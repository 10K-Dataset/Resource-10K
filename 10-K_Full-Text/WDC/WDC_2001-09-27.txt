PART I

Item 1.

Business

General

Western Digital Corporation (the
“Company” or “Western Digital”) operates as
the parent company of Western Digital Technologies, Inc.
(“WDT”) and other subsidiaries. WDT designs, develops,
manufactures and markets hard drives, the Company’s core
business, featuring leading-edge technology. A hard drive is a
storage device found in most computers that stores data on one
or more rotating magnetic disks that provide fast access to data
that must be readily available to users of computers or other
devices. The Company’s hard drives are used in desktop
PC’s, entry level servers, network attached storage
devices, video game consoles, digital video recording devices,
digital cable set-top boxes, satellite television boxes and
audio/visual juke boxes. The Company’s hard drive products
currently include 1.0-inch high, 3.5-inch form factor drives
with capacities ranging from 8 gigabytes (“GB”) to
100 GB, rotation speeds of 5400 and 7200 revolutions per
minute (“rpm”) and the Enhanced Integrated Drive
Electronics (“EIDE”) interface. The Company sells its
products worldwide to computer manufacturers for inclusion in
their computer systems or subsystems and to distributors,
resellers and retailers. The Company’s hard drive products
are currently manufactured in Malaysia. In January 2000, the
Company announced its decision to cease production of Small
Computer System Interface (“SCSI”) hard drives and
closed its Rochester, Minnesota hard drive design center.

The Company continuously evaluates opportunities
to apply its data storage core competencies to emerging markets
and to expand beyond the traditional market for hard drives
through new business ventures and market areas which meet
certain predefined criteria. In February 1999, the Company
acquired Connex, Inc. (“Connex”), a San Jose-based
startup company that designed network attached storage products.
During 2001 the Company formed SANavigator, Inc.
(“SANavigator”) to develop and market storage area
network (“SAN”) management. Subsequent to
June 29, 2001, the Company sold substantially all of the
assets of Connex and SANavigator and, accordingly, discontinued
these operations.

In February 2000, the Company formed SageTree,
Inc. (“SageTree”) to design and market packaged
analytical software and related services for supply chain and
product life cycle applications. In June 2000, SageTree received
a direct investment from NCR Corporation in exchange for a
minority interest in SageTree. For further discussion of
SageTree, see under the heading “Products —
Products Developed by SageTree” and Part II,
Item 7, under the heading “Risk factors relating to
Western Digital particularly.”

In February 2000, the Company also formed Cameo
Technologies, Inc. (“Cameo”) to develop and market
technologies and services for delivering high-quality digital
video content to PC users. Cameo entered into an agreement with
Universal Pictures in June 2001 to deliver Universal’s
promotional materials to connected PC users. For further
discussion of Cameo, see under the heading
“Products — Products Developed by Cameo
Technologies” and Part II, Item 7, under the
heading “Risk factors relating to Western Digital
particularly.”

In October 2000, the Company formed Keen Personal
Media, Inc. (“Keen PM”) to develop and market
interactive personal video recorder and set-top box software,
services and hardware for broadband television content
management and commerce. Keen PM entered into a joint
development agreement during October 2000 to develop and license
its digital video recorder storage management subsystem software
to Scientific-Atlanta. For further discussion of Keen PM, see
under the heading “Products — Products Developed
by Keen PM” and Part II, Item 7, under the
heading “Risk factors relating to Western Digital
particularly.”

The Company monitors the development of new
markets related to data or content storage and storage
management, and communication of digital content and network
intelligence, and may from time to time offer new products or
services to address appropriate new markets. Conversely,
depending on the development of such markets and the
Company’s ability to achieve its goals, the Company may,
from time to time withdraw from certain markets.



Industry

Desktop PC Market.

According to International Data
Corporation (“IDC”), the desktop computer segment is
the largest segment of the worldwide personal computer market,
accounting for approximately 79% of global personal computer
shipments in calendar 2000. As a result, desktop computers were
the leading source of demand for hard drives, accounting for
more than 74% of all hard drive units shipped worldwide in
calendar 2000, according to IDC. Over 90% of Western
Digital’s hard drive unit shipments in 2001 were sold to
this market. Desktop personal computers for entry level to
experienced users are used in both commercial and consumer
environments. The demand for hard drive capacity continues to
grow in part due to:

Future demand growth for desktop computer hard
drives also may be driven by new and emerging hard drive
markets. In September 2001, IDC forecasted that the worldwide
desktop PC hard drive market would grow from approximately
139 million units in calendar 2001 to 193 million
units in calendar 2005, reflecting a compound annual growth rate
of approximately 8.5%. Revenue growth is expected to be lower
due to the impact of severe price competition. However, in
August 2001, IDC forecasted that the non-desktop PC hard drive
market would grow from approximately 1.1 million units in
calendar 2000 to 37.2 million units in calendar 2004,
reflecting a compound annual growth rate of approximately 120%.
See Part II, Item 7, under the heading “Risk
factors related to the hard drive industry in which we
operate.”

Desktop PCs are used in a number of environments,
ranging from homes to businesses and multi-user networks.
Software applications are used on desktop PCs primarily for word
processing, spreadsheet, desktop publishing, database
management, multimedia, entertainment and other related
applications. Desktop PCs typically utilize the EIDE interface
for hard drives. The Company believes the minimum storage
requirement in the past year for entry-level PCs was generally
10 GB to 20 GB of formatted capacity.

The industry continues to supply increased
capacity per unit as users’ system needs increase and
technological and manufacturing advances continue to make higher
capacity drives more affordable. In the mainstream desktop PC
market, the Company believes that the rate of increase in
storage capacity per unit has recently outpaced the rate of
increase in demand for such capacity. This will result in the
Company changing its product mix, with an increasing percentage
of lower capacity hard drives manufactured with fewer heads and
disks per unit. The Company believes that even though unit
demand will increase, this changing product mix will reduce the
average selling price per hard drive unit in the desktop PC
market. In contrast, the emerging use of hard drives to record
and play back audio and video content in the audio-visual market
is expected to create demand for storage capacity that will
exceed the growth in demand for increased capacity in the
desktop PC market. Overall, industry sources believe that the
current rate of increase in storage capacity per unit shipped
will continue for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the
Company believes that time-to-market, time-to-volume and
time-to-quality leadership with higher capacity drives at
attractive price levels will continue to be critical to its
future success in serving this market.

Users of desktop PCs, especially entry-level
desktop PCs, have become increasingly price sensitive. In 1999
the market for desktop PC’s priced below $1,000 grew
significantly, and in 2000 the market for desktop PC’s
priced below $800 was the fastest growing segment of the market.
Data for 2001 indicates that during the latter part of 2001, the
growth in sales of entry-level PCs had abated. These systems
typically do not contain high performance hard drives, but the
growth of these segments in 1999 and 2000 has placed downward
price pressure on higher cost systems as well, thereby
contributing to the increasing price pressures on desktop hard



drives. See Part II, Item 7, under the
heading “Risk factors related to the hard drive industry in
which we operate.”

Emerging Audio-visual Markets.

Audio-visual content stored for
entertainment has historically been stored on removable media,
such as compact disks (“CDs”), digital video disks
(“DVDs”), and videotape. These media have also been
used to transport and deliver content. The emergence of
broadband communications as a means of delivering digital
content makes it unnecessary to use the removable media itself
for delivery. This allows hard drives to become the storage
media for this digital, audio-visual content as it is delivered
through broadband communications. This has led to the use of
hard drives in products for consumer broadband communications
networks, such as cable and satellite networks. Audio-visual
applications such as digital video recording devices represent a
developing market opportunity for the Company’s hard drive
technologies. Hard drive technology makes it possible to
simultaneously record and play back content; to pause and skip
forward and backward during live broadcasts; and to rapidly
access large amounts of audio-visual content.

Because the market for audio-visual products has
not yet developed, it is too early to project the likely size
and growth of such market. For further discussion of this
product development effort, see Part II, Item 7, under
the heading “Risk factors relating to Western Digital
particularly.”

Products

The Company’s WD Caviar® and WD
Protege

TM

hard drive products are designed to serve
the advanced and value portions, respectively, of the desktop PC
market, entry level server markets and game console markets, and
its WD Performer

TM

hard drive products are designed
to serve the emerging audio-visual portion of the hard drive
market.

Desktop PC and Entry-Level Server Hard Drive
Products.

The WD Caviar and WD Protege
families currently consists of 1.0” high, 3.5-inch
form factor products with capacities ranging from 8 GB to
100 GB and rotation speeds of 5400 and 7200 rpm. In
1998 the Company introduced the Data Lifeguard

TM

feature, an exclusive data reliability feature which is now
implemented in all of the Company’s hard drives. Data
Lifeguard protects end-user data by automatically detecting,
isolating, and repairing possible problem areas on the hard
drive before data loss can occur. These products utilize the
EIDE interface, providing high performance while retaining ease
of use and overall low cost of connection. The type of EIDE
interface currently used in substantially all of the
Company’s hard drives is ATA/100, which signifies an
internal data transfer rate of 100 megabytes per second,
almost twice as fast as the previous generation of EIDE
interface. The Company also sells a line of hard drives and
related adapters which are designed to accommodate an interface
known as “1394/ Firewire/ i.Link”, for use primarily
in connecting digital consumer electronic devices, such as
digital video camcorders.

The Western Digital product line generally
leverages a common architecture or “platform” for
various products with different capacities to serve the
differing market needs. This platform strategy results in
commonality of components across different products, which
reduces exposure to changes in demand, facilitates inventory
management and allows the Company to achieve lower costs through
economies of scale purchasing. This platform strategy also
enables computer manufacturer customers to leverage their
qualification efforts onto successive product models. The
Company expects to continue to utilize this platform strategy as
it develops products for the emerging market for hard drives
specifically designed for audio-visual applications, such as new
digital video recording devices.

Audio-visual Hard Drive
Products.

The Company offers
customized design capabilities and unique hard drive
technologies for consumer applications; however, where
practical, the Company intends to leverage its existing product
line architectures for the various products for the audio-visual
market. The Company is currently offering the WD
Performer

TM

Technology and Product Development

Hard drives are used to record, store and
retrieve digital data. Their performance attributes are
currently better than removable or floppy disks, optical disk
drives and tape, and they are more cost effective than
semiconductor technology. The primary measures of hard drive
performance include:

All of the Company’s hard drive products
employ similar technology. The main components of the hard drive
are the head disk assembly and the printed circuit board. The
head disk assembly includes the head, media (disks), head
positioning mechanism (actuator) and spin motor. These
components are contained in a hard base plate protective package
in a contamination-free environment. The printed circuit board
includes custom integrated circuits, an interface connector to
the host computer and a power connector.

The head disk assembly is comprised of one or
more disks positioned around a spindle hub that rotates the
disks by a spin motor. Disks are made of a smooth substrate to
which a thin coating of magnetic materials is applied. Each disk
has a head suspended directly above it, which can read data from
or write data to the spinning disk. The sensor element of the
head, also known as the slider, is getting progressively
smaller, resulting in reduced material costs.

The integrated circuits on the printed circuit
board typically include a drive interface and a controller. The
drive interface receives instructions from the computer, while
the controller directs the flow of data to or from the disks and
controls the heads. The location of data on each disk is
logically maintained in concentric



tracks which are divided into sectors. The
computer sends instructions to the controller to read data from
or write data to the disks based on track and sector locations.
Guided by instructions from the controller, the head stack
assembly is pivoted and swung across the disk by a head actuator
or motor until it reaches the selected track of a disk, where
the data is recorded or retrieved.

Industry standard interfaces are utilized to
allow the disk drive to communicate with the computer.
Currently, the primary interface for desktop PCs is EIDE.
Increasingly, work station computers are using the EIDE
interface as well. As computer performance continues to improve,
the hard drive will need to deliver information faster than this
interface can handle. Accordingly the desktop PC industry plans
to transition to higher speed interfaces to handle the higher
data transfer rates. The Company is working to develop products
that will support these higher speed interfaces.

Storage capacity of the hard drive is determined
by the number of disks and each disk’s areal density, which
is a measure of the amount of data that can be stored on the
recording surface of the disk. Areal density is generally
measured in megabits per square inch of disk surface. The higher
the areal density, the more information can be stored on a
single platter. As the areal density increases, fewer disks
and/or heads are required to achieve a given drive capacity,
thus reducing product costs through reduced component
requirements.

Head technology is one of the variables affecting
areal density. The desktop hard drive industry has completed a
transition to magnetoresistive head technology, which allows
significantly higher storage capacities than the previously
utilized thin-film head technology. Magnetoresistive heads have
discrete read and write structures which provide more signal
than the older thin-film inductive heads. This allows
significantly higher areal densities, which increases storage
capacity per disk and improves manufacturing margin and product
reliability. The Company completed the transition to
magnetoresistive head technology in 1999, and in 2000, completed
the transition to the next generation of head technology, known
as giant magnetoresistive, and currently all of the
Company’s hard drive product offerings employ giant
magnetoresistive head technology.

Constant innovations in research and development
are essential to the Company’s ability to compete. Hard
drive providers are evaluating or implementing a number of
technological innovations designed to further increase hard
drive performance and reduce product costs, including
simplifying the electronic architecture by combining the
traditional controller, channel, microprocessor and
servo-interface management functions of traditional hard drive
microprocessors on a single integrated circuit. Moreover, to
consistently achieve timely introduction and rapid volume
production of new products, some hard drive providers are
striving to simplify their product design processes by focusing
on creating extendible core technology platforms which utilize
common firmware and mechanical designs and re-use of
manufacturing tooling and application specific integrated
circuits across various product generations and product lines.

Sales and Distribution

The Company sells its products globally to
computer manufacturers, distributors, value-added resellers,
dealers, system integrators, retailers and internet-based
retailers. Manufacturers typically purchase components such as
hard drives and assemble them into the computer systems they
build. Distributors typically sell the Company’s drives to
small manufacturers, dealers, system integrators and other
resellers.

Manufacturers.

Sales
to manufacturers accounted for 70%, 65% and 59% of consolidated
revenues in 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively. The
Company’s major computer manufacturer customers include
Apple Computer, Compaq Computer, Dell Computer, Fujitsu,
Gateway, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Intel, Micron Electronics and
NEC. During both 1999 and 2000 sales to Compaq accounted for 21%
of revenues. During 2001 sales to Compaq and to Dell accounted
for 12% and 17% of revenues, respectively. The Company believes
that its success depends on its ability to maintain and improve
its strong relationships with the leading



computer manufacturers. Western Digital, Quantum,
Maxtor and Seagate have historically had the highest market
share with these manufacturers. During 2001, Maxtor acquired the
hard drive business of Quantum. However, the remaining number of
qualified suppliers to the leading manufacturers, combined with
the continued growth of the sub-$1,000 PC market and a recent
economic slowdown, has placed continuous downward pressure on
hard drive prices. This pressure, in turn, has reduced average
gross margins for hard drive suppliers.

The leading PC computer manufacturers have been
gaining market share, which has increased their purchasing
leverage over component suppliers. In calendar year 2000, the
top ten desktop personal computer manufacturers accounted for
more than 58% of all shipments and a significant amount of the
growth in the desktop PC market. As a result, maintaining
customer satisfaction with these leading computer manufacturers
has become even more critical.

Computer manufacturers typically seek to qualify
up to three or four providers for each generation of hard
drives. Once a computer manufacturer has chosen its qualified
hard drive vendors for a given product, it generally will
purchase hard drives from those vendors for the life of that
product. To achieve consistent success with computer
manufacturers’ qualifications, a hard drive supplier must
be an early provider of next generation hard drives featuring
leading technology and high capacity per disk. Suppliers must
quickly achieve volume production of high quality and reliable
hard drives. To quickly achieve high volume production, a hard
drive supplier must have access to flexible, high-capacity,
high-quality manufacturing capabilities. Factors on which
computer manufacturers evaluate their hard drive suppliers
include overall quality, storage capacities, performance
characteristics, price, ease of doing business, and the
supplier’s long-term financial stability.

The business models of computer manufacturers
have been changing, and these changes have impacted, and will
continue to impact, Western Digital’s sales, inventory and
distribution patterns. Most of the computer industry has used a
forecast-driven, long-production-run logistics model. This model
limits the computer manufacturers’ flexibility to react to
rapid technology changes and component pricing fluctuations.
Some of the Company’s customers have implemented a supply
chain logistics model that combines “build-to-order”
(computer manufacturer does not build until there is an order
backlog) and “contract manufacturing” (computer
manufacturer contracts assembly work to a contract manufacturer
who purchases components and assembles the computer based on the
computer manufacturer’s instructions.) The Company has
adapted its logistics model to effectively align with these
industry shifts. These changes require greater skill in managing
finished goods inventory and more flexibility in manufacturing,
both of which in turn require even closer relationships between
the Company and its computer manufacturer and contract
manufacturer customers. To help meet these challenges, the
Company is expanding its use of Internet technology and
web-based supply chain planning tools.

For an additional discussion of the changes in
customer models, refer to Part II, Item 7, under the
headings “Risk factors related to the hard drive industry
in which we operate,” and “Risk factors related to
Western Digital particularly.”

The Company maintains a base stock of two to
three weeks of current, finished goods inventory for certain key
computer manufacturer customers in facilities located adjacent
to their operations. Inventory at these locations usually
includes minor product customizations (such as labeling) for the
related computer manufacturer. If subsequent to its initial
order the computer manufacturer changes its requirements,
inventory held at these facilities can be sold to other computer
manufacturers or distributors as is or with minor modifications
(such as a change in labeling) at little or no additional cost.
Therefore, these arrangements, even if not fulfilled, have
minimal impact on inventory valuation.

Distributors.

The
Company uses a select group of distributors to sell its products
to small computer manufacturers, value-added resellers,
resellers and systems integrators. The Company’s major
distributor customers include ASI, Decision Support Systems,
ELD, Ingram Micro, Merisel, Servex, Synnex and Tech Data.
Distributors and retailers combined accounted for approximately
30%, 35% and 41% of disk drive revenue for 1999, 2000 and 2001,
respectively. Distributors generally enter into non-exclusive
agreements with



the Company for purchase and redistribution of
product on a quick turnover basis. Purchase orders are placed
and revised on a weekly basis. The Company grants certain of its
distributors price protection and limited rights to return
product on a rotation basis.

Retailers.

The
Company sells its retail-packaged products directly to a select
group of major retailers such as computer superstores, warehouse
clubs and computer electronics stores and authorizes sales
through distributors to smaller retailers. Major retailers to
whom the Company sells directly include Best Buy, Circuit City,
CompUSA, Office Depot, Vobis and Fry’s Electronics.
Retailers accounted for approximately 6%, 5% and 6% of revenue
for 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively. The Company’s
current retail customer base is primarily in the United States,
Canada and Europe. The retail channel complements the
Company’s other sales channels while helping to build brand
awareness for the Company and its products. Retailers supply the
aftermarket “upgrade” sector in which end-users
purchase and install products to upgrade their computers. The
Company grants certain of its retailers price protection and
limited rights to return product on a rotation basis. The
Company also sells its retail-packaged products through the
Internet, at its website, http://www.westerndigital.com.

The Company maintains sales offices throughout
North America, Eastern and Western Europe, the Middle East,
Japan and Southeast Asia. Field application engineering is
provided to strategic computer manufacturer accounts, and
end-user technical support services are provided within the
United States and Europe. The Company’s end-user technical
support is supplied by both employees and qualified third-party
support organizations through telephone support during business
hours and via the Company’s website.

The Company’s international sales, which
include sales to foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies,
represented 45%, 53% and 41% of revenues for fiscal years 1999,
2000 and 2001, respectively. Sales to international customers
may be subject to certain risks not normally encountered in
domestic operations, including exposure to tariffs, various
trade regulations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates.
See Part II, Item 7, under the heading “Risk factors
relating to Western Digital particularly.”

For information concerning revenue recognition,
sales by geographic region and significant customer information,
see Notes 1 and 9, respectively, of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

The Company’s marketing and advertising
functions are performed both internally and through outside
firms. Advertising, direct marketing, worldwide packaging and
marketing materials are targeted to various end-user segments.
Western Digital utilizes both consumer media and trade
publications. The Company has programs under which qualifying
manufacturers and resellers are reimbursed for certain
advertising expenditures. Western Digital also invests in direct
marketing and customer satisfaction programs. The Company
maintains ongoing contact with end users through primary and
secondary market research, focus groups, product registrations
and technical support databases.

Competition

In the desktop hard drive market, the Company has
competed primarily with Fujitsu, IBM, Maxtor, Quantum, Samsung
and Seagate. During the last year, Maxtor acquired the hard
drive business of Quantum and, recently, Fujitsu announced that
it would exit the desktop hard drive market, decreasing the
number of major competitors.

The hard drive industry is intensely competitive,
with hard drive suppliers competing for a limited number of
major customers. Hard drives manufactured by different
competitors are highly substitutable due to the industry mandate
of technical form, fit and function standards. Hard drive
manufacturers compete on the basis of product quality and
reliability, storage capacity, unit price, product performance,
production volume capabilities, delivery capability, leadership
in time-to-market, time-to-volume and time-to-quality and ease
of doing business. The relative importance of these factors
varies among different customer and market segments. The Company
believes that it is generally competitive in all of these
factors.

The Company believes that it cannot differentiate
its hard drive products solely on attributes such as storage
capacity; therefore, the Company also differentiates itself by
designing and incorporating into its hard drives desirable
product performance attributes and by emphasizing rapid response
with its computer



manufacturer and distribution customers and brand
equity with its end users. These product performance attributes
include seek time, data transfer rates, intelligent caching,
failure prediction, remote diagnostics, acoustics and data
recovery. Rapid response requires accelerated design cycles,
customer delivery and production flexibility, which contribute
to customer satisfaction. Data storage has become strategically
critical for computer end users. Consequently, the Company
believes that trust in a manufacturer’s reputation has
become an important factor in the selection of a hard drive,
particularly within such a rapidly changing technology
environment. The Company believes it has strong brand equity
with its end users.

The Company completed its transition to
magnetoresistive technology in 1999 and completed its transition
to giant magnetoresistive technology in 2000. During the first
quarter of 2000, the Company lost market share as a result of a
product recall; however, the Company recovered some of its
market share as it regained a leadership position in quality and
time-to-market during the remainder of 2000 and continued to
regain market share during 2001.

The desktop hard drive market is characterized by
many competitors and short product life cycles; therefore, it
has traditionally been subject to periods of sustained and
severe price competition, and factors such as time-to-market can
have a pronounced effect on the success of any particular
product.

Advances in magnetic, optical or other data
storage technologies could result in competitive products that
have better performance or lower cost per unit of capacity than
the Company’s hard drive products. High-speed semiconductor
memory could compete with the Company’s hard drive products
in the future. Semiconductor memory is much faster than magnetic
disk drives, but currently is volatile (i.e., subject to loss of
data in the event of power failure) and much more costly. Flash
memory, a nonvolatile semiconductor memory, is currently much
more costly and, while it has higher “read”
performance than hard drives, it has lower “write”
performance. Flash memory could become competitive in the near
future for applications requiring less storage capacity than
that provided by hard drives.

For an additional discussion of competition, see
Part II, Item 7, under the heading “Risk factors
related to the hard drive industry in which we operate.”

Service and Warranty

Western Digital generally warrants its newly
manufactured hard drives against defects in materials and
workmanship for a period of one to three years from the date of
sale. The Company’s warranty obligation is generally
limited to repair or replacement of the hard drive. The Company
has contracted with a third party in the United States to
process and test returned hard drives for the Company’s end
users. The Company refurbishes or repairs its products at
third-party service facilities located in Singapore and Germany.

Manufacturing

To be competitive, Western Digital must
manufacture high quality hard drives with industry leading
time-to-volume production at competitive unit costs. The Company
strives to maintain manufacturing flexibility, high
manufacturing yields and high-quality components at competitive
prices. The critical elements of Western Digital’s hard
drive production are high volume, low cost assembly and testing,
and establishment and maintenance of key vendor relationships in
order to create “virtual vertical integration.” By
establishing partner relationships with its strategic component
suppliers, the Company believes it is able to access
“best-of-class” manufacturing quality without the
substantial capital investment associated with actual vertical
integration. In addition, the Company believes that its virtual
vertical integration model enables it to have the business
flexibility needed to select the highest quality low cost
suppliers as product designs and technologies evolve.

Hard drive manufacturing is a complex process
involving the assembly of precision components with narrow
tolerances and extensive testing to ensure reliability. The
assembly process occurs in a “clean room”



environment which demands skill in process
engineering and efficient utilization of the “clean
room” layout in order to reduce the high operating costs of
this manufacturing environment. The Company’s clean room
manufacturing process consists of modular production units, each
of which contains a number of work cells. With increased areal
density requirements of new products introduced, the ability to
achieve historically high yields has decreased.

The Company produces hard drives in one plant in
Malaysia. As a continuation of its virtual vertical integration
model, the Company sold its media manufacturing division in 1999
to Komag, Inc. (“Komag”). With the sale of this
division, the Company now purchases all of the standard
mechanical components and micro controllers for its hard drives
from external suppliers.

The Company continually evaluates its
manufacturing processes in an effort to increase productivity
and decrease manufacturing costs. In order to address inventory
oversupply, the Company reduced excess manufacturing capacity by
closing two manufacturing facilities in Singapore during 1999
and 2000 and relocating its hard drive production to Malaysia.
The Company continually evaluates which steps in the
manufacturing process would benefit from automation and how
automated manufacturing processes support the Company’s
business plans.

For an additional discussion of manufacturing,
see Part II, Item 7, under the heading “Risk factors
relating to Western Digital particularly.”

Research and Development

The Company devotes substantial resources to
development of new products and improvement of existing
products. The Company focuses its engineering efforts on
coordinating its product design and manufacturing processes in
order to bring its products to market in a cost-effective and
timely manner. Research and development expenses for continuing
operations totaled $198.4, $150.7 and $122.5 million in
1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively. The decreases from 1999 to
2000 and from 2000 to 2001 were due to the Company’s exit
from SCSI hard drive production during 2000 and expense
reduction efforts in its remaining hard drive operations,
partially offset by increased spending in the Company’s
developing new business ventures.

For a discussion of product development, see Part
II, Item 7, under the heading “Risk factors related to
the hard drive industry in which we operate.”

Materials and Supplies

The principal components currently used in the
manufacture of the Company’s hard drives are magnetic heads
and related head stack assemblies, media, controllers, spindle
motors and mechanical parts used in the head-disk assembly. In
addition to its own proprietary semiconductor devices, the
Company also uses standard semiconductor components such as
logic, memory and microprocessor devices obtained from other
manufacturers and a wide variety of other parts, including
connectors, cables, and other interconnect technology.

Unlike some of its competitors, the Company
acquires all of the components for its products from third-party
suppliers. In general, the Company tries to have at least three
suppliers for each of its component requirements. For example,
the Company currently buys giant magnetoresistive heads from
IBM, Read-Rite and SAE. Media requirements are purchased from
several outside vendors including Komag, Fuji, Trace and Showa.
In connection with the sale of its media manufacturing division
to Komag in April 1999, the Company entered into a volume
purchase agreement with Komag. Under this Agreement, which
expires in April 2002, the Company is obligated to purchase a
substantial percentage of its requirements for hard disk media
from Komag as long as Komag’s prices, technology and
quality remain competitive. Subsequent to June 29, 2001,
Komag announced the voluntary filing for Chapter 11
reorganization. Komag further announced that it expects to
continue its operations during the Chapter 11 process.
Komag Malaysia, a separate subsidiary which did not file
Chapter 11, is the manufacturing entity which supplies the
Company’s media. The Company is in discussions with Komag
concerning an extension of the Agreement beyond its April 2002
expiration date.



Some custom integrated circuits are currently
sole-sourced from STMicroelectronics. Because of their custom
nature, these products require significant design-in periods and
long lead times. There has been a trend in integrated circuit
design toward increased integration of various separate
circuits. The Company expects this trend to continue in the area
of custom integrated circuits for hard drives.

For an additional discussion of component
supplies, see Part II, Item 7, under the heading
“Risk factors relating to Western Digital
particularly.”

Backlog

At August 24, 2001, the Company’s
backlog, consisting of orders scheduled for delivery within the
next twelve months, was approximately $287 million,
compared with a backlog at September 18, 2000 of
approximately $294 million. The Company expects this entire
backlog to be delivered within the current fiscal year.
Historically, a substantial portion of the Company’s orders
has been for shipments within 30 to 60 days of the
placement of the order. The Company generally negotiates
pricing, order lead times, product support requirements and
other terms and conditions prior to receiving a computer
manufacturer’s first purchase order for a product.
Manufacturers’ purchase orders typically may be canceled
with relatively short notice to the Company, with little or no
cost to the customer, or modified by customers to provide for
delivery at a later date. Also, certain of the Company’s
sales to computer manufacturers are made under
“just-in-time” delivery contracts that do not
generally require firm order commitments by the customer until
the time of sale. Therefore, backlog information as of the end
of a particular period is not necessarily indicative of future
levels of the Company’s revenue and profit and may not be
comparable to earlier periods.

Patents, Licenses and Proprietary
Information

The Company owns numerous patents and has many
patent applications in process. The Company believes that,
although its patents and patent applications have significant
value, the successful manufacturing and marketing of its
products depends primarily upon the technical competence and
creative ability of its personnel. Accordingly, the patents held
and applied for do not assure the Company’s future success.

In addition to patent protection of certain
intellectual property rights, the Company considers elements of
its product designs and processes to be proprietary and
confidential. The Company believes that its nonpatented
intellectual property, particularly some of its process
technology, is an important factor in its success. Western
Digital relies upon employee, consultant, and vendor
non-disclosure agreements and a system of internal safeguards to
protect its proprietary information. Despite these safeguards,
there is a risk that competitors may obtain and use such
information. The laws of foreign jurisdictions in which the
Company does business also may provide less protection for
confidential information than the United States.

The Company relies on certain technology that is
licensed from other parties in order to manufacture and sell its
products. The Company has cross-licensing agreements with
several competitors, customers and suppliers, and the Company
believes that it has adequate licenses and other agreements in
place in addition to its own intellectual property portfolio to
compete successfully in the hard drive industry.

For additional discussion of intellectual
property, see Part II, Item 7, under the heading
“Risk factors relating to Western Digital
particularly.”

Environmental Regulation

The Company is subject to a variety of
regulations in connection with its operations. It believes that
it has obtained or is in the process of obtaining all necessary
permits for its domestic operations.

Employees

As of June 29, 2001, the Company employed a
total of 7,909 full-time employees worldwide. This represents an
increase in headcount of approximately 8% since June 30,
2000 and a reduction of approximately 25% since July 3,
1999, as the Company responded to the industry downturn and its
decrease in sales by restructuring its hard drive business
during 1999 and 2000. The Company employed 1,174 employees in the



United States, 6,630 employees in Malaysia, 27
employees in Singapore, and 78 employees at its international
sales offices as of June 29, 2001.

Many of the Company’s employees are highly
skilled, and the Company’s continued success depends in
part upon its ability to attract and retain such employees.
Accordingly, the Company offers employee benefit programs which
it believes are at least equivalent to those offered by its
competitors. Despite these programs, the Company has, along with
most of its competitors, experienced difficulty at times in
hiring and retaining certain skilled personnel. In critical
areas, the Company has utilized consultants and contract
personnel to fill these needs until full-time employees could be
recruited. The Company has never experienced a work stoppage,
none of its domestic employees are represented by a labor
organization, and the Company considers its employee relations
to be good.

Item 2.

Properties

During December 2000, the Company relocated its
corporate headquarters from Irvine, California to Lake Forest,
California, signing a 10-year lease agreement for the Lake
Forest facility. The lease for the Irvine facility expired in
January 2001. The Company’s corporate headquarters houses
management, research and development, administrative and sales
personnel. The Company leases one facility in San Jose,
California and one facility in Irvine, California, for
research and development and new venture activities. The
San Jose lease expires in July 2006 and the Irvine research
and development facility lease expires in September 2010.
Western Digital owns a manufacturing facility in Kuala Lumpur,
Malaysia. The Company also leases office space in various other
locations throughout the world primarily for sales and technical
support.

The Company’s present facilities are
adequate for its current needs, although the process of
upgrading its facilities to meet technological and market
requirements is expected to continue. The hard drive industry
does not generally require long lead time to develop and begin
operations in new manufacturing facilities.

During 2000 the Company sold approximately 34
acres of land in Irvine, California, upon which it had
previously planned to build a new corporate headquarters, for
$26 million (the approximate cost of the land). The Company
also sold its enterprise drive manufacturing facility in Tuas,
Singapore for $11.0 million (for a gain of
$3.1 million) and its Rochester, Minnesota enterprise
research and development facility for $29.7 million (for a
loss of $1.9 million).

Item 3.

Legal
Proceedings

The following discussion contains forward-looking
statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.
These statements relate to the Company’s legal proceedings
described below. Litigation is inherently uncertain and may
result in adverse rulings or decisions. Additionally, the
Company may enter into settlements or be subject to judgments
that may, individually or in the aggregate, have a material
adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial
position, results of operations or liquidity. In addition, the
costs of defending such litigation, individually or in the
aggregate, may be material, regardless of the outcome.
Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from those
projected in the forward-looking statements.

In 1992 Amstrad plc (“Amstrad”) brought
suit against the Company in California State Superior Court,
County of Orange, alleging that disk drives supplied to Amstrad
by the Company in 1988 and 1989 were defective and caused
damages to Amstrad of not less than $186 million. The suit
also sought punitive damages. The Company denied the material
allegations of the complaint and filed cross-claims against
Amstrad. The case was tried, and in June 1999 the jury returned
a verdict in favor of Western Digital. Amstrad has appealed the
judgment. The Company does not believe that the outcome of this
matter will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated
financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

In 1994 Papst Licensing (“Papst”)
brought suit against the Company in federal court in California
alleging infringement by the Company of five of its patents
relating to disk drive motors that the Company purchased from
motor vendors. Later that year Papst dismissed its case without
prejudice, but it has notified the Company that it intends to
reinstate the suit if the Company does not enter into a license
agreement with Papst. Papst has also put the Company on notice
with respect to several additional patents. The Company does



not believe that the outcome of this matter will
have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial
position, results of operations or liquidity.

In June 2000 Discovision Associates
(“Discovision”) notified the Company in writing that
it believes certain of the Company’s hard disk drive
products may infringe certain of Discovision’s patents.
Discovision has offered to provide the Company with a license
under its patent portfolio. The Company is in discussion with
Discovision regarding its claims. There is no litigation
pending. The Company does not believe that the outcome of this
matter will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
consolidated financial position, results of operations or
liquidity.

On June 9, 2000, a suit was brought against
the Company in California Superior Court for the County of
Orange on behalf of a class of former employees of the Company
who were terminated as a result of a reduction in force in
December 1999. The complaint asserted claims for unpaid wages,
fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract, and unfair
business practices. The Company removed the suit to United
States District Court, Central District of California, on the
ground that all of the claims were preempted by the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. On January 26,
2001, the Company filed a motion to dismiss plaintiffs’
complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b). The Court
granted the Company’s motion with leave to amend on
April 2, 2001. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on
April 6, 2001, and the Company filed a motion to dismiss
the amended complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure
12(b) on June 4, 2001. The Court granted the Company’s
motion and dismissed plaintiffs’ amended complaint with
prejudice on August 6, 2001. On September 5, 2001, the
Court entered a stipulated order according to which plaintiffs
agreed to waive their right to appeal the Court’s order
dismissing their claims in exchange for the Company’s
agreeing to waive its right to costs and fees as the prevailing
party under ERISA.

On May 22, 2001, Cambrian Consultants, Inc.
(“Cambrian”) filed a complaint against the Company in
the United States District Court, Central District of
California. The suit alleges infringement by the Company of a
Cambrian patent. On July 20, 2001, the Company filed an answer
denying the allegations contained in Cambrian’s complaint
and a counterclaim asserting that Cambrian’s patent was
invalid. The Court ordered that a Markman hearing to construe
the claims of Cambrian’s patent be held on April 15,
2002 and set a briefing schedule leading up to the hearing. Both
parties are engaged in discovery and expect that such discovery
will continue for at least the next several months. Based on its
initial investigation and the limited discovery done to date,
the Company does not believe that the outcome of this matter
will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated
financial position, results of operation or liquidity.

On July 5, 2001, the Company (and its
Malaysian subsidiary) filed suit against Cirrus Logic, Inc.
(“Cirrus”) in California Superior Court for the County
of Orange for breach of contract and other claims resulting from
Cirrus’ role as a strategic supplier of read channel chips
for the Company’s hard drives. The Company also stopped
making payments to Cirrus for past deliveries of chips and
terminated all outstanding purchase orders from Cirrus for such
chips. The Company’s complaint alleges that Cirrus’
unlawful conduct caused damages in excess of any amounts that
may be owing on outstanding invoices or arising out of any
alleged breach of the outstanding purchase orders. On
August 20, 2001, Cirrus filed an answer and
cross-complaint. Cirrus denied the allegations contained in the
Company’s complaint and asserted counterclaims against the
Company for, among other things, the amount of the outstanding
invoices and the Company’s alleged breach of the
outstanding purchase orders. The parties have begun discovery
and expect that such discovery will continue for the next
several months. Based on its initial investigation and the
limited



discovery done to date, the Company does not
believe that the outcome of this matter will have a material
adverse effect on its consolidated financial position, results
of operation or liquidity.

In the normal course of business, the Company
receives and makes inquiries regarding possible intellectual
property matters, including alleged patent infringement. Where
deemed advisable, the Company may seek or extend licenses or
negotiate settlements. Although patent holders often offer such
licenses, no assurance can be given that in a particular case a
license will be offered or that the offered terms will be
acceptable to the Company. The Company does not believe that the
ultimate resolution of these matters will have a material
adverse effect on its consolidated financial position, results
of operations or liquidity.

From time to time the Company receives claims and
is a party to suits and other judicial and administrative
proceedings incidental to its business. Although occasional
adverse decisions (or settlements) may occur, the Company does
not believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will
have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial
position, results of operations or liquidity.

Overview

Western Digital is a longtime leader and one of
the pioneers of the data storage industry. Through significant
reorganization of its hard drive business the Company has
established a framework to apply its data storage core
competencies to emerging markets and expand beyond the
traditional market for hard drives through new business ventures
and market areas, while maintaining its core business.

The hard drive industry, the Company’s core
and primary business, is intensely competitive and has
experienced a great deal of growth, entry and exit of
competitors, and technological change over recent years. This
industry is characterized by short product life cycles,
dependence upon highly skilled engineering and other personnel,
significant expenditures for product development and recurring
periods of oversupply. During 1999 and 2000 the Company
initiated restructuring programs to reduce costs and improve
operating efficiency of its hard drive business. During 1999,
the Company combined its Personal Storage Division and
Enterprise Storage Group into a single hard drive operating
unit, closed its Tuas, Singapore facility and moved production
of its SCSI drives to the Company’s nearby manufacturing
facility in Chai-Chee, Singapore. The combination resulted in a
$41.0 million charge to operations. Also during 1999, the
Company sold its Santa Clara disk media operations to Komag,
Inc. (“Komag”), recording a charge to operations of
$20.0 million. During 2000,



the Company transferred all of its hard drive
production to one highly efficient manufacturing facility in
Malaysia, closed its Singapore manufacturing facilities,
discontinued its SCSI drive product line, closed its Rochester,
Minnesota design facility, and made significant changes to its
worldwide management structure and sales organization. These
actions resulted in net restructuring and other charges to
operations of $125.5 million.

The Company continuously evaluates opportunities
to apply its data storage core competencies to emerging markets
and to expand beyond traditional markets for hard drives through
new business ventures meeting certain predefined criteria. The
Company’s new business ventures have included Connex, Inc.
(“Connex”), SANavigator, Inc.
(“SANavigator”), SageTree, Inc.
(“SageTree”), Keen Personal Media, Inc. (“Keen
PM”) and Cameo Technologies, Inc. (“Cameo”).
Subsequent to June 29, 2001, the Company discontinued the
operations of both Connex and SANavigator, selling substantially
all the assets of the two companies. The Company’s other
new businesses have not yet generated significant revenue and
the Company continues to evaluate their progress.

Results of Operations

Summary of 1999, 2000 and 2001
Comparison

The following table sets forth, for the periods
indicated, items in the Company’s statements of operations
expressed as a percentage of total revenue. This table and the
following discussion exclude the results of the discontinued
Connex and SANavigator businesses.

The Company reported losses from continuing
operations of $472.5, $329.5 and $87.1 million in 1999,
2000 and 2001, respectively. The 1999 loss included charges of
approximately $77.0 million for incremental thin-film
warranty provisions, approximately $7.5 million in
Malaysian currency losses and restructuring charges of
$61.0 million for the consolidation of the Company’s
personal storage and enterprise storage divisions and the sale
of its media operation. The 2000 loss included net restructuring
charges totaling $85.8 million for the closure of the
Company’s Singapore operations and SCSI hard drive
operations. The 2000 loss also included charges to cost of
revenues of $34.8 million for vendor settlements,
incremental warranty, and inventory write-downs associated with
exiting the SCSI hard drive product line and $37.7 million
for costs to repair recalled drives. The 2001 loss included
nonoperating charges of $52.4 million to adjust the
carrying value of equity investments in and notes receivable
from Komag, Inc. (“Komag”) and accruals of contingent
guarantees. Excluding the aforementioned restructuring and other
charges, losses from continuing operations were $327.0, $171.2
and $34.7 million in 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively. The
decrease in losses from 1999 to 2000, excluding restructuring
and special charges, was due primarily to a $107.6 million,
or 27.9%, decrease in operating expenses and a
$20.8 million decrease in interest and other nonoperating
expense. The decrease in losses from 2000 to 2001 resulted from
a $125.6 million increase in gross profit and a



$36.1 million decrease in operating
expenses, partially offset by a $5.7 million increase in
interest and other nonoperating expense.

Net Revenues

Consolidated net revenues of $2.0 billion in
2000, decreased $0.8 billion or 29.3% from 1999, due to the
Company’s decision in the third quarter of 2000 to cease
production of SCSI hard drives (1999 revenue included
$435.0 million for SCSI hard drives compared to
$141.8 million in 2000), a decline in the average selling
prices (“ASP’s”) of EIDE hard drive products due
to an intensely competitive market, and a decline in EIDE drive
unit shipments of approximately 6%, due largely to the product
recall in the first quarter of 2000.

During the first quarter of 2000, the Company
announced a recall of its 6.8GB per platter series of WD
Caviar® EIDE hard drives because of a reliability problem
resulting from a faulty power driver chip manufactured by a
third-party supplier. As a result, revenues of approximately
$100 million were reversed and production was shut down for
approximately two weeks, eliminating approximately
$70 million of forecasted revenue.

Consolidated net revenues in 2001 were flat with
2000, at approximately $2.0 billion. Excluding the revenue
from SCSI drive sales in 2000, revenue increased
$138.0 million or 7.6% in 2001. This improvement was due to
an increase in EIDE drive unit shipments of approximately 19%,
offset by a decline in ASP’s. Revenues from new business
ventures were not material for the periods presented. In 2001,
the Company adopted Staff Accounting Bulletin 101 “Revenue
Recognition in Financial Statements” (“SAB 101”),
which defers the recognition of revenue on sales made under
certain shipping terms. The implementation of SAB 101 resulted
in an increase to revenues for 2001 of $13.1 million.

Gross Profit

Gross profit (loss) was ($2.8) million, or
(0.1)% of revenue in 1999, $9.6 million, or 0.5% of revenue in
2000 and $207.7 million, or 10.6% of revenue in 2001. Gross
profit for 1999 included $77.0 million of special charges
for incremental thin-film warranty provision related to a change
in the estimated lifetime return rate applied to an installed
base of products. Gross profit for 2000 included
$72.5 million of special charges related to exiting the
SCSI hard drive product line and the product recall. Excluding
special charges, gross profit was $74.2 million, or 2.7% of
revenue, and $82.1 million, or 4.2% of revenue, for 1999
and 2000, respectively. The increase in gross profit from 1999
to 2000 (excluding special charges) was primarily the result of
lower manufacturing costs due to the consolidation of drive
production to a single, highly utilized facility in Malaysia,
offset by lower volumes and lower ASPs. The increase in gross
profit from 2000 to 2001 (excluding special charges) was the
result of higher volume, offset by lower ASP’s, lower
manufacturing costs due to 2000 expense reduction efforts and
lower warranty costs due to the discontinuance of the SCSI hard
drive product line in 2000 and the expiration of the warranty
period for thin-film products in 2001. The net impact of SAB 101
on gross profit in 2001 was insignificant.

Operating Expenses

Research and development expense was $198.4,
$150.7 and $122.5 million for 1999, 2000 and 2001,
respectively. The $47.7 and $28.1 million decreases from
1999 to 2000 and from 2000 to 2001, respectively, were due to
the Company’s exit from SCSI hard drive production during
2000 and expense reduction efforts in its remaining hard drive
operations, partially offset by increased spending in the
Company’s developing new business ventures.

Selling, general and administrative
(“SG&A”) expense was $194.4, $127.0 and
$119.1 million for 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively. The
decrease of $67.4 million from 1999 to 2000 was primarily
due to the Company’s exit from SCSI hard drive production,
expense reductions in its remaining hard drive operations, an
$11.0 million accrual reduction in the fourth quarter of
2000 and the nonrecurrence of a $7.5 million charge on the
terminated hedging contracts recorded in 1999. The decrease was
partially offset by increased spending in the Company’s
developing new business ventures. The decrease of
$7.9 million from 2000 to 2001 was



primarily due to the Company’s exit from
SCSI hard drive production in 2000 and the expense reduction
efforts in its remaining hard drive operations, partially offset
by increased spending in the Company’s developing new
business ventures.

Interest and Other Income/
Expense, Tax Benefit and Extraordinary Item

Net interest and other (expense) income was
($15.9), $4.9 and ($53.2) million in 1999, 2000 and 2001,
respectively. The $20.8 million decrease in expense in 2000
was due to a $14.8 million gain on the disposition of
certain investment securities and to lower interest expense on
lower average debt balances resulting from the payment in 2000
of an outstanding term loan of $50.0 million and
redemptions during 2000 of the Company’s 5.25% zero coupon
convertible debentures (the “Debentures”), offset by a
reduced amount of interest income due to lower cash and cash
equivalent balances.

During the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company
recorded nonoperating charges of $52.4 million to adjust
the carrying value of equity investments in and notes receivable
from Komag and accruals of Komag contingent guarantees. The
assets were received as a component of the total consideration
from the sale of the Company’s disk media operations to
Komag in 1999. Also in conjunction with the sale, Komag assumed
certain liabilities, mainly leases related to production
equipment and facilities, for which the Company remained
contingently liable. Due to recent market conditions and the
announcement by Komag that it would not pay its senior debt when
it became due in June and an interest payment on its convertible
bonds due in July, the Company recorded the charges. On
August 24, 2001, Komag announced its voluntary
Chapter 11 reorganization filing.

The $58.1 million increase in net interest and
other expense in 2001 was due primarily to the nonrecurring
charges related to Komag of $52.4 million, a $15.1 million
decrease in gains from the disposition of investment securities
and a reduced amount of interest income due to lower cash and
cash equivalent balances, offset slightly by lower accrued
interest expense due to Debenture redemptions.

The Company recorded an income tax benefit of
$19.5 million in 2000 to adjust its current and deferred
tax accruals. The accruals were previously established over time
and primarily related to unremitted income of foreign
subsidiaries. However, due to the significant increase of net
operating loss carryforwards in recent years and reevaluation of
the accruals after the substantial international restructurings
in 2000, the Company believed the accruals were no longer
necessary. In 1999 and 2001, no tax benefit was recorded because
additional loss carrybacks were not available and management
believed it was “more likely than not” that the
deferred tax benefits generated would not be realized (see Note
5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).

During 2000, the Company issued 26.7 million
shares of common stock in exchange for $735.6 million in
face value of its convertible debentures (with a book value of
$284.1 million). During 2001 the Company issued
16.0 million shares of common stock in exchange for
$295.7 million in face value of its convertible debentures
(with a book value of $120.3 million). These redemptions
were private, individually negotiated non-cash transactions with
certain institutional investors. As a result of the redemptions,
the Company recognized extraordinary gains of
$166.9 million and $22.4 million in 2000 and 2001,
respectively.

Discontinued Operations

Subsequent to June 29, 2001, the Company
decided to discontinue the operations of Connex and SANavigator
and sold substantially all of the assets of these two
businesses. Accordingly, the operating results of Connex and
SANavigator have been segregated from continuing operations and
reported separately on the statements of operations as
discontinued operations for all periods presented.



Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company had cash and cash equivalents of
$184.0 million at June 30, 2000 and
$167.6 million at June 29, 2001. Net cash used for
continuing operations was $126.7 million during 2000 as
compared to $71.3 million during 2001. The decrease in cash
used for continuing operations reflects a significant
improvement in the Company’s operating results, net of
non-cash items, offset by a higher level of cash used to fund
net operating asset growth. The improvement in continuing
operating results, net of non-cash items, of $204.3 million was
due to significantly better performance by the Company’s
hard drive business, as a result of higher sales volume and
improved cost management, the discontinuance in 2000 of the
Company’s SCSI drive product line and the inclusion in 2000
of significant charges relating to the product recall. The
improved operating results of the hard drive business were
offset somewhat by increased spending on continuing new business
ventures. Cash used to fund net operating asset growth for
continuing operations increased in 2001 by $148.9 million due
primarily to the impact in the prior year of the product recall
on net operating assets. Specifically, there was a sharp
contraction during 2000 in the Company’s cash conversion
cycle which represents the sum of the number of days sales
outstanding (“DSO”) and days inventory outstanding
(“DIO”) less days payable outstanding
(“DPO”). As the following chart indicates, the
Company’s cash conversion cycle was reduced by 17 days
during 2000, and another 6 days during 2001.

The decrease in the cash conversion cycle from
1999 to 2000 was due primarily to a reduction in DSO’s, due
in large part to the product recall during the first quarter of
2000 and a sustained improvement in the linearity of shipments
during the remainder of 2000. The decrease from 2000 to 2001 was
due to a reduction in DSO’s and DIO’s, due primarily
to improved sales and production linearity, offset partially by
a slight decrease in DPO’s. The Company seeks to maintain a
negative cash conversion cycle.

Other uses of cash during 2000 included the
repayment of bank debt of $50.0 million, cost-method
investments of $12.9 million and net capital expenditures
of $21.4 million. Other sources of cash during 2000
included proceeds of $111.8 million received upon issuance
of 24.6 million shares of the Company’s stock under
the Company’s equity facility, $10.0 million received by
SageTree upon issuance of preferred stock, $6.2 million
received in connection with stock option exercises and Employee
Stock Purchase Plan purchases, and $66.8 million received
from sales of real property.

Other uses of cash during 2001 included net
capital expenditures of $50.7 million, primarily to upgrade the
Company’s hard drive production capabilities and for normal
replacement of existing assets. Other sources of cash during
2001 included proceeds of $15.0 million received upon the
sale of marketable equity securities, $110.5 million
received upon issuance of 23.5 million shares of the
Company stock under the Company’s equity facility,
$7.1 million received in connection with the stock option
exercises and Employee Stock Purchase Plan purchases and
$5.0 million received by Keen upon issuance of an investor
note.

The Company anticipates that capital expenditures
in 2002 will not be more than $65.0 million and will relate
to normal replacement of existing assets.

During 1998 the Company issued zero coupon
convertible subordinated debentures due February 18, 2018
(the “Debentures”). The Debentures are subordinated to
all senior debt; are redeemable at the option of the Company any
time after February 18, 2003 at the issue price plus
accrued original issue discount to the date of redemption; and
at the holder’s option, will be repurchased by the Company,
as of February 18, 2003, February 18, 2008 or
February 18, 2013, or if there is a Fundamental Change (as
defined in the Debenture documents), at the issue price plus
accrued original issue discount to the date of repurchase. The
payment on those dates, with the exception of a Fundamental
Change, can be in cash, stock or any combination, at the



Company’s option. The Debentures are
convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at
the rate of 14.935 shares per $1,000 principal amount at
maturity. The principal amount at maturity of the Debentures
when issued was $1.3 billion. During 2000, the Company
issued 26.7 million shares of common stock in exchange for
Debentures with a book value of $284.1 million and an
aggregate principal amount at maturity of $735.6 million.
During 2001, the Company issued 16.0 million shares of common
stock in exchange for Debentures with a book value of
$120.3 million and an aggregate principal amount at
maturity of $295.7 million. These redemptions were private,
individually negotiated transactions with certain institutional
investors and resulted in extraordinary gains of $166.9 million
and $22.4 million during 2000 and 2001, respectively. As of
June 29, 2001, the book value of the remaining outstanding
Debentures was $112.5 million, the aggregate principal amount at
maturity was $265.9 million and the market value was
$85.1 million.

During 2001 the Company entered into a three-year
Senior Credit Facility for its hard drive business, Western
Digital Technologies, Inc. (“WDT”), replacing a
previous facility that had matured on March 31, 2000. The
Senior Credit Facility provides up to $125 million in
revolving credit (subject to a borrowing base calculation),
matures on September 20, 2003 and is secured by WDT’s
accounts receivable, inventory, 65% of the stock in its foreign
subsidiaries and other assets. At the option of WDT, borrowings
bear interest at either LIBOR (with option periods of one to
three months) or a base rate, plus a margin determined by the
borrowing base.

The Senior Credit Facility requires WDT to
maintain certain amounts of tangible net worth, prohibits the
payment of cash dividends on common stock and contains a number
of other covenants. As of the date hereof, there were no
borrowings under the facility.

Under an existing shelf registration statement
(the “equity facility”), the Company may issue shares
of common stock to institutional investors for cash. Shares sold
under the facility are at the market price of the Company’s
common stock less a discount ranging from 2.75% to 4.25%. During
2000, the Company issued 24.6 million shares of common
stock under the equity facility for net cash proceeds of
$111.8 million. During 2001, the Company issued
23.5 million shares of common stock under the equity
facility for net cash proceeds of $110.5 million. As of
June 29, 2001, the Company had $167.7 million
remaining under the equity facility.

The Company may continue to incur operating
losses during 2002. However, at June 29, 2001, the Company
had a cash and cash equivalent balance of $167.6 million,
working capital of $45.4 million and shareholders’
equity of $6.8 million. The Company has achieved
significant reductions in manufacturing labor and overhead and
operating expenses resulting from the sale in late 1999 of the
Company’s media operations, the closure in 2000 of the
Company’s two Singapore based manufacturing facilities and
its Rochester design center, the disposal of its Connex and
SANavigator businesses, and an overall reduction in worldwide
headcount. In addition, the Company had the following additional
sources of liquidity available as of September 26, 2001;
$167.7 million remaining available under the equity
facility and a Senior Credit Facility providing up to
$125 million in revolving credit (subject to a borrowing
base calculation).

Based on the above factors, the Company believes
its current cash and cash equivalent balances and its existing
equity and credit facilities will be sufficient to meet its
working capital needs through the foreseeable future. There can
be no assurance that the Senior Credit Facility or the equity
facility will continue to be available to the Company. Also, the
Company’s ability to sustain its working capital position
is dependent upon a number of factors that are discussed below
under the headings “Risk factors related to the hard drive
industry in which we operate” and “Risk factors
relating to Western Digital particularly.”

New Accounting Pronouncements

During July 2001, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 141, “Business
Combinations” (“SFAS 141”) and Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets” (“SFAS 142”).
Effective June 30, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS 141.
SFAS 141 addresses financial accounting and reporting for
business combinations and requires that all business
combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 be accounted for
using the purchase method. The adoption of SFAS 141 did not have
a material impact on the Company’s financial position or
results of operations.



SFAS 142 requires that goodwill and intangible
assets that have indefinite useful lives not be amortized but
rather be tested at least annually for impairment. The Company
is required to adopt SFAS 142 on June 29, 2002.
However, goodwill and intangible assets acquired after
June 30, 2001 are subject to the amortization provisions of
SFAS 142. The Company does not expect the adoption of
SFAS 142 to have a material impact on the Company’s
financial position or results of operations.

Risk factors related to the hard drive
industry in which we operate

Our operating results depend on our being
	among the first-to-market and first-to-volume with our new
	products.

To achieve consistent success with computer
manufacturer customers we must be an early provider of next
generation hard drives featuring leading technology and high
quality. If we fail to:

then our market share would be adversely
affected, which would harm our operating results.

Short product life cycles make it
difficult to recover the cost of development.

Over the past few years hard drive areal density
(the gigabytes of storage per disk) has increased at a much more
rapid pace than previously experienced. The technical challenges
of maintaining this pace are becoming more formidable, and the
risk of not achieving the targets for each new generation of
drives increases, which could adversely impact product
manufacturing yields and schedules, among other impacts. Higher
areal densities mean that fewer heads and disks are required to
achieve a given drive capacity. This has significantly shortened
product life cycles, since each generation of drives is more
cost effective than the previous one. Shorter product cycles
make it more difficult to recover the cost of product
development.

Short product life cycles force us
to continually qualify new products with our
customers.

Due to short product life cycles, we must
regularly engage in new product qualification with our
customers. To be considered for qualification we must be among
the leaders in time-to-market with our new products. Once a
product is accepted for qualification testing, any failure or
delay in the qualification process can result in our losing
sales to that customer until the next generation of products is
introduced. The effect of missing a product qualification
opportunity is magnified by the limited number of high volume
computer manufacturers, most of which continue to consolidate
their share of the PC market. These risks are magnified because
we expect cost improvements and competitive pressures to result
in declining sales and gross margins on our current generation
products.

Unexpected technology advances in
the hard drive industry could harm our competitive
position.

If one of our competitors were able to implement
a significant advance in head or disk drive technology that
enables a step-change increase in areal density allowing greater
storage of data on a disk, it would harm our operating results.

Advances in magnetic, optical, semiconductor or
other data storage technologies could result in competitive
products that have better performance or lower cost per unit of
capacity than our products. If these products prove to be
superior in performance or cost per unit of capacity, we could
be at a competitive disadvantage to the companies offering those
products.



Our average selling prices are
declining.

We expect that our average selling prices for
hard drives will continue to decline. Rapid increases in areal
density mean that the average drive we sell has fewer heads and
disks, and is therefore lower cost. Because of the
competitiveness of the hard drive industry, lower costs
generally mean lower prices. This is true even for those
products that are competitive and introduced into the market in
a timely manner. Our average selling prices decline even further
when competitors lower prices to absorb excess capacity,
liquidate excess inventories, restructure or attempt to gain
market share.

The hard drive industry is highly competitive
	and characterized by rapid shifts in market share among the
	major competitors.

The price of hard drives has fallen over time due
to increases in supply, cost reductions, technological advances
and price reductions by competitors seeking to liquidate excess
inventories or gain market share. In addition, rapid
technological changes often reduce the volume and profitability
of sales of existing products and increase the risk of inventory
obsolescence. These factors, taken together, result in
significant and rapid shifts in market share among the
industry’s major participants. For example, during 1998 and
1999, we lost significant share of the desktop market. During
the first quarter of 2000, the Company lost market share as a
result of a previously announced product recall; however, we
recovered some market share during the remainder of 2000 and
during the first half of 2001, but our share is still
significantly below its 1997 level.

Our prices and margins are subject to declines
	due to unpredictable end-user demand and oversupply of hard
	drives.

Demand for our hard drives depends on the demand
for computer systems manufactured by our customers and on
storage upgrades to existing systems. The demand for computer
systems has been volatile in the past and often has had an
exaggerated effect on the demand for hard drives in any given
period. As a result, the hard drive market tends to experience
periods of excess capacity, which typically lead to intense
price competition. Recently several competitor manufacturers and
industry analysts have forecasted softening PC demand in the
U.S. If intense price competition occurs as a result of
softening demand, we may be forced to lower prices sooner and
more than expected and transition to new products sooner than
expected.

Changes in the markets for hard
drives require us to develop new products.

Over the past few years the consumer market for
desktop computers has shifted significantly towards lower priced
systems, especially those systems priced below $1,000. We were
late to market with a value line hard drive to serve that
market, and we lost market share. If we are not able to offer a
competitively priced value line hard drive for the low-cost PC
market our market share will likely fall, which could harm our
operating results.

The PC market is fragmenting into a variety of
computing devices and products. Some of these products, such as
Internet appliances, may not contain a hard drive. On the other
hand, many industry analysts expect, as do we, that as
broadcasting and communications are increasingly converted to
digital technology from the older, analog technology, the
technology of computers and consumer electronics and
communication devices will converge, and hard drives will be
found in many consumer products other than computers. If we are
not successful in using our hard drive technology and expertise
to develop new products for these emerging markets, it will
likely harm our operating results.

We depend on our key
personnel.

Our success depends upon the continued
contributions of our key employees, many of whom would be
extremely difficult to replace. Worldwide competition for
skilled employees in the hard drive industry is intense. We have
lost a number of experienced hard drive engineers over the past
two years as a result of the loss of retention value of their
employee stock options (because of the decrease in price of our
common stock) and aggressive recruiting of our employees. If we
are unable to retain our existing employees or hire and
integrate new employees, our operating results would likely be
harmed.



Risk factors relating to Western Digital
particularly

Loss of market share with a key
customer could harm our operating results.

A majority of our revenue comes from a few
customers. For example, during 2001, sales to our top
10 customers accounted for approximately 60% of revenues.
These customers have a wide variety of suppliers to choose from
and therefore can make substantial demands on us. Even if we
successfully qualify a product with a customer, the customer
generally is not obligated to purchase any minimum volume of
products from us and is able to terminate its relationship with
us at any time. Our ability to maintain strong relationships
with our principal customers is essential to our future
performance. If we lose a key customer, or if any of our key
customers reduce their orders of our products or require us to
reduce our prices before we are able to reduce costs, our
operating results would likely be harmed. For example, this
occurred with our enterprise hard drive product line early in
the third quarter of 2000 and is one of the factors which led to
our decision to exit the enterprise hard drive market.

Dependence on a limited number of qualified
	suppliers of components could lead to delays or increased
	costs.

Because we do not manufacture any of the
components in our hard drives, an extended shortage of required
components or the failure of key suppliers to remain in
business, adjust to market conditions, or to meet our quality,
yield or production requirements could harm us more severely
than our competitors, some of whom manufacture certain of the
components for their hard drives. A number of the components
used by us are available from only a single or limited number of
qualified outside suppliers. If a component is in short supply,
or a supplier fails to qualify or has a quality issue with a
component, we may experience delays or increased costs in
obtaining that component. This occurred in September 1999 when
we had to shut down our Caviar product line production for
approximately two weeks as a result of a faulty power driver
chip which was sole-sourced from a third-party supplier.

To reduce the risk of component shortages, we
attempt to provide significant lead times when buying these
components. As a result, we may have to pay significant
cancellation charges to suppliers if we cancel orders, as we did
in 1998 when we accelerated our transition to magnetoresistive
recording head technology, and as we did in 2000 as a result of
our decision to exit the enterprise hard drive market.

In April 1999, we entered into a three-year
volume purchase agreement with Komag under which we buy a
substantial portion of our media components from Komag. This
strategic relationship has reduced our media component costs;
however, it has increased our dependence on Komag as a supplier.
Our future operating results may depend substantially on
Komag’s ability to timely qualify its media components in
our new development programs and to supply us with these
components in sufficient volume to meet our production
requirements. A significant disruption in Komag’s ability
to manufacture and supply us with media could harm our operating
results. Subsequent to June 29, 2001, Komag announced the
voluntary filing for Chapter 11 reorganization. Komag
further announced that it expects to continue its operations
during the Chapter 11 process.

To develop new products we must maintain
	effective partner relationships with our strategic component
	suppliers.

Under our “virtual vertical
integration” business model, we do not manufacture any of
the parts used in our hard drives. As a result, the success of
our products depends on our ability to gain access to and
integrate parts that are “best in class” from reliable
component suppliers. To do so we must effectively manage our
relationships with our strategic component suppliers. We must
also effectively integrate different products from a variety of
suppliers and manage difficult scheduling and delivery problems.



We have only one manufacturing
facility, which subjects us to the risk of damage or loss of the
facility.

Our volume manufacturing operations currently are
based in one facility in Malaysia. A fire, flood, earthquake or
other disaster or condition affecting our facility or the
geographic area in which it is located would almost certainly
result in a loss of substantial sales and revenue and harm our
operating results.

Manufacturing our products abroad
subjects us to numerous risks.

We are subject to risks associated with our
foreign manufacturing operations, including:

We have attempted to manage the impact of foreign
currency exchange rate changes by, among other things, entering
into short-term, forward exchange contracts. However, those
contracts do not cover our full exposure and can be canceled by
the issuer if currency controls are put in place, as occurred in
Malaysia during the first quarter of 1999. As a result of the
Malaysian currency controls, we are no longer hedging the
Malaysian currency risk.

Our plan to broaden our business
takes us into new markets.

We are developing storage devices and content
management software for the emerging broadband television market
through our Keen PM subsidiary. We will be facing the challenge
of developing products for a market that is still evolving and
subject to rapid changes and shifting consumer preferences.
There are several competitors which have also entered this
emerging market, and there is no assurance that the market for
digital storage devices for television and other audio-visual
content will materialize or support all of these competitors.

We have entered the data warehouse software and
services market through our SageTree subsidiary and are
considering other initiatives related to data and content
management, storage and communication. In any of these
initiatives we will be facing the challenge of developing
products and services for markets that are still evolving and
which have many current and potential competitors. If we are not
successful in these new initiatives it will likely harm our
operating results.

We have developed technologies and services for
integrating high-quality digital video into everyday computing
through our Cameo subsidiary. We will be facing the challenge of
developing products for a market that is still evolving and
subject to rapid changes and shifting consumer preferences.
There is no assurance that the market for these products will
materialize or that the products we produce will be acceptable
to that market.

Our reliance on intellectual property and
	other proprietary information subjects us to the risk of
	significant litigation.

The hard drive industry has been characterized by
significant litigation. This includes litigation relating to
patent and other intellectual property rights, product liability
claims and other types of litigation. We are currently
evaluating notices of alleged patent infringement or notices of
patents from patent holders. We also are a party to several
judicial and other proceedings relating to patent and other
intellectual property rights. If



we conclude that a claim of infringement is
valid, we may be required to obtain a license or cross-license
or modify our existing technology or design a new non-infringing
technology. Such licenses or design modifications can be
extremely costly. We may also be liable for any past
infringement. If there is an adverse ruling against us in an
infringement lawsuit, an injunction could be issued barring
production or sale of any infringing product. It could also
result in a damage award equal to a reasonable royalty or lost
profits or, if there is a finding of willful infringement,
treble damages. Any of these results would likely increase our
costs and harm our operating results.

Our reliance on intellectual property and
	other proprietary information subjects us to the risk that these
	key ingredients of our business could be copied by
	competitors.

Our success depends, in significant part, on the
proprietary nature of our technology, including non-patentable
intellectual property such as our process technology. Despite
safeguards, to the extent that a competitor is able to reproduce
or otherwise capitalize on our technology, it may be difficult,
expensive or impossible for us to obtain necessary legal
protection. Also, the laws of some foreign countries may not
protect our intellectual property to the same extent as do the
laws of the United States. In addition to patent protection of
intellectual property rights, we consider elements of our
product designs and processes to be proprietary and
confidential. We rely upon employee, consultant and vendor
non-disclosure agreements and a system of internal safeguards to
protect our proprietary information. However, any of our
registered or unregistered intellectual property rights may be
challenged or exploited by others in the industry, which might
harm our operating results.

Inaccurate projections of demand
for our product can cause large fluctuations in our quarterly
results.

If we do not forecast total quarterly demand
accurately, it can have a material adverse effect on our
quarterly results. We typically book and ship a high percentage
of our total quarterly sales in the third month of the quarter,
which makes it difficult for us to match our production plans to
customer demands. In addition, our quarterly projections and
results may be subject to significant fluctuations as a result
of a number of other factors including:

Rapidly changing market conditions
in the hard drive industry make it difficult to estimate actual
results.

We have made and continue to make a number of
estimates and assumptions relating to our consolidated financial
reporting. The rapidly changing market conditions with which we
deal means that actual results may differ significantly from our
estimates and assumptions. Key estimates and assumptions for us
include:



The market price of our common
stock is volatile.

The market price of our common stock has been,
and may continue to be, extremely volatile. Factors such as the
following may significantly affect the market price of our
common stock:

In addition, the stock market in recent months
has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have
particularly affected the stock price of many high technology
companies. These fluctuations are often unrelated to the
operating performance of the companies.

Securities class action lawsuits are often
brought against companies after periods of volatility in the
market price of their securities. A number of such suits have
been filed against us in the past, and any of these litigation
matters could result in substantial costs and a diversion of
resources and management’s attention.

We may be unable to raise future
capital through debt or equity financing.

Due to our recent financial performance and the
risks described in this Report, in the future we may be unable
to maintain adequate financial resources for capital
expenditures, working capital and research and development. We
have a credit facility for our WDT subsidiary, which matures on
September 20, 2003. If we decide to increase or accelerate
our capital expenditures or research and development efforts, or
if results of operations do not meet our expectations, we could
require additional debt or equity financing. However, we cannot
ensure that additional financing will be available to us or
available on favorable terms. An equity financing could also be
dilutive to our existing stockholders.

Power outages resulting from energy shortages
	in California may have an adverse impact on our facilities
	located in California.

We conduct substantial operations at our
headquarters located in Lake Forest, California and at our
facilities located in San Jose, California and Irvine,
California. We rely on a continuous power supply in order to
conduct those operations. California’s current energy
crisis could disrupt our operations and increase our expenses.
In the event of an acute power shortage, that is, when energy
reserves for the state fall below 1.5%, California has on some
occasions implemented, and may in the future implement, rolling
blackouts across the state. Although the Governor and state
legislators are working to prevent them in the future, and
although the Company has back-up energy reserves to last a short
period, rolling blackouts could interrupt our power supply and
might temporarily render us unable to continue operations at our
California facilities. Any such interruption in our ability to
continue our operations at our California facilities could delay
the development of products or disrupt communications with our
customers, suppliers or manufacturing operations, either of
which could harm our business and results of operations. In
addition, if wholesale prices for electricity continue to
increase, our operating expenses would likely increase which
might negatively affect our operating results.



Item 7A.

Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Disclosure About Foreign Currency
Risk

Although the majority of the Company’s
transactions are in U.S. Dollars, some transactions are based in
various foreign currencies. From time to time, the Company
purchases short-term, forward exchange contracts to hedge the
impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain underlying
assets, liabilities and commitments for operating expenses
denominated in foreign currencies. The purpose for entering into
these hedge transactions is to minimize the impact of foreign
currency fluctuations on the results of operations. To date, a
majority of the increases or decreases in the Company’s
local currency operating expenses are offset by gains and losses
on the hedges. The contracts have maturity dates that do not
exceed twelve months. The Company does not purchase short-term
forward exchange contracts for trading purposes.

Historically, the Company has focused on hedging
its foreign currency risk related to the Singapore Dollar, the
British Pound and the Malaysian Ringgit. With the establishment
of currency controls and the prohibition of purchases or sales
of the Malaysian Ringgit by offshore companies, the Company
discontinued hedging its Malaysian Ringgit currency risk in
1999. Future hedging of this currency will depend on currency
conditions in Malaysia. The imposition of exchange controls by
the Malaysian government resulted in a $7.5 million
realized loss on terminated hedging contracts in the first
quarter of 1999. As a result of the closure of the
Company’s Singapore operations in 2000, the Company has
also discontinued its hedging program related to the Singapore
Dollar.

As of June 29, 2001, the Company had
outstanding the following purchased foreign currency forward
exchange contracts (in millions, except average contract rate):

In 1999, 2000, and 2001 total realized
transaction and forward exchange contract currency gains and
losses (excluding the $7.5 million realized loss on the
Malaysian Ringgits realized in 1999), were not material to the
consolidated financial statements. Based on historical
experience, the Company does not expect that a significant
change in foreign exchange rates would materially affect the
Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Disclosure About Other Market Risks

Fixed Interest Rate Risk

At June 29, 2001, the market value of the
Company’s 5.25% zero coupon convertible subordinated
debentures due in 2018 was approximately $85.1 million,
compared to the related book value of $112.5 million. The
convertible debentures will be repurchased by the Company, at
the option of the holder, as of February 18, 2003,
February 18, 2008, or February 18, 2013, or if there
is a Fundamental Change (as defined in the Debenture documents),
at the issue price plus accrued original issue discount to the
date of redemption. The payment on those dates, with the
exception of a Fundamental Change, can be in cash, stock or any
combination, at the Company’s option.

The Company has a note receivable from another
company that carries a fixed rate of interest. Therefore, a
significant change in interest rates would not cause these notes
to impact the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Variable Interest Rate
Risk

At the option of WDT, borrowings under the Senior
Credit Facility would bear interest at either LIBOR (with option
periods of one to three months) or a base rate, plus a margin
determined by the borrowing base. This is the only debt which
does not have a fixed-rate of interest.



The Senior Credit Facility requires WDT to
maintain certain amounts of tangible net worth, prohibits the
payment of cash dividends on common stock and contains a number
of other covenants. As of the date hereof, there were no
borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility.

Fair Value Risk

The Company owns approximately 1.2 million
shares of Vixel common stock. As of June 29, 2001, the
market value of the Vixel shares was $3.1 million. The
Company determines, on a quarterly basis, the fair market value
of the Vixel shares and records an unrealized gain or loss
resulting from the difference in the fair market value of the
shares as of the previous quarter end and the fair market value
of the shares on the measurement date. As of June 29, 2001,
a $3.1 million total accumulated unrealized gain has been
recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). If
the Company sells all or a portion of this common stock, any
unrealized gain or loss on the date of sale will be recorded as
a realized gain or loss in the Company’s results of
operations. As a result of market conditions, the market value
of the shares had declined from $3.1 million as of
June 29, 2001 to $2.4 million as of August 17,
2001. Due to market fluctuations, an additional decline in the
stock’s fair market value could occur.

Note 1.  Organization and Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies

Western Digital Corporation (“Western
Digital” or the “Company”) has prepared its
consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States and has
adopted accounting policies and practices which are generally
accepted in the industry in which it operates. Following are the
Company’s significant accounting policies:

Fiscal Year

The Company has a 52 or 53-week fiscal year. In
order to align its manufacturing and financial calendars,
effective during the three months ended December 31, 1999,
the Company changed its fiscal calendar so that each fiscal
month ends on the Friday nearest to the last day of the calendar
month. Prior to this change, the Company’s fiscal month
ended on the Saturday nearest to the last day of the calendar
month. The change did not have a material impact on the
Company’s results of operations or financial position. The
1999, 2000 and 2001 fiscal years ended on July 3,
June 30, and June 29, respectively, and consisted of
52 weeks for the fiscal years 2000 and 2001, and
53 weeks for the fiscal year 1999. All general references
to years relate to fiscal years unless otherwise noted.

On April 6, 2001, the Company established a
holding company organizational structure, under which Western
Digital Corporation operates as the parent company to its hard
drive business, Western Digital Technologies (“WDT”),
and other subsidiaries. This administrative and legal change had
no material impact to the accounting and reporting structure of
the Company or to the Company’s results of operations or
financial position.

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and its majority owned subsidiaries. All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation. The accounts of foreign
subsidiaries have been remeasured using the U.S. dollar as the
functional currency. As such, foreign exchange gains or losses
resulting from remeasurement of these accounts are reflected in
the results of operations. These foreign exchange gains and
losses were immaterial to the consolidated financial statements.
Monetary and nonmonetary asset and liability accounts have been
remeasured using the exchange rate in effect at each year end
and using historical rates, respectively. Income statement
accounts have been remeasured using average monthly exchange
rates.

Cash Equivalents

The Company’s cash equivalents represent
highly liquid investments, primarily money market funds and
commercial paper, with original maturities of three months or
less.

Concentration of Credit
Risk

The Company designs, develops, manufactures and
markets hard drives to personal computer manufacturers,
resellers and retailers throughout the world. The Company
performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers’
financial condition and generally requires no collateral. The
Company maintains reserves for potential credit losses, and such
losses have historically been within management’s
expectations. The Company also has cash equivalent policies that
limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial
institution or investment instrument, and require that
investments be made only with financial institutions or in
investment instruments evaluated as highly credit-worthy.

STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Inventory Valuation

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or
net realizable value. Cost is on a first-in, first-out basis for
raw materials and is computed on a currently adjusted standard
basis (which approximates first-in, first-out) for work in
process and finished goods.

The Company maintains a base stock of two to
three weeks of current finished goods inventory for certain key
original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) customers in
facilities located adjacent to their operations. Inventory at
these locations usually includes minor product customizations
(such as labeling) for the related OEM. If subsequent to its
initial order the OEM changes its requirements, inventory held
at these facilities can generally be sold to other OEM’s or
distributors as is or with minor modifications (such as a change
in labeling) at little or no additional cost.

Property and Equipment

The cost of property and equipment is depreciated
over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets.
Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis. Leasehold
improvements are amortized over the lesser of the estimated
useful lives of the assets or the related lease terms.

Intangible Assets

Intangible assets are included in other assets
and amortized over their expected useful lives or the lives of
the related products. The Company reviews identifiable
intangibles and other long-lived assets for impairment whenever
events or circumstances indicate the carrying amounts may not be
recoverable. If the sum of the expected future cash flows
(undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the
carrying amount of an asset, an impairment loss is recognized
(See Note 1, New Accounting Pronouncements).

Revenue Recognition

The Company generally recognizes revenue at the
time of shipment, net of pricing adjustments and estimated sales
returns. In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange
Commission (“SEC”) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin
101 (“SAB 101”), “Revenue Recognition in
Financial Statements”. The Company adopted SAB 101 during
its quarter ended June 29, 2001. As a result, the Company
changed its revenue recognition policy effective July 1,
2000 to recognize revenue on certain product shipments upon
delivery rather than shipment. The accounting change resulted in
an increase to revenues for 2001 of $13.1 million, of which
$16.9 million had been recognized in 2000 and $3.8 million
will be recognized in 2002. The cumulative effect on prior years
of this accounting change was $1.5 million and had an
immaterial impact on reported operating losses in 2001.

In accordance with standard industry practice,
the Company’s agreements with certain resellers provide
price protection for inventories held by the resellers at the
time of published list price reductions and, under certain
circumstances, stock rotation for slow-moving items. Either
party may terminate these agreements upon written notice. In the
event of termination, the Company may be obligated to repurchase
a certain portion of the resellers’ inventory. The Company
recognizes revenue at the time of shipment on sales to resellers
who have inventory repurchase agreements due to the
Company’s ability to reasonably estimate future returns as
well as the historically low levels of actual repurchases.
Revenue recognized on sales to resellers with inventory
repurchase agreements was $841, $683 and $806 million for
fiscal years 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively. Repurchases of
inventory under such agreements were not material in 1999, 2000
and 2001.



WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Warranty

The Company records an accrual for estimated
warranty costs when revenue is recognized. Warranty covers cost
of repair or replacement of the hard drive and the warranty
periods range from 1 to 3 years for all hard drives, except
enterprise drives, which had a warranty period of 5 years.
The Company has comprehensive processes with which to estimate
accruals for warranty, which include specific detail on hard
drives in the field by product type, historical field return
rates and costs to repair. Although the Company believes that it
has the continued ability to reasonably estimate warranty
reserves, unforeseeable changes in factors used to estimate the
accrual for warranty could occur. These unforeseeable changes
could cause a material change in the Company’s warranty
accrual estimate. Such a change would be recorded in the period
in which the change was identified.

The Company transitioned from thin-film to
magnetoresistive head technology in its desktop product line
during 1998. Due to the expiration of the warranty period for
the thin-film products during 2001 and to the discontinuance of
its SCSI drive product line during 2000, warranty accruals
decreased significantly from 2000 to 2001.

Advertising Expense

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.
Selling, general and administrative expenses of the Company
include advertising costs of $14.3, $9.0 and $7.4 million
in 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively.

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes using the
liability method under Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes”
(“SFAS 109”). This method generally provides that
deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized for temporary
differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax
basis of the Company’s assets and liabilities and expected
benefits of utilizing net operating loss (“NOL”)
carryforwards. The Company records a valuation allowance for
certain temporary differences for which it is more likely than
not that it will not receive future tax benefits. The impact on
deferred taxes of changes in tax rates and laws, if any, are
applied to the years during which temporary differences are
expected to be settled and reflected in the consolidated
financial statements in the period of enactment (See Note 5).

Per Share Information

The Company computes basic loss per share using
the net loss and the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the period. Dilutive loss per share is
computed using the net loss and the weighted average number of
common shares and dilutive potential common shares outstanding
during the period. Dilutive common shares include outstanding
employee stock options, employee stock purchase plan shares and
common shares issuable upon conversion of the convertible
debentures. The effects of these items were not included in the
computation of diluted loss per share for each period presented
as their effect would have been anti-dilutive.

As of July 3, 1999, June 30, 2000 and
June 29, 2001, 17.8 million, 20.9 million shares and
23.3 million shares, respectively, relating to the possible
exercise of outstanding stock options were not included in the
computation of diluted loss per share. Also, for the same
periods, an additional 19.4 million, 8.4 million and
4.0 million shares, respectively, issuable upon conversion
of the Debentures were excluded from the computation of diluted
loss per share. The effects of these items were not included in
the computation of diluted loss per share as their effect would
have been anti-dilutive.



WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company applies the provisions of Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, “Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation” (“SFAS 123”). SFAS
123 establishes the financial accounting and reporting standards
for stock-based compensation plans. The Company elected to
continue accounting for stock-based employee compensation plans
in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees” and related interpretations (“APB Opinion
No. 25”), as SFAS 123 permits, and to follow the pro
forma net income (loss), pro forma earnings (loss) per
share, and stock-based compensation plan disclosure requirements
set forth in SFAS 123. (See Note 6).

During 2001, the Company adopted the FASB issued
Interpretation No. 44 “Accounting for Certain
Transactions Involving Stock Compensation — an
interpretation of APB Opinion No. 25” (“FIN
44”). This Interpretation clarifies the definition of an
employee for purposes of applying Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees” (“APB 25”), the criteria for
determining whether a plan qualifies as a noncompensatory plan,
the accounting consequence of various modifications to the terms
of a previously fixed stock option or award, and the accounting
for an exchange of stock compensation awards in a business
combination. The adoption of FIN 44 did not result in a material
impact to the Company’s consolidated financial position,
results of operations or liquidity.

Fair Value of Financial
Instruments

The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents
approximates fair value for all periods presented because of the
short-term maturity of these financial instruments. The fair
value of the Company’s convertible debentures is estimated
by reference to quoted information from market sources. At
June 30, 2000, the market value of the Company’s
convertible debentures was approximately $111.6 million,
compared to the related carrying value of $225.5 million. At
June 29, 2001, the market value of the Company’s
convertible debentures was approximately $85.1 million,
compared to the related carrying value of $112.5 million.
The carrying amounts of all other financial instruments in the
consolidated balance sheets approximate fair values.

Investments

The Company’s investments in unrestricted,
marketable equity securities have been classified as
“available for sale”, are included in other current
assets, and are carried at fair value. The classification of a
security is determined at the acquisition date and reviewed
periodically. The Company reviews, on a monthly basis, the fair
market value of the available for sale securities and records an
unrealized gain or loss resulting from the difference between
the fair market value at the time of the acquisition and the
fair market value on the measurement date. The unrealized gains
or losses are shown as a component of accumulated comprehensive
income (loss) in shareholders’ equity (deficiency).
Securities that are not classified as “available for
sale” are carried at cost. The Company periodically reviews
its cost-basis investments for instances where fair value is
less than cost to determine if the decline in value is other
than temporary. If the decline in value is judged to be other
than temporary, the cost basis of the security is written down
to fair value. The amount of any write-down would be included in
the results of operations as a realized loss. Realized gains and
losses resulting from the sale of securities are determined
using the specific identification method.

The Company received approximately
10.8 million shares of Komag common stock during April
1999, upon the sale of its disk media operations to Komag (See
Note 8). The common stock had a fair market value of
$34.9 million at the time of the transaction. During the
three months ended September 29, 2000, the Company sold
4.9 million shares of the stock for $15.0 million. The
5.9 million remaining Komag shares owned by the Company
were restricted to sale until the following dates:
1.6 million shares on October 8, 2000;
3.2 million shares on October 8, 2001; and
1.1 million shares on October 8, 2002. The
1.6 million shares and the 3.2 million shares,
available for sale on October 8, 2000 and October 8,
2001, respectively, have been classified as current assets and
“available for sale” under the provisions of Statement
of Financial Accounting



WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Standards No. 115, “Investments in
Certain Debt and Equity Securities”
(“SFAS 115”). These shares were marked to market
using published closing prices of Komag stock on a monthly basis
and a related accumulated unrealized gain or loss was included
in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). During the
fourth quarter of 2001, due to market conditions of Komag’s
common stock and a public announcement by Komag that it would
not make current payments on its debt, the decline in market
value of the 4.8 million shares held as current and the
remaining 1.1 million shares held as long term was deemed
“other than temporary” and an impairment loss of
$19.2 million was recognized.

The Company owns approximately 1.2 million
shares of Vixel Corporation (“Vixel”) common stock.
The Company has identified these shares as “available for
sale” under the provisions of SFAS 115. At June 29,
2001 an unrealized gain of $3.1 million is included in
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The aggregate
book value of the shares was $3.1 million as of
June 29, 2001, and the investment was classified as current.

Other Comprehensive Income
(Loss)

The Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 130, “Reporting Comprehensive
Income” (“SFAS 130”), beginning with the
Company’s fourth quarter of 1999. Prior to the fourth
quarter of 1999, the Company did not possess any components of
other comprehensive income as defined by SFAS 130. Adjustments
to net income to arrive at other comprehensive income (loss)
include revenue, expenses, gains and losses that are recorded as
an element of shareholders’ equity (deficiency) but
are excluded from net income (loss). While SFAS 130 establishes
new rules for the reporting and display of comprehensive income
(loss), SFAS 130 has no impact on the Company’s net loss or
total shareholders’ equity (deficiency). The Company’s
components of other comprehensive income (loss) are
unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities categorized
as “available for sale” under SFAS 115.

Minority Interest in
Subsidiary

In June 2000, the Company’s subsidiary,
SageTree, Inc. (“SageTree”), received cash proceeds of
$10.0 million from NCR Corporation in exchange for a
minority voting interest in SageTree at June 30, 2000. The
Company reflects the portion of the earnings or losses of
SageTree, which are applicable to the minority interest as an
adjustment to minority interest on the consolidated balance
sheets, and as a component of other income (expense) on the
consolidated statements of operations. The amount of minority
interest in SageTree’s losses was not material to the
Company’s consolidated financial statements for the years
ended June 30, 2000 and June 29, 2001.

Foreign Exchange
Contracts

Although the majority of the Company’s
transactions are in U.S. Dollars, some transactions are based in
various foreign currencies. From time to time, the Company
purchases short-term, forward exchange contracts to hedge the
impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain underlying
assets, liabilities and commitments for operating expenses
denominated in foreign currencies. The purpose of entering into
these hedge transactions is to minimize the impact of foreign
currency fluctuations on the results of operations. A majority
of the increase or decreases in the Company’s local
currency operating expenses are offset by gains and losses on
the hedges. The contracts have maturity dates that do not exceed
twelve months. The Company does not purchase short-term forward
exchange contracts for trading purposes. In response to the
Company’s underlying foreign currency exposures, the
Company may, from time to time, adjust its foreign currency
hedging position by taking out additional contracts or by
terminating or offsetting existing foreign currency forward
exchange contracts.

During 2001, the Company adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, “Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”
(“SFAS 133”), as amended by Statement of Financial



WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Accounting Standards No. 138,
“Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain
Hedging Activities, an Amendment of FASB Statement
No. 133”. SFAS 133, as amended, establishes
accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments
embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities.

The Company had outstanding forward exchange
contracts with commercial banks with nominal values of $66.4,
$13.5 and $2.8 million, at July 3, 1999, June 30,
2000 and June 29, 2001, respectively. Upon adoption of
SFAS 133, the Company elected not to designate these
forward exchange contracts as accounting hedges and any changes
in fair value have been recorded through the results of
operations for the year ended June 29, 2001. Such changes
in fair value were minor for the year ended June 29, 2001.
Unrealized gains and losses on outstanding forward exchange
contracts and foreign currency transactions are recorded in the
consolidated statements of operations at each quarter end and
were not material to the consolidated financial statements as of
and for the year ended June 30, 2000. For the year ended
July 3, 1999, the total net loss on foreign currency
transactions and forward exchange contracts was
$10.3 million. Of this amount, a realized loss of
$7.5 million on terminated hedging contracts was recorded
due to the imposition of exchange controls by the Malaysian
government. Historically, the Company has focused on hedging its
foreign currency risk related to the Malaysian Ringgit, the
Singapore Dollar and the British Pound. With the establishment
of currency controls and the prohibition of purchases or sales
of the Malaysian Ringgit by offshore companies, the Company
discontinued hedging its Malaysian Ringgit currency risk in
1999. Future hedging of this currency will depend on currency
conditions in Malaysia. As a result of the closure of the
Company’s Singapore operations in 2000, the Company
discontinued its hedging program related to the Singapore Dollar.

Use of Estimates

Company management has made estimates and
assumptions relating to the reporting of certain assets and
liabilities in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

Reclassifications

Certain prior years’ amounts have been
reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

New Accounting
Pronouncements

During July 2001, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 141, “Business
Combinations” (“SFAS 141”) and Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets” (“SFAS 142”).
Effective June 30, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS 141.
SFAS 141 addresses financial accounting and reporting for
business combinations and requires that all business
combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 be accounted for
using the purchase method. The adoption of SFAS 141 did not
have a material impact on the Company’s financial position
or results of operations.

SFAS 142 requires that goodwill and
intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives not be
amortized but rather be tested at least annually for impairment.
The Company is required to adopt SFAS 142 on June 29,
2002. However, goodwill and intangible assets acquired after
June 30, 2001 are subject to the amortization provisions of

Note 3.  Long-Term Debt

Line of Credit

During 2001, the Company’s hard drive
business, Western Digital Technologies (“WDT”),
entered into a three-year Senior Credit Facility which provides
up to $125 million in revolving credit (subject to a
borrowing base calculation), matures on September 20, 2003
and is secured by WDT’s accounts receivable, inventory, 65%
of its stock in its foreign subsidiaries and other assets. At
the option of WDT, borrowings bear interest at either LIBOR
(with option periods of one to three months) or a base rate,
plus a margin determined by the borrowing base. The Senior
Credit Facility requires WDT to maintain certain amounts of
tangible net worth, prohibits the payment of cash dividends on
common stock and contains a number of other covenants. The
Senior Credit facility replaced a previous facility that matured
on March 31, 2000. Outstanding borrowings at July 3,
1999 from this previous facility amounted to $50.0 million
and were paid in full during 2000. As of the date hereof, there
were no borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility.

Convertible Debentures

During 1998 the Company issued zero coupon
convertible subordinated debentures due February 18, 2018
(the “Debentures”). The Debentures are subordinated to
all senior debt; are redeemable at the option of the Company any
time after February 18, 2003 at the issue price plus
accrued original issue discount to the date of redemption; and
at the holder’s option, will be repurchased by the Company,
as of February 18, 2003, February 18, 2008 or
February 18, 2013, or if there is a Fundamental Change (as
defined in the Debenture documents), at the issue price plus
accrued original issue discount to the date of repurchase. The
payment on those dates, with the exception of a Fundamental
Change, can be in cash, stock or any combination, at the
Company’s option. The Debentures are convertible into
shares of the Company’s common stock at the rate of 14.935
shares per $1,000 principal amount at maturity. The principal
amount at maturity of the Debentures when issued was
$1.3 billion. During 2000, the Company issued
26.7 million shares of common stock in exchange for
Debentures with a book value of $284.1 million and an
aggregate principal amount at maturity of $735.6 million.
During 2001, the Company issued 16.0 million shares of
common stock in exchange for Debentures with a book value of
$120.3 million and an aggregate principal amount at
maturity of $295.7 million. These redemptions were private,
individually negotiated, non-cash transactions with certain
institutional investors and resulted in extraordinary gains of
$166.9 million and $22.4 million during 2000 and 2001,
respectively. As of June 29, 2001, the book value of the
remaining outstanding Debentures was $112.5 million and the
aggregate principal amount at maturity was $265.9 million.
Included in other assets is the amount of unamortized Debenture
issuance costs. The Debenture issuance costs totaled
approximately $14.5 million at origination and are being
amortized over 10 years. During 2000 and 2001,
approximately $7.1 million and $2.4 million,
respectively, of unamortized costs were netted against the
extraordinary gain in connection with the redemptions. As of
June 29, 2001 the balance of unamortized Debenture issuance
costs was approximately $1.9 million and is included in
other assets.

Note 4.  Commitments, Agreements and
Contingent Liabilities

Operating Leases

The Company leases certain facilities and
equipment under long-term, non-cancelable operating leases which
expire at various dates through 2010. Rental expense under these
leases, including month-to-month rentals, was $36.2, $17.8 and
$15.4 million in 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively. Leases
with terms through 2003 for which the Company is contingently
liable are included in the table below. See Note 8 for further

Legal Proceedings

In 1992 Amstrad plc (“Amstrad”) brought
suit against the Company in California State Superior Court,
County of Orange, alleging that disk drives supplied to Amstrad
by the Company in 1988 and 1989 were defective and caused
damages to Amstrad of not less than $186 million. The suit
also sought punitive damages. The Company denied the material
allegations of the complaint and filed cross-claims against
Amstrad. The case was tried, and in June 1999 the jury returned
a verdict in favor of Western Digital. Amstrad has appealed the
judgment. The Company does not believe that the outcome of this
matter will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated
financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

In 1994 Papst Licensing (“Papst”)
brought suit against the Company in federal court in California
alleging infringement by the Company of five of its patents
relating to disk drive motors that the Company purchased from
motor vendors. Later that year Papst dismissed its case without
prejudice, but it has notified the Company that it intends to
reinstate the suit if the Company does not enter into a license
agreement with Papst. Papst has also put the Company on notice
with respect to several additional patents. The Company does not
believe that the outcome of this matter will have a material
adverse effect on its consolidated financial position, results
of operations or liquidity.

In June 2000 Discovision Associates
(“Discovision”) notified the Company in writing that
it believes certain of the Company’s hard disk drive
products may infringe certain of Discovision’s patents.
Discovision has offered to provide the Company with a license
under its patent portfolio. The Company is in discussion with
Discovision regarding its claims. There is no litigation
pending. The Company does not believe that the outcome of this
matter will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
consolidated financial position, results of operations or
liquidity.

On June 9, 2000, a suit was brought against
the Company in California Superior Court for the County of
Orange on behalf of a class of former employees of the Company
who were terminated as a result of a reduction in force in
December 1999. The complaint asserted claims for unpaid wages,
fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract, and unfair
business practices. The Company removed the suit to United
States District Court, Central District of California, on the
ground that all of the claims are preempted by the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. On January 26,
2001, the Company filed a motion to dismiss plaintiffs’
complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b). The Court
granted the Company’s motion with leave to amend on
April 2, 2001. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on
April 6, 2001, and the Company filed a motion to dismiss
the amended complaint under Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 12(b) on June 4, 2001. The Court granted the
Company’s motion and dismissed plaintiffs’ amended
complaint with prejudice on August 6, 2001. On
September 5, 2001, the Court entered a stipulated order
according to which plaintiffs agreed to waive their right to
appeal the Court’s order dismissing their claims in
exchange for the Company’s agreeing to waive its right to
costs and fees as the prevailing party under ERISA.

On May 22, 2001, Cambrian Consultants, Inc.
(“Cambrian”) filed a complaint against the Company in
the United States District Court, Central District of
California. The suit alleges infringement by the Company of a
Cambrian patent. On July 20, 2001, the Company filed an answer
denying the allegations contained in Cambrian’s complaint
and a counter claim asserting that Cambrian’s patent was
invalid. The Court ordered that a Markman hearing to construe
the claims of Cambrian’s patent be held on April 15,
2002 and set a briefing schedule leading up to the hearing. Both
parties are engaged in discovery and expect that such discovery
will continue for at least the next several months. Based on its
initial investigation and the limited discovery done to date,
the Company does not believe that the outcome of this matter
will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated
financial position, results of operation or liquidity.

On July 5, 2001, the Company (and its
Malaysian subsidiary) filed suit against Cirrus Logic, Inc.
(“Cirrus”) in California Superior Court for the County
of Orange for breach of contract and other claims resulting from
Cirrus’ role as a strategic supplier of read channel chips
for the Company’s hard drives. The Company also stopped
making payments to Cirrus for past deliveries of chips and
terminated all outstanding purchase orders from Cirrus for such
chips. The Company’s complaint alleges that Cirrus’
unlawful conduct caused damages in excess of any amounts that
may be owing on outstanding invoices or arising out of any
alleged breach of the outstanding purchase orders. On
August 20, 2001, Cirrus filed an answer and
cross-complaint. Cirrus denied the allegations contained in the
Company’s complaint and asserted counterclaims against the
Company for, among other things, the amount of the outstanding
invoices and the Company’s alleged breach of the
outstanding purchase orders. The parties have begun discovery
and expect that such discovery will continue for the next
several months. Based on its initial investigation and the
limited discovery done to date, the Company does not believe
that the outcome of this matter will have a material adverse
effect on its consolidated financial position, results of
operation or liquidity.

In the normal course of business, the Company
receives and makes inquiries regarding possible intellectual
property matters, including alleged patent infringement. Where
deemed advisable, the Company may seek or extend licenses or
negotiate settlements. Although patent holders often offer such
licenses, no assurance can be given that in a particular case a
license will be offered or that the offered terms will be
acceptable to the Company. The Company does not believe that the
ultimate resolution of these matters will have a material
adverse effect on its consolidated financial position, results
of operations or liquidity.

From time to time the Company receives claims and
is a party to suits and other judicial and administrative
proceedings incidental to its business. Although occasional
adverse decisions (or settlements) may occur, the Company does
not believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will
have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial
position, results of operations or liquidity.

Note 5.  Income Taxes

The domestic and international components of net
income (loss) before income taxes are as follows (in
thousands):

The components of the provision
(benefit) for income taxes are as follows (in thousands):

The tax benefits associated with employee
exercises of non-qualified stock options, disqualifying
dispositions of stock acquired with incentive stock options, and
disqualifying dispositions of stock acquired under the employee
stock purchase plan reduced taxes currently payable. However, no
tax benefits were recorded to additional paid-in capital in
1999, 2000 and 2001 because their realization was not more
likely than not to occur and, consequently, a valuation
allowance was recorded against the entire benefit.

During 2000, the Company reversed
$19.5 million of tax accruals and certain deferred tax
amounts. These accruals were previously established over time
and primarily related to unremitted income of foreign
subsidiaries. However, based upon a review of the Company’s
tax positions after the substantial international operations
restructurings in 2000, and due to the significant balances of
net operating losses in recent years, the Company believed these
accruals were no longer necessary.

Income tax payments amounted to
$5.5 million, $4.6 million and $1.5 million in 1999,
2000 and 2001, respectively.

Temporary differences and carryforwards which
give rise to a significant portion of deferred tax assets and
liabilities at June 30, 2000 and June 29, 2001 are as
follows (in thousands):

Reserves and accrued expenses not currently
deductible include the following:

SFAS 109 requires deferred taxes to be determined
for each tax paying component of an enterprise within each tax
jurisdiction. The deferred tax assets indicated above are
attributable primarily to tax jurisdictions where a history of
earnings has not been established. The taxable earnings in these
tax jurisdictions are also subject to volatility. Therefore, the
Company believes a valuation allowance is needed to reduce the
deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to
be realized.

Reconciliation of the United States Federal
statutory rate to the Company’s effective tax rate is as
follows:

Certain income of selected subsidiaries is taxed
at substantially lower income tax rates as compared to local
statutory rates. The lower rates reduced income taxes and
reduced the net loss by $25.2 million ($.28 per share,
diluted), $19 million ($.15 per share, diluted), and
$30.0 million ($.18 per share, diluted) in 1999, 2000 and
2001, respectively. These lower rates are in effect through
fiscal year 2004.



WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Net undistributed earnings from international
subsidiaries at June 29, 2001, on which no U.S. tax has
been provided, amounted to approximately $460 million. The net
undistributed earnings are intended to finance local operating
requirements. Accordingly, an additional United States tax
provision has not been made on these earnings.

At June 29, 2001, the Company had Federal
and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately
$900 million and $386 million, respectively. In
addition, the Company had various Federal and state tax credit
carryforwards of approximately $42.7 million. The loss
carryforwards expire in fiscal years 2008 through 2021 and the
credit carryforwards begin to expire in fiscal year 2002.

Note 6.  Shareholders’
Equity

Equity Facility

Under an existing shelf registration
(“equity facility”), the Company may issue shares of
common stock to institutional investors for cash. Shares sold
under the equity facility are at the market price of the
Company’s common stock less a discount ranging from 2.75%
to 4.25%. During 2000, the Company issued 24.6 million
shares of common stock under the equity facility for net cash
proceeds of approximately $111.8 million. During 2001, the
Company issued 23.5 million shares of common stock under the
equity facility for net cash proceeds of approximately
$110.5 million. As of June 29, 2001, the Company had
$167.7 million remaining under the equity facility.

Stock Reserved for
Issuance

The following table summarizes all shares of
common stock reserved for issuance at June 29, 2001 (in
thousands):

Employee Stock Purchase
Plan

The Company has an employee stock purchase plan
(“ESPP”) that operates in accordance with
Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code whereby eligible
employees may authorize payroll deductions of up to 10% of their
salary to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock at
85% of the fair market value of common stock on the date of
grant or the exercise date, whichever is less.

Approximately 2.9 million shares of common
stock remain reserved for issuance under this plan.
Approximately 1,002,000, 1,236,000 and 1,199,000 shares were
issued under this plan during 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively.

Stock Option Plans

Western Digital’s Employee Stock Option Plan
(“Employee Plan”) is administered by the Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors (“Compensation
Committee”), which determines the vesting provisions, the
form of payment for the shares and all other terms of the
options. Terms of the Employee Plan require that the exercise
price of options be not less than the fair market value of the
common stock on the date of grant. Options granted generally
vest 25% one year from the date of grant and in twelve quarterly



WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

increments thereafter and have a ten-year term.
As of June 29, 2001 options to purchase 7,532,746 and
13,423,861 shares of common stock were exercisable and available
for grant, respectively, under this plan. Pursuant to the terms
of the Employee Plan, participants are permitted to utilize
previously purchased common stock as consideration to purchase
additional common stock upon exercise of options or to exercise
on a cashless basis.

On September 30, 1999, the Company’s
Board of Directors approved the Broad-Based Stock Incentive Plan
(the “Broad-Based Plan”) under which options to
purchase shares of common stock and stock awards may be granted
to employees of the Company and others. This plan is intended to
qualify as “broadly-based” under the New York Stock
Exchange shareholder approval policy. The Compensation Committee
determines the vesting provisions and other terms of the options
and stock. To date, the options granted vest either 100% one
year from the date of grant or 25% every six months beginning
six months from the date of grant. During 2001, the Company
issued 1.3 million shares of restricted stock under the
Broad-Based Plan to certain employees. The stock vests on the
second and third anniversary dates of the grant provided that
the recipient is still employed by the Company. The aggregate
market value of the restricted stock at the dates of issuance of
$4.4 million has been recorded as deferred compensation, a
separate component of shareholder’s equity (deficiency),
and is being amortized over the three-year vesting period. As of
June 29, 2001, options to purchase 3,641,118 shares of
common stock were exercisable and 6,354,583 shares were
available for grant as options or stock awards, under this plan.

The Company has a Stock Option Plan for
Non-Employee Directors (“Director Plan”) and has
reserved 2.6 million shares for issuance thereunder. The
Director Plan provides for initial option grants to new
directors of 75,000 shares per director and additional grants of
options to purchase 10,000 shares of common stock per director
each year upon their reelection as a director at the annual
shareholders’ meeting. Terms of the Director Plan require
that options have a ten-year term and that the exercise price of
options be not less than the fair market value at the date of
grant. Options granted generally vest 25% one year from the date
of grant and in twelve quarterly increments thereafter and have
a ten-year term. As of June 29, 2001, options to purchase
527,192 shares of common stock were exercisable and options to
purchase 1,125,964 shares of common stock were available for
grant.

The following table summarizes activity under the
Employee, Broad-Based and Director Plans (in thousands, except
per share amounts):



WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION

The significant increase in the number of shares
canceled or expired in 2000 was the result of terminations
relating to restructuring and other attrition.

The following tables summarize information about
options outstanding and exercisable under the Employee,
Broad-Based and Director Plans at June 29, 2001 (in
thousands, except per share amounts):

Some of the Company’s new venture
subsidiaries maintain stock option plans for their own employees
and directors and for directors of the Company. The terms of
these plans are similar to those of the Company’s Employee
Plan. These new ventures have reserved up to approximately 17%
of their stock for existing and future option grants to their
employees and directors.

Pro Forma Information

Pro forma information regarding net income (loss)
and earnings (loss) per share is required by SFAS 123. This
information is required to be determined as if the Company had
accounted for its stock options (including shares issued under
the Stock Option Plans, the ESPP and new venture option plans
collectively called “options”) granted subsequent to
July 1, 1995, under the fair value method of that statement.

The fair value of options granted in 1999, 2000
and 2001 reported below has been estimated at the date of grant
using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following
weighted average assumptions:

The following is a summary of the per share
weighted average fair value of stock options granted in the
years listed below:



WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company applies APB Opinion No. 25 in
accounting for its stock option and ESPP plans and, accordingly,
no compensation expense has been recognized for the options in
the consolidated financial statements. Had the Company
determined compensation expense based on the fair value at the
grant date for its options under SFAS 123, the Company’s
net loss and net loss per share would have been increased to the
amounts indicated below:

Stock Purchase Rights

In 1989, the Company implemented a plan to
protect shareholders’ rights in the event of a proposed
takeover of the Company. Under the plan, each share of the
Company’s outstanding common stock carried one Right to
Purchase Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock (the
“Right”). The Right enabled the holder, under certain
circumstances, to purchase common stock of Western Digital or of
an acquiring company at a substantially discounted price ten
days after a person or group publicly announces it has acquired
or has tendered an offer for 15% or more of the Company’s
outstanding common stock. On September 10, 1998 the
Company’s Board of Directors approved the adoption of a new
Rights plan to replace the previous plan, which expired in
September of 1998. The Rights under the 1998 plan were similar
to the rights under the 1989 plan except they were redeemable by
the Company at $.01 per Right and expired in 2008. In connection
with the establishment of a holding company structure on
April 6, 2001, the Company terminated the Rights under the
1998 plan and adopted a new Rights plan. The 2001 plan is
similar to the terminated 1998 plan, except that the exercise
price was reduced from $150.00 to $50.00 per share, and the
expiration date for the 2001 Rights plan was extended to April
2011.

Note 7.  Savings and Profit Sharing
Plan

Effective July 1, 1991, the Company adopted
a Savings and Profit Sharing Plan, the Western Digital
Corporation Retirement Savings and Profit Sharing Plan
(“the Plan”). The Plan includes an employee 401(k)
plan. The Plan covers substantially all domestic employees,
subject to certain eligibility requirements. The Company may
make annual contributions to the 401(k) plan at the discretion
of the Board of Directors. For 1999, 2000 and 2001 the Company
made contributions to the 401(k) plan of $3.3 million,
$2.3 million and $1.7 million, respectively.

Note 8.  Restructurings

1999 Restructuring
Actions

In January 1999, the Company initiated a
restructuring program which resulted in the combination of its
personal storage and enterprise storage divisions into a single
hard drive operating unit. Accordingly, design, manufacturing,
materials, business and product marketing resources to address
both the personal storage and enterprise markets were combined.
In connection with the combination, the Company’s Tuas,
Singapore facility was closed and production of SCSI drives was
moved to the Company’s facility in Chai-Chee, Singapore.
This restructuring program, which was substantially completed by
the end of the third quarter of 1999, resulted in a reduction of
worldwide employee headcount of 934 employees, approximately 250
of which were direct and indirect labor and the remainder were
management, professional and administrative personnel. A
$41.0 million restructuring charge was recorded consisting
of $19.6 million for the write-down of the Tuas building
and equipment to its estimated fair value of $7.8 million,
based on a valuation done by an



WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

independent party, $14.3 million for
severance and other incremental costs related to the closure of
the facility, $5.7 million for the write-off of duplicate
warranty repair and engineering supplies and $1.4 million
for renovation related costs of the Tuas facility. Of the
severance and other related charges, approximately
$11.0 million was paid in 1999, and the remainder was paid
in 2000. The write-off of duplicate warranty repair and
engineering supplies, including base replacement stock for
warranty repairs and engineering materials, was necessary due to
the reduced requirements of a single combined repair facility.
Tuas facility renovation and related costs consisted of costs
incurred to ready the facility for sale.

In April 1999, the Company completed the sale of
its Santa Clara disk media operations to Komag. The components
of the sale are summarized below (in millions):

The Company received, as a component of the total
consideration, an unsecured note (the “Note”) in the
amount of $30.1 million, which was recorded in other
assets. The Note matures in April 2002 and has an annual
interest rate of 4.9%, compounded quarterly. The outstanding
principal balance and accrued interest is due and payable in
full upon maturity. The Note contains a principal and accrued
interest reduction provision which is based on the excess, if
any, of proceeds received upon sale of Komag stock over a
predetermined floor. In conjunction with the sale of Company
assets, Komag assumed certain liabilities, mainly leases related
to production equipment and facilities. The Company is
contingently liable for these leases. If Komag is unable to meet
its payment obligations on the remaining leases, totaling
approximately $9.3 million as of June 29, 2001, the
Company is liable to make the payments (see Note 2).

The transaction with Komag included a three-year
volume purchase agreement under which the Company must purchase
a significant percentage of its media requirements from Komag.
The agreement does not require the Company to purchase a fixed
minimum amount of media from Komag. The Company also entered
into a License Agreement and Joint Development Agreement. The
License Agreement grants Komag a fully paid-up license to
utilize certain of the Company’s technology in the
development of future media products for the Company. The Joint
Development Agreement provides the basis for determining the
ownership of any media manufacturing related technology
developed by Komag and/or the Company in the future. There is no
additional consideration related to the sale inherent in these
other agreements. Therefore, no portion of the sales proceeds
was allocated to them.

The April 1999 sale of the media business
resulted in a reduction of employee headcount of 1,106
employees, approximately 650 of which were direct labor, with
the rest being technicians, management and other professionals.
Of the severance and outplacement charge of $3.0 million,
approximately $1.9 million was paid in 1999, and the balance was
paid in 2000. The sale of the Company’s media assets to
Komag and the related transition and restructuring program were
substantially completed by the end of the fourth quarter of 1999.

charges, the amounts paid and the ending accrual balances (in

The accrual balance at July 3, 1999 after
remaining cash obligations paid in 2000, was reversed through
the restructuring charges line item on the consolidated
statement of operations in 2000 (see table below).

2000 Restructuring
Actions

During 2000, the Company initiated restructuring
actions to improve operational efficiency and reduce operating
expenses. Charges related to these restructuring actions were
accrued in the periods in which executive management committed
to execute such actions. The restructuring actions taken in 2000
included the reorganization of worldwide operational and
management responsibilities, transfer of hard drive production
from Singapore to the Company’s manufacturing facility in
Malaysia, removal of property and equipment from service,
closure of the Company’s Singapore operations and closure
of its Rochester, Minnesota design center. These actions
resulted in a net reduction of worldwide headcount of
approximately 2,000, of which approximately 540 were management,
professional and administrative personnel and the remainder were
manufacturing employees. These employees were given legally
required notification and outplacement services. Restructuring
charges recorded in connection with these actions totaled
$85.8 million and consisted of severance and outplacement
costs of $28.7 million, the write-off of manufacturing
equipment and information systems assets of $56.3 million
(taken out of service and held for disposal), including a loss
recognized on the sale of the Rochester facility of
$1.9 million (sold for cash proceeds of approximately
$29.7 million), and net lease cancellation and other costs
associated with the closure of $11.0 million. Reducing
these charges was the favorable settlement of lease commitments
in Singapore of $5.3 million, favorable settlement of 1999
restructuring accruals of $1.8 million and a gain realized
on the sale of the Tuas facility of $3.1 million. The
restructuring effort was substantially completed by
June 30, 2000. Of the charges, approximately
$30.5 million was paid in 2000 and the remainder was paid
in 2001.

The Company formed new business ventures in 1999,
2000 and 2001. The Company’s new business ventures have
included Connex, Inc. (“Connex”), SANavigator, Inc.
(“SANavigator”), SageTree, Inc.
(“SageTree”), Keen Personal Media, Inc. (“Keen
PM”), and Cameo Technologies, Inc. (“Cameo”).
Connex was formed in 1999 to design and market network attached
storage products. SANavigator was formed as a subsidiary of
Connex in 2001 to develop and market storage area network
(“SAN”) management software. SageTree was formed in
2000 to design and market packaged analytical software and
related services for supply chain and product lifecycle
applications. Keen PM was formed in 2000 to develop and sell
interactive personal video recorder and set-top box software,
services and hardware for broadband television content
management and commerce. Cameo was formed in 2000 to develop
technologies and services for delivering broadcast-quality video
content to PC users. Subsequent to June 29, 2001,
substantially all of the assets of Connex and SANavigator were
sold and, accordingly, their operations were discontinued (See
Note 10). The Company’s chief operating decision maker
uses the segment information for WDT and the Company’s
combined new business ventures to assess performance and to
determine resource allocation. The continuing separate new
business venture amounts do not meet the disclosure requirements
of SFAS 131 and they have been combined and presented in an
“all other” category, separate from the WDT segment
results.

WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Transfers between geographic areas are accounted
for at prices comparable to normal sales through outside
distributors. General and corporate expenses of
$83 million, $62 million and $51 million in 1999,
2000, and 2001 respectively, have been excluded in determining
operating income (loss) by geographic region.

Major Customer

During 1999 and 2000 sales to one customer
accounted for 21% of the Company’s revenues. During 2001
sales to one customer accounted for 17% of the Company’s
revenues and another accounted for 12% of the Company’s
revenues.

Note 10.  Discontinued
Operations

The Company acquired Connex, a San Jose-based
startup company formed to develop storage systems and solutions,
on February 1, 1999 for approximately $12.0 million.
The purchase price included 575,662 shares of Western Digital
common stock valued at $7.9 million, forgiveness of amounts
advanced to Connex prior to the acquisition totaling
$2.0 million and the assumption of certain liabilities of
approximately $2.1 million. The acquisition was accounted
for as a purchase. At the time of the acquisition, Connex was a
development stage operation with no commercial products yet
available for sale. Connex had, at the time of acquisition,
several in-process research and development projects which were
approximately 40% complete. The Company allocated
$12.0 million of the purchase price as a one-time charge
for in-process research and development in 1999. Connex
continued the development efforts and began shipping network
attached storage products during the third quarter of 2000.



WESTERN DIGITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

SANavigator operated as a division of Connex from
its inception in November 1999 until March 22, 2001, at
which time it was incorporated as a wholly owned subsidiary of
Connex. SANavigator was formed to develop and market storage
area network (SAN) management software and released its first
product in October 2000.

On July 1, 2001, the Company decided to
discontinue Connex and SANavigator. Connex and SANavigator are
separate major lines of business and legal entities with
separate facilities, operations, management teams, and classes
of end-user customers from the Company’s hard drive
business. As such, the disposals have been accounted for as
discontinued operations and, accordingly, the consolidated
financial statements for all periods presented have been
reclassified. On August 8, 2001 substantially all of the
operating assets of Connex were sold to Quantum Corporation for
cash proceeds of $11.0 million, and on September 21,
2001 substantially all of the operating assets of SANavigator
were sold to McData Corporation for cash proceeds of
$29.8 million. Approximately $4.1 million of the
combined cash proceeds will be escrowed for one year pending
expiration of customary indemnification periods. The
transactions are expected to generate gains, which will be
recognized during the first quarter of 2002, when realized. At
June 29, 2001 and June 30, 2000 the net liabilities of
discontinued operations consisted principally of individually
immaterial amounts of inventories, fixed assets, accounts
payable and accrued compensation. Combined operating results for
Connex and SANavigator in 1999, 2000 and 2001 were as follows:

(1)  1999 operating losses include
in-process research and development charges of
$12.0 million.

STATEMENTS — (Continued)

During the first quarter of 2000, the Company
	announced a recall of its 6.8GB per platter series of
	WD Caviar® desktop hard drives because of a
	reliability problem resulting from a faulty power driver chip
	manufactured by a third-party supplier. Approximately
	1.2 million units were manufactured with the faulty chip.
	Replacement of the chips involved rework of the printed circuit
	board assembly. Revenues of approximately $100 million,
	which related to products shipped during the first quarter and
	that were recalled, were reversed in the first quarter of 2000.
	In addition, the Caviar product line was shut down for
	approximately two weeks, eliminating approximately
	$70 million of forecasted revenue during the quarter. Cost
	of revenues for the first quarter of 2000 included charges
	totaling $37.7  million for estimated costs to recall and
	repair the affected drives, consisting of $23.1 million for
	repair and retrieval, $4.5 million for freight and other,
	and $10.1 million for write-downs of related inventory.

During the first quarter of 2000 the Company
	recorded a restructuring charge of $32.3 million related to
	the consolidation of the Asian operations, consisting of
	$14.1 million for the write-off of fixed assets no longer
	utilized as a result of the restructuring, $13.0 million
	for severance and outplacement as a result of headcount
	reductions from the restructuring, and lease cancellations and
	other costs of $5.2 million.

During the first quarter of 2000 the Company also
	recognized an extraordinary gain of $90.6 million for the
	redemption of debentures.

The first quarter of 2001 includes an
	extraordinary gain of $11.2 million the Company recognized
	for the redemption of debentures.

(2)

During the second quarter of 2000, the Company
	continued with its restructuring actions and recorded a
	restructuring charge of $25.5  million related to further
	consolidation of the Asian operations, consisting of
	$14.7 million for the write-off of fixed assets,
	$5.8 million for lease cancellation and other costs, and
	$5.0 million for severance and outplacement costs.

Also during the second quarter of 2000 the
	Company recognized an extraordinary gain of $76.3 million
	relating to the redemption of debentures.

The second quarter of 2001 includes an
	extraordinary gain of $10.6 million the Company recognized
	for the redemption of debentures.

(3)

The third quarter of 2000 includes a
	$28.0 million net restructuring charge and a special charge
	to cost of revenues of $34.8 million, directly resulting
	from the Company’s exit from SCSI hard drive production.

The third quarter of 2000 also includes a
	$14.8 million gain on the disposition of certain investment
	securities.

(4)

The fourth quarter of 2000 includes benefits for
	adjustments to tax and other accrual accounts of
	$19.5 million and $11.0 million, respectively.

During the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company
	recorded nonoperating charges of $52.4 million to adjust
	the carrying value of equity investments in and notes receivable
	from Komag and accruals of Komag contingent guarantees.

(5)

As a result of the adoption of Staff Accounting
	Bulletin 101 (“SAB 101”), “Revenue
	Recognition in Financial Statements”, the Company changed
	its revenue recognition policy effective July 1, 2000 to
	recognize revenue on certain product shipments upon delivery
	rather than shipment and recorded a cumulative effect of change
	in accounting principle of $1.5 million in the first
	quarter of 2001. In accordance with the requirements of
	SAB 101, as a result of its adoption during the fourth
	quarter of 2001, previously reported quarterly information for
	2001 has been restated.

The quarterly results presented have been
	reclassified to present the operations of Connex and SANavigator
	as discontinued.
