PART I

Item 1.

Business

General

We design, develop, manufacture and sell hard drives. A
    hard drive is a device that uses one or more rotating magnetic
    disks to store and allow fast access to data. Hard drives are
    key components of computers, including desktop and notebook
    computers (“PCs”), data storage subsystems and many
    consumer electronic (“CE”) devices.

We sell our products worldwide to original equipment
    manufacturers (“OEMs”) and original design
    manufactures (“ODMs”) for use in computer systems,
    subsystems or CE devices, and to distributors, resellers and
    retailers. Our hard drives are used in desktop computers,
    notebook computers, and enterprise applications such as servers,
    workstations, network attached storage, storage area networks
    and video surveillance equipment. Additionally, our hard drives
    are used in CE applications such as digital video recorders
    (“DVRs”), and satellite and cable set-top boxes
    (“STBs”). We also sell our hard drives as stand-alone
    storage products and integrate them into our own WD-branded
    external storage appliances for purposes such as personal data
    backup and portable or expanded storage of digital music,
    photography, video, and other data.

Hard drives provide non-volatile data storage, which means that
    the data remains present when power is no longer applied to the
    device. Our hard drives currently include 3.5-inch and 2.5-inch
    form factor drives, having capacities ranging from 40 gigabytes
    (“GB”) to 1 terabyte (“TB”), nominal
    rotation speeds of 5,400, 7,200 and 10,000 revolutions per
    minute (“RPM”), and offer interfaces including both
    Enhanced Integrated Drive Electronics (“EIDE”) and
    Serial Advanced Technology Attachment (“SATA”). We
    also embed our hard drives into WD-branded external storage
    appliances that utilize interfaces such as USB 2.0, external
    SATA,
    FireWire

tm

and Ethernet network connections. In addition, we recently
    announced a family of hard drives specifically designed to
    consume substantially less power than previous designs.

We manufacture hard drives and head stack assemblies
    (“HSAs”) in Malaysia and Thailand. We also design and
    manufacture a substantial portion of our required magnetic heads
    in California, and head gimbal assemblies (“HGAs”) in
    Thailand. Following our planned acquisition of Komag,
    Incorporated (“Komag”), a leading media manufacturer
    and one of our current suppliers, we will also design in
    California and manufacture in Malaysia most of our required
    media and substrates. For geographical financial data, see
    Part II, Item 8, Note 6 in the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K.

On June 28, 2007, we entered into a definitive agreement to
    acquire all the outstanding shares of Komag for a value of
    approximately $1.0 billion. The planned acquisition of
    Komag is intended to strengthen our production efficiencies and
    enhance our hard drive manufacturing process by integrating
    media. The planned acquisition is structured as a cash tender
    offer at $32.25 per share for all the outstanding shares of
    Komag common stock, followed by a merger of our indirect
    wholly-owned subsidiary into Komag in which the remaining
    shareholders of Komag will receive $32.25 in cash per share. The
    planned acquisition is expected to close in the third calendar
    quarter of 2007. We intend to fund the planned acquisition,
    including the expected repurchase of Komag’s convertible
    notes due 2014 and related fees and expenses, through a
    combination of cash and proceeds from a senior unsecured term
    bridge loan facility of up to $1.3 billion.

Business
    Strategy

Our business strategy is to provide a broad selection of
    reliable, high quality hard drives at a low total cost of
    ownership and with high efficiency. We believe this strategy
    helps accomplish the following:

•

distinguishes us in the dynamic and competitive hard drive
    industry;

•

provides great value to our customers; and

•

allows us to better achieve consistent financial performance,
    including strong returns on invested capital.

We have designed our business strategy to accommodate
    significant unit and revenue growth with relatively small
    increases in operating expenses and to consistently achieve high
    asset utilization.



Industry

We develop and manufacture hard drives for the desktop, mobile
    PC, enterprise, CE and branded product retail markets. We
    believe that growth in the sales of hard drives has outpaced
    growth in the sales of all PCs over the past five years. Based
    on industry data, in calendar 2001 there were approximately 50%
    more hard drives sold in the market than PCs. In contrast, in
    calendar 2006 there were approximately 79% more hard drives sold
    in the market than PCs. We believe the following factors
    primarily drive this accelerating growth of hard drive sales in
    addition to PC applications:

•

consumer use of hard drives for the playing, retention, and
    creation of digital content for personal use in the rapidly
    growing CE market;

•

growth of the external hard drive or branded products market,
    permitting the easy storage, portability and backup of data such
    as music, or digital photographs and video;

•

increased use of multiple hard drives in PCs for data backup and
    expanded storage capacity; and

•

increased use of multiple cost-optimized high performance hard
    drives in data-intensive applications such as Internet search
    engines.

Additionally, we believe that the demand for 2.5-inch hard
    drives has grown from approximately 16% of the overall hard
    drive market in calendar 2003 to 34% of the overall hard drive
    market in calendar 2006.

These factors and our product expansion strategy in the last
    three years have gradually increased our percentage of revenue
    derived from non-desktop sources. In 2007, 57% of our revenue
    was from desktop computers and 43% was from non-desktop sources,
    compared to 71% of our revenue from desktop computers and 29%
    from non-desktop sources in 2006.

For further discussion of the risks of the hard drive industry,
    please see Item 1A of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Desktop
    Market

The desktop market consists of the overall hard drive market for
    desktop computers. Individuals use desktop computers in homes,
    businesses and multi-user networks. Desktop computers use
    software applications for word processing, spreadsheet, desktop
    publishing, database management, multimedia, entertainment and
    for other needs. Hard drives store desktop computer operating
    system and application software, as well as the data used by the
    applications.

We believe that the demand for hard drives in the desktop market
    has grown in part due to:

•

the overall growth of desktop computer sales;

•

the increasing needs of businesses and individuals for increased
    storage capacity on their desktop computers;

•

the continuing development of software applications to manage
    multimedia content; and

•

the increasing use of broadband Internet, including content
    downloaded from the Internet onto desktop computer hard drives.

We believe several other factors affect the rate of desktop
    computer unit growth, including maturing desktop markets in
    North America and Western Europe, an increase in first-time
    buyers of desktop computers in Asia, Eastern Europe and
    Latin America, and the lengthening of desktop computer
    replacement cycles.

Mobile PC
    Market

The mobile PC market consists primarily of notebook computers.
    Individuals use notebook computers both in and away from homes
    and businesses. Like desktop computers, notebook computers use
    software applications for various needs and hard drives store
    notebook operating system and application software, and the data
    used by the applications.

We believe that the demand for hard drives in the mobile PC
    market has grown in part due to:

•

the overall growth of notebook sales;

•

the increased mobility of the workforce;



•

the increasing needs of businesses and individuals for increased
    storage capacity on their notebook computers;

•

the continuing development of software applications to manage
    multimedia content; and

•

the increasing use of broadband Internet, including content
    downloaded from the Internet onto notebook hard drives.

We expect the mobile PC market to continue to grow faster than
    the desktop or enterprise markets in the next three years. As
    the mobile PC market continues to evolve to a higher volume
    market, we believe customers are placing increased emphasis on
    attributes such as quality, reliability, execution, flexibility,
    and competitive cost structures of their hard drive suppliers.
    These are the same attributes that have mattered for many years
    to customers in the high-volume desktop market.

Enterprise
    Market

The enterprise market for hard drives includes workstations,
    servers, network attached storage, storage area networks, other
    computing systems or subsystems, and video surveillance.
    Historically, hard drives for this market have utilized several
    interfaces, including the Small Computer Systems Interface
    (“SCSI”) and Fibre Channel Arbitrated Loop
    (“FCAL”). Beginning in 2003, these traditional
    enterprise interfaces have been supplemented or have been
    replaced in certain storage applications by hard drives
    featuring the SATA interface technology, which is supported by
    industry standards, as well as by Serial Attached SCSI
    (“SAS”). SATA hard drives typically cost customers
    less than SCSI hard drives while offering higher capacities and
    maintaining similar reliability, scalability and performance.

We believe that enterprise uses of SATA hard drives will
    continue to increase. During the past few years a new disk-based

back-up

application has emerged with high-capacity SATA hard drives
    augmenting SCSI hard drives, tape and optical media. This new
    application, popularly referred to as “near-line”
    storage, has created a growth market because hard drives

back-up

or
    access data more quickly than tape or optical solutions, and
    quickly retrieve critical

back-up

or
    near-line data. The availability of SATA hard drive solutions,
    which are more cost effective than SCSI hard drives, promotes
    the increasing use of high-capacity hard drives in near-line
    storage applications. The low price per capacity of SATA drives
    has stimulated new applications such as video surveillance,
    video editing/broadcasting and medical imaging. These
    applications represent segments of a growing market for high
    capacity storage in non-computing imaging and multimedia
    professions.

Enterprise-class SATA drives are becoming commonplace for
    IT infrastructure applications such as databases, scientific
    computing, web content, web caching, web search engines and
    electronic mail. These applications have become an important
    market for high-capacity SATA hard drives. We believe that this
    market will consume a growing portion of the highest capacity
    hard drives in the next three years.

SAS is the next generation SCSI technology and is expected to
    replace SCSI drives over the next few years. SATA technology is
    compatible with SAS technology, enabling customers the
    flexibility of incorporating SATA hard drives in SAS storage
    systems. We believe the market transition from SCSI to SAS will
    add to the growth of the enterprise-class SATA market,
    which currently is estimated to be more than 30% of the
    enterprise hard drive market.

High-performance applications such as blade servers are
    increasingly using 2.5-inch form factor hard drives, supplanting
    traditional 3.5-inch drives. Smaller form factors enable more
    drives per physical space for increased performance, high
    capacity per square foot and low power consumption. This trend
    demonstrates the fragmentation of the enterprise hard drive
    market and the need for application-specific enterprise-class
    hard drives.

Consumer
    Electronics Market

The use of hard drives in CE products has been a major growth
    area in recent years. Currently, the three largest segments of
    this market are:

•

video content in applications such as DVRs;

•

audio and video content in applications such as consumer
    handheld devices, including MP3 players; and

•

hard drives in game consoles.



Since 1999, DVRs have been available for use in home
    entertainment systems and they offer enhanced capabilities such
    as pausing live television, simplifying the process of
    recording, cataloging recorded television programs and quickly
    forwarding or returning to any section of a recorded television
    program. Additionally, digital video disk (“DVD”)
    recorders increasingly incorporate hard drives to allow for DVR
    functionality and faster recording of content onto removable
    DVDs. The market for these products favors larger capacity hard
    drives and continues to grow in Japan, North America, and
    Europe. Additionally, the rest of Asia Pacific shows strong
    interest in this market. We believe growth in this market will
    continue to build demand for higher capacity hard drives.

The proliferation in the CE market of more sophisticated mobile
    devices including cell phones and MP3 players is driving the
    delivery of diverse content from hard drive intensive hosts. We
    believe this is one of the factors influencing increased sales
    of enterprise-class SATA drives. We also believe that
    multimedia handheld devices such video cameras and
    high-resolution still cameras are enabling consumer production
    of expansive digital content that requires increasing amounts of
    small form-factor hard drive storage.

Hard drives with 1.8-inch or 1.0-inch form factors primarily
    address the consumer handheld device and portable external
    storage markets. The majority of hard drives used in portable
    media players that play both digital audio and video content are
    1.8-inch form factors. Currently, we believe the markets for
    these handheld devices are better served by flash memory as
    opposed to rotating magnetic storage.

External
    Hard Drive Market

Most new PC systems include high-speed external interfaces, such
    as USB 2.0, external SATA,
    FireWire

tm

or Ethernet network connections that permit users to supplement
    the storage space of their PC systems or home and small office
    networks with the use of external hard drives. Users store
    additional programs or multimedia content, and back up internal
    hard drives with external hard drives, as well as mobile
    external hard drives for mobility convenience. Although external
    hard drives are a small part of the overall hard drive market,
    we believe that sales will continue to grow. External storage
    can often be the easiest, quickest or only way of adding
    additional storage capacity to either a desktop or notebook
    computer. We believe there is an increasing consumer awareness
    of the need and value of securely storing personal digital
    content through backup applications and devices. In addition,
    there is opportunity for external storage as a way of expanding
    storage capacity in CE devices such as DVRs.

Other
    Market Opportunities

We regularly review opportunities to apply our knowledge of data
    storage technology to markets that we do not currently serve.
    Based on significant investments we made over the last four
    years, we believe we now have the technology building blocks to
    increase our overall market penetration and be a full-line hard
    drive supplier. Consistent with our measured and deliberate
    approach to new market entries in the recent past, our approach
    to additional new markets will be based on a careful assessment
    of the risks, rewards, requirements and profit potential of such
    actions.

Research
    and Development

We devote substantial resources to development of new products
    and improvement of existing products. We focus our engineering
    efforts on coordinating our product design and manufacturing
    processes to bring our products to market in a cost-effective
    and timely manner. Research and development expenses totaled
    $306 million, $297 million and $240 million in
    2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.



For further discussion of risks related to our development of
    new products, see Item 1A of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Technology
    and Product Development

Hard drives record, store and retrieve digital
    data. Performance attributes of hard drives, such as their
    ability to access and transmit data and storage capacity, are
    currently better than removable or floppy disks, optical hard
    drives and tapes, and they are more cost effective than
    semiconductor technology. The primary measures of hard drive
    performance include:

•

“Acoustics” — which is the sound power
    emitted during hard drive operation, commonly expressed in
    decibels.

•

“Data transfer rate” — which is the
    sustained rate of data transfer to and from the disk, commonly
    expressed in megabits per second. One megabit equals one million
    bits.

•

“Seek time” — which is the time needed to
    position the heads over a selected track on the disk surface,
    commonly expressed in milliseconds.

•

“Spindle rotation speed” — which is the
    nominal rotation speed of the disks inside the hard drive,
    commonly expressed in RPM, revolutions per minute or latency.
    Spindle rotation speeds commonly stated as 5,400, 7,200 and
    10,000 RPM are sometimes approximations.

•

“Storage capacity” — which is the amount of
    data that can be stored on the hard drive, commonly expressed in
    GB or TB. As defined in the hard drive industry, one GB equals
    one billion bytes and one TB equals one trillion bytes. A byte
    is a digital character, typically comprised of eight bits. A bit
    is a binary digit, the smallest unit of information in a digital
    system.

All of our hard drive products employ similar technology. The
    main components of the hard drive are a head disk assembly and a
    printed circuit board. The head disk assembly includes heads,
    media (disks), head positioning mechanism (actuator) and spindle
    motor. A rigid base and top cover contain these components in a
    contamination-controlled environment. The printed circuit board
    includes both standard and custom integrated circuits, an
    interface connector to the host computer and a power connector.

One or more disks positioned around a motor-driven spindle hub
    that rotates the disks comprise the head disk assembly. A thin
    coating of magnetic materials applied to a smooth substrate make
    the disk. Each disk has a head suspended directly above it,
    which can read data from or write data to the spinning disk.

The integrated circuits on the printed circuit board typically
    include a drive interface and a controller. The drive interface
    receives instructions from the computer, while the controller
    directs the flow of data to or from the disks and controls the
    heads. The location of data on each disk is logically maintained
    in concentric tracks divided into sectors. The computer sends
    instructions to the controller to read data from or write data
    to the disks based on logical track and sector locations. Guided
    by instructions from the controller, the head stack assembly
    pivots and swings across the disk by a head actuator or motor
    until it reaches the selected track of a disk, where the data is
    recorded or retrieved.

Industry standard interfaces allow the hard drive to communicate
    with the computer. Currently, the primary interfaces for PCs are
    EIDE and SATA, and the primary interfaces for enterprise systems
    are SCSI, SATA, SAS and FCAL. As computer performance continues
    to improve, the hard drive will need to deliver information
    faster. We believe this will continue to drive the PC industry
    transition to higher speed interfaces, such as SATA, to handle
    the higher data transfer rates. We currently offer our WD
    Caviar

®

and WD
    Caviar

®

GreenPower

tm

(“GP”) drives with the SATA interface featuring
    capacities as large as 750 GB and 1 TB, respectively. We design
    these products for the PC, workstation, and external storage
    markets. We currently offer our WD
    Raptor

®

,
    a 10,000 RPM enterprise-class drive with the
    SATA interface, and the WD RE, 7,200 RPM drives
    manufactured to enterprise-class standards and available with a
    SATA interface.

The number of disks and each disk’s areal density, which is
    a measure of the amount of data that can be stored on the
    recording surface of the disk, determines storage capacity of
    the hard drive. The higher the areal density, the more
    information can be stored on a single platter. Achieving a given
    drive capacity requires fewer disks as the areal density
    increases, potentially reducing product costs over time through
    reduced component requirements. Beginning in June



2007, we began shipping 3.5-inch hard drives with 188 GB per
    platter areal density and 2.5-inch hard drives with 125 GB
    per platter areal density. In July 2007, we introduced the WD
    Cavier

®

GP 3.5-inch hard drive which has 250 GB per platter areal
    density.

Head technology is one of the variables affecting areal density.
    Historically, there have been rapid technological changes
    resulting in several generations of head technology in a
    relatively short time. However, in recent years the time has
    lengthened between changes in generations of head technology.
    The hard drive industry is in the midst of a transition from the
    use of giant magnetoresistive head technology for the head
    writer function to perpendicular recording (“PMR”)
    technology, which allows for significantly higher storage
    capacities. In addition, the industry is making the transition
    to tunnel injunctive magneto resistive (“TMR”)
    technology for the head reader function. We have essentially
    completed the transition to PMR and TMR in our 2.5-inch products
    and we are in the midst of these transitions in our 3.5-inch
    products.

The WD product line generally leverages a common platform for
    various products within product families with different
    capacities to serve differing market needs. This platform
    strategy results in commonality of components across different
    products within product families and, in some cases, across
    product families, which reduces exposure to changes in demand,
    facilitates inventory management and allows us to achieve lower
    costs through purchasing economies. This platform strategy also
    enables our customers to leverage their qualification efforts
    onto successive product models.

In addition to the development of hard drives, we invest
    considerable resources in the development of head technology
    used in the majority of our hard drive products and we
    anticipate investing considerable resources in the development
    of media technology following our planned acquisition of Komag.
    The design and manufacturing of WD heads consists of engineering
    and fabricating a read element for reading data from media, a
    write element for writing data to media, and slider. The slider
    functions like an airplane wing and allows the read and write
    elements to fly over the surface of media and to land, on either
    the media or a special ramp, when power is not applied to the
    hard drive.

Fiscal 2007 represented the fifth consecutive year of
    substantial growth in our research and development and capital
    spending to support our significant broadening of our product
    and technology portfolios. Over that five-year period, we have
    grown our investment spending over 270% from $170 million
    in fiscal 2002 to approximately $630 million in fiscal
    2007. As a result of this investment activity, we continue to
    expand our business beyond the desktop market into newer markets
    or markets in which we have not previously participated. Such
    investments have allowed us to execute against our strategic
    objective of revenue diversification to address the growth of
    new applications for hard drives and fast-growing new market
    opportunities.

We are currently expanding our existing head wafer fabrication
    facilities to accommodate our anticipated growth. The expansion
    will involve a process change to utilize 8.0-inch wafers from
    6.0-inch wafers and will cost an estimated $400 million in
    the fiscal 2008 to 2010 timeframe. This will be in addition to
    our ongoing capital expenditures for hard drive and head
    assembly, and our anticipated capital expenditures for media
    development and manufacturing following our planned acquisition
    of Komag.

For an additional discussion of risks related to technological
    innovations, see Item 1A of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Sales and
    Distribution

We sell our products globally to OEMs, ODMs, distributors and
    retailers. OEMs purchase our hard drives, either directly or
    through a contract manufacturer such as an ODM, and assemble
    them into the computer or other CE systems they build.
    Distributors typically sell our hard drives to non-direct
    customers such as small computer and CE manufacturers, dealers,
    systems integrators, online retailers and other resellers.
    Retailers typically sell our hard drive products directly to
    end-users through their storefront or online facilities.

Original
    Equipment Manufacturers

Sales to OEMs, which include sales through ODMs, accounted for
    48%, 54% and 58% of our revenue in 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. During 2007, our largest OEM customer was Dell.
    During 2007, 2006 and 2005, sales to Dell accounted for 10%,
    12%, and 16%, respectively, of our revenue. We believe that our
    success depends on our ability to maintain and improve our
    strong relationships with the leading OEMs.



OEMs evaluate and select their hard drive suppliers based on a
    number of factors, including quality and reliability, storage
    capacities, performance characteristics, price, service and
    support, ease of doing business, and the supplier’s
    long-term financial stability. They typically seek to qualify
    two or more providers for each generation of hard drives, and
    once an OEM has chosen its qualified hard drive vendors for a
    given product, it generally will purchase hard drives from those
    vendors for the life of that product. To achieve success with
    OEM qualifications, a hard drive supplier must consistently
    offer hard drives featuring leading technology, quality, and
    reliability at acceptable capacity per disk. Suppliers must
    quickly achieve volume production of each new generation of high
    quality and reliable hard drives, requiring access to flexible,
    high-capacity, high-quality manufacturing capabilities.

Many of our OEM customers utilize

just-in-time

inventory management processes or supply chain business models
    that combine “build-to-order,” in which they do not
    build until there is a firm order, and “contract
    manufacturing,” in which the OEM contracts assembly work to
    a contract manufacturer, such as an ODM, who purchases
    components and assembles the computer based on the OEM’s
    instructions. For certain OEMs, we maintain a base stock of
    finished goods inventory in facilities located near or adjacent
    to the OEM’s operations.

For an additional discussion of risks related to our need to
    adapt to our customers’ business models and maintain
    customer satisfaction, refer to Item 1A of this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K.

Distributors

We use a broad group of distributors to sell our products to
    non-direct customers such as small computer and CE
    manufacturers, dealers, systems integrators, online retailers
    and other resellers. Distributors accounted for approximately
    36%, 39% and 36% of our revenue for 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. Distributors generally enter into non-exclusive
    agreements for specific territories with us for the purchase and
    redistribution of our products in specific territories. We grant
    our distributors limited price protection rights.

Retailers

We sell our branded products directly to a select group of major
    retailers such as computer superstores, warehouse clubs, online
    retailers, and computer electronics stores, and authorize sales
    through distributors to smaller retailers. Retailers accounted
    for approximately 16%, 7% and 6% of our revenue for 2007, 2006
    and 2005, respectively. Our current retail customer base is
    primarily in the United States, Canada and Europe. The retail
    channel complements our other sales channels while helping to
    build brand awareness for WD and our products. Retailers supply
    end-users with products to upgrade their computers and
    externally store their data for backup or mobility purposes. We
    grant our retailers price protection and limited rights to
    return product on an inventory rotation basis. We also sell our
    branded products at our web site.

Sales and
    Marketing

We maintain sales offices in selected parts of the world
    including the major geographies of the Americas, Asia Pacific,
    Japan, Europe, and the Middle East. Our international sales,
    which include sales to foreign subsidiaries of
    U.S. companies but do not include sales to
    U.S. subsidiaries of foreign companies, represented 68%,
    68% and 65% of our revenue for 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. Sales to international customers may be subject to
    certain risks not normally encountered in domestic operations,
    including exposure to tariffs and various trade regulations. For
    further discussion regarding the risks related to sales to
    international customers, see Item 1A of this Annual Report
    on

Form 10-K.

For additional information concerning revenue recognition, sales
    by geographic region and significant customer information, see
    Part II, Item 8, Notes 1 and 6 of the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

We perform our marketing and advertising functions internally
    and through outside firms. We target advertising, worldwide
    packaging and marketing materials to various reseller and
    end-user categories. We utilize both consumer media and trade
    publications. We have programs under which we reimburse
    qualified distributors and retailers for certain marketing
    expenditures. We also maintain customer relationships by
    communicating with our resellers and providing end-users with
    information and support through our web site.



Competition

We compete primarily with manufacturers of hard drives for use
    in desktop, notebook, enterprise, CE and external storage
    products. Our competitors in the hard drive market include
    ExcelStor Technology, Fujitsu Limited, Hitachi Global Storage
    Technologies, Samsung Electronics Incorporated, Seagate
    Technology and Toshiba Corporation. In 2006, Seagate
    completed the acquisition of Maxtor Corporation which, at the
    time of the acquisition, was one of the hard drive
    industry’s four largest suppliers.

The hard drive industry is intensely competitive, with hard
    drive suppliers competing for sales to a limited number of major
    customers. Hard drives manufactured by different competitors are
    highly substitutable due to the industry mandate of technical
    form, fit and function standards. Hard drive manufacturers
    compete on the basis of product quality and reliability, storage
    capacity, unit price, product performance, production volume
    capabilities, delivery capability, leadership in time-to-market,
    time-to-volume and time-to-quality, service and support, and
    ease of doing business. The relative importance of these factors
    varies by customer and market. We believe that we are generally
    competitive in all of these factors.

We believe that there are no substantial barriers for existing
    competitors to offer competing products. Therefore, we believe
    that we cannot differentiate WD hard drive products solely on
    attributes such as storage capacity, buffer size or
    time-to-market. Accordingly, we differentiate WD by focusing on
    operational excellence, high product quality and reliability,
    and designing and incorporating into our hard drives desirable
    product performance attributes. Such performance attributes
    include seek times, data transfer rates, intelligent caching,
    failure prediction, remote diagnostics, acoustics, error
    recovery, low operating temperature, low power consumption and
    optimized streaming capabilities. In addition, we emphasize
    non-product related attributes, including rapid response to our
    customers. Rapid response requires accelerated design cycles,
    customer delivery, production flexibility and timely service and
    support, which contribute to customer satisfaction. We also rely
    on the strength of the WD brand name with value-added resellers,
    retailers and solution providers to whom we sell our hard drive
    products directly and indirectly. We believe that trust in a
    manufacturer’s reputation, its execution track record and
    the establishment of strategic relationships have become
    important factors in the selection of a hard drive, particularly
    in a rapidly changing technology environment.

Advances in magnetic, optical or other data storage technologies
    could result in competitive products with better performance or
    lower cost per unit of capacity than our products. High-speed
    semiconductor memory could compete with our hard drive products
    in the future. Semiconductor memory is much faster in some
    applications than magnetic hard drives, but currently is not
    competitive from a cost standpoint. Flash memory, a non-volatile
    semiconductor memory, is currently much more costly and, while
    it has higher “read” performance attributes than hard
    drives, it has lower “write” performance attributes.
    Flash memory could become competitive in the near future for
    applications requiring less storage capacity than that provided
    by hard drives. We believe that the traditional high-volume
    computing markets will remain the domain of 3.5-inch and
    2.5-inch hard drives based on the HDD industry’s attributes
    of reliability, availability and cost.

For an additional discussion of risks related to competition,
    see Item 1A of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Service
    and Warranty

We generally warrant our newly manufactured hard drives against
    defects in materials and workmanship from one to five years from
    the date of manufacture depending on the type of product. Our
    warranty obligation is generally limited to repair or
    replacement of the hard drive. We have engaged third parties in
    Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Germany, Hungary, India,
    Korea, Russia, Singapore, Thailand and the United Arab Emirates
    to provide various levels of testing, processing

and/or

recertification of returned hard drives for our customers. In
    addition, we process, test and recertify returned hard drives at
    our facility in the United States.

Manufacturing

We believe that we have significant know-how, unique product
    manufacturing processes, execution skills and human resources to
    continue to be successful and have the ability to grow, as
    necessary, our manufacturing operations. To be competitive, we
    must manufacture high quality hard drives with industry leading
    time-to-volume production at competitive unit costs. We strive
    to maintain manufacturing flexibility, high manufacturing
    yields, reliable products,



and high-quality components that we manufacture ourselves, while
    insisting that our suppliers provide high-quality components at
    competitive prices. The critical elements of our hard drive
    production are high volume, low cost assembly and testing, and
    establishment and maintenance of key supplier relationships. By
    establishing close relationships with our strategic component
    suppliers, we believe we access best-of-class manufacturing
    quality. In addition, we believe that our sourcing strategy
    currently enables us to have the business flexibility needed to
    select the highest quality low cost of ownership suppliers as
    product designs and technologies evolve.

Hard drive manufacturing is a complex process involving the
    assembly of precision components with narrow tolerances and
    thorough testing. The assembly process occurs in a “clean
    room” environment that demands skill in process engineering
    and efficient space utilization to control the operating costs
    of this manufacturing environment. Our clean room manufacturing
    process consists of modular production units, each of which
    contains a number of work cells.

We manufacture hard drives in Malaysia and Thailand. We
    continually evaluate our manufacturing processes in an effort to
    increase productivity, sustain and improve quality and decrease
    manufacturing costs. We continually evaluate which steps in the
    manufacturing process would benefit from automation and how
    automated manufacturing processes can improve productivity and
    reduce manufacturing costs.

In July 2003, we purchased substantially all of the assets of
    Read-Rite Corporation, formerly one of our suppliers of heads,
    including its wafer fabrication equipment in Fremont, California
    and its slider fabrication facility in Bang Pa-In, Thailand. We
    upgraded and enhanced these facilities to meet the demands of
    new technologies consistent with our hard drive production
    facilities. We use these facilities to design and manufacture a
    substantial portion of the heads, HGAs we include in the hard
    drives we manufacture.

We are currently expanding our head wafer manufacturing
    facilities in Fremont, California and expect to complete the
    expansion in calendar 2009, which will provide us with adequate
    wafer fabrication capacity for the foreseeable future.

Following our planned acquisition of Komag, we will also have
    media and substrate design and manufacturing facilities in
    Malaysia. We plan to use these facilities to design and
    manufacture most of the media and substrates that we use in our
    products.

For an additional discussion of risks related to manufacturing,
    see Item 1A of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Materials
    and Supplies

The following products are the major components currently used
    in the manufacture of our hard drives:

•

magnetic heads and media;

•

suspensions with related HGAs and head stack assemblies
    (“HSAs”);

•

spindle motors;

•

custom and standard electronics such as system on chips, memory,
    motor controllers,

pre-amps,

and printed circuit boards;

•

base and top covers; and

•

magnets and related voice coil motors.

We also use several other components in our hard drives such as
    seals, filters, plastic molded parts, capacitors, resistors,
    connectors, and cables.

We design and manufacture a substantial portion of the heads
    required for the hard drives we manufacture. We purchase a
    portion of these components from third party suppliers.
    Following our planned acquisition of Komag, we intend to follow
    a similar operational strategy of internally supplying the
    majority of our media and substrate requirements and purchasing
    the remainder from independent media suppliers.

We acquire all of the remaining components for our products from
    third party suppliers. We generally retain multiple suppliers
    for each of our component requirements but in some instances use
    sole sources for business reasons.



We sole-source some components, such as custom integrated
    circuit devices for certain products from suppliers like Marvell
    Technology, STMicroelectronics and Texas Instruments. Because of
    their custom nature, these products require significant
    design-in periods and long lead times. There has been a trend in
    integrated circuit design toward increased integration of
    various separate circuits. We expect this trend to continue in
    custom integrated circuits for hard drives.

For an additional discussion of risks related to our component
    supplies, see Item 1A of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Backlog

Historically, a substantial portion of our orders have been for
    shipments of hard drives within 30 to 60 days of the
    placement of the order. We generally negotiate pricing, order
    lead times, product support requirements and other terms and
    conditions before receiving a computer manufacturer’s first
    purchase order for a product. Customers’ purchase orders
    typically may be canceled with relatively short notice to us,
    with little or no cost to the customer, or modified by customers
    to provide for delivery at a later date. In addition, we make
    many of our sales to OEMs under

just-in-time

delivery contracts that do not generally require firm order
    commitments by the customer until the time of sale. Instead, we
    receive a periodic forecast of requirements from the customer
    and invoice the customer upon shipment of the product from the

just-in-time

warehouse. Therefore, backlog information as of the end of a
    particular period is not necessarily indicative of future levels
    of our revenue and profit and may not be comparable to earlier
    periods.

Patents,
    Licenses and Proprietary Information

We own numerous patents and have many patent applications in
    process. We believe that, although our patents and patent
    applications have considerable value, the successful
    manufacturing and marketing of our products depends primarily
    upon the technical and managerial competence of our staff.
    Accordingly, the patents held and applied for do not ensure our
    future success.

In addition to patent protection of certain intellectual
    property rights, we consider elements of our product designs and
    processes to be proprietary and confidential. We believe that
    our non-patented intellectual property, particularly some of our
    process technology, is an important factor in our success. We
    rely upon non-disclosure agreements and contractual provisions
    and a system of internal safeguards to protect our proprietary
    information. Despite these safeguards, there is a risk that
    competitors may obtain and use such information. The laws of
    foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business may provide
    less protection for confidential information than the United
    States.

We rely on certain technology that we license from other parties
    to manufacture and sell WD products. We believe that we have
    adequate cross-licenses and other agreements in place in
    addition to our own intellectual property portfolio to compete
    successfully in the hard drive industry. For additional
    discussion of risks related to our ownership and use of
    intellectual property, see Item 1A of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Environmental
    Regulation

We are subject to a variety of regulations in connection with
    our operations. We believe that we have obtained or are in the
    process of obtaining all necessary environmental permits for our
    operations. For additional discussion of risks related to
    environmental regulation, see Item 1A of this Annual Report
    on

Form 10-K.

Employees

As of June 29, 2007, we employed a total of
    29,572 employees worldwide. This represents an increase in
    headcount of approximately 20% since July 2, 2006 and an
    increase of approximately 28% since July 1, 2005. Many of
    our employees are highly skilled, and our continued success
    depends in part upon our ability to attract and retain such
    employees. Accordingly, we offer employee benefit programs,
    which we believe are, in the aggregate, competitive with those
    offered by our competitors. We and most of our competitors
    nevertheless have difficulty at times in hiring and retaining
    certain skilled employees. We have engaged consultants and
    contract personnel to fill these needs until full-time employees
    could be recruited. We consider our employee relations to be
    good.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

Declines
    in average selling prices (“ASPs”) in the hard drive
    industry adversely affect our operating results.

The hard drive industry historically has experienced declining
    ASPs. Our ASPs tend to decline when competitors lower prices as
    a result of decreased costs or to absorb excess capacity,
    liquidate excess inventories, restructure or attempt to gain
    market share. Our ASPs also decline when there is a shift in the
    mix of product sales, and sales of lower priced products
    increase relative to those of higher priced products. If ASPs in
    the hard drive industry continue to decline, then our ASPs will
    also likely decline, which would adversely affect our operating
    results.

If we
    fail to anticipate or timely respond to changes in the markets
    for hard drives, our operating results could be adversely
    affected.

Over the past few years the consumer market for computers has
    shifted significantly towards lower priced systems. If we are
    not able to continue to offer a competitively priced hard drive
    for the low-cost PC market, our share of that market will likely
    fall, which could harm our operating results.

The market for hard drives is also fragmenting into a variety of
    devices and products. Many industry analysts expect, as do we,
    that as content increasingly converts to digital technology from
    the older, analog technology, the technology of computers and
    consumer electronics will continue to converge, and hard drives
    will be found in many CE products other than computers. In
    addition, we expect that the consumer market for multi-media
    applications, including audio-video products, incorporating high
    capacity, and handheld consumer storage will continue to grow.
    However, because this market remains relatively new, accurate
    forecasts for future growth remain challenging.

Moreover, some devices, such as personal video recorders and
    digital video recorders, or some new PC operating systems which
    allow greater consumer choice in levels of functionality,
    therefore allowing for greater market differentiation, may
    require attributes not currently offered in our products,
    resulting in a need to expend capital to develop new interfaces,
    form factors, technical specifications or hard drive features,
    increasing our overall operational expense without corresponding
    incremental revenue at this stage. If we are not successful in
    continuing to deploy our hard drive technology and expertise to
    develop new products for the emerging CE market, or if we are
    required to incur significant costs in developing such products,
    it may harm our operating results.

Our
    prices and margins are subject to declines due to unpredictable
    end-user demand and oversupply of hard drives.

Demand for our hard drives depends on the demand for systems
    manufactured by our customers and on storage upgrades to
    existing systems. The demand for systems has been volatile in
    the past and often has had an exaggerated effect on the demand
    for hard drives in any given period. As a result, the hard drive
    market has experienced periods of excess capacity which can lead
    to liquidation of excess inventories and intense price
    competition. If intense price competition occurs, we may be
    forced to lower prices sooner and more than expected, which
    could result in lower revenue and gross margins.

Our
    failure to accurately forecast market and customer demand for
    our products could adversely affect our business and financial
    results.

The hard drive industry faces difficulties in accurately
    forecasting market and customer demand for its products. The
    variety and volume of products we manufacture is based in part
    on these forecasts. If our forecasts exceed actual market
    demand, or if market demand decreases significantly from our
    forecasts, then we could experience periods of product
    oversupply and price decreases, which could impact our financial
    performance. If our forecasts do not meet actual market demand,
    of if market demand increases significantly beyond our
    forecasts, then we may not be able to satisfy customer product
    needs, which could result in a loss of market share if our
    competitors are able to meet customer demands.

We also use forecasts in making decisions regarding investment
    of our resources. For example, as the hard drive industry
    transitions from the Parallel Advanced Technology Attachment
    (“PATA”) interface to the SATA interface, we may
    invest more resources in the development of products using the
    SATA interface. If our forecasts regarding the replacement of
    the PATA interface with the SATA interface are inaccurate, we
    may not have products available to meet our customers’
    needs.



In addition, although we receive forecasts from our customers,
    they are not obligated to purchase the forecasted amounts. In
    particular, sales volumes in the distribution channel are
    volatile and harder to predict than sales to our OEM or ODM
    customers. We consider these forecasts in determining our
    component needs and our inventory requirements. If we fail to
    accurately forecast our customers’ product demands, we may
    have inadequate or excess inventory of our products or
    components, which could adversely affect our operating results.

Increases
    in areal density may outpace customers’ demand for storage
    capacity, which may lower the prices our customers are willing
    to pay for new products.

Historically, the industry has experienced periods of variable
    areal density growth rates. When the rate of areal density
    growth increases, the rate of increase may exceed the increase
    in our customers’ demand for aggregate storage capacity.
    Furthermore, our customers’ demand for storage capacity may
    not continue to grow at current industry estimates as a result
    of developments in the regulation and enforcement of digital
    rights management or otherwise. These factors could lead to our
    customers’ storage capacity needs being satisfied with
    lower capacity hard drives at lower prices, thereby decreasing
    our revenue. As a result, even with increasing aggregate demand
    for storage capacity, our ASPs could decline, which could
    adversely affect our results of operations.

A low
    cost structure is critical to our operating results and
    increased costs may adversely affect our operating
    margin.

A low cost structure for our products, including critical
    components, labor and overhead, is critical to the success of
    our business and our operating results depend on our ability to
    maintain competitive cost structures on new and established
    products. If our competitors are able to achieve a lower cost
    structure for manufacturing hard drives, and we are unable to
    match their cost structure, we could be at a competitive
    disadvantage to those competitors.

Shortages
    of commodity materials, or use by other industries of materials
    used in the hard drive industry, may increase our cost
    structure.

There are costs for certain commodity materials, an increase in
    which increases our costs of manufacturing and transporting hard
    drives and key components. For example, shortages of materials
    such as steel, aluminum and precious metals increase our costs
    and may result in lower operating margins if we are unable to
    find ways to mitigate these increased costs. The variability in
    the cost of oil also affects our costs and may result in lower
    operating margins if we are unable to pass increased costs
    through to our customers.

Additionally, there are certain limited supply materials, such
    as raw materials like nickel and steel as well as metals like
    neodymium and ruthenium, which are used in the manufacturing of
    hard drive components. If other high volume industry demands for
    any of these materials increase, our costs may increase which
    could have an adverse affect on our operating margins.

Changes
    in product life cycles could adversely affect our financial
    results.

Product life cycles lengthened over the four years beginning in
    calendar year 2002 due in large part to a decrease in the rate
    of hard drive areal density growth. However, with the use of
    perpendicular recording in hard drives beginning in calendar
    year 2006, we anticipate that the life cycle of these products
    may shorten. If product life cycles lengthen, we may need to
    develop new technologies or programs to reduce our costs on any
    particular product to maintain competitive pricing for that
    product. This may result in an increase in our overall expenses
    and a decrease in our gross margins, both of which could
    adversely affect our operating results. If product life cycles
    shorten, it may be more difficult to recover the cost of product
    development before the product becomes obsolete. Our failure to
    recover the cost of product development in the future could
    adversely affect our operating results.

If we
    fail to make the technical innovations necessary to continue to
    increase areal density, we may fail to remain
    competitive.

New products in the hard drive market typically require higher
    areal densities than previous product generations, posing
    formidable technical and manufacturing challenges. Higher areal
    densities require existing head and media technology to be
    improved or new technology developed to accommodate more data on
    a single disk. In addition, our introduction of new products
    during a technology transition increases the likelihood of
    unexpected quality concerns. Our



failure to bring high quality new products to market on time and
    at acceptable costs may put us at a competitive disadvantage to
    companies that achieve these results.

A
    fundamental change in recording technology could result in
    significant increases in our operating expenses and could put us
    at a competitive disadvantage.

The industry is developing and now implementing new recording
    technologies that enable greater recording densities than
    currently available using magnetoresistive head technology,
    including perpendicular and tunneling junction technology, each
    of which represent a significant change in fundamental recording
    technology. This shift in technology is difficult to implement
    and historically, when the industry experiences a fundamental
    change in technology, any manufacturer that fails to
    successfully and timely adjust their designs and processes to
    accommodate the new technology, fails to remain competitive.

There are some technologies, such as current
    perpendicular-to-plane and heat assisted magnetic recording,
    that, if they can be implemented by a competitor on a
    commercially viable basis, will represent a revolutionary
    recording technology that could put us at a competitive
    disadvantage.

As a result of these technology shifts, we could incur
    substantial costs in developing new technologies, such as,
    heads, media, and tools to remain competitive. If we fail to
    successfully implement these new technologies, or if we are
    significantly slower than our competitors at implementing new
    technologies, we may not be able to offer products with
    capacities that our customers desire. For example, new recording
    technology requires changes in the manufacturing process of
    media, which may cause longer production times and reduce the
    overall availability of media in the industry. Additionally, the
    new technology requires a greater degree of integration between
    heads and media which may lengthen our time of development of
    hard drives using this technology. Furthermore, as we attempt to
    develop and implement new technologies, we may become more
    dependent on suppliers to ensure our access to components that
    accommodate the new technology. These results would increase our
    operating costs, which may negatively impact our operating
    results.

The
    difficulty of introducing hard drives with higher levels of
    areal density and the challenges of reducing other costs may
    impact our ability to achieve historical levels of cost
    reduction.

Storage capacity of the hard drive, as manufactured by us, is
    determined by the number of disks and each disk’s areal
    density. Areal density is a measure of the amount of magnetic
    bits that can be stored on the recording surface of the disk.
    Generally, the higher the areal density, the more information
    can be stored on a single platter. Historically, we have been
    able to achieve a large percentage of cost reduction through
    increases in areal density. Increases in areal density mean that
    the average drive we sell has fewer heads and disks for the same
    capacity and, therefore, may result in a lower component cost.
    However, because increasing areal density has become more
    difficult in the hard drive industry, such increases may require
    increases in component costs and other opportunities to reduce
    costs may not continue at historical rates. Additionally,
    increases in areal density may require us to make further
    capital expenditures on items such as new testing equipment
    needed as a result of an increased number of GB per platter. Our
    inability to achieve cost reductions could adversely affect our
    operating results.

If we
    fail to maintain effective relationships with our major
    component suppliers, our supply of critical components may be at
    risk and our profitability could suffer.

Under our business model, we do not manufacture many of the
    component parts used in our hard drives, however, for some of
    our product families, we do make most of our own heads, and we
    intend to make most of our own media following our planned
    acquisition of Komag. As a result, the success of our products
    depends on our ability to gain access to and integrate parts
    that are “best in class” from reliable component
    suppliers. To do so, we must effectively manage our
    relationships with our major component suppliers. We must also
    effectively integrate different products from a variety of
    suppliers, each of which employs variations on technology, which
    can impact, for example, feasible combinations of heads and
    media components. In August 2003, we settled litigation with a
    supplier who previously was the sole source of read channel
    devices for our hard drives. As a result of the disputes that
    gave rise to the litigation, our profitability was at risk until
    another supplier’s read channel devices could be designed
    into our products. Similar disputes with other strategic
    component suppliers could adversely affect our operating results.



Dependence
    on a limited number of qualified suppliers of components and
    manufacturing equipment could lead to delays, lost revenue or
    increased costs.

Certain components are available from a limited number of
    suppliers. Because we depend on a limited number of suppliers
    for certain hard drive components and manufacturing equipment,
    each of the following could significantly harm our operating
    results:

•

an increase in the cost of such components or equipment;

•

an extended shortage of required components or equipment;

•

consolidation of key suppliers, such as the acquisition of
    Brilliant Manufacturing Limited by Nidec Corporation, the
    acquisition of Agere Systems Inc. by LSI Logic Corporation, and
    the planned acquisition of Alps Electric Co. Ltd.’s
    magnetic device division’s assets and related intellectual
    property by TDK Corp;

•

failure of a key supplier’s business process; or

•

the failure of key suppliers to remain in business, to remain
    independent merchant suppliers, to adjust to market conditions,
    or to meet our quality, yield or production requirements.

Our future operating results may also depend substantially on
    our suppliers’ ability to timely qualify their components
    in our programs, and their ability to supply us with these
    components in sufficient volumes to meet our production
    requirements. A number of the components that we use are
    available from only a single or limited number of qualified
    outside suppliers, and may be used across multiple product
    lines. In addition, some of the components (or component types)
    used in our products are used in other devices, such as mobile
    telephones and digital cameras. If there is a significant
    simultaneous upswing in demand for such a component (or
    component type) from several high volume industries, resulting
    in a supply reduction, or a component is otherwise in short
    supply, or if a supplier fails to qualify or has a quality issue
    with a component, we may experience delays or increased costs in
    obtaining that component. For example, in the last year the hard
    drive industry faced a tightness in the availability of
    materials used in the manufacture of magnetic components, such
    as heads, media and magnets. If we are unable to obtain
    sufficient quantities of materials used in the manufacture of
    magnetic components, or other necessary components, we may
    experience production delays which could cause us loss of
    revenue. If a component becomes unavailable, we could suffer
    significant loss of revenue.

In addition, certain equipment we use in our manufacturing or
    testing processes is available only from a limited number of
    suppliers. Some of this equipment uses materials that at times
    could be in short supply. If these materials are not available,
    or are not available in the quantities we require for our
    manufacturing and testing processes, our ability to manufacture
    our products could be impacted, and we could suffer significant
    loss of revenue.

Contractual
    commitments with component suppliers may result in us paying
    increased charges and cash advances for such
    components.

To reduce the risk of component shortages, we attempt to provide
    significant lead times when buying components. As a result, we
    may be subject to cancellation charges if we cancel orders,
    which may occur when we make technology transitions or when our
    component needs change. In addition, we have entered into
    contractual commitments with component suppliers, such as
    suppliers of media, and may enter into contractual commitments
    with other component suppliers, in an effort to increase and
    stabilize the supply of those components, and enable us to
    purchase such components at favorable prices. Some of these
    commitments require or may require us to buy a substantial
    number of components from the supplier or make significant cash
    advances to the supplier, however these commitments may not
    result in a satisfactory increase or stabilization of the supply
    of such components.

Our
    high-volume hard drive manufacturing facilities, and the
    manufacturing facilities of many of our suppliers, are
    concentrated in Asia, and our planned media manufacturing
    facilities will be located in Asia, which subjects us to the
    risk of damage or loss of any of these facilities and localized
    risks to employees in these locations.

Our high-volume hard drive manufacturing facilities are in
    Malaysia and Thailand and the manufacturing facilities of many
    of our suppliers are in Asia. Following our planned acquisition
    of Komag, we will also have media and substrate manufacturing
    facilities in Malaysia. A condition or event such as political
    instability, civil unrest or a power outage, or a fire, flood,
    earthquake or other disaster that adversely affects any of these
    facilities or our ability to manufacture could



limit the total volume of hard drives we are able to manufacture
    and result in a loss of sales and revenue and harm our operating
    results. Similarly, a localized health risk affecting our
    employees or the staff of our suppliers, such as a new pandemic
    influenza in Asia, could impair the total volume of hard drives
    that we are able to manufacture.

Our head
    manufacturing operations include a single wafer fabrication
    facility in Fremont, California and a single head gimbal
    assembly facility in Bang Pa-In, Thailand, and our planned media
    operations will include four facilities in Malaysia, which
    subjects us to substantial risk of damage or loss if operations
    at either of these facilities are disrupted.

As we have previously discussed in public statements, our
    business plan presently contemplates that we plan to design and
    manufacture approximately 70% to 80% of the heads required for
    the hard drives we manufacture. We fabricate wafers in our
    Fremont, California facility, and the wafers are then sent to
    our Thailand facility for slider fabrication and wafer slicing
    and HGA assembly and testing. Additionally, following our
    planned acquisition of Komag, we will manufacture the majority
    of our media and substrates in Malaysia facilities. A fire,
    flood, earthquake or other disaster, condition or event such as
    a power outage that adversely affects our facilities in Fremont,
    California or Bang Pa-In, Thailand, or in Malaysia following our
    planned acquisition of Komag, would significantly affect supply
    of our heads or media, respectively, and limit our ability to
    manufacture hard drives which would result in a substantial loss
    of sales and revenue and a substantial harm to our operating
    results.

Following
    our planned acquisition of Komag, if we fail to successfully
    integrate Komag’s business into our operations in the
    expected time frame, or at all, it may adversely affect our
    future results.

We believe that our planned acquisition of Komag will result in
    certain benefits, including certain cost, operational and other
    efficiencies and synergies. The success of our planned
    acquisition will be dependent on our ability to realize the
    anticipated benefits from vertically integrating Komag’s
    business into our operations and Komag’s media technology
    with our head technology. Following the planned acquisition, we
    may fail to realize the anticipated benefits on a timely basis,
    or at all, for a variety of reasons, including the following:

•

potential incompatibility of Komag’s operating systems with
    our operating systems;

•

failure to integrate Komag’s media technology with our head
    technology, or failure to leverage such integration, quickly and
    effectively;

•

failure to successfully manage relationships with Komag’s
    suppliers;

•

failure to successfully manage relationships with Komag’s
    other customers and the possibility of unanticipated claims from
    such parties;

•

failure to successfully manage relationships with our other
    media suppliers;

•

potential difficulties integrating and harmonizing financial
    reporting systems; and

•

the loss of key employees.

If we are not able to successfully integrate Komag’s
    business and technology into our operations, the anticipated
    benefits and efficiencies of the planned acquisition may not be
    realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than
    expected, and our ability to compete, our profit margins and our
    results of operations may be adversely affected.

The
    successful completion of our planned acquisition of Komag is
    subject to risks and uncertainties and in the event we fail to
    complete the acquisition our stock price could suffer and our
    relationship with vendors and customers may be adversely
    impacted.

Our ability to complete the planned acquisition of Komag is
    subject to risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited
    to, the risk that a condition to closing of the transaction may
    not be satisfied and the risk that we fail to obtain the
    financing necessary to complete the transaction. There is also
    no assurance that an adequate number of Komag shares will be
    validly tendered, and not withdrawn, in the tender offer
    sufficient to satisfy our minimum tender offer condition. In the
    event that the tender offer or merger is not completed or is
    delayed, the current market price of our common stock may
    decline if based on an assumption that the merger will occur as
    contemplated during the third calendar quarter of 2007.
    Additionally, these uncertainties regarding the merger may
    adversely affect our relationships with our vendors and
    customers.



There are
    certain additional capital expenditure costs and asset
    utilization risks to our business associated with our strategy
    to vertically integrate our operations.

Our vertical integration of head manufacturing resulted in a
    fundamental change in our operating structure, as we now
    manufacture heads for use in many of the hard drives we
    manufacture. Similarly, our planned integration of Komag’s
    media business into our overall operations will allow us to
    manufacture media components to work with our heads.
    Consequently, we make more capital investments than we would if
    we were not vertically integrated and carry a higher percentage
    of fixed costs than assumed in our prior financial business
    model. If the overall level of production decreases for any
    reason, and we are unable to reduce our fixed costs to match
    sales, our head or planned media manufacturing assets may face
    under-utilization that may impact our results of operations. We
    are therefore subject to additional risks related to overall
    asset utilization, including the need to operate at high levels
    of utilization to drive competitive costs, and the need for
    assured supply of components that we do not manufacture
    ourselves.

In addition, we may incur additional risks, including:

•

if we are unable to manufacture a sufficient supply of heads, or
    media following our planned acquisition of Komag, there may be
    insufficient third party sources to satisfy our needs;

•

third party head or media suppliers may not continue to do
    business with us or may not do business with us on the same
    terms and conditions we have previously enjoyed;

•

claims that our manufacturing of heads, or media following our
    planned acquisition of Komag, may infringe certain intellectual
    property rights of other companies; and

•

difficulties locating in a timely manner suitable manufacturing
    equipment for our head or planned media manufacturing processes
    and replacement parts for such equipment.

If we do not adequately address the challenges related to our
    head or planned media manufacturing operations, our ongoing
    operations could be disrupted, resulting in a decrease in our
    revenue or profit margins and negatively impacting our operating
    results.

Our
    operating results will be adversely affected if we fail to
    optimize the overall quality, time-to-market and time-to-volume
    of new and established products.

To achieve consistent success with our customers, we must
    balance several key attributes such as time-to-market,
    time-to-volume, quality, cost, service, price and a broad
    product portfolio. If we fail to:

•

maintain overall quality of products on new and established
    programs;

•

produce sufficient quantities of products at the capacities our
    customers demand while managing the integration of new and
    established technologies;

•

develop and qualify new products that have changes in overall
    specifications or features that our customers may require for
    their business needs;

•

obtain commitments from our customers to qualify new products,
    redesigns of current products, or new components in our existing
    products;

•

qualify these products with key customers on a timely basis by
    meeting all of our customers’ needs for performance,
    quality and features;

•

maintain an adequate supply of components required to
    manufacture our products;

•

maintain the manufacturing capability to quickly change our
    product mix between different capacities, form factors and spin
    speeds in response to changes in customers’ product
    demands; or

•

consistently meet stated quality requirements on delivered
    products,

our operating results will be adversely affected.



If we are
    unable to timely and cost-effectively develop heads and media,
    following our planned acquisition of Komag, with leading
    technology and overall quality, our ability to sell our products
    may be significantly diminished, which could materially and
    adversely affect our business and financial results.

Under our business plan, we are developing and manufacturing a
    substantial portion of the heads used in some of the hard drives
    products we manufacture and, following our planned acquisition
    of Komag, we intend to develop and manufacture a substantial
    portion of the media used in some of the hard drive products we
    manufacture. Consequently, we are more dependent upon our own
    development and execution efforts and less able to take
    advantage of head technologies, and will be less able to take
    advantage of media technologies, developed by other
    manufacturers. Technology transition for head and media designs
    is critical to increasing our volume production of heads and
    media. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be
    successful in timely and cost-effectively developing and
    manufacturing heads or media for products using future
    technologies. We also may not effectively transition our head or
    planned media design and technology to achieve acceptable
    manufacturing yields using the technologies necessary to satisfy
    our customers’ product needs, or we may encounter quality
    problems with the heads we manufacture or media we plan to
    manufacture. In addition, we may not have access to external
    sources of supply without incurring substantial costs. For
    example, we recently began using perpendicular recording heads
    in certain of our products. We face various challenges in
    ramping the manufacturing volume of these products and if we do
    not adequately address these challenges, or if we encounter
    quality problems with the heads we manufacture or media we plan
    to manufacture for these products, our continued shipment of
    these products may be delayed, impairing our ability to realize
    revenue from these products.

Failure
    by certain suppliers to effectively and efficiently develop and
    manufacture components for our products may adversely affect our
    operations.

We rely on suppliers for various component parts that we
    integrate into our hard drives but do not manufacture ourselves,
    such as semiconductors, motors, flex circuits and suspensions.
    We are dependent on the suppliers of these various components to
    be able and willing to dedicate adequate engineering resources
    to develop technology that can be successfully integrated with
    our products, and to manufacture these components efficiently.
    The failure of component suppliers to effectively and
    efficiently develop and manufacture technology that can be
    integrated into our products may cause us to experience
    inability or delay in our manufacturing and shipment of hard
    drive products, or our expansion into new technology and
    markets, therefore adversely affecting our business and
    financial results.

If we
    fail to qualify our products with our customers, they may not
    purchase any units of a particular product line, which would
    have a significant adverse impact on our sales.

We regularly engage in new product qualification with our
    customers. Once a product is accepted for qualification testing,
    failures or delays in the qualification process can result in
    our losing sales to that customer until the next generation of
    products is introduced. The effect of missing a product
    qualification opportunity is magnified by the limited number of
    high volume OEMs, which continue to consolidate their share of
    the PC and CE markets. If product life cycles lengthen, we may
    have a significantly longer period to wait before we have an
    opportunity to qualify a new product with a customer, which
    could harm our competitive position. These risks are increased
    because we expect cost improvements and competitive pressures to
    result in declining gross margins on our current generation
    products.

We are
    subject to risks related to product defects, which could result
    in product recalls and could subject us to warranty claims in
    excess of our warranty provisions or which are greater than
    anticipated due to the unenforceability of liability
    limitations.

We warrant the majority of our products for periods of one to
    five years. We test our hard drives in our manufacturing
    facilities through a variety of means. However, there can be no
    assurance that our testing will reveal latent defects in our
    products, which may not become apparent until after the products
    have been sold into the market. Accordingly, there is a risk
    that product defects will occur, which could require a product
    recall. Product recalls can be expensive to implement and, if a
    product recall occurs during the product’s warranty period,
    we may be required to replace the defective product. In
    addition, a product recall may damage our relationship with our
    customers, and we may lose market share with our customers,
    including our OEM and ODM customers.

Our standard warranties contain limits on damages and exclusions
    of liability for consequential damages and for misuse, improper
    installation, alteration, accident or mishandling while in the
    possession of someone other than us. We



record an accrual for estimated warranty costs at the time
    revenue is recognized. We may incur additional operating
    expenses if our warranty provision does not reflect the actual
    cost of resolving issues related to defects in our products. If
    these additional expenses are significant, it could adversely
    affect our business, financial condition and results of
    operations.

Current
    or future competitors may gain a technology advantage or develop
    an advantageous cost structure that we cannot match.

It may be possible for our current or future competitors to gain
    an advantage in product technology, manufacturing technology, or
    process technology, which may allow them to offer products or
    services that have a significant advantage over the products and
    services that we offer. Advantages could be in capacity,
    performance, reliability, serviceability, or other attributes.

Higher capacity storage needs have typically been better served
    by magnetic hard drives than flash memory as hard drive
    manufacturers can offer better value at high capacities, while
    lower capacity needs have been successfully served by solid
    state storage such as flash memory technology. Advances in
    magnetic, optical, semiconductor or other data storage
    technologies could result in competitive products that have
    better performance or lower cost per unit of capacity than our
    products. If we fail to be cost competitive against flash
    memory, we could be at a competitive disadvantage to companies
    using semiconductor technology.

Further
    industry consolidation could provide competitive advantages to
    our competitors.

The hard drive industry has experienced consolidation over the
    past several years. Consolidation by our competitors may enhance
    their capacity, abilities and resources and lower their cost
    structure, causing us to be at a competitive disadvantage.
    Additionally, continued industry consolidation may lead to
    uncertainty in areas such as component availability, which could
    negatively impact our cost structure.

Sales in
    the distribution channel are important to our business, and if
    we fail to maintain brand preference with our distributors or if
    distribution markets for hard drives weaken, our operating
    results could suffer.

Our distribution customers typically sell to small computer
    manufacturers, dealers, systems integrators and other resellers.
    We face significant competition in this channel as a result of
    limited product qualification programs and a significant focus
    on price and availability of product. If we fail to remain
    competitive in terms of our technology, quality, service and
    support, our distribution customers may favor our competitors,
    and our operating results could suffer. We also face significant
    risk in the distribution market for hard drives. If the
    distribution market weakens as a result of a slowing PC growth
    rate, technology transitions or a significant change in consumer
    buying preference from white box to branded PCs, or we
    experience significant price declines due to oversupply in the
    distribution channel, then our operating results would be
    adversely affected.

The hard
    drive industry is highly competitive and can be characterized by
    significant shifts in market share among the major
    competitors.

The price of hard drives has fallen over time due to increases
    in supply, cost reductions, technological advances and price
    reductions by competitors seeking to liquidate excess
    inventories or attempting to gain market share. In addition,
    rapid technological changes often reduce the volume and
    profitability of sales of existing products and increase the
    risk of inventory obsolescence. We also face competition from
    other companies that produce alternative storage technologies
    like flash memory. These factors, taken together, may result in
    significant shifts in market share among the industry’s
    major participants. In addition, product recalls can lead to a
    loss of market share, which could adversely affect our operating
    results.

Some of
    our competitors with diversified business units outside the hard
    drive industry periodically sell disk drives at prices that we
    cannot profitably match.

Some of our competitors earn a significant portion of their
    revenue from business units outside the hard drive industry.
    Because they do not depend solely on sales of hard drives to
    achieve profitability, they periodically sell hard drives at
    lower prices and operate their hard drive business unit at a
    loss while still remaining profitable overall. In



addition, if these competitors can increase sales of non-hard
    drive products to the same customers, they may benefit from
    selling their hard drives at low prices. Our results of
    operations may be adversely affected if we can not successfully
    compete with the pricing by these companies.

If we do
    not successfully expand into new hard drive markets and manage
    the issues associated with new products and new markets, our
    business may suffer.

To remain a significant supplier of hard drives, we will need to
    offer a broad range of hard drive products to our customers. We
    currently offer a variety of 3.5-inch hard drives for the
    desktop, enterprise, CE and external storage markets, and we
    also offer 2.5-inch form factor hard drives for the mobile, CE
    and external storage markets. However, demand for hard drives
    may shift to products in smaller form factors, which our
    competitors may already offer. Expansion into other hard drive
    markets and resulting increases in volume capacity requirements
    may require us to make substantial additional capital
    investments due in part because our operations are vertically
    integrated.

While we continue to develop new products and look to expand
    into other hard drive markets, the success of our new product
    introductions is dependent on a number of factors, including our
    ability to anticipate and manage a variety of issues associated
    with these new products and new markets, such as difficulties
    faced in manufacturing ramp, market acceptance, effective
    management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product
    demand, quality problems or other defects in the early stages of
    new product introduction that were not anticipated in the design
    of those products, and higher return rates of external storage
    products due to more lenient return policies in the retail
    market. Further, we need to identify how any of the hard drive
    markets that we are expanding into may have different
    characteristics from the markets in which we currently exist,
    such as, demand volume growth rates, demand seasonality, product
    generations development rates, customer concentrations, and cost
    and performance requirements, and we must properly address these
    differences. If we fail to successfully develop and manufacture
    new products and expand into new hard drive markets, customers
    may decrease the amount of our products that they purchase, and
    we may lose business to our competitors who offer these products.

If we do
    not properly manage the technology transitions of our products,
    our operating results may be negatively affected.

Many of the markets in which we offer our products are
    undergoing technology transitions. For example, in order to
    handle higher data transfer rates, the PC and enterprise markets
    are transitioning from parallel interfaces, such as PATA and
    SCSI, to serial interfaces, such as SATA and SAS, respectively.
    We must effectively manage the transition of the features of our
    products to serial interfaces in order to remain competitive and
    cost effective. In the PC market, we currently offer PATA and
    SATA products and must timely and efficiently manage both our
    manufacture of PATA products through their end of life and our
    ramp of SATA products and features. If we fail to successfully
    manage the transition from parallel interfaces to serial
    interfaces, our operating results may suffer.

Expanding
    into new hard drive markets exposes our business to different
    seasonal demand cycles, which in turn could adversely affect our
    operating results.

The CE and retail markets have different seasonal pricing and
    volume demand cycles as compared to the PC market. By expanding
    into these markets, we became exposed to seasonal fluctuations
    that are different from, and in addition to, those of the PC
    market. For example, because the primary customer for products
    such as our branded products are individual consumers, these
    markets experience a dramatic increase in demand during the
    winter holiday season. If we do not properly adjust our supply
    to new demand cycles such as this, we risk having excess
    inventory during periods of low demand and insufficient
    inventory during periods of high demand, therefore adversely
    affecting our operating results.

If we do
    not successfully continue to expand into the mobile market, or
    if we do not accurately predict the growth and demands of the
    mobile market, our business may suffer.

We began shipping 2.5-inch form factor hard drives for the
    mobile market during calendar year 2004. If we are unable to
    successfully continue to expand into the mobile market, we would
    have a competitive disadvantage to companies that are successful
    in this regard, and our business and financial results could
    suffer. To increase the sale of our products in the mobile
    market, we must adapt to the differences between the desktop and
    mobile markets, such as different requirements, features and
    competitors. In addition, if we continue to incur significant
    costs in manufacturing



and selling the 2.5-inch hard drives, and if we are unable to
    recover those costs from sales of the products, then we may not
    be able to compete successfully in this market and our operating
    results may suffer.

Furthermore, if we do not accurately predict the future growth
    and demands of the mobile market, our business may suffer. For
    example, if the volume demand of the PC market shifts from
    desktop computers to notebook computers at a faster rate than we
    anticipate, we would be at a more significant competitive
    disadvantage to companies who have been more successful in the
    mobile market.

Selling
    to the retail market has become an important part of our
    business, and if we fail to maintain and grow our market share
    or gain market acceptance of our branded products, our operating
    results could suffer.

We sell our branded products directly to a select group of major
    retailers, for example, computer superstores and CE stores, and
    authorize sales through distributors to other retailers and
    online resellers. Our current retail customer base is primarily
    in the United States, Canada and Europe. We are facing increased
    competition from other companies for shelf space at a small
    number of major retailers that have strong buying power and
    pricing leverage. If we fail to successfully maintain a customer
    preference for Western Digital brand products or fail to
    successfully expand into multiple channels, our operating
    results may be adversely affected. We face strong competition in
    maintaining and trying to grow our market share in the retail
    market, particularly because of the relatively low barriers to
    entry in this market. We will continue to introduce new products
    in the retail market that incorporate our disk drives, however
    there can be no assurance that these products will gain market
    acceptance, and if they do not, our operating results could
    suffer.

Loss of
    market share with or by a key customer could harm our operating
    results.

During 2007, a large percentage of our revenue came from sales
    to our top 10 customers, which accounted for 47% of our revenue.
    One of these customers, Dell, accounted for more than 10% of our
    revenue. These customers have a variety of suppliers to choose
    from and therefore can make substantial demands on us, including
    demands on product pricing and on contractual terms, which often
    results in the allocation of risk to us as the supplier. Even if
    we successfully qualify a product with a customer, the customer
    generally is not obligated to purchase any minimum volume of
    products from us and may be able to cancel an order or terminate
    its relationship with us at any time. Our ability to maintain
    strong relationships with our principal customers is essential
    to our future performance. If we lose a key customer, if any of
    our key customers reduce their orders of our products or require
    us to reduce our prices before we are able to reduce costs, if a
    customer is acquired by one of our competitors or if a key
    customer suffers financial hardship then our operating results
    would likely be harmed. In addition, if customer pressures
    require us to reduce our pricing such that our gross margins are
    diminished, we could decide not to sell our products to a
    particular customer, which could result in a decrease in our
    revenue.

We may be
    unable to retain our key staff and skilled employees.

Our success depends upon the continued contributions of our key
    staff and skilled employees, many of whom would be extremely
    difficult to replace. Worldwide competition for skilled
    employees in the hard drive industry is intense. Volatility or
    lack of positive performance in our stock price may adversely
    affect our ability to retain key staff or skilled employees who
    have received equity compensation. If we are unable to retain
    our existing key staff or skilled employees, or hire and
    integrate new key staff or skilled employees, or if we fail to
    implement succession plans for our key staff, our operating
    results would likely be harmed.

Manufacturing
    and marketing our products abroad subjects us to numerous
    risks.

We are subject to risks associated with our foreign
    manufacturing operations and foreign marketing efforts,
    including:

•

obtaining requisite United States of America and foreign
    governmental permits and approvals;

•

currency exchange rate fluctuations or restrictions;

•

political instability and civil unrest;

•

limited transportation availability, delays, and extended time
    required for shipping, which risks may be compounded in periods
    of price declines;



•

higher freight rates;

•

labor problems;

•

trade restrictions or higher tariffs;

•

exchange, currency and tax controls and reallocations;

•

increasing labor and overhead costs; and

•

loss or non-renewal of favorable tax treatment under agreements
    or treaties with foreign tax authorities.

While neither the 2006 Thai coup d’état nor terrorist
    bombings in Bangkok had any appreciable impact on our
    manufacturing operations, these events illustrate the risks
    associated with our foreign manufacturing operations and foreign
    marketing efforts and the importance to our business of
    stability in the countries in which we operate.

Terrorist
    attacks may adversely affect our business and operating
    results.

The continued threat of terrorist activity and other acts of war
    or hostility have created uncertainty in the financial and
    insurance markets and have significantly increased the
    political, economic and social instability in some of the
    geographic areas in which we operate. Additionally, it is
    uncertain what impact the reactions to such acts by various
    governmental agencies and security regulators worldwide will
    have on shipping costs. Acts of terrorism, either domestically
    or abroad, could create further uncertainties and instability.
    To the extent this results in disruption or delays of our
    manufacturing capabilities or shipments of our products, our
    business, operating results and financial condition could be
    adversely affected.

Sudden
    disruptions to the availability of freight lanes could have an
    impact on our operations.

We ship the majority of our products to our various customers
    via air freight. The sudden unavailability of air cargo
    operations used to ship our products would impair our ability to
    deliver our products in a timely and efficient manner, which
    could adversely impact our operating results. We also ship our
    product via ocean freight, and events or conditions at shipping
    ports, such as labor difficulties or disputes, could also impact
    our operating results by impairing our ability to timely and
    efficiently deliver these products.

We face
    litigation risks relating to our historical stock option grants
    that could have a material adverse effect on the operation of
    our business.

Several purported derivative actions were filed nominally on our
    behalf against certain of our current and former directors and
    officers in connection with our historical stock option granting
    practices. See Part I, Item 3, “Legal
    Proceedings” for a more detailed description of these
    proceedings. We are and may in the future be subject to other
    litigation or government investigations arising in connection
    with such option practices. These proceedings may be
    time-consuming, expensive and disruptive to normal business
    operations, and the outcome of any such proceeding is difficult
    to predict. The defense of such lawsuits or investigations could
    result in significant expense and the diversion of our
    management’s time and attention from the operation of our
    business, which could impede our ability to achieve our business
    objectives. Some or all of the amount we may be required to pay
    to defend or to satisfy a judgment or settlement of any or all
    of these proceedings may not be covered by insurance.

Under indemnification agreements we have entered into with our
    current and former officers and directors, we are required to
    indemnify them, and advance expenses to them, in connection with
    their participation in proceedings arising out of their service
    to us. These payments may be material.

The
    nature of our business and our reliance on intellectual property
    and other proprietary information subjects us to the risk of
    significant litigation.

The hard drive industry has been characterized by significant
    litigation. This includes litigation relating to patent and
    other intellectual property rights, product liability claims and
    other types of litigation. Litigation can be expensive, lengthy
    and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the
    results of litigation are inherently uncertain and may



result in adverse rulings or decisions. We may enter into
    settlements or be subject to judgments that may, individually or
    in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our
    business, financial condition or results of operations.

We evaluate notices of alleged patent infringement and notices
    of patents from patent holders that we receive from time to
    time. If claims or actions are asserted against us, we may be
    required to obtain a license or cross-license, modify our
    existing technology or design a new non-infringing technology.
    Such licenses or design modifications can be extremely costly.
    In addition, we may decide to settle a claim or action against
    us, which settlement could be costly. We may also be liable for
    any past infringement. If there is an adverse ruling against us
    in an infringement lawsuit, an injunction could be issued
    barring production or sale of any infringing product. It could
    also result in a damage award equal to a reasonable royalty or
    lost profits or, if there is a finding of willful infringement,
    treble damages. Any of these results would increase our costs
    and harm our operating results.

Our
    reliance on intellectual property and other proprietary
    information subjects us to the risk that these key ingredients
    of our business could be copied by competitors.

Our success depends, in significant part, on the proprietary
    nature of our technology, including non-patentable intellectual
    property such as our process technology. Despite safeguards, to
    the extent that a competitor is able to reproduce or otherwise
    capitalize on our technology, it may be difficult, expensive or
    impossible for us to obtain necessary legal protection. Also,
    the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our
    intellectual property to the same extent as do the laws of the
    United States. In addition to patent protection of intellectual
    property rights, we consider elements of our product designs and
    processes to be proprietary and confidential. We rely upon
    employee, consultant and vendor non-disclosure agreements and
    contractual provisions and a system of internal safeguards to
    protect our proprietary information. However, any of our
    registered or unregistered intellectual property rights may be
    challenged or exploited by others in the industry, which might
    harm our operating results.

Environmental
    regulation costs could harm our operating results.

We may be subject to various state, federal and international
    laws and regulations governing the environment, including those
    restricting the presence of certain substances in electronic
    products and making producers of those products financially
    responsible for the collection, treatment, recycling and
    disposal of certain products. Such laws and regulations have
    been passed in several jurisdictions in which we operate,
    including various European Union member countries. For example,
    the European Union has enacted the Restriction of the Use of
    Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic
    Equipment (“RoHS”) and the Waste Electrical and
    Electronic Equipment (“WEEE”) directives. RoHS
    prohibits the use of certain substances, including lead, in
    certain products, including hard drives, put on the market after
    July 1, 2006. The WEEE directive obligates parties that
    place electrical and electronic equipment onto the market in the
    EU to put a clearly identifiable mark on the equipment, register
    with and report to EU member countries regarding distribution of
    the equipment, and provide a mechanism to take-back and properly
    dispose of the equipment. There is still some uncertainty in
    certain EU countries as to which party involved in the
    manufacture, distribution and sale of electronic equipment will
    be ultimately responsible for registration, reporting and
    disposal. Similar legislation may be enacted in other locations
    where we manufacture or sell our products, such as Asia. We will
    need to ensure that we comply with such laws and regulations as
    they are enacted, and that our component suppliers also timely
    comply with such laws and regulations. If we fail to timely
    comply with the legislation, our customers may refuse to
    purchase our products, which would have a materially adverse
    effect on our business, financial condition and results of
    operations.

In connection with our compliance with such environmental laws
    and regulations, we could incur substantial costs and be subject
    to disruptions to our operations and logistics. In addition, if
    we were found to be in violation of these laws, we could be
    subject to governmental fines and liability to our customers. If
    we have to make significant capital expenditures to comply with
    environmental laws, or if we are subject to significant expenses
    in connection with a violation of these laws, our financial
    condition or operating results could suffer.

Fluctuations
    in currency exchange rates as a result of our international
    operations may negatively affect our operating
    results.

Because we manufacture our products abroad, our operating costs
    are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
    Further fluctuations in the exchange rate of the Thai Baht and
    of the Malaysian Ringgit may negatively impact our operating
    results.



The Thai Baht is a free floating currency while the Malaysian
    Ringgit exchange rate policy is one of a managed float. We have
    attempted to manage the impact of foreign currency exchange rate
    changes by, among other things, entering into short-term,
    forward contracts. However, these contracts do not cover our
    full exposure and can be canceled by the issuer if currency
    controls are put in place. Currently, we hedge the Thai Baht,
    Malaysian Ringgit, Euro and British Pound Sterling with forward
    contracts.

If the U.S. dollar exhibits sustained weakness against most
    foreign currencies, the U.S. dollar equivalents of unhedged
    manufacturing costs could increase because a significant portion
    of our production costs are foreign-currency denominated.
    Conversely, there would not be an offsetting impact to revenues
    since revenues are substantially U.S. dollar denominated.

Increases
    in our customers’ credit risk could result in credit losses
    and an increase in our operating costs.

Some of our OEM customers have adopted a subcontractor model
    that requires us to contract directly with companies, such as
    ODMs, that provide manufacturing services to our OEM customers.
    Because these subcontractors are generally not as well
    capitalized as our direct OEM customers, this subcontractor
    model exposes us to increased credit risks. Our agreements with
    our OEM customers may not permit us to increase our product
    prices to alleviate this increased credit risk. Additionally, as
    we attempt to expand our OEM and distribution channel sales into
    emerging economies such as Brazil, Russia, India and China, the
    customers in these regions may have relatively short operating
    histories, making it more difficult for us to accurately access
    the associated credit risks. Any credit losses we may suffer as
    a result of these increased risks, or as a result of credit
    losses from any significant customer, would increase our
    operating costs, which may negatively impact our operating
    results.

Inaccurate
    projections of demand for our product can cause large
    fluctuations in our quarterly results.

We often ship a high percentage of our total quarterly sales in
    the third month of the quarter, which makes it difficult for us
    to forecast our financial results before the end of the quarter.
    In addition, our quarterly projections and results may be
    subject to significant fluctuations as a result of a number of
    other factors including:

•

the timing of orders from and shipment of products to major
    customers;

•

our product mix;

•

changes in the prices of our products;

•

manufacturing delays or interruptions;

•

acceptance by customers of competing products in lieu of our
    products;

•

variations in the cost of components for our products;

•

limited availability of components that we obtain from a single
    or a limited number of suppliers;

•

competition and consolidation in the data storage industry;

•

seasonal and other fluctuations in demand for PCs often due to
    technological advances; and

•

availability and rates of transportation.

Rapidly
    changing conditions in the hard drive industry make it difficult
    to predict actual results.

We have made and continue to make a number of estimates and
    assumptions relating to our consolidated financial reporting.
    The highly technical nature of our products and the rapidly
    changing market conditions with which we deal means that actual
    results may differ significantly from our estimates and
    assumptions. These changes have impacted our financial results
    in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Key
    estimates and assumptions for us include:

•

accruals for warranty costs related to product defects;

•

price protection adjustments and other sales promotions and
    allowances on products sold to retailers, resellers and
    distributors;



•

inventory adjustments for write-down of inventories to lower of
    cost or market value (net realizable value);

•

reserves for doubtful accounts;

•

accruals for product returns;

•

accruals for litigation and other contingencies; and

•

reserves for deferred tax assets.

The
    market price of our common stock is volatile.

The market price of our common stock has been, and may continue
    to be, extremely volatile. Factors such as the following may
    significantly affect the market price of our common stock:

•

actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;

•

announcements of technological innovations by us or our
    competitors which may decrease the volume and profitability of
    sales of our existing products and increase the risk of
    inventory obsolescence;

•

new products introduced by us or our competitors;

•

periods of severe pricing pressures due to oversupply or price
    erosion resulting from competitive pressures or industry
    consolidation;

•

developments with respect to patents or proprietary rights;

•

conditions and trends in the hard drive, computer, data and
    content management, storage and communication
    industries; and

•

changes in financial estimates by securities analysts relating
    specifically to us or the hard drive industry in general.

In addition, general economic conditions may cause the stock
    market to experience extreme price and volume fluctuations from
    time to time that particularly affect the stock prices of many
    high technology companies. These fluctuations often appear to be
    unrelated to the operating performance of the companies.

Securities class action lawsuits are often brought against
    companies after periods of volatility in the market price of
    their securities. A number of such suits have been filed against
    us in the past, and should any new lawsuits be filed, such
    matters could result in substantial costs and a diversion of
    resources and management’s attention.

We may be
    unable to raise future capital through debt or equity
    financing.

Due to the risks described herein, in the future we may be
    unable to maintain adequate financial resources for capital
    expenditures, expansion or acquisition activity, working capital
    and research and development. If we decide to increase or
    accelerate our capital expenditures or research and development
    efforts, or if results of operations do not meet our
    expectations, we could require additional debt or equity
    financing. However, we cannot ensure that additional financing
    will be available to us or available on acceptable terms. An
    equity financing could also be dilutive to our existing
    stockholders.

If our
    internal controls are found to be ineffective, our financial
    results or our stock price may be adversely affected.

Our most recent evaluation resulted in our conclusion that as of
    June 29, 2007, in compliance with Section 404 of the
    Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, our internal controls over financial
    reporting were effective. We believe that we currently have
    adequate internal control procedures in place for future
    periods; however, if our internal controls are found to be
    ineffective, our financial results or our stock price may be
    adversely affected.

Our
    Company

We design, develop, manufacture and sell hard drives. A hard
    drive is a device that uses one or more rotating magnetic disks
    to store and allow fast access to data. Hard drives are key
    components of computers, including desktop and notebook
    computers (“PCs”), data storage subsystems and many
    consumer electronic (“CE”) devices.

We sell our products worldwide to original equipment
    manufacturers (“OEMs”) and original design
    manufactures (“ODMs”) for use in computer systems,
    subsystems or CE devices, and to distributors, resellers and
    retailers. Our hard drives are used in desktop computers,
    notebook computers, and enterprise applications such as servers,
    workstations, network attached storage, storage area networks
    and video surveillance equipment. Additionally, our hard drives
    are used in CE applications such as digital video recorders
    (“DVRs”), and satellite and cable set-top boxes
    (“STBs”). We also sell our hard drives as stand-alone
    storage products and integrate them into our own WD-branded
    external storage appliances for purposes such as personal data
    backup and portable or expanded storage of digital music,
    photography, video, and other data.



Hard drives provide non-volatile data storage, which means that
    the data remains present when power is no longer applied to the
    device. Our hard drives currently include 3.5-inch and 2.5-inch
    form factor drives, having capacities ranging from 40 gigabytes
    (“GB”) to 1 terabyte (“TB”), nominal
    rotation speeds of 5,400, 7,200 and 10,000 revolutions per
    minute (“RPM”), and offer interfaces including both
    Enhanced Integrated Drive Electronics (“EIDE”) and
    Serial Advanced Technology Attachment (“SATA”). We
    also embed our hard drives into WD-branded external storage
    appliances that utilize interfaces such as USB 2.0, external
    SATA,
    FireWire

tm

and Ethernet network connections. In addition, we recently
    announced a family of hard drives specifically designed to
    consume substantially less power than previous designs.

We manufacture hard drives and head stack assemblies
    (“HSAs”) in Malaysia and Thailand. We also design and
    manufacture a substantial portion of our required magnetic heads
    in California, and head gimbal assemblies (“HGAs”) in
    Thailand. Following our planned acquisition of Komag,
    Incorporated (“Komag”), a leading media manufacturer
    and one of our current suppliers, we will also design in
    California and manufacture in Malaysia most of our required
    media and substrates. For geographical financial data, see
    Part II, Item 8, Note 6 in the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K.

On June 28, 2007, we entered into a definitive agreement to
    acquire all the outstanding shares of Komag for a value of
    approximately $1.0 billion. The planned acquisition of
    Komag is intended to strengthen our production effeciencies and
    enhance our hard drive manufacturing process by integrating
    media. The planned acquisition is structured as a cash tender
    offer at $32.25 per share for all the outstanding shares of
    Komag common stock, followed by a merger of our indirect
    wholly-owned subsidiary into Komag in which the remaining
    shareholders of Komag will receive $32.25 in cash per share. The
    planned acquisition is expected to close in the third calendar
    quarter of 2007. We intend to fund the planned acquisition,
    including the expected repurchase of Komag’s convertible
    notes due 2014 and related fees and expenses, through a
    combination of cash and proceeds from a senior unsecured term
    bridge loan facility of up to $1.3 billion.

Results
    of Operations

Fiscal
    2007 Overview

In 2007, our net revenue increased by 26% to $5.5 billion
    on unit shipments of 97 million as compared to
    $4.3 billion and 73 million units, respectively, in
    2006. In 2007, 43% of our revenue was derived from non-desktop
    sources including CE products, enterprise applications, notebook
    computers and retail sales as compared to 29% in 2006. Gross
    margin percentage decreased to 16.5% from 19.1% in 2006.
    Operating income increased by $49 million to
    $415 million. As a percentage of net revenue, operating
    income was 7.6% in 2007 compared to 8.4% 2006. We generated
    $618 million in cash flow from operations in 2007 compared
    with $368 million in 2006, finishing the year with
    $907 million in cash and short-term investments, an
    increase of $208 million from the prior year. We utilized
    $73 million to repurchase 4 million shares of our
    common stock and $43 million to repay long-term debt.

Fiscal
    Year 2007 Compared to Fiscal Year 2006

Net Revenue.

Net revenue was $5.5 billion
    for 2007, an increase of 26% from 2006. Total unit shipments
    increased to 97 million as compared to 73 million for
    the prior year. This unit increase resulted from an increase in
    our desktop market share, stronger overall demand for hard
    drives in the desktop market and our increasing focus on the
    non-desktop market, including mobile, CE, enterprise and branded
    products. For example, we shipped 12 million drives to the
    mobile market in 2007 as compared to 5 million units in
    2006. Additionally, we shipped 10 million units to the DVR
    market in 2007 as compared to 7 million units in 2006. ASPs
    declined to $57 due to normal technology price declines and a
    more competitive pricing environment in the notebook, desktop,
    and consumer electronics markets. Changes in revenue by
    geography generally reflect overall market demand fluctuations
    for hard drives. Changes in revenue by channel are a result of
    increases in sales of branded products due to the growing
    worldwide acceptance of our WD My
    Book

tm

and WD
    Passport

®

external digital storage appliances.

Gross Margin.

Gross margin for 2007 was
    $900 million, an increase of $71 million, or 9% over
    the prior year. Gross margin percentage decreased to 16.5% in
    2007 from 19.1% in 2006. The factors contributing to this
    decrease include normal technology price declines and a more
    competitive pricing environment in the notebook, desktop, and
    consumer electronics markets. In addition, gross margin in 2006
    benefited from a more favorable supply/demand balance.

Operating Expenses.

Total operating expenses,
    consisting of research and development (“R&D”)
    and selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”)
    expenses decreased to 8.9% of net revenue in 2007 compared to
    10.7% in 2006. R&D expense was $306 million in 2007,
    an increase of $9 million, or 3% over the prior year. The
    increase in R&D expense was primarily related to the
    development of new product platforms in support of our entry
    into new markets and expenditures for advanced head
    technologies, partially offset by a decrease of $2 million
    in variable incentive compensation programs. SG&A expense
    was $179 million in 2007, an increase of $13 million,
    or 8% as compared to 2006. The increase in SG&A expense was
    primarily due to an increase of $19 million in stock based
    compensation expense and other long-term employee incentive
    programs, offset by a $5 million decrease in software
    write-offs that occurred in 2006.

Interest and Other Income.

Net interest and
    other income was $28 million and $16 million in 2007
    and 2006, respectively. This increase in net interest income was
    primarily due to higher average invested cash and short-term
    investment balances.



Income Tax Benefit.

Income tax benefit was
    $121 million and $13 million in 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. Tax benefit as a percentage of income before taxes
    was 27% and 3% for 2007 and 2006, respectively. Differences
    between the effective tax rates and the U.S. Federal
    statutory rate are primarily due to tax holidays and incentive
    programs and reductions to our valuation allowance for deferred
    tax assets. We have tax holidays in Malaysia and Thailand that
    expire at various times ranging from 2008 to 2022. In addition
    to the tax holidays, the tax provision was impacted by favorable
    adjustments to the company’s valuation allowance for
    deferred tax assets of $126 and $22 million in 2007 and
    2006, respectively. These adjustments were based upon
    determination that it was more likely than not that all or a
    portion of our deferred tax assets will be realized. In the
    fourth quarter of 2007, we reversed the remaining valuation
    allowance for our deferred tax assets based on the weight of
    available evidence including our history of cumulative pretax
    income and the increased likelihood of our ability to generate
    profits in the future. In 2006, we released a portion of the
    valuation allowance on deferred tax assets due to the difficulty
    at the time in accurately projecting income for periods of
    longer than two years given the cyclical nature of our industry.
    The realization of the deferred tax assets is primarily
    dependent on our ability to generate sufficient earnings in
    certain jurisdictions in future years. The amount of deferred
    tax assets considered realizable may increase or decrease in
    subsequent periods based on fluctuating industry or company
    conditions.

Fiscal
    Year 2006 Compared to Fiscal Year 2005

Net Revenue.

Net revenue was $4.3 billion
    for 2006, an increase of 19% from 2005. Total unit shipments
    increased to 73 million as compared to 61 million for
    the prior year. This unit increase resulted from an increase in
    our desktop market share, stronger overall demand for hard
    drives in the desktop market and our increasing focus on the
    non-desktop market, including mobile, CE and branded products.
    For example, we shipped 5 million drives to the mobile
    market in 2006 as compared to 1 million units in 2005.
    Additionally, we shipped 7 million units to the DVR market
    in 2006 as compared to 4 million units in 2005. ASPs
    remained at a relatively constant level of $59 due to an
    increase in the average storage capacity of hard drives sold
    offset by moderate price declines. Revenue contribution by
    geographic region for 2006 as compared to 2005 reflects our
    focus on revenue growth in emerging geographic markets,
    primarily in Asia. Changes in revenue by channel reflect overall
    market demand fluctuations for hard drives.

Gross Margin.

Gross margin for 2006 was
    $829 million, an increase of $239 million, or 41% over
    the prior year. Gross margin percentage increased to 19.1% in
    2006 from 16.2% in 2005. Gross margin in 2006 benefited from a
    more favorable supply/demand balance. In addition, gross margin
    was favorably impacted in 2006 by the following factors:
    1) manufacturing efficiencies, 2) lower customer
    returns resulting from ongoing quality improvements that
    favorably impacted warranty obligations, and 3) an increase
    in the average storage capacity of hard drives sold. Moderate
    price declines somewhat offset the favorable impact of the
    aforementioned factors. During 2006 and 2005, our warranty
    accrual for prior quarters’ shipments was favorably
    adjusted by approximately $30 million and $1 million,
    respectively, as a result of improvements in quality and
    customer return rates and their expected impact on future levels
    of customer returns under warranty.

Operating Expenses.

Total operating expenses,
    consisting of research and development (“R&D”)
    and selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”)
    expenses, were 10.7% of net revenue in 2006, as compared to
    10.9% in 2005. R&D expense was $297 million in 2006,
    an increase of $57 million, or 24% over the prior year. The
    increase in R&D expense was primarily related to the
    development of new product platforms in support of our entry
    into new markets, expenditures for advanced head technologies
    and an increase of $18 million in employee incentive
    compensation programs, of which $12 million related to the
    adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard
    (“SFAS”)

No. 123-R.

SG&A expense was $166 million in 2006, an increase of
    $11 million, or 7% as compared to 2005. This increase in
    SG&A expense was primarily due to an expansion of sales
    resources to support increasing desktop computer demand in
    certain geographic regions, the growing mobile and CE markets,
    an increase of $15 million in employee incentive
    compensation programs, of which $7 million related to the
    adoption of

SFAS No. 123-R,

and a $5 million software write-off. The 2005 fiscal period
    included a $19 million charge for the settlement of a
    patent infringement lawsuit.

Interest and Other Income.

Net interest and
    other income was $16 million and $5 million in 2006
    and 2005, respectively. This increase in net interest income was
    primarily due to higher average invested cash and short-term
    investment balances as well as increases in the rates of return
    on investments.



Income Tax Expense (Benefit).

Income tax
    (benefit) expense was $(13) million and $4 million in
    2006 and 2005, respectively. Tax (benefit) expense as a
    percentage of income before taxes was (3)% and 2% for 2006 and
    2005, respectively. Differences between the effective tax rates
    and the U.S. Federal statutory rate are primarily due to
    tax holidays in Malaysia and Thailand that expire at various
    times ranging from 2008 to 2022. In addition to the tax
    holidays, the tax provision for 2006 was favorably impacted by
    $22 million given the partial reduction of our valuation
    allowance on deferred tax assets upon determination that it was
    more likely than not that a portion of our deferred tax assets
    would be realized. The realization of the deferred tax assets is
    primarily dependent on our ability to generate sufficient
    earnings in certain jurisdictions in fiscal years 2007 and 2008.
    A two-year period was used due to the difficulty at the time in
    accurately projecting income for longer periods of time given
    the cyclical nature of our industry. The 2005 effective tax rate
    benefited by approximately 0.7% from the favorable resolution of
    certain tax contingencies.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

We ended 2007 with total cash, cash equivalents and short-term
    investments of $907 million, an increase of
    $208 million from June 30, 2006. Our investment policy
    is to manage our investment portfolio to preserve principal and
    liquidity while maximizing return through the full investment of
    available funds. A portion of our available funds is invested in
    auction rate securities, which are short-term investments in
    bonds with original maturities greater than 90 days. The
    following table summarizes the results of our statements of cash
    flows for the three years ended June 29, 2007:

Operating
    Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities during 2007 was
    $618 million as compared to $368 million during 2006
    and $421 million for 2005. Cash flow from operations
    consists of net income, adjusted for non-cash charges, plus or
    minus working capital changes. This represents our principal
    source of cash. Net cash used to fund working capital was
    $78 million for 2007 as compared to $207 million for
    2006 and net cash provided by changes in working capital of
    $89 million for 2005.

Our working capital requirements depend upon the effective
    management of our cash conversion cycle, which measures how
    quickly a company can convert its products into cash through
    sales. The following table summarizes the cash conversion cycle
    for the three years ended 2007:

The increase in the cash conversion cycle for 2007 was primarily
    due to our days sales outstanding (“DSOs”), which
    increased by six days from 2006. This increase was primarily due
    to the discontinuance of an early pay program with one of our
    larger customers and increasing sales to branded products’
    customers and other customers who have longer payment terms.



From time to time, we modify the timing of payments to our
    vendors. We make these modifications primarily to manage our
    vendor relationships and to manage our cash flows, including our
    cash balances. Generally, we make the payment modifications
    through negotiations with or by granting to or receiving from
    our vendors’ payment term accommodations.

Investing
    Activities

Net cash used in investing activities for 2007 was
    $383 million as compared to $303 million for 2006 and
    $274 million for 2005. During 2007, cash used in investing
    activities consisted of $324 million for capital
    expenditures and $59 million for short-term investments.
    During 2006, cash used in investing activities consisted of
    $268 million for capital expenditures and $35 million
    for short-term investments. The increase in capital expenditures
    in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily consists of equipment
    purchased to support our investments in advanced head
    technologies, new product platforms and capacity for our
    broadening and growing product portfolio. The increase in
    capital expenditures in 2006 compared to 2005 was primarily a
    result of assets purchased to upgrade our head manufacturing
    capabilities, increased desktop and mobile hard drive production
    capabilities and for the normal replacement of existing assets.
    Additionally, during 2006, we purchased our previously leased
    head wafer manufacturing facility in Fremont, California for
    $27 million. For 2008, we expect capital additions to be
    between $600 million and $650 million, of which
    approximately $200 million will be utilized for the
    expansion of our head wafer fabrication capacity. Depreciation
    and amortization for 2008 is expected to be between $270 and
    $290 million.

Financing
    Activities

Net cash used in financing activities for 2007 was
    $86 million as compared to net cash provided by financing
    activities of $1 million for 2006 and net cash used in
    financing activities of $7 million for 2005. The net cash
    used in financing activities in 2007 consisted of
    $73 million used for repurchases of our common stock and
    $43 million used for repayments of long-term debt, offset
    by $30 million received through the exercise of common
    stock options and our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The net cash
    provided by financing activities in 2006 consisted of
    $78 million received through the exercise of common stock
    options and our Employee Stock Purchase Plan, offset by
    $54 million used in repurchases of our common stock and
    $23 million used for repayments of long-term debt. The net
    cash used in financing activities in 2005 consisted of
    $45 million used for repurchases of our common stock and
    $20 million for debt repayments, offset by $58 million
    received upon issuance of common stock under employee plans.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

Other than facility and equipment lease commitments incurred in
    the normal course of business and certain indemnification
    provisions (see Capital Commitments below), we do not have any
    off-balance sheet financing arrangements or liabilities,
    guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interests in
    transferred assets, or any obligation arising out of a material
    variable interest in an unconsolidated entity. We do not have
    any majority-owned subsidiaries that are not included in the
    consolidated financial statements. Additionally, we do not have
    an interest in, or relationships with, any special-purpose
    entities.

These amounts do not reflect the reduction to commitments
    resulting from our planned acquisition of Komag.



In anticipation of our planned acquisition of Komag, we intend
    to fund the transaction, including the expected repurchase of
    Komag’s convertible notes due 2014 and related fees and
    expenses, through a combination of our cash and proceeds from a
    senior unsecured term bridge loan facility of up to
    $1.3 billion.

Long-Term
    Debt

We maintained a $125 million credit facility (“Senior
    Credit Facility”) with a termination date of
    September 20, 2009. The facility provided for a revolving
    credit line (subject to outstanding letters of credit and a
    borrowing base calculation) and a term loan. The term loan was
    paid in full as of March 30, 2007, a letter of termination
    was submitted for the Senior Credit Facility on
    June 28

th

,
    2007, and termination was finalized during the first quarter of
    2008.

Purchase
    Orders

In the normal course of business, we issue purchase orders to
    suppliers for the purchase of hard drive components used to
    manufacture our products. These purchase orders generally cover
    forecasted component supplies needed for production during the
    next quarter, are recorded as a liability upon receipt of the
    components, and generally may be changed or canceled at any time
    prior to shipment of the components. We may be obligated to pay
    for certain costs related to changes to, or cancellation of, a
    purchase order, such as costs incurred for raw materials or work
    in process.

We have entered into long-term purchase agreements with various
    component suppliers. The commitments are subject to minimum
    quality requirements. In addition, the dollar amount of the
    purchases may depend on the specific products ordered and future
    price negotiations. The estimated related minimum purchase
    requirements are included in “Purchase obligations” in
    the table above.

From time to time, we enter into other long-term purchase
    agreements for components with certain vendors. Generally,
    future purchases under these agreements are not fixed and
    determinable as they depend on our overall unit volume
    requirements and are contingent upon the prices, technology and
    quality of the supplier’s products remaining competitive.
    These arrangements are not included under “Purchase
    obligations” in the table above. Please see Item 1A of
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for a discussion of risks related to these commitments.

Forward
    Exchange Contracts

We purchase short-term, forward exchange contracts to hedge the
    impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain underlying
    assets, liabilities and commitments for operating expenses and
    product costs denominated in foreign currencies. See
    Part II, Item 7A, under the heading “Disclosure
    About Foreign Currency Risk,” for our current forward
    exchange contract commitments.

Indemnifications

In the ordinary course of business, we may provide
    indemnifications of varying scope and terms to customers,
    vendors, lessors, business partners and other parties with
    respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to,
    losses arising out of our breach of such agreements, services to
    be provided by us, or from intellectual property infringement
    claims made by third parties. In addition, we have entered into
    indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our
    officers that will require us, among other things, to indemnify
    them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of
    their status or service as directors or officers. We maintain
    director and officer insurance, which may cover certain
    liabilities arising from our obligation to indemnify our
    directors and officers in certain circumstances.

It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount
    under these indemnification agreements due to the limited
    history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and
    circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Such
    indemnification agreements may not be subject to maximum loss
    clauses. Historically, we have not incurred material costs as a
    result of obligations under these agreements.

Stock
    Repurchase Program

Our Board of Directors has authorized us to repurchase
    $250 million of our common stock in open market
    transactions. The term of the program is a five-year period from
    November 17, 2005 to November 17, 2010. We expect
    stock repurchases to be funded principally by operating cash
    flows. During 2007, we repurchased 4.0 million shares of



common stock at a total cost of $73 million. Subsequent to
    the end of 2007, we purchased 0.8 million shares for
    approximately $16 million. During 2006, we repurchased
    3.5 million shares of common stock at a total cost of
    $54 million. Since the inception of the program and through
    August 16, 2007, we have repurchased 15.1 million
    shares for a total cost of $204 million. Subject to any
    limitations that may be set forth in our proposed bridge loan
    facility to be entered into with our planned acquisition of
    Komag, we may continue to repurchase our stock as we deem
    appropriate and market conditions allow.

We believe our current cash, cash equivalents and short-term
    investments will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs
    through the foreseeable future. Our ability to sustain our
    working capital position is dependent upon a number of factors
    that we discuss in Item 1A of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Critical
    Accounting Policies

We have prepared the accompanying consolidated financial
    statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of the
    financial statements requires the use of judgment and estimates
    that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets,
    liabilities and shareholders’ equity. We have adopted
    accounting policies and practices that are generally accepted in
    the industry in which we operate. We believe the following are
    our most critical accounting policies that affect significant
    areas and involve judgment and estimates made by us. If these
    estimates differ significantly from actual results, the impact
    to the consolidated financial statements may be material.

Revenue
    and Accounts Receivable

In accordance with standard industry practice, we have
    agreements with resellers that provide limited price protection
    for inventories held by resellers at the time of published list
    price reductions and other incentive programs. In accordance
    with current accounting standards, we recognize revenue upon
    delivery to OEMs, ODMs and resellers and record a reduction to
    revenue for estimated price protection and other programs in
    effect until the resellers sell such inventory to their
    customers. We base these adjustments on anticipated price
    decreases during the reseller holding period, estimated amounts
    to be reimbursed to qualifying customers, as well as historical
    pricing information. If end-market demand for hard drives
    declines significantly, we may have to increase sell-through
    incentive payments to resellers, resulting in an increase in our
    allowances, which could adversely impact operating results.

We record an allowance for doubtful accounts by analyzing
    specific customer accounts and assessing the risk of loss based
    on insolvency, disputes or other collection issues. In addition,
    we routinely analyze the different receivable aging categories
    and establish reserves based on a combination of past due
    receivables and expected future losses based primarily on our
    historical levels of bad debt losses. If the financial condition
    of a significant customer deteriorates resulting in its
    inability to pay its accounts when due, or if our overall loss
    history changes significantly, an adjustment in our allowance
    for doubtful accounts would be required, which could affect
    operating results.

We establish provisions against revenue and cost of revenue for
    estimated sales returns in the same period that the related
    revenue is recognized. We base these provisions on existing
    product return notifications. If actual sales returns exceed
    expectations, an increase in the sales return accrual would be
    required, which could negatively affect operating results.

Warranty

We record an accrual for estimated warranty costs when revenue
    is recognized. We generally warrant our products for a period of
    one to five years. Our warranty provision considers estimated
    product failure rates and trends, estimated repair or
    replacement costs and estimated costs for customer compensatory
    claims related to product quality issues, if any. We use a
    statistical warranty tracking model to help with our estimates
    and we exercise judgment in determining the underlying
    estimates. Our statistical tracking model captures specific
    detail on hard drive reliability, such as factory test data,
    historical field return rates, and costs to repair by product
    type. If actual product return trends, costs to repair returned
    products or costs of customer compensatory claims differ
    significantly from our estimates, our future results of
    operations could be materially affected. Our judgment is subject
    to a greater degree of subjectivity with respect to newly
    introduced products because of limited field experience with
    those products upon which to base our warranty estimates. We
    review our warranty accrual quarterly for products shipped in
    prior periods and which are still under warranty. Any



changes in the estimates underlying the accrual may result in
    adjustments that impact current period gross margin and income.
    Such changes are generally a result of differences between
    forecasted and actual return rate experience and costs to
    repair. For a summary of historical changes in estimates related
    to pre-existing warranty provisions, refer to Part II,
    Item 8, Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements, included in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Inventory

We value inventories at the lower of cost

(first-in,

first-out basis) or net realizable value. We record inventory
    write-downs for the valuation of inventory at the lower of cost
    or net realizable value by analyzing market conditions and
    estimates of future sales prices as compared to inventory costs
    and inventory balances.

We evaluate inventory balances for excess quantities and
    obsolescence on a regular basis by analyzing estimated demand,
    inventory on hand, sales levels and other information, and
    reduce inventory balances to net realizable value for excess and
    obsolete inventory based on this analysis. Unanticipated changes
    in technology or customer demand could result in a decrease in
    demand for one or more of our products, which may require an
    increase in inventory balance adjustments that could negatively
    affect operating results.

Litigation
    and Other Contingencies

We apply SFAS No. 5, “Accounting for
    Contingencies,” to determine when and how much to accrue
    for and disclose related to legal and other contingencies.
    Accordingly, we disclose contingencies deemed to be reasonably
    possible and accrue loss contingencies when, in consultation
    with our legal advisors, we conclude that a loss is probable and
    reasonably estimable (Refer to Part II, Item 8,
    Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,
    included in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K).

The ability to predict the ultimate outcome of such matters
    involves judgments, estimates and inherent uncertainties. The
    actual outcome of such matters could differ materially from
    management’s estimates.

Income
    Taxes

We account for income taxes under the asset and liability
    method, which provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities
    be recognized for temporary differences between the financial
    reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities
    and expected benefits of utilizing net operating loss
    (“NOL”) and tax credit carryforwards. We record a
    valuation allowance where it is more likely than not that the
    deferred tax assets will not be realized. Each period we
    evaluate the need for a valuation allowance for our deferred tax
    assets and we adjust the valuation allowance so that we record
    net deferred tax assets only to the extent that we conclude it
    is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be
    realized.

We record estimated liabilities for tax uncertainties. To the
    extent a tax position does not meet a probable level of
    certainty, a liability is established based on the best estimate
    of the amount that will not be sustained. However, the actual
    liability in any such contingency may be materially different
    from our estimates, which could result in the need to record
    additional tax liabilities or potentially adjust previously
    recorded tax liabilities.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

We account for all stock-based compensation in accordance with
    the fair value recognition provisions of

SFAS No. 123-R,

“Share-Based Payment”. Under these provisions,
    stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date
    based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense
    over the vesting period. Under

SFAS No. 123-R,

we are required to use judgment in estimating the amount of
    stock-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. If actual
    forfeitures differ significantly from the original estimate,
    stock-based compensation expense and our results of operations
    could be materially impacted.

Prior to the adoption of

SFAS No. 123-R,

we accounted for stock-based employee compensation plans
    (including shares issued under our stock option plans and ESPP)
    in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion
    No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
    Employees” and its related interpretations (“APB
    No. 25”), and followed the pro forma net income, pro
    forma income per share, and stock-based compensation plan
    disclosure requirements set forth in SFAS No. 123,
    “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.” All other
    types of equity awards were previously accounted for in
    accordance with SFAS No. 123.



The fair values of all stock options granted on and subsequent
    to January 1, 2005, were estimated using a binomial model
    and the fair values of all options granted on and prior to
    December 31, 2004, and all ESPP shares were estimated using
    the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. Both the binomial
    and the Black-Scholes-Merton models require the input of highly
    subjective assumptions.

New
    Accounting Standards

In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48,
    “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an
    interpretation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes”
    (“FIN 48”). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting
    for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition
    threshold a tax position is required to meet before being
    recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 also
    provides guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification,
    interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods,
    disclosure and transition. The interpretation applies to all tax
    positions related to income taxes subject to
    SFAS No. 109. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal
    years beginning after December 15, 2006. Differences
    between the amounts recognized in the statements of financial
    position prior to the adoption of FIN 48 and the amounts
    reported after adoption should be accounted for as a
    cumulative-effect adjustment recorded to the beginning balance
    of retained earnings. We are currently evaluating the impact the
    adoption of FIN 48 will have on our consolidated financial
    statements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS 157”).
    SFAS 157 provides guidance for using fair value to measure
    assets and liabilities. It also responds to investors’
    requests for expanded information about the extent to which
    companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value, the
    information used to measure fair value, and the effect of fair
    value measurements on earnings. SFAS 157 applies whenever
    other standards require (or permit) assets or liabilities to be
    measured at fair value. The standard does not expand the use of
    fair value in any new circumstances, but provides clarification
    on acceptable fair valuation methods and applications.
    SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for
    fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim
    periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating
    the impact the adoption of SFAS 157 will have on our
    consolidated financial statements.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS Statement
    No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets
    and Financial Liabilities” (“SFAS 159”).
    SFAS 159 permits entities to choose to measure many
    financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value.
    Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value
    option has been elected are reported in earnings. SFAS 159
    is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15,
    2007. We are currently assessing the impact SFAS 159 will
    have on our consolidated financial statements.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Disclosure
    About Foreign Currency Risk

Although the majority of our transactions are in
    U.S. Dollars, some transactions are based in various
    foreign currencies. We purchase short-term, forward exchange
    contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency fluctuations
    on certain underlying assets, liabilities and commitments for
    operating expenses and product costs denominated in foreign
    currencies. The purpose of entering into these hedge
    transactions is to minimize the impact of foreign currency
    fluctuations on our results of operations. The contract maturity
    dates do not exceed six months. We do not purchase short-term
    forward exchange contracts for trading purposes. Currently, we
    focus on hedging our foreign currency risk related to Thai Baht,
    Malaysian Ringgit, Euro and British Pound Sterling. Thai Baht
    and Malaysian Ringgit contracts are designated as cash flow
    hedges. All other contracts are designated as fair value hedges.
    See Part II, Item 8, Note 1 in the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K.



As of June 29, 2007, we had outstanding the following

REPORT
    OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors

Western Digital Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Western Digital Corporation and subsidiaries as of June 29,
    2007 and June 30, 2006, and the related consolidated
    statements of income, shareholders’ equity and
    comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years in
    the three-year period ended June 29, 2007. In connection
    with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we
    have also audited the related financial statement schedule.
    These consolidated financial statements and financial statement
    schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
    management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
    consolidated financial statements and financial statement
    schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
    to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
    position of Western Digital Corporation and subsidiaries as of
    June 29, 2007 and June 30, 2006, and the results of
    their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in
    the three-year period ended June 29, 2007, in conformity
    with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also,
    in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
    considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
    statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material
    respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company has adopted the provisions of Statement
    of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R),
    “Share-Based Payment,” on July 2, 2005 and
    accordingly, has changed its method of accounting for
    share-based compensation.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of June 29, 2007, based on criteria
    established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated August 24,
    2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on management’s
    assessment of, and the effective operation of, internal control
    over financial reporting.

REPORT
    OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors

Western Digital Corporation:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
    accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A, that Western
    Digital Corporation and subsidiaries maintained effective
    internal control over financial reporting as of June 29,
    2007, based on criteria established in Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
    of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
    The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
    on management’s assessment and an opinion on the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
    management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
    such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
    circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
    basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Western
    Digital Corporation and subsidiaries maintained effective
    internal control over financial reporting as of June 29,
    2007, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
    the Treadway Commission (COSO). Also, in our opinion, Western
    Digital Corporation and subsidiaries maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of June 29, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
    of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Western Digital Corporation and
    subsidiaries as of June 29, 2007 and June 30, 2006,
    the related consolidated statements of income,
    shareholders’ equity and comprehensive income, and cash
    flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
    June 29, 2007, and the related financial statement
    schedule, and our report dated August 24, 2007 expressed an
    unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements
    and financial statement schedule.

WESTERN
    DIGITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1.

Organization
    and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Western Digital Corporation (the “Company” or
    “Western Digital” or “WD”) designs,
    develops, manufactures and sells hard drives. A hard drive is a
    device that stores data on one or more rotating magnetic disks
    to allow fast access to data. The Company’s hard drives are
    used in desktop computers, notebook computers, external storage
    devices, enterprise applications such as servers, workstations,
    network attached storage and storage area networks and in
    consumer electronics products such as personal/digital video
    recorders, satellite and cable set-top boxes and video game
    consoles. The Company sells its products worldwide to original
    equipment manufacturers and original design manufacturers for
    inclusion in computer systems or subsystems, and to
    distributors, resellers and retailers.

Western Digital has prepared its consolidated financial
    statements in accordance with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) and has adopted
    accounting policies and practices which are generally accepted
    in the industry in which it operates. The Company’s
    significant accounting policies are summarized below.

Fiscal
    Year

The Company has a 52 or 53-week fiscal year. The 2007, 2006 and
    2005 fiscal years, which ended on June 29, 2007,
    June 30, 2006 and July 1, 2005, respectively,
    consisted of 52 weeks each.

Basis of
    Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
    the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant
    intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
    consolidation. The accounts of foreign subsidiaries have been
    remeasured using the U.S. dollar as the functional
    currency. As such, gains or losses resulting from remeasurement
    of these accounts from local currencies into U.S. dollars
    are reflected in the results of operations. These gains and
    losses were immaterial to the consolidated financial statements.

Cash
    Equivalents

The Company’s cash equivalents represent highly liquid
    investments, primarily money market funds and commercial paper,
    with original maturities of three months or less.

Short-Term
    Investments

The Company’s short-term investments consist primarily of
    auction rate securities, which are short-term investments in
    bonds with original maturities greater than 90 days. The
    Company has classified these investments as “available for
    sale” securities under Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards (“SFAS”) No. 115 “Accounting for
    Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.” These
    investments are carried at fair value.

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts
    receivable, short-term investments, accounts payable and accrued
    expenses approximate fair value for all periods presented
    because of the short-term maturity of these assets and
    liabilities.

Concentration
    of Credit Risk

The Company designs, develops, manufactures and markets hard
    drives to computer manufacturers, resellers and retailers
    throughout the world. The Company performs ongoing credit
    evaluations of its customers’ financial condition and
    generally requires no collateral. The Company maintains
    allowances for potential credit losses, and such losses have
    historically been within management’s expectations. At any
    given point in time, the total amount outstanding from any one
    of a number of its customers may be individually significant to
    the Company’s financial results. At June 29, 2007 and
    June 30, 2006, the Company had reserves for potential
    credit losses of $5 million and $5 million,
    respectively, and net



WESTERN
    DIGITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

accounts receivable of $697 million and $481 million,
    respectively. The Company also has cash equivalent and
    short-term investment policies that limit the amount of credit
    exposure to any one financial institution or investment
    instrument and require that investments be made only with
    financial institutions or in investment instruments evaluated as
    highly credit-worthy.

Inventory
    Valuation

The Company values inventory at the lower of cost

(first-in,

first-out basis) or net realizable value. Inventory write-downs
    are recorded to reduce the carrying value of inventory to the
    lower of cost or net realizable value by analyzing market
    conditions and estimates of future sales prices as compared to
    inventory costs and inventory balances. The Company evaluates
    inventory balances for excess quantities and obsolescence on a
    regular basis by analyzing estimated demand, inventory on hand,
    sales levels and other information, and reduces inventory
    balances to net realizable value for excess and obsolete
    inventory based on this analysis.

Property
    and Equipment

The cost of property and equipment is depreciated over the
    estimated useful lives of the respective assets. The
    Company’s buildings are being depreciated over periods
    ranging from fifteen to thirty years. The majority of the
    Company’s equipment is being depreciated over periods of
    three to seven years. Depreciation is computed on a
    straight-line basis. Leasehold improvements are amortized over
    the lesser of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the
    related lease terms.

Intangible
    Assets

Intangible assets consist of purchased technology acquired in
    asset acquisitions. These assets are being amortized over a
    weighted average period of three years. During the fiscal years
    ended June 29, 2007, June 30, 2006 and July 1,
    2005, the Company recorded $3 million, $4 million and
    $14 million of amortization expense related to these
    intangible assets, respectively. Amortization expense for
    intangible assets is estimated to be $3 million in 2008.

Revenue
    Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with SEC Staff
    Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 104,
    “Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements.” Under
    SAB No. 104, revenue is recognized when the title and
    risk of loss have passed to the customer, there is persuasive
    evidence of an arrangement, delivery has occurred, or services
    have been rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable and
    collectibility is reasonably assured. The Company establishes
    provisions against revenue and cost of revenue for estimated
    sales returns in the same period that the related revenue is
    recognized based on existing product return notifications.

In accordance with standard industry practice, the Company has
    agreements with resellers that provide limited price protection
    for inventories held by resellers at the time of published list
    price reductions and other incentive programs. Either party may
    terminate these agreements upon written notice. In the event of
    termination, the Company may be obligated to repurchase a
    certain portion of the resellers’ inventory. The Company
    records a reduction to revenue for estimated price protection
    and other programs in effect until the resellers sell such
    inventory to their customers. These adjustments are based on
    anticipated price decreases during the reseller holding period,
    estimated amounts to be reimbursed to qualifying customers, as
    well as historical pricing information. If end-market demand for
    hard drives declines significantly, the Company may have to
    increase sell-through incentive payments to resellers, resulting
    in an increase in price protection allowances, which could
    adversely impact operating results. Net revenue recognized on
    sales to resellers was approximately $2.8 billion,
    $2.0 billion and $1.5 billion in 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. Repurchases of reseller inventory were not
    material in 2007, 2006 or 2005.

Western Digital establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts
    by analyzing specific customer accounts and assessing the risk
    of loss based on insolvency, disputes or other collection
    issues. In addition, the Company routinely



WESTERN
    DIGITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

analyzes the different receivable aging categories and its bad
    debt loss history and establishes reserves based on a
    combination of past due receivables and expected future losses
    based primarily on the Company’s historical levels of bad
    debt losses. If the financial condition of a significant
    customer deteriorates resulting in its inability to pay its
    accounts when due, or if the overall loss history of the Company
    changes significantly, an adjustment in the Company’s
    allowance for doubtful accounts would be required, which could
    affect operating results.

Warranty

The Company records an accrual for estimated warranty costs when
    revenue is recognized. The Company generally warrants its
    products for a period of one to five years. The warranty
    provision considers estimated product failure rates and trends,
    estimated repair or replacement costs and estimated costs for
    customer compensatory claims related to product quality issues,
    if any. A statistical warranty tracking model is used to help
    with estimates and assists in exercising judgment in determining
    the underlying estimates. The statistical tracking model
    captures specific detail on hard drive reliability, such as
    factory test data, historical field return rates, and costs to
    repair by product type. If actual product return trends, costs
    to repair returned products or costs of customer compensatory
    claims differ significantly from estimates, future results of
    operations could be materially affected. Management’s
    judgment is subject to a greater degree of subjectivity with
    respect to newly introduced products because of limited field
    experience with those products upon which to base warranty
    estimates. Management reviews the warranty accrual quarterly for
    products shipped in prior periods and which are still under
    warranty. Any changes in the estimates underlying the accrual
    may result in adjustments that impact current period gross
    margin and income. Such changes are generally a result of
    differences between forecasted and actual return rate experience
    and costs to repair.

Advertising
    Expense

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Selling, general and
    administrative expenses of the Company include advertising costs
    of $5 million, $6 million and $2 million in 2007,
    2006 and 2005, respectively.

Income
    Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and
    liability method, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities
    are recognized for temporary differences between the financial
    reporting basis and the tax basis of the assets and liabilities
    and expected benefits of utilizing net operating loss
    (“NOL”) carryforwards. The Company records a valuation
    allowance where it is more likely than not that the deferred tax
    assets will not be realized. Each period the Company evaluates
    the need for a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets
    and adjusts the valuation allowance so that the Company records
    net deferred tax assets only to the extent that it has concluded
    it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will
    be realized.

The Company records estimated liabilities for tax uncertainties.
    To the extent a tax position does not meet a probable level of
    certainty, a liability is established based on the best estimate
    of the amount that will not be sustained. However, the actual
    liability in any such contingency may be materially different
    from the estimates, which could result in the need to record
    additional tax liabilities or potentially adjust previously
    recorded tax liabilities.

Per Share
    Information

The Company computes basic income per share using the net income
    and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
    during the period. Diluted income per share is computed using
    the net income and the weighted average number of common shares
    and potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the
    period. Potentially dilutive common shares include outstanding
    employee stock options, employee stock purchase plan shares and
    restricted

“Share-Based Payment.” Under the fair value
    recognition provisions of

SFAS No. 123-R,

stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date
    based on the value of the award and is recognized on a
    straight-line basis as expense over the vesting period. Under

SFAS No. 123-R,

the Company is required to use judgment in estimating the amount
    of stock-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. If
    actual forfeitures differ significantly from the original
    estimate, stock-based compensation expense and the results of
    operations could be materially impacted.

Prior to the adoption of

SFAS No. 123-R,

the Company accounted for stock-based employee compensation
    plans (including shares or other equity instruments issued under
    its stock incentive plans and employee stock purchase plan) in
    accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
    “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” and its
    related interpretations (“APB No. 25”), and
    followed the pro forma net income, pro forma income per share,
    and stock-based compensation plan disclosure requirements set
    forth in SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for
    Stock-Based Compensation.”

The fair values of all stock options granted subsequent to
    January 1, 2005 were estimated using a binomial model and
    the fair values of all options granted prior to
    December 31, 2004 and all ESPP shares were estimated using
    the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. Both the binomial
    and the Black-Scholes-Merton models require the input of highly
    subjective assumptions.

Other
    Comprehensive Income

Other comprehensive income refers to revenue, expenses, gains
    and losses that are recorded as an element of shareholders’
    equity but are excluded from net income. The Company’s
    other comprehensive income is comprised of unrealized gains and
    losses on foreign currency contracts and marketable securities
    categorized as available for sale under SFAS No. 115.

Foreign
    Exchange Contracts

Although the majority of the Company’s transactions are in
    U.S. Dollars, some transactions are based in various
    foreign currencies. The Company purchases short-term, forward
    exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency
    fluctuations on certain underlying assets, liabilities and
    commitments for operating expenses and product costs denominated
    in foreign currencies. The contracts have maturity dates that do
    not exceed six months. The Company does not purchase short-term
    forward exchange contracts for trading purposes.

The Company applies the provisions of SFAS No. 133,
    “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities”, as amended, which establishes accounting and
    reporting standards for derivative instruments embedded in other
    contracts and for hedging activities. The Company had
    outstanding forward exchange contracts with commercial banks for
    Thai Baht, Malaysian Ringgit, British Pound Sterling and Euro
    with values of $493 million and $264 million at
    June 29, 2007 and June 30, 2006, respectively. Thai
    Baht and Malaysian Ringgit contracts are designated as cash flow
    hedges under SFAS No. 133. If the derivative is
    designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the
    change in fair value of the derivative is initially deferred in
    other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. These amounts are
    subsequently recognized into earnings when the underlying cash
    flow being hedged is recognized into earnings. Recognized gains
    and losses on foreign currency contracts entered into for
    factory related activities are reported in cost of revenues.
    Hedge effectiveness is measured by comparing the hedging
    instrument’s cumulative change in fair value from inception
    to maturity to the underlying exposure’s terminal value.
    The Company has determined that all of its hedging instruments
    for all years presented were effective as defined under
    SFAS No. 133.

All other contracts are related to international sales
    activities and are designated as fair value hedges. These
    contracts are not designated as hedging instruments under
    U.S. GAAP, and therefore, the change in the
    instrument’s fair value is recognized currently in earnings
    and is reported as a component of non-operating income. Changes
    in fair value on these contracts were not material to the
    consolidated financial statements for all years presented.

Use of
    Estimates

Company management has made estimates and assumptions relating
    to the reporting of certain assets and liabilities in conformity
    with generally accepted accounting principles. These estimates
    and assumptions have been applied using methodologies, which are
    consistent throughout the periods presented. However, actual
    results could differ from these estimates.

New
    Accounting Standards

In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48,
    “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an
    interpretation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes”
    (“FIN 48”). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting
    for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition
    threshold a tax position is required to meet before being
    recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 also
    provides guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification,
    interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods,
    disclosure and transition. The interpretation applies to all tax
    positions related to income taxes subject to
    SFAS No. 109. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal
    years beginning after December 15, 2006. Differences
    between the amounts recognized in the statements of financial
    position prior to the adoption of FIN 48 and the amounts
    reported after adoption should be accounted for as a
    cumulative-effect adjustment recorded to the beginning balance
    of retained earnings. The Company is currently evaluating the
    impact the adoption of FIN 48 will have on its consolidated
    financial statements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS 157”).
    SFAS 157 provides guidance for using fair value to measure
    assets and liabilities. It also responds to investors’
    requests for expanded information about the extent to which
    companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value, the
    information used to measure fair value, and the effect of fair
    value measurements on earnings. SFAS 157 applies whenever
    other standards require (or permit) assets or liabilities to be
    measured at fair value. The standard does not expand the use of
    fair value in any new circumstances, but provides clarification
    on acceptable fair valuation methods and applications.
    SFAS 157 is



WESTERN
    DIGITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
    beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods
    within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating
    the impact the adoption of SFAS 157 will have on its
    consolidated financial statements.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS Statement
    No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets
    and Financial Liabilities” (“SFAS 159”).
    SFAS 159 permits entities to choose to measure many
    financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value.
    Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value
    option has been elected are reported in earnings. SFAS 159
    is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15,
    2007. The Company is currently assessing the impact
    SFAS 159 will have on its consolidated financial statements.

Reclassifications

Certain prior years’ amounts have been reclassified to
    conform to the current year presentation. In addition, the
    current presentation within the consolidated statement of cash
    flows for capital expenditures has been corrected to reflect
    capital expenditures on a cash disbursements basis in accordance
    with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (“SFAS”) No. 95, “Statement of Cash
    Flows.” Previously, the Company presented capital
    expenditures on an incurred (accrual) basis. The comparative

Product
    Warranty Liability

The warranty provision considers estimated product failure rates
    and trends, estimated repair or replacement costs and estimated
    costs for customer compensatory claims related to product
    quality issues, if any. Management uses a statistical warranty
    tracking model to help estimate and exercise judgment in
    determining the underlying estimates. Management reviews the
    warranty accrual quarterly for products shipped in prior periods
    and which are still under warranty. Any changes in the estimates
    underlying the accrual may result in adjustments that impact
    current period gross margin and income. Such changes are
    generally a result of differences between forecasted and actual
    return rate experience and costs to repair. Changes in the
    warranty accrual for the years ended June 29, 2007,
    June 30, 2006 and July 1, 2005 were as follows (in

Long-term
    Purchase Agreements

The Company has entered into long-term purchase agreements with
    various component suppliers. The commitments depend on specific
    products ordered and may be subject to minimum quality
    requirements and future price negotiations. For 2008 and 2009,
    WD expects these commitments to total approximately
    $985 million and $754 million, respectively. In
    conjunction with these agreements, the Company has advanced
    approximately $99 million related to 2008 and 2009 purchase
    commitments, of which $63 million is included in advances
    to suppliers and $36 million is included in other long-term
    assets as of June 29, 2007. These amounts do not reflect
    the reduction in commitments resulting from the planned
    acquisition of Komag.

Note 5.

Legal
    Proceedings

In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to
    legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims. Although the
    ultimate aggregate amount of monetary liability or financial
    impact with respect to these matters is subject to many
    uncertainties and is therefore not predictable with assurance,
    management believes that any monetary liability or financial
    impact to the Company from these matters or the specified
    matters below, individually and in the aggregate, beyond that
    provided at June 29, 2007, would not be material to the
    Company’s financial condition. However, there can be no
    assurance with respect to such result, and monetary liability or
    financial impact to the Company from these legal proceedings,
    lawsuits and other claims could differ materially from those
    projected.

In June 1994, Papst Licensing (“Papst”) brought suit
    against the Company alleging infringement by the Company of five
    hard drive motor patents owned by Papst. In December 1994, Papst
    dismissed its case without prejudice. In July 2002, Papst filed
    a new complaint against the Company and several other defendants
    alleging infringement by the Company of seventeen of
    Papst’s patents related to hard drive motors that the
    Company purchased from motor vendors. Papst sought an injunction
    and damages. The Company filed an answer on September 4,
    2002, denying Papst’s complaint, and the lawsuit was
    subsequently stayed pending the outcome of certain other related
    litigation. On July 4, 2005, the Company entered into a
    Settlement and License Agreement with Papst. In connection with
    the settlement, the Company made a one-time payment of
    $24 million to Papst on July 29, 2005, of which
    $19 million represented a charge to selling, general and
    administrative expense for the Company’s 2005 fiscal fourth
    quarter ($5 million had been accrued

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

in a prior year). In exchange for the payment, Papst has
    dismissed with prejudice its lawsuit pending against the
    Company, granted the Company a fully-paid license to certain
    patents owned by Papst, and released the Company of all past,
    present and future claims alleging infringement by the Company
    of those Papst patents. The Settlement and License Agreement
    resolved all outstanding litigation between the two companies
    without any admission of infringement by the Company.

Since the Company’s announcement on July 27, 2006 that
    it was conducting a company-initiated, voluntary review of its
    historical stock option grants, several purported derivative
    actions were filed nominally on behalf of the Company against
    certain current and former directors and officers of the Company
    in the United States District Court for the Central District of
    California and the Superior Court of the State of California for
    the County of Orange. These complaints assert claims for
    violations of Sections 10(b), 14(a) and 20(a) of the
    Securities Exchange Act, accounting, breach of fiduciary duty

and/or

aiding and abetting, constructive fraud, waste of corporate
    assets, unjust enrichment, rescission, breach of contract,
    violation of the California Corporations Code, abuse of control,
    gross mismanagement, and constructive trust in connection with
    the Company’s option granting practices. The complaints
    seek unspecified monetary damages and other relief against the
    individual defendants and certain governance reforms affecting
    the Company. The Company is named solely as a nominal defendant
    in each action. The parties in the actions engaged in a
    voluntary mediation on June 6, 2007, and these discussions
    are continuing.

On January 22, 2007, StorMedia Texas LLC filed a complaint
    against the Company and several other companies, including other
    disk drive manufacturers, for patent infringement in the Eastern
    District of Texas alleging infringement of U.S. Patent
    No. 6,805,891. The Company served an answer to the
    complaint denying all material allegations and asserting
    affirmative defenses, and has also filed counterclaims against
    StorMedia. The Company intends to defend itself vigorously in
    this matter. As described elsewhere in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

the Company has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire
    Komag. Komag has provided its customers with certain contractual
    indemnification undertakings for patent infringement involving
    its products and Komag has received claims for reimbursement of
    legal defense costs from its customers related to the StorMedia
    patent infringement litigation. The Company is evaluating the
    position of Komag in relation to this litigation.

Shareholders’
    Equity

Stock
    Incentive Plans

The Company has four stock-based incentive plans (collectively
    referred to as the “Stock Plans”): The 2004 amended
    and restated Performance Incentive Plan, the Employee Stock
    Option Plan, the Broad-Based Stock Incentive Plan and the Stock
    Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors. Subsequent to the
    expiration of the Employee Stock Option Plan on
    November 10, 2004 and approval of the 2004 Performance
    Incentive Plan by the Company’s shareholders on
    November 18, 2004, no new awards are permitted under the
    Employee Stock Option Plan, the Broad-Based Stock Incentive Plan
    or the Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors
    (collectively referred to as the “Prior Stock Plans”).
    As of June 29, 2007, options to purchase 7.2 million
    shares of the Company’s common stock remain outstanding
    under the Prior Stock Plans, of which 6.2 million shares
    were exercisable and 0.1 million shares of restricted stock
    remain unvested. Options granted under the Prior Stock Plans
    vested over periods from one to four years. Options granted
    under the Prior Stock Plans expire either five or ten years from
    the date of grant.

In November 2004, the Company’s shareholders approved the
    2004 Performance Incentive Plan. Subsequently, in November 2005,
    the Company’s shareholders approved an authorization for an
    additional 13 million shares. The types of



WESTERN
    DIGITAL CORPORATION

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

awards that may be granted under the 2004 Performance Incentive
    Plan include stock options, stock appreciation rights,
    restricted stock, stock bonuses and other forms of awards
    granted or denominated in the Company’s common stock or
    units of the Company’s common stock, as well as certain
    cash bonus awards. Persons eligible to receive awards under the
    2004 Performance Incentive Plan include officers or employees of
    the Company or any of its subsidiaries, directors of the Company
    and certain consultants and advisors to the Company or any of
    its subsidiaries. The vesting of awards under the Performance
    Incentive Plan is determined at the date of grant. Each award
    expires on a date determined at the date of grant; however, the
    maximum term of options, stock appreciation rights and other
    rights to acquire common stock under the 2004 Performance
    Incentive Plan is ten years after the grant date of the award.

As of June 29, 2007, the maximum number of shares of the
    Company’s common stock that are authorized for award grants
    under the 2004 Performance Incentive Plan is 22.1 million
    shares. Any shares subject to awards under the prior stock plans
    that are cancelled, forfeited, or otherwise terminate without
    having vested or been exercised, as applicable, will become
    available for other award grants under the 2004 Performance
    Incentive Plan. The 2004 Performance Incentive Plan will
    terminate on September 21, 2014 unless terminated earlier
    by the Company’s Board of Directors.

Employee
    Stock Purchase Plan

During 2006, the Company adopted the Western Digital Corporation
    2005 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) whereby
    eligible employees may authorize payroll deductions of up to 10%
    of their eligible compensation to purchase shares of the
    Company’s common stock at 95% of the fair market value of
    common stock on either the date of grant or on the exercise
    date, whichever is less. The date of grant of each offering
    period is June 1st or December 1st, except for
    the initial offering period, which began on December 15,
    2005. Each offering period is 24 months and consists of
    four exercise dates. If the fair market value of the common
    stock is less on a given exercise date than on the date of
    grant, employee participation in that offering period is
    terminated and re-enrollment in the new offering period occurs
    automatically. The Company’s ESPP operates in accordance
    with Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. The 1993
    Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which was previously suspended by
    the Board of Directors, terminated upon stockholder approval of
    the 2005 ESPP.

Stock-Based
    Compensation Expense

Effective July 2, 2005, the Company adopted Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004),
    “Share-Based Payment”

(“SFAS No. 123-R”)

using the modified prospective method.

SFAS No. 123-R

establishes the financial accounting and reporting standards for
    stock-based compensation plans. As required by

SFAS No. 123-R,

the Company recognized the cost resulting from all share-based
    payment transactions including shares issued under the
    Company’s stock option plans and employee stock purchase
    plans in the financial statements. During the fiscal year ended
    June 29, 2007, the Company expensed $18 million
    related to stock-based compensation from stock options and ESPP
    shares. At June 29, 2007, total compensation cost related
    to unvested stock options granted to employees and ESPP shares,
    but not yet recognized, was $26 million and will be
    amortized on a straight-line basis over a weighted average
    period of approximately 2.2 years.

Pro forma
    Information for Periods Prior to the Adoption of

SFAS No. 123-R

Prior to July 2, 2005, the Company accounted for
    stock-based employee compensation plans (including shares issued
    under the Company’s stock option plans and ESPP) in
    accordance with APB No. 25 and followed the pro forma net
    income, pro forma income per share, and stock-based compensation
    plan disclosure requirements set forth in the Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, “Accounting

    that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable.
    For stock options granted January 1, 2005 through
    July 1, 2005, the 2005 pro forma income per share
    information is estimated using a binomial model. Both the
    Black-Scholes-Merton and the binomial option pricing models
    require the input of highly subjective assumptions such as the
    expected stock price volatility and expected employee exercise
    behavior. The resulting fair value of employee stock options is
    amortized on a straight-line basis over the service period of
    the options.

The aggregate intrinsic value is calculated as the difference
    between the exercise price of the underlying awards and the
    quoted price of the Company’s common stock for those awards
    that have an exercise price currently below the quoted price. As
    of June 29, 2007, the Company had options outstanding to
    purchase an aggregate of 8.5 million shares with an
    exercise price below the quoted price of the Company’s
    stock resulting in an aggregate intrinsic value of
    $86 million. During the years ended June 29, 2007 and
    June 30, 2006, the aggregate intrinsic value of options
    exercised under the Company’s stock option plans was
    $30 million and $84 million, respectively, determined
    as of the date of exercise.

Deferred
    Stock Compensation

The Company granted approximately 1.8 million,
    2.0 million and 1.6 million shares of restricted stock
    during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The restricted stock
    vests annually over periods from one to five years. The
    aggregate market value of the restricted stock at the date of
    issuance was $36 million, $27 million and
    $17 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. These
    amounts have been recorded as deferred compensation and are
    being amortized to operating expense over the corresponding
    vesting periods. For purposes of valuing these awards, the
    Company has assumed a forfeiture rate of zero based on a
    historical analysis indicating minimal forfeitures for these
    types of awards. For the year ended June 29, 2007, the
    Company charged to expense $29 million related to
    restricted stock awards that were vested during the period. Of
    this amount, $12 million represented the incremental cost
    from the modification of pre-existing awards. As of
    June 29, 2007, the aggregate unamortized fair value of all
    unvested restricted stock awards was $38 million, which
    will be amortized on a straight-line basis over a weighted
    average vesting period of approximately 2.7 years.

During 2005, the Company also awarded certain executives and
    other key employees 0.5 million restricted stock units with
    performance-based vesting (“Performance Shares”).
    However, during 2006, the Company cancelled all outstanding
    Performance Shares. The impact of these awards, and subsequent
    cancellation, were not material to the consolidated financial
    statements.

Fair
    Value Disclosure — Binomial Model

The fair value of stock options granted for the years ended
    June 29, 2007, June 30, 2006 and all options granted
    between January 1, 2005 and July 1, 2005 was estimated
    using a binomial option pricing model. The binomial model
    requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including
    the expected stock price volatility, the expected price multiple
    at which employees are likely to exercise stock options and the
    expected employee forfeiture rate. The Company uses historical
    data to estimate option exercise, employee termination, and
    expected stock price volatility within the binomial model. The
    risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the
    option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect
    at the time of grant.

The fair value of stock options granted during the three years
    ended June 29, 2007 was estimated using the following

Fair
    Value Disclosure — Black-Scholes-Merton
    Model

Pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per
    share is required by SFAS No. 123. This information is
    required to be determined as if the Company had accounted for
    its stock options (including shares issued under the Stock
    Incentive Plans and the ESPP, collectively called
    “Options”) granted subsequent to July 1, 1995,
    under the fair value method of that statement.

The 2005 pro forma income per share information for all stock
    options granted on or prior to December 31, 2004 as well as
    all ESPP shares granted on or prior to July 1, 2005 was
    estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model.
    The Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model was developed for
    use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no
    vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. The
    Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model requires the input of
    highly subjective assumptions such as the expected stock price
    volatility and the expected period until options are exercised.
    The pro forma impact of applying SFAS No. 123 at
    June 29, 2007 is not necessarily representative of future
    periods.

Stock
    Repurchase Program

The Company’s Board of Directors has authorized the
    repurchase of up to $250 million of the Company’s
    common stock in open market transactions. Stock repurchases are
    expected to be funded principally from operating cash flows.
    During 2007, the Company repurchased 4.0 million shares of
    common stock at a total cost of $73 million. Subsequent to
    the end of 2007, the Company purchased 0.8 million shares
    for approximately $16 million. Since the inception of the
    program, the Company has repurchased 15.1 million shares
    for a total cost of $204 million. Subject to any
    limitations that may be set forth in the proposed bridge loan
    facility to be entered into for the planned acquisition of
    Komag, the Company may continue to repurchase its stock as it
    deems appropriate and market conditions allow.

Stock
    Purchase Rights

In 1989, the Company implemented a plan to protect
    shareholders’ rights in the event of a proposed takeover of
    the Company. Under the plan, each share of the Company’s
    outstanding common stock carried one Right to Purchase
    Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock (the
    “Right”). The Right enabled the holder, under certain
    circumstances, to purchase common stock of Western Digital or of
    an acquiring company at a substantially discounted price ten
    days after a person or group publicly announces it has acquired
    or has tendered an offer for 15% or more of the Company’s
    outstanding common stock. On September 10, 1998, the
    Company’s Board of Directors approved the adoption of a new
    Rights plan to replace the previous plan, which expired in
    September 1998. The Rights under the 1998 plan were similar to
    the rights under the 1989 plan except they were redeemable by
    the Company at $.01 per Right and expired in 2008. In connection
    with the establishment of a holding company structure on
    April 6, 2001, the Company terminated the Rights under the
    1998 plan and adopted a new Rights plan. The 2001 plan is
    similar to the terminated 1998 plan, except that the exercise
    price was reduced from $150.00 to $50.00 per share and the
    expiration date for the 2001 Rights plan was extended to April
    2011.

Remaining net undistributed earnings from foreign subsidiaries
    at June 29, 2007 on which no U.S. tax has been

The Company determines deferred taxes for each of its tax-paying
    subsidiaries within each tax jurisdiction. The Company’s
    deferred tax assets had previously been partially reserved in
    the form of a valuation allowance. As of the end of fiscal 2007,
    the Company determined that it is more likely than not that
    these assets will be realized. Accordingly, the Company reduced
    the remainder of the valuation allowance which resulted in the
    recognition of additional net deferred tax assets of
    $125 million. The realization of the deferred tax assets is
    primarily dependent on the Company’s ability to generate
    sufficient earnings in certain jurisdictions in future years.
    The Company released the remainder of the valuation allowance
    for its deferred tax assets based on the weight of available
    evidence including the history of cumulative pretax income and
    the increased likelihood of the Company’s ability to
    generate profits in the future. In 2006, the Company released a
    portion of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets due to
    the difficulty at the time in accurately projecting income for
    periods of longer than two years given the cyclical nature of
    the industry. The amount of deferred tax assets considered
    realizable may increase or decrease in subsequent periods based
    on fluctuating industry or company conditions.

    or in part at various dates through 2022. Certain of the
    holidays may be extended if specific conditions are met. The net

Planned
    Acquisition

The Company has a definitive agreement to acquire Komag,
    Incorporated, a media manufacturer and current supplier to the
    Company, for $32.25 per share for a value of approximately
    $1.0 billion, which is expected to close during the third
    calendar quarter of 2007. The planned acquisition of Komag is
    intended to strengthen production efficiencies and enhance the
    Company’s hard drive manufacturing process by integrating
    media, one of the critical technology components of hard drives.

The planned acquisition is structured as a cash tender offer for
    all the outstanding shares of Komag common stock followed by a
    merger of an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company
    into Komag in which the remaining shareholders of Komag will
    receive $32.24 in cash per share.

The Company intends to fund the planned acquisition, including
    the expected repurchase of Komag’s convertible notes due
    2014 and related fees and expenses, through a combination of the
    Company’s cash and proceeds from a senior unsecured term
    bridge loan facility of up to $1.3 billion.

(1)

The fourth quarter of 2007 included a $126 million benefit
    to income taxes from an adjustment to the valuation allowance
    for deferred income taxes. This benefit is net of an adjustment
    made in the fourth quarter to reduce the deferred tax asset and
    the related valuation allowance by approximately
    $21 million to correct the amount of state deferred tax
    asset recognized in prior periods. As both the deferred tax
    asset and the related valuation allowance were overstated in
    prior periods, there was no net effect to the total assets or
    net income as reported in those prior periods, or in the fourth
    quarter 2007.

The fourth quarter of 2006 included a $13 million benefit
    to gross margin related to the resolution of certain items that

    income taxes from an adjustment to the valuation allowance for
    deferred income taxes.

Controls
    and Procedures

Evaluation
    of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

As required by SEC

Rule 13a-15(b)

of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
    “Exchange Act”), we carried out an evaluation, under
    the supervision and with the participation of our management,
    including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our
    disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period
    covered by this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period
    covered by this Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined
    in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

of
    the Exchange Act) to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over
    financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
    (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in
    reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions
    and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable
    assurance that the transactions are recorded as necessary to
    permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts
    and expenditures are being made only in accordance with
    authorizations of our management and our directors; and
    (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
    timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition
    of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial
    statements.

Our management evaluated the effectiveness of our internal
    control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by
    the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (COSO) in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework.

Based on this evaluation, our management
    concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was
    effective as of the end of the period covered by this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K.

KPMG LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm
    which audited the consolidated financial statements included in
    this Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

has issued an attestation report on our assessment of our
    internal control over financial reporting. See page 48
    herein.

Changes
    in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There has been no change in our internal control over financial
    reporting during the fourth fiscal quarter ended June 29,
    2007 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
    materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Inherent
    Limitations of Effectiveness of Controls

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and its
    Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure
    controls and procedures or our internal controls over financial
    reporting will prevent all error and all fraud. A control
    system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide
    only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of
    the control system are met. Further, the benefits of controls
    must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the
    inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of
    controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues
    and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These
    inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in
    decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur
    because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can
    be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by
    collusion of two or more people, or by management override of
    the control. The design of any system of controls is also based
    in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future
    events, and there can be no assurance that any design will
    succeed in achieving



its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Because
    of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system,
    misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be
    detected.
