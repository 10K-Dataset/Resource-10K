We are one of the largest manufacturers and distributors of nitrogen fertilizer products and other nitrogen products in the world. Our principal customers are cooperatives, independent fertilizer distributors, farmers and industrial users. Our principal nitrogen fertilizer products are ammonia, granular urea, urea ammonium nitrate solution (UAN) and ammonium nitrate (AN). Our other nitrogen products include diesel exhaust fluid (DEF), urea liquor, nitric acid and aqua ammonia, which are sold primarily to our industrial customers, and compound fertilizer products (NPKs), which are solid granular fertilizer products for which the nutrient content is a combination of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. We operate world-class nitrogen manufacturing complexes in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, and distribute plant nutrients through a system of terminals, warehouses, and associated transportation equipment located primarily in the Midwestern United States. We also export nitrogen fertilizer products from our Donaldsonville, Louisiana and Yazoo City, Mississippi manufacturing facilities, and our United Kingdom manufacturing facilities in Billingham and Ince.

Our principal assets include:

•

four U.S. nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities, located in Donaldsonville, Louisiana (the largest nitrogen fertilizer complex in the world); Port Neal, Iowa; Yazoo City, Mississippi; and Woodward, Oklahoma. These facilities are owned by CF Industries Nitrogen, LLC (CFN), of which we own approximately 89% and CHS Inc. (CHS) owns the remainder. See Note

16—Noncontrolling Interests

for additional information on our strategic venture with CHS;

•

an approximately

75.3%

interest in Terra Nitrogen Company, L.P. (TNCLP), a publicly traded limited partnership of which we are the sole general partner and the majority limited partner and which, through its subsidiary Terra Nitrogen, Limited Partnership (TNLP), operates a nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facility in Verdigris, Oklahoma;

•

two Canadian nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities, located in Medicine Hat, Alberta (the largest nitrogen fertilizer complex in Canada) and Courtright, Ontario;

•

two United Kingdom nitrogen manufacturing complexes, located in Ince and Billingham;

•

an extensive system of terminals and associated transportation equipment located primarily in the Midwestern United States; and

•

a

50%

interest in Point Lisas Nitrogen Limited (PLNL), an ammonia production joint venture located in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago that we account for under the equity method.

On February 7, 2018, we announced that Terra Nitrogen GP Inc. (TNGP), the sole general partner of TNCLP and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of CF Holdings, elected to exercise its right to purchase all of the 4,612,562 publicly traded common units of TNCLP on April 2, 2018, for a cash purchase price of $84.033 per unit in accordance with the terms of TNCLP’s partnership agreement. The purchase price of $84.033 per unit was determined under the terms of TNCLP’s partnership agreement as the average of the daily closing prices per common unit for the 20 consecutive trading days beginning with January 5, 2018 and ending with February 2, 2018. The purchase price of all of the 4,612,562 publicly traded common units of TNCLP is approximately $390 million. We intend to fund the purchase with cash on hand. As of the April 2, 2018 purchase date, all rights of the holders of the units will terminate, with the exception of the right to receive payment of the purchase price. Upon completion of the purchase, we will own 100 percent of the general and limited partnership interests of TNCLP, and the common units representing limited partner interests will cease to be publicly traded or listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

In 2016, we completed our capacity expansion projects at Donaldsonville, Louisiana and Port Neal, Iowa. These projects, originally announced in 2012, included the construction of new ammonia, urea, and UAN plants at our Donaldsonville,



CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

Louisiana complex and new ammonia and urea plants at our Port Neal, Iowa complex. These plants increased our overall production capacity by approximately 25%, improved our product mix flexibility at Donaldsonville, and improved our ability to serve upper-Midwest urea customers from our Port Neal location. These new facilities allow us to benefit from the cost advantages of North American natural gas. At our Donaldsonville complex, the ammonia plant was placed in service in October 2016, the UAN plant was placed in service in the first quarter of 2016 and the granular urea plant was placed in service in the fourth quarter of 2015. At our Port Neal, Iowa complex, both the ammonia and granular urea plants were placed in service in the fourth quarter of 2016. The total capital cost of the capacity expansion projects was $5.2 billion.

We commenced a strategic venture with CHS on February 1, 2016, at which time CHS purchased a minority equity interest in CFN for

$2.8 billion

, which represented approximately 11% of the membership interest of CFN. We own the remaining membership interest. On February 1, 2016, CHS also began receiving deliveries pursuant to a supply agreement under which CHS has the right to purchase annually from CFN up to approximately

1.1 million

tons of granular urea and

580,000

tons of UAN at market prices. As a result of its minority equity interest in CFN, CHS is entitled to semi-annual cash distributions from CFN. We are also entitled to semi-annual cash distributions from CFN. See Note

16—Noncontrolling Interests

for additional information on our strategic venture with CHS.

On July 31, 2015, we acquired the remaining 50% equity interest in

CF Fertilisers UK Group Limited

(formerly known as GrowHow UK Group Limited) (CF Fertilisers UK) not previously owned by us for total consideration of

$570 million

, and

CF Fertilisers UK

became wholly owned by us. This transaction added

Company History

We were founded in 1946 as a fertilizer brokerage operation by a group of regional agricultural cooperatives. During the 1960s, we expanded our distribution capabilities and diversified into fertilizer manufacturing through the acquisition of several existing plants and facilities. During the 1970s and again during the 1990s, we expanded our production and distribution capabilities significantly, spending approximately $1 billion in each of these decades.

We operated as a traditional manufacturing and supply cooperative until 2002, when we adopted a new business model that established financial performance as our principal objective, rather than assured supply to our owners. A critical aspect of the new business model was to establish a more economically driven approach to the marketplace.

In August 2005, we completed our initial public offering (IPO) of common stock, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. In connection with the IPO, we consummated a reorganization transaction whereby we ceased to be a cooperative and our pre-IPO owners' equity interests in CF Industries were canceled in exchange for all of the proceeds of the offering and shares of our common stock.

In April 2010, we acquired Terra Industries Inc. (Terra), a leading North American producer and marketer of nitrogen fertilizer products for a purchase price of $4.6 billion, which was paid in cash and shares of our common stock. As a result of the Terra acquisition, we acquired five nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities, our approximately 75.3% interest in TNCLP and certain joint venture interests.

In March 2014, we completed the sale of our phosphate mining and manufacturing business, which was located in Florida, to Mosaic for approximately $1.4 billion in cash.

The purchase price of all of the 4,612,562 publicly traded common units of TNCLP is approximately $390 million. Upon completion of the purchase, we will own 100 percent of the general and limited partnership interests of TNCLP.

Product Tons and Nutrient Tons

Unless otherwise stated, we measure our production and sales volume in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in product tons, which represents the weight of the product measured in short tons (one short ton is equal to 2,000 pounds). References to UAN product tons assume a 32% nitrogen content basis for production volume.

We also provide certain supplementary volume information measured in nutrient tons. Nutrient tons represent the weight of the product’s nitrogen content, which varies by product. Ammonia represents 82% nitrogen content, granular urea represents 46% nitrogen content, UAN represents between 28% and 32% nitrogen content and AN represents between 29% and 35% nitrogen content.

Reportable Segments

Our reportable segments consist of the following segments: ammonia, granular urea, UAN, AN and Other. These segments are differentiated by products. We use gross margin to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. Total other operating costs and expenses (consisting of selling, general and administrative expenses and other operating—net) and non-operating expenses (interest and income taxes), are centrally managed and are not included in the measurement of segment profitability reviewed by management. See Note

20—Segment Disclosures

for additional information.

Our Products

Our primary nitrogen fertilizer products are ammonia, granular urea, UAN and AN. Our historical sales of nitrogen fertilizer products are shown in the following table. Net sales do not reflect amounts used internally, such as ammonia, in the manufacture of other products.

We own and operate seven nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities in North America, including five nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities in the United States, one in Medicine Hat, Alberta, Canada and one in Courtright, Ontario, Canada. As of December 31,


, the combined production capacity of these seven facilities represented approximately 42%, 43%, 44%



CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

and 19% of North American ammonia, granular urea, UAN and AN production capacity, respectively. Each of our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities in North America has on-site storage to provide flexibility to manage the flow of outbound shipments without impacting production.

We also operate two United Kingdom nitrogen manufacturing complexes located in Ince and Billingham that produce ammonia, AN and NPKs and serve primarily the British agricultural and industrial markets.

The following table shows the production capacities as of December 31,


at each of our nitrogen manufacturing facilities:

_______________________________________________________________________________

(1)

Point Lisas, Trinidad

The Point Lisas Nitrogen facility in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago is owned jointly through a 50/50 venture with Koch Fertilizer LLC. This facility has the capacity to produce 720,000 tons of ammonia annually from natural gas supplied under a contract with the National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago (NGC).

Nitrogen Fertilizer Raw Materials

Natural gas is the principal raw material and primary fuel source used in the ammonia production process at our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities. In


, natural gas accounted for approximately

47%

of our total production costs for nitrogen fertilizer products. Our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities have access to abundant, competitively-priced natural gas through a reliable network of pipelines that are connected to major natural gas trading hubs near the facilities. Our facilities utilize the following natural gas hubs: Henry Hub in Louisiana; SONAT in Louisiana; TETCO ELA in Louisiana; ONEOK in Oklahoma; AECO in Alberta; Ventura in Iowa; Demarcation in Kansas; Welcome in Minnesota; Dawn in Ontario; Parkway in Ontario; and the National Balancing Point (NBP) in the United Kingdom.

In 2017, our nitrogen manufacturing facilities consumed, in the aggregate, approximately 356 million MMBtus of natural gas. In 2017, the amount of natural gas consumed by our nitrogen manufacturing facilities increased as a result of the completion of our capacity expansion projects. We employ a combination of spot and term purchases from a variety of quality suppliers to maintain a reliable, competitively-priced supply of natural gas. We also use certain financial instruments to hedge natural gas prices. See Note

14—Derivative Financial Instruments

for additional information about our natural gas hedging activities.

Nitrogen Fertilizer Distribution

The safe, efficient and economical distribution of nitrogen fertilizer products is critical for successful operations. Our nitrogen fertilizer production facilities have access to multiple transportation modes by which we ship fertilizer products to terminals, warehouses and customers. Each of our production facilities has a unique distribution pattern based on its production capacity and location.

Our North American nitrogen production facilities can ship products via truck and rail to customers and our storage facilities in the U.S. and Canada, with access to our leased railcar fleet of approximately 5,000 tank and hopper cars, as well as railcars provided by rail carriers. Our United Kingdom nitrogen production facilities mainly ship products via truck.

The North American waterway system is also used extensively to ship products from our Donaldsonville, Verdigris and Yazoo City facilities. To ship ammonia and UAN, we employ a fleet of ten tow boats and thirty-two river barges, which are primarily leased. We also utilize contract marine services to move urea fertilizer. We can also export nitrogen fertilizer products via seagoing vessels from our Donaldsonville, Yazoo City, Billingham and Ince manufacturing facilities.

Three of our nitrogen production facilities also have access to pipelines for the transportation of ammonia. The Donaldsonville facility is connected to the 2,000-mile long Nustar pipeline through which we have the ability to transport ammonia to more than 20 terminals and shipping points in the midwestern U.S. corn belt. Our Verdigris and Port Neal facilities are connected to the 1,100-mile long Magellan ammonia pipeline that also serves the Midwestern United States.



CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

Storage Facilities and Other Properties

As of

December 31, 2017

, we owned or leased space at


in-market storage terminals and warehouses located in a 22-state region of the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. Including storage at our production facilities, we have an aggregate storage capacity for approximately

3.5 million

tons of fertilizer. Our storage capabilities are summarized in the following table.

_______________________________________________________________________________

(1)

Capacity is expressed as the equivalent volume of UAN measured on a 32% nitrogen content basis.

(2)

Our lease agreements are typically for periods of one to five years.

Customers

The principal customers for our nitrogen fertilizer and other nitrogen products are cooperatives, independent fertilizer distributors, farmers and industrial users. CHS was our largest customer in


and accounted for approximately

11%

of our consolidated net sales. Sales are generated by our internal marketing and sales force.

Competition

Our markets are global and intensely competitive, based primarily on delivered price and, to a lesser extent, on customer service and product quality. During the peak demand periods, product availability and delivery time also play a role in the buying decisions of customers.

Our primary North American-based competitors include Nutrien Ltd. (formed in January 2018 by the merger of Agrium Inc. and Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc.), Koch Fertilizer LLC and Iowa Fertilizer Company. Additionally, Yara BASF is expected to bring a new North American nitrogen fertilizer production facility on line in 2018. There is also significant competition from products sourced from other regions of the world, including some with lower natural gas or other feedstock costs. Because ammonia, urea and UAN are widely-traded fertilizer products and there are limited barriers to entry, we experience competition from foreign-sourced products continuously.

Our primary United Kingdom competition comes from imported products supplied by companies including Yara International, Origin Fertilisers, Ameropa, CHS and Helm. Urea and UAN are not produced in the United Kingdom, but along with AN are widely-traded fertilizer products with limited barriers to entry.

Seasonality

The fertilizer business is seasonal. The degree of seasonality of our business can change significantly from year to year due to conditions in the agricultural industry and other factors. The strongest demand for our products in North America occurs during the spring planting season, with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest. We and our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons. Seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the short application season and the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product. The seasonality of fertilizer demand generally results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring planting season. Our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weather-related shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns.

Financial Information About Foreign and Domestic Sales and Operations

CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

Environmental, Health and Safety

We are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, including laws and regulations relating to the generation and handling of hazardous substances and wastes; the cleanup of hazardous substance releases; the discharge of regulated substances to air or water; and the demolition of existing plant sites upon permanent closure. In the United States, these laws include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) and various other federal, state, provincial, local and international statutes. Violations of environmental, health and safety laws can result in substantial penalties, court orders to install pollution-control equipment, civil and criminal sanctions, permit revocations and facility shutdowns. In addition, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations may impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault, for cleanup costs on potentially responsible parties who have released or disposed of hazardous substances into the environment. We may be subject to more stringent enforcement of existing or new environmental, health and safety laws in the future.

Environmental, Health and Safety Expenditures

Our environmental, health and safety capital expenditures in


totaled approximately $21 million. We estimate that we will have approximately $60 million of capital expenditures for environmental, health and safety in


. Environmental, health and safety laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. We expect that continued government and public emphasis on environmental issues will result in increased future expenditures for environmental controls at our operations. Such expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations or reinterpretation of current laws and regulations may require us to make substantial expenditures. Our costs to comply with, or any liabilities under, these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

CERCLA/Remediation Matters

From time to time, we receive notices from governmental agencies or third parties alleging that we are a potentially responsible party at certain cleanup sites under CERCLA or other environmental cleanup laws. In 2011, we received a notice from the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality (IDEQ) that alleged that we were a potentially responsible party for the cleanup of a former phosphate mine we owned in the late 1950s and early 1960s located in Georgetown Canyon, Idaho. The current owner of the property and a former mining contractor received similar notices for the site. We and the current owner are currently conducting a remedial investigation/feasibility study of the site. In 2015, we and several other parties received a notice that the U.S. Department of Interior and other trustees intend to undertake a natural resource damage assessment for a group of former phosphate mines in southeast Idaho, including the former Georgetown Canyon mine. See Note

Regulation of Greenhouse Gases

We are subject to regulations in the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States concerning greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

The United Kingdom is a party to the Kyoto Protocol. As a result of agreements reached during a conference in Durban, South Africa in 2011, the Kyoto Protocol will continue in force for a second commitment period, which will expire by 2020. On December 12, 2015, 195 countries adopted by consensus a new international agreement known as the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement is intended to provide a framework pursuant to which the parties to the agreement will attempt to hold the increase in global average temperatures to below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. The Paris Agreement, which has been accepted by the United States and ratified by Canada and the United Kingdom, went into effect in November 2016. The Paris Agreement could result in more aggressive efforts to reduce GHG emissions in the jurisdictions in which we operate.

The United Kingdom has adopted GHG emissions regulations, including regulations to implement the European Union Greenhouse Gas Trading System. Our U.K. manufacturing plants are required to report GHG emissions annually to the United Kingdom Environment Agency pursuant to their site Environmental Permits and Climate Change Agreement, which specify energy efficiency targets. Failure to meet efficiency targets may require these plants to purchase CO


emissions allowances. The steam boilers at each of our U.K. sites are also subject to the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme.

Canada withdrew from further participation in the Kyoto Protocol in December 2011, but is a party to the Paris Agreement. In Canada, we are required to conduct an annual review of our operations with respect to compliance with



CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

Environment Canada's National Pollutant Release Inventory and Ontario's Mandatory Monitoring and Reporting Regulation and the GHG Reporting Regulation. In addition, the Canadian national government, in collaboration with Canadian provinces, has developed a Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change. Among other things, the framework establishes a nationwide price on carbon emissions, which price serves as a floor for the GHG emissions reduction requirements of the separate Canadian provinces and territories. The announced plan would impose a $10 per ton (Canadian dollars) charge beginning in 2018, rising to $50 per ton by 2022. The framework provides for a review of the approach taken by the national government and the provinces to address further action after 2022.

Ontario is party to the Western Climate Initiative (WCI), comprising California and several Canadian provinces. On January 1, 2017, Ontario launched its own GHG cap and trade program. Under this program, the Ontario government will set a hard limit on emissions, which will steadily decline annually. By 2020, the cap will mandate that GHG emissions decline by 15% compared to 1990 levels. Facilities that generate more than 25,000 tonnes of GHG emissions per year will be required to participate in the cap and trade program and will require emissions allowances for every tonne of GHG emitted. During the 2017-2020 compliance period, we are eligible to receive free emissions allowances, although the amount of free allowances will decline through 2020. This will require us to purchase emission allowances or to reduce GHG emissions. Ontario has stated it intends to reassess the extent to which it will provide free allowances for post-2020 compliance periods. Beginning January 1, 2018, Ontario's cap and trade program is linked with the cap and trade programs of Quebec and California.

In Alberta, the Specified Gas Emitters Regulation (GHG Regulation) was implemented in 2007. This program required facilities emitting more than 100,000 tons of GHGs per year to reduce emissions by 12% over such facilities' 2007 levels. To meet this requirement, companies could reduce emissions, purchase/use offset credits, or contribute to a technology fund at an annual rate of $15 per ton of CO


. Beginning in 2018, our facility will become subject to the Carbon Competitiveness Incentive Regulation, which establishes product-specific benchmarks based on the most efficient GHG emitting facilities in a sector. Similar to the existing regulation, a facility that exceeds the applicable benchmark will be required to take action to reduce its GHG emissions intensity, purchase emissions offsets or performance credits, or make contributions to Alberta's climate fund.  The obligations under this regulation are being phased in over a three year period and will be tightened over time.

The United States is not a party to the Kyoto Protocol, but is a party to the Paris Agreement. However, in June 2017, the United States announced its intention to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, subject to renegotiation of the Paris Agreement on terms more favorable to the United States. Under the terms of the Paris Agreement, the United States cannot formally provide notice of its withdrawal before November 2019, which would become effective one year after providing such notice. In the interim, it is unclear if the United States will comply with its commitments under the Paris Agreement. There has been no indication to date that the United States' announced withdrawal is causing other countries to also consider withdrawing from the Paris Agreement. In the United States, GHG regulation is evolving at state, regional and federal levels, although some of the more significant developments to date, including EPA's Clean Power Plan, do not directly impose obligations on our facilities. The EPA has issued a mandatory GHG reporting rule that required all of our U.S. manufacturing facilities to commence monitoring GHG emissions beginning on January 1, 2010 and report the previous year's emissions annually starting in 2011. In addition, if we seek to modify or expand any of our major facilities and as a result, are required to obtain a Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) construction permit applicable to such facilities, we could be subject to pollution control requirements applicable to GHGs in addition to requirements applicable to conventional air pollutants. Such requirements may result in increased costs or delays in completing such projects. Other than the states' implementation of this permitting requirement, none of the states where our U.S. production facilities are located—Iowa, Louisiana, Mississippi and Oklahoma—has proposed control regulations limiting GHG emissions.

New Source Performance Standards for Nitric Acid Plants

We operate 14 nitric acid plants in the United States. On August 14, 2012, the EPA issued a final regulation revising air emission standards applicable to newly constructed, reconstructed or modified nitric acid plants. The regulations will apply to these plants if and when we undertake activities or operations that are considered modifications, including physical changes that would allow us to increase our production capacity at these plants. The regulations include certain provisions that could make it difficult for us to meet the limits on emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO

x

) notwithstanding pollution controls we may add to our plants, and accordingly, the regulations could impact our ability to expand production at our existing plants. The EPA regulation did not include a limitation on emissions of nitrous oxide (a greenhouse gas).



CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

Regulatory Permits and Approvals

We hold numerous environmental and other governmental permits and approvals authorizing operations at each of our facilities. A decision by a government agency to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed regulatory material permit or approval, or to revoke or substantially modify an existing material permit or approval, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at the affected facility. Any future expansion of our existing operations is also predicated upon securing the necessary environmental or other permits or approvals. More stringent environmental standards may impact our ability to obtain such permits. On December 15, 2016, the EPA re-designated the Greater Baton Rouge Nonattainment Area (BRNA), where our Donaldsonville facility is located, to attainment with the 2008 8-hour ozone standard. However, on October 26, 2015, the EPA published a more stringent national ambient air quality standard for ozone. The State of Louisiana has recommended to the EPA that Baton Rouge be designated as nonattainment with the 2015 ozone standard. On December 20, 2017, the EPA notified the State of Louisiana that it intends to designate the Baton Rouge area as non-attainment for the 2015 ozone standard. On January 5, 2018, the EPA published notice of a public comment period with respect to the proposed attainment/non-attainment designations of certain air quality regions, including the Baton Rouge area. Such a classification (in the Baton Rouge area or in other areas where our manufacturing facilities are located) could result in more stringent air pollution emissions limits for our existing operations and would also subject our facilities to more stringent requirements to obtain approvals for plant expansions, or could make it difficult to obtain such approvals.

Employees

As of

December 31, 2017

, we employed approximately 2,900 full-time and 100 part-time employees.

ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS.

In addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, you should carefully consider the factors discussed below before deciding to invest in any of our securities. These risks and uncertainties could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Our business is cyclical, resulting in periods of industry oversupply during which our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows tend to be negatively affected.

Historically, selling prices for our products have fluctuated in response to periodic changes in supply and demand conditions. Demand for nitrogen is affected by planted acreage, crop selection and fertilizer application rates, driven by population growth or changes in dietary habits and non-food use of crops, such as production of ethanol and other biofuels among other things. Demand also includes industrial uses of nitrogen, for example chemicals manufacturing and emissions reductants such as diesel exhaust fluid (DEF). Supply is affected by available capacity and operating rates, raw material costs and availability, government policies and global trade.

Periods of strong demand, high capacity utilization and increasing operating margins tend to stimulate global investment in production capacity. The construction of new nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing capacity in the industry, plus improvements to increase output from the existing production assets, increase nitrogen supply availability and affect the balance of supply and demand. In recent years, fertilizer producers, including CF Holdings, have built new production facilities or expanded capacity of existing production assets, or announced plans to do so. Global nitrogen fertilizer capacity has increased faster than global nitrogen fertilizer demand, creating a surplus of global nitrogen fertilizer capacity leading to lower nitrogen fertilizer selling prices.

Selling prices reached multi-year lows in


. The average selling price for our products in


was

$207

per ton compared to

$217

per ton in


, a decline of

5%

, and $314 per ton in 2015, a decline of 31%.

Additional production capacity is expected to come on line over the next twelve months. We cannot predict the extent to which the current oversupply environment, global or local economic and financial conditions or changes in such conditions, or other factors may cause delays, cancellation or acceleration of other announced and/or ongoing projects. We also cannot predict the closures or operating rates of existing installed capacity.

Price fluctuations for our products result from changes in supply demand balances. The significant price fluctuations we have experienced are also a symptom of an oversupplied market in transition as new capacity ramps up and trade flows adjust.  Imports into different regions of the world impact the local supply demand balances. If imports increase into an oversupplied region, lower prices in that region could result.

We expect the lower priced environment to continue until global supply and demand become more balanced through a combination of continued demand growth and supply reductions as producers respond to lower realized margins by taking higher cost production facilities off line.

During periods of industry oversupply, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows tend to be affected negatively as the price at which we sell our products typically declines, resulting in possible reduced profit margins, write-downs in the value of our inventory and temporary or permanent curtailments of production. Our financial performance, credit ratings and the trading price for our common stock have been negatively impacted by the lower selling prices resulting from the current global oversupply of nitrogen fertilizer. The period of time that these conditions will persist and the degree to which they will impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows is uncertain.

Our products are global commodities, and we face intense global competition from other fertilizer producers.

We are subject to intense price competition from our competitors. Most fertilizers are global commodities, with little or no product differentiation, and customers make their purchasing decisions principally on the basis of delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality.

We compete with many producers, including state-owned and government-subsidized entities. Consolidation in the industry may increase the resources of several of our competitors. For example, in January 2018, our competitors Agrium Inc. and Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc. completed their merger into the newly formed company Nutrien Ltd. Some of our competitors have greater total resources and are less dependent on earnings from fertilizer sales, which make them less vulnerable to industry downturns and better positioned to pursue new expansion and development opportunities. Furthermore, certain governments as owners of some of our competitors may be willing to accept lower prices and profitability on their products in order to support domestic employment or other political or social goals. Our competitive position could suffer to the



CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

extent we are not able to expand our own resources, either through investments in new or existing operations or through acquisitions, joint ventures or partnerships.

China, the world’s largest producer and consumer of nitrogen fertilizers, currently has significant capacity surplus and many high-cost plants. As a result, the domestic nitrogen industry in China is operating at less than full capacity. If Chinese government policy, devaluation of the Chinese renminbi or decreases in Chinese producers’ underlying costs such as the price of Chinese coal encourage increased production capacity utilization, any resulting export volume could adversely affect the balance between global supply and demand and may put downward pressure on global fertilizer prices, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Our competitors in Russia continue to benefit from non-market pricing of natural gas, allowing continued exports from the region, and have significant nitrogen fertilizer export capacity. The 2016 revocations of U.S. antidumping measures on solid urea and fertilizer grade ammonium nitrate from Russia allow for increases in imports from that country.

We also face competition from other fertilizer producers in the Middle East, Europe and Latin America, who, depending on market conditions, fluctuating input prices, geographic location and freight economics, may take actions at times with respect to price or selling volumes that adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

A decline in agricultural production or limitations on the use of our products for agricultural purposes could materially adversely affect the demand for our products.

Conditions in the United States, Europe and other global agricultural areas significantly impact our operating results. Agricultural planted areas and production can be affected by a number of factors, including weather patterns and field conditions, current and projected grain inventories and prices, demand for agricultural products and governmental policies regarding production of or trade in agricultural products. These factors are outside of our control.

Governmental policies, including farm and biofuel subsidies and commodity support programs, as well as the prices of fertilizer products, may also directly or indirectly influence the number of acres planted, the mix of crops planted and the use of fertilizers for particular agricultural applications. Ethanol production in the United States contributes significantly to corn demand, due in part to federal legislation mandating use of renewable fuels. An increase in ethanol production has led to an increase in the amount of corn grown in the United States and to increased fertilizer usage on both corn and other crops that have also benefited from improved farm economics. While the current Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) encourages continued high levels of corn-based ethanol production, a continuing “food versus fuel” debate and other factors have resulted in calls to eliminate or reduce the renewable fuel mandate, or to eliminate or reduce corn-based ethanol as part of the renewable fuel mandate. This could have an adverse effect on corn-based ethanol production, planted corn acreage and fertilizer demand.

Developments in crop technology, such as nitrogen fixation, the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen into compounds that plants can assimilate, or nitrogen-efficient varieties, could also reduce the use of chemical fertilizers and adversely affect the demand for our products. Widespread adoption of emerging application technologies could disrupt traditional application practices, affecting the volume or types of products used and timing of applications. In addition, from time to time various state legislatures have considered limitations on the use and application of chemical fertilizers due to concerns about the impact of these products on the environment. Any reduction in the demand for chemical fertilizer products, including any limitation on the use and application of chemical fertilizer, could affect the demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Our business is dependent on natural gas, the prices of which are subject to volatility.

Natural gas is the principal raw material used to produce nitrogen fertilizers. We use natural gas both as a chemical feedstock and as a fuel to produce ammonia, granular urea, urea ammonium nitrate solution (UAN), ammonium nitrate (AN) and other nitrogen products.

Because most of our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities are located in the United States and Canada, North American natural gas comprises a significant portion of the total production cost of our products. The price of natural gas in North America has been volatile in recent years. During

Changes in the supply of and demand for natural gas can lead to periods of volatile natural gas prices. If high prices were to occur during a period of low fertilizer selling prices, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

The price of natural gas in North America and worldwide has been volatile in recent years and has declined on average due in part to the development of significant natural gas reserves, including shale gas, and the rapid improvement in shale gas extraction techniques, such as hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling. Future production of natural gas from shale formations could be reduced by regulatory changes that restrict drilling or hydraulic fracturing or increase its cost or by reduction in oil exploration and development prompted by lower oil prices and resulting in production of less associated gas. Additionally, increased demand for natural gas, particularly in the Gulf Coast Region, due to increased industrial demand and increased natural gas exports could result in increased natural gas prices. If such reduced production or increased demand were to occur, or if other developments adversely impact the supply/demand balance for natural gas in the United States or elsewhere, natural gas prices could rise, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Our operations and those of our joint venture are dependent upon raw materials provided by third parties, and any delay or interruption in the delivery of raw materials may adversely affect our business.

We and our joint venture use natural gas and other raw materials in the manufacture of nitrogen products. We purchase the natural gas and other raw materials from third party suppliers. Our natural gas is transported by pipeline to our facilities and those of our joint venture by third party transportation providers or through the use of facilities owned by third parties. Delays or interruptions in the delivery of natural gas or other raw materials may be caused by, among other things, severe weather or natural disasters, unscheduled downtime, labor difficulties, insolvency of our suppliers or their inability to meet existing contractual arrangements, deliberate sabotage and terrorist incidents, or mechanical failures. Our joint venture, Point Lisas Nitrogen Limited, has experienced numerous natural gas curtailments as discussed in the risk factor below titled "We are exposed to risks associated with our joint venture." In addition, the transport of natural gas by pipeline is subject to additional risks, including delays or interruptions caused by capacity constraints, leaks or ruptures. Any delay or interruption in the delivery of natural gas or other raw materials, even for a limited period, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Our transportation and distribution activities rely on third party providers and are subject to environmental, safety and regulatory oversight. This exposes us to risks and uncertainties beyond our control that may adversely affect our operations and exposes us to additional liability.

We rely on railroad, truck, pipeline, river barge and ocean vessel companies to transport raw materials to our manufacturing facilities, to coordinate and deliver finished products to our distribution system and to ship finished products to our customers. We also lease rail cars in order to ship raw materials and finished products. These transportation operations, equipment and services are subject to various hazards, including adverse operating conditions on the inland waterway system, extreme weather conditions, system failures, work stoppages, delays, accidents such as spills and derailments and other accidents and operating hazards. Additionally, due to the aging infrastructure of certain bridges, roadways, rail lines, river locks, and equipment that our third party service providers utilize, we may experience delays in both the receipt of raw materials or the shipment of finished product while repairs, maintenance or replacement activities are conducted. Also, certain third party service providers, particularly railroads, have experienced periodic service slowdowns due to capacity constraints in their systems, operational and maintenance difficulties and other events, which impact the shipping times of our products.

These transportation operations, equipment and services are also subject to environmental, safety, and regulatory oversight. Due to concerns related to accidents, discharges or other releases of hazardous substances, terrorism or the potential use of fertilizers as explosives, governmental entities could implement new or more stringent regulatory requirements affecting the transportation of raw materials or finished products.

If shipping of our products is delayed or we are unable to obtain raw materials as a result of these transportation companies’ failure to operate properly, or if new and more stringent regulatory requirements are implemented affecting transportation operations or equipment, or if there are significant increases in the cost of these services or equipment, our revenues and cost of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, increases in our transportation costs, or changes in



CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

such costs relative to transportation costs incurred by our competitors, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

In the United States and Canada, the railroad industry continues various efforts to limit the railroads’ potential liability stemming from the transportation of Toxic Inhalation Hazard materials, such as the anhydrous ammonia we transport to and from our manufacturing and distribution facilities. For example, various railroads shift liability to shippers by contract, purport to shift liability to shippers by tariff, or otherwise seek to require shippers to indemnify and defend the railroads from and against liabilities (including in negligence, strict liability, or statutory liability) that may arise from certain acts or omissions of the railroads, third parties with insufficient resources, unknown causes or acts of god. These initiatives could materially and adversely affect our operating expenses and potentially our ability to transport anhydrous ammonia and increase our liability for releases of our anhydrous ammonia while in the care, custody and control of the railroads or third parties, for which our insurance may be insufficient or unavailable. New or more stringent regulatory requirements also could be implemented affecting the equipment used to ship our raw materials or finished products. Restrictions on service, increases in transportation costs, or changes in such costs relative to transportation costs incurred by our competitors, and any railroad industry initiatives that may impact our ability to transport our products, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Our operations and the production and handling of our products involve significant risks and hazards. We are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business. Therefore, our insurance coverage may not adequately cover our losses.

Our operations are subject to hazards inherent in the manufacture, transportation, storage and distribution of chemical products, including ammonia, which is highly toxic and corrosive. These hazards include: explosions; fires; severe weather and natural disasters; train derailments, collisions, vessel groundings and other transportation and maritime incidents; leaks and ruptures involving storage tanks, pipelines and rail cars; spills, discharges and releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases; deliberate sabotage and terrorist incidents; mechanical failures; unscheduled plant downtime; labor difficulties and other risks. Some of these hazards can cause bodily injury and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage, and may result in suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties and liabilities.

We maintain property, business interruption, casualty and liability insurance policies, but we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business. If we were to incur significant liability for which we were not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We are subject to various self-retentions, deductibles and limits under these insurance policies. The policies also contain exclusions and conditions that could have a material adverse impact on our ability to receive indemnification thereunder. Our policies are generally renewed annually. As a result of market conditions, our premiums, self-retentions and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially and, in some instances, certain insurance may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. In addition, significantly increased costs could lead us to decide to reduce, or possibly eliminate, coverage. There can be no assurance that we will be able to buy and maintain insurance with adequate limits and reasonable pricing terms and conditions.

In April 2013, there was a fire and explosion at the West Fertilizer Co. fertilizer storage and distribution facility in West, Texas. According to published reports, 15 people were killed and approximately 200 people were injured in the incident, and the fire and explosion damaged or destroyed a number of homes and buildings around the facility. Various subsidiaries of CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (the CF Entities) have been named as defendants along with other companies in lawsuits filed in 2013, 2014 and 2015 in the District Court of McLennan County, Texas by the City of West, individual residents of the County and other parties seeking recovery for damages allegedly sustained as a result of the explosion. The cases have been consolidated for discovery and pretrial proceedings in the District Court of McLennan County under the caption “In re: West Explosion Cases.” The two-year statute of limitations expired on April 17, 2015. As of that date, over 400 plaintiffs had filed claims, including at least 9 entities, 325 individuals, and 80 insurance companies. Plaintiffs allege various theories of negligence, strict liability, and breach of warranty under Texas law. Although we do not own or operate the facility or directly sell our products to West Fertilizer Co., products that the CF Entities have manufactured and sold to others have been delivered to the facility and may have been stored at the West facility at the time of the incident. The Court granted in part and denied in part the CF Entities’ Motions for Summary Judgment in August 2015. Over one hundred sixty cases have been resolved pursuant to confidential settlements that have been or we expect will be fully funded by insurance. The remaining cases are in various stages of discovery and pre-trial proceedings. The next trial is expected to be scheduled for later in 2018. We believe we have strong legal and factual defenses and intend to continue defending the CF Entities vigorously in the pending lawsuits. The increased focus on the risks associated with fertilizers as a result of the incident could impact the regulatory environment and requirements applicable to fertilizer manufacturing and storage facilities.



CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our cash flow, prevent us from fulfilling our obligations and impair our ability to pursue or achieve other business objectives.

As of

December 31, 2017

, we had approximately

$4.69 billion

of total funded indebtedness, consisting primarily of secured and unsecured senior notes with varying maturity dates between 2020 and 2044, or approximately

41%

of our total capitalization, and an additional

$695 million

of senior secured borrowing availability (reflecting no outstanding borrowings and

$55 million

of outstanding letters of credit) under our senior secured revolving credit agreement (as amended, the Revolving Credit Agreement). Our substantial debt service obligations will have an impact on our earnings and cash flow for so long as the indebtedness is outstanding.

Our substantial indebtedness could, through the operation of the financial and other restrictive covenants to which we are subject under the agreements and instruments governing that indebtedness and otherwise, have important consequences. For example, it could:

•

make it more difficult for us to pay or refinance our debts as they become due during adverse economic and industry conditions because any related decrease in revenues could cause us not to have sufficient cash flows from operations to make our scheduled debt payments;

•

cause us to be less able to take advantage of significant business opportunities, such as acquisition opportunities, and to react to changes in market or industry conditions;

•

cause us to use a portion of our cash flow from operations for debt service, reducing the availability of cash to fund working capital and capital expenditures, and other business activities;

•

cause us to be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions;

•

expose us to the risk of increased interest rates because certain of our borrowings, including borrowings under our Revolving Credit Agreement, could be at variable rates of interest;

•

make us more leveraged than some of our competitors, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage;

•

restrict our investments in our subsidiaries, which could limit our ability to fund certain of our businesses;

•

restrict our ability to dispose of assets or otherwise restrict our use of funds from the disposal of assets;

•

restrict our ability to pay dividends on our common stock or utilize excess cash to repurchase shares of our common stock;

•

limit our ability to borrow additional monies in the future to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes; and

•

result in a downgrade in the credit rating of our indebtedness which could increase the cost of further borrowings.

We expect to consider options to refinance our outstanding indebtedness from time to time. Our ability to obtain any financing, whether through the issuance of new debt securities or otherwise, and the terms of any such financing are dependent on, among other things, our financial condition, financial market conditions within our industry and generally, credit ratings and numerous other factors, including factors beyond our control. Consequently, in the event that we need to access the credit markets, including to refinance our debt, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable timeframe, if at all. An inability to obtain financing with acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Our Revolving Credit Agreement and the terms of our outstanding indebtedness impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries, which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities.

Our Revolving Credit Agreement imposes significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions include covenants limiting our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries (other than certain excluded subsidiaries) to, among other things:

•

incur additional indebtedness or guarantee indebtedness;

•

pay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect of their capital stock or make other restricted payments;

•

make certain investments or acquisitions;

•

sell, transfer or otherwise convey certain assets;

•

create liens;

•

consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our and our restricted subsidiaries’ assets; and

•

prepay certain kinds of indebtedness.

In addition, our Revolving Credit Agreement requires us to comply with consolidated interest coverage ratio, total debt to capital ratio, and consolidated secured leverage ratio maintenance covenants.



CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

Certain of these restrictions could be suspended if and for so long as we satisfy certain investment grade corporate rating and consolidated leverage tests. However, we cannot assure you that we will meet these tests or, if we do, that we will be able to maintain compliance with those conditions.

As a result of these restrictions and covenants under our existing indebtedness, including our senior secured notes, we are limited as to how we conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional debt financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. The terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include additional or more restrictive covenants. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain compliance with the covenants under the terms of our indebtedness or, if we fail to do so, that we will be able to obtain waivers from the lenders and/or amend such covenants.

We may incur additional indebtedness in the future.

The terms of our existing indebtedness allow us to incur additional debt in the future, including additional secured and unsecured indebtedness. The indentures governing our senior secured notes do not limit incurrence by us of additional unsecured indebtedness, and will permit us to incur additional secured indebtedness subject to certain restrictions. Although our Revolving Credit Agreement contains restrictions on our ability to incur additional secured and unsecured indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to exceptions and qualifications, which allow us to incur additional secured and unsecured indebtedness in limited amounts. If we incur additional indebtedness, the risks that we face as a result of our leverage could intensify. If our financial condition or operating results deteriorate, our relations with our creditors, including the holders of our outstanding debt securities, the lenders under our Revolving Credit Agreement and our suppliers, may be materially and adversely affected.

A breach of the covenants under any of the agreements governing our indebtedness could result in an event of default under such agreements.

Our ability to comply with the covenants in the agreements and instruments governing our indebtedness will depend upon our future performance and various other factors, such as market prices for our nitrogen products, natural gas prices and other business, competitive and regulatory factors, many of which are beyond our control. We may not be able to maintain compliance with all of these covenants. In that event, we would need to seek an amendment to our debt agreements or would need to refinance our indebtedness. There can be no assurance that we can obtain future amendments or waivers of our debt agreements and instruments, or refinance our debt, and, even if we were able to do so, such relief might only last for a limited period, potentially necessitating additional amendments, waivers or refinancings. Any noncompliance by us with the covenants under our debt agreements and instruments could result in an event of default under those debt agreements and instruments. An event of default under an agreement or instrument governing any of our indebtedness may allow our creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. If our lenders or holders of our debt securities accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we may be forced to liquidate certain assets to repay all or part of our indebtedness, which could materially and adversely impair our business operations. An event of default under our Revolving Credit Agreement would permit the lenders thereunder to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under our Revolving Credit Agreement. Furthermore, our Revolving Credit Agreement and senior secured notes provide for liens on specified collateral to secure our obligations thereunder, and if we were unable to repay amounts due and payable under our Revolving Credit Agreement or the senior secured notes, our Revolving Credit Agreement lenders or holders of the senior secured notes, as applicable, could proceed against the collateral granted to them, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In the event our creditors accelerate the repayment of our indebtedness, we cannot assure that we would have sufficient assets to make such repayment.

Potential future downgrades of our credit ratings could adversely affect our access to capital and could otherwise have a material adverse effect on us.

As of

February 15, 2018

, our corporate credit rating by S&P Global Ratings (S&P) is BB+ with a negative outlook; our corporate credit rating by Moody's Investor Services, Inc. (Moody's) is Ba2 with a stable outlook; and our corporate credit rating with Fitch Ratings, Inc. (Fitch) is BB+ with a negative outlook.

These ratings and our current credit condition affect, among other things, our ability to access new capital, especially debt, and negative changes in these ratings may result in more stringent covenants and higher interest rates under the terms of any new debt. Our credit ratings were downgraded in 2016 and rating agencies could further downgrade our credit ratings or issue adverse commentaries in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. In particular, a weakening of our financial condition, including a significant increase in our leverage or decrease in our profitability or cash flows, could adversely affect our ability to obtain necessary funds, result in a credit rating downgrade or change in outlook, or otherwise increase our cost of borrowing.

Cyber security risks could result in disruptions in business operations and adverse operating results.

We rely on information technology and computer control systems in many aspects of our business, including internal and external communications, the management of our accounting, financial and supply chain functions and plant operations. Business and supply chain disruptions, plant and utility outages and information technology system and network disruptions due to cyber attacks could seriously harm our operations and materially adversely affect our operating results. Cyber security risks include attacks on information technology and infrastructure by hackers, damage or loss of information due to viruses, the unintended disclosure of confidential information, the misuse or loss of control over computer control systems, and breaches due to employee error. Our exposure to cyber security risks includes exposure through third parties on whose systems we place significant reliance for the conduct of our business. We routinely review and implement security procedures and measures in order to protect our systems and information from being vulnerable to evolving cyber attacks. We believe these measures and procedures are appropriate. However, we may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate, prevent, or recover from rapidly evolving types of cyber attacks. Compromises to our information and control systems could have severe financial and other business implications.

Adverse weather conditions may decrease demand for our fertilizer products, increase the cost of natural gas or materially disrupt our operations.

Weather conditions that delay or disrupt field work during the planting, growing, harvesting or application periods may cause agricultural customers to use different forms of nitrogen fertilizer, which may adversely affect demand for the forms that we sell or may impede farmers from applying our fertilizers until the following application period, resulting in lower seasonal demand for our products.

Adverse weather conditions during or following harvest may delay or eliminate opportunities to apply fertilizer in the fall. Weather can also have an adverse effect on crop yields, which could lower the income of growers and impair their ability to purchase fertilizer from our customers. Our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weather-related shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns.

Weather conditions or, in certain cases, weather forecasts, also can affect the price of natural gas, the principal raw material used to make our nitrogen fertilizer products. Colder than normal winters and warmer than normal summers increase the demand for natural gas for power generation and for residential and industrial use, which can increase the cost and/or decrease the availability of natural gas. In addition, adverse weather events such as very low temperatures leading to well freeze-offs or hurricanes affecting the Gulf of Mexico coastal states can impact the supply of natural gas and cause prices to rise.

Tax matters, including changes in tax laws or rates, adverse determinations by taxing authorities and imposition of new taxes could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

We are subject to taxes in the United States, where most of our operations are located, and numerous foreign jurisdictions where our subsidiaries are organized. Tax rates in various jurisdictions in which we operate may be subject to significant change. Our future effective tax rate could be affected by changes in our mix of earnings from countries with differing statutory tax rates and tax systems, changes in valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation.

We are also subject to regular reviews, examinations and audits by the IRS and other taxing authorities with respect to taxes inside and outside of the United States. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, if a taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken, we could face additional tax liability, including interest and penalties. There can be no assurance that payment of such additional amounts upon final adjudication of any disputes will not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition.

We have used the cash we generate outside the United States primarily to fund development of our business in non-U.S. jurisdictions. If the funds generated by our U.S. business are not sufficient to meet our need for cash in the United States, we may need to repatriate a portion of our future international earnings to the United States. Under the tax laws of the foreign countries in which we operate, those international earnings would be subject to withholding taxes when repatriated; therefore, the repatriation of those earnings could result in an increase in our worldwide effective tax rate and an increase in our use of cash to pay these taxes.

We also need to comply with other new, evolving or revised tax laws and regulations. The enactment of, or increases in, tariffs or value added taxes, or other changes in the application of existing taxes, in markets in which we are currently active, or may be active in the future, or on specific products that we sell or with which our products compete, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

On December 22, 2017, the president of the United States signed into law the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017 (the "Tax Act" or "Tax Reform"). The Tax Act significantly changes how the U.S. taxes corporations. The Tax Act requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required in U.S. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the Tax Act and significant estimates in calculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. The U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the Tax Act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from the interpretation currently reflected in our financial statements or tax returns. As we continue our analysis of the Tax Act, we may make adjustments to provisional amounts that we have recorded that may materially impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which such adjustments are made.

In addition, foreign governments may enact tax laws in response to the Tax Act that could result in further changes to global taxation and materially affect our financial position and results of operations.

We are reliant on a limited number of key facilities.

Our nitrogen fertilizer operations are located at nine separate nitrogen complexes, the largest of which is the Donaldsonville complex, which represented approximately

40%

of our ammonia production capacity as of

December 31, 2017

. The suspension of operations at any of these complexes could adversely affect our ability to produce our products and fulfill our commitments, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, our Donaldsonville complex is located in an area of the United States that experiences a relatively high level of hurricane or high wind activity and several of our complexes are located in areas that experience severe weather. Such storms, depending on their severity and location, have the potential not only to damage our facilities and disrupt our operations, but also to affect adversely the shipping and distribution of our products. Moreover, our facilities may be subject to failure of equipment that may be difficult to replace and could result in operational disruptions.

We are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and permitting requirements, as well as potential environmental liabilities, which may require us to make substantial expenditures.

We are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, including laws and regulations relating to the generation and handling of hazardous substances and wastes; the cleanup of hazardous substance releases; the discharge of regulated substances to air or water; and the demolition of existing plant sites upon permanent closure. In the United States, these laws include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act and various other federal, state, provincial, local and international statutes.

As a producer of nitrogen fertilizer products working with hazardous substances, our business faces risks of spills, discharges or other releases of those substances into the environment. Certain environmental laws, including CERCLA, impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault, for cleanup costs on persons who have disposed of or released hazardous substances into the environment. Given the nature of our business, we have incurred, are incurring currently, and are likely to incur periodically in the future, liabilities under CERCLA and other environmental cleanup laws at our current facilities or facilities previously owned by us or other acquired businesses, adjacent or nearby third-party facilities or offsite disposal locations. The costs associated with future cleanup activities that we may be required to conduct or finance may be material. Additionally, we may become liable to third parties for damages, including personal injury and property damage, resulting from the disposal or release of hazardous substances into the environment.

Violations of environmental, health and safety laws can result in substantial penalties, court orders to install pollution-control equipment, civil and criminal sanctions, permit revocations and facility shutdowns. Environmental, health and safety laws change regularly and have tended to become more stringent over time. As a result, we have not always been and may not always be in compliance with all environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. We may be subject to more stringent enforcement of existing or new environmental, health and safety laws in the future. Additionally, future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations or reinterpretation of current laws and regulations may require us to make substantial expenditures. Our costs to comply with, or any liabilities under, these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

From time to time, our production of anhydrous ammonia has resulted in accidental releases that have temporarily disrupted our manufacturing operations and resulted in liability for administrative penalties and claims for personal injury. To date, our costs to resolve these liabilities have not been material. However, we could incur significant costs if our liability coverage is not sufficient to pay for all or a large part of any judgments against us, or if our insurance carrier refuses coverage for these losses.



CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

We hold numerous environmental and other governmental permits and approvals authorizing operations at each of our facilities. Expansion or modification of our operations is predicated upon securing necessary environmental or other permits or approvals. A decision by a government agency to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed regulatory material permit or approval, or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or approval, or a determination that we have violated a law or permit as a result of a governmental inspection of our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at our facilities and on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. On October 26, 2015, the EPA published a final regulation lowering the national ambient air quality standard for ozone. Ozone attainment designations were due by October 1, 2017. In November 2017, the EPA issued a partial list of air quality regions that are in attainment with the 2015 ozone standard, but it has not yet promulgated the final list of air quality regions that will be classified as as being in nonattainment with the ozone standard. These regions will be subject to more stringent permitting requirements, which in turn could make it much more difficult and expensive to obtain permits to construct new facilities or expand our existing operations.

Future regulatory restrictions on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the jurisdictions in which we operate could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We are subject to GHG regulations in the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States. In the United States, our existing facilities currently are only subject to GHG emissions reporting obligations, although our new and modified facilities are likely to be subject to GHG emissions standards included in their air permits. Our facilities in the United Kingdom are subject to regulatory emissions trading systems, which generally require us to hold or obtain emissions allowances to offset GHG emissions from those aspects of our operations that are subject to regulation under this program. Our facility in Alberta, Canada has been subject to a provincial regulation requiring reductions in the facility’s net emissions intensity, which can be met by facility improvements, the purchase of emissions offsets or performance credits, or contributions to a non-profit climate change fund established by Alberta. Beginning in 2018, our facility became subject to the Carbon Competitiveness Incentive Regulation. This regulation establishes product-specific benchmarks based on the most efficient GHG emitting facilities in a sector. Similar to the existing regulation, a facility that exceeds the applicable benchmark is required to take action to reduce its GHG emissions intensity, purchase emissions offsets or performance credits, or make contributions to Alberta's climate fund.  The obligations under this regulation are being phased in over a three-year period and will be tightened over time.

Our Courtright, Ontario facility is subject to Ontario’s GHG cap-and-trade program that began in January 2017. In addition, the Canadian national government, in collaboration with Canadian provinces, has developed the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change. Among other things, the framework establishes a nationwide price on carbon emissions, which price serves as a floor for the GHG emissions reduction requirements of the separate Canadian provinces and territories. The announced plan would impose a $10 per ton (Canadian dollars) charge beginning in 2018, rising to $50 per ton by 2022. The framework provides for review of the approach taken by the national government and the provinces to address future action after 2022.

There are substantial uncertainties as to the nature, stringency and timing of any future GHG regulations. On December 12, 2015, 195 countries adopted by consensus a new international agreement known as the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement, which has been accepted by the United States and ratified by Canada and the United Kingdom, went into effect in November 2016. However, in June 2017, the United States announced its intention to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, subject to renegotiation of the Paris Agreement on terms more favorable to the United States. Under the terms of the Paris Agreement, the United States cannot formally provide notice of its withdrawal before November 2019, which would become effective one year after providing such notice. In the interim, it is unclear if the United States will comply with its commitments under the Paris Agreement. There has been no indication to date that the United States' announced withdrawal is causing other countries to also consider withdrawing from the Paris Agreement. If the Paris Agreement remains in effect, it could result in more aggressive efforts to reduce GHG emissions in the jurisdictions in which we operate.

More stringent GHG regulations, if they are enacted, are likely to have a significant impact on us, because our production facilities emit GHGs such as carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide and because natural gas, a fossil fuel, is a primary raw material used in our nitrogen production process. Regulation of GHGs may require us to make changes in our operating activities that would increase our operating costs, reduce our efficiency, limit our output, require us to make capital improvements to our facilities, increase our costs for or limit the availability of energy, raw materials or transportation, or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, to the extent that GHG restrictions are not imposed in countries where our competitors operate or are less stringent than regulations that may be imposed in the United States, Canada or the United Kingdom, our competitors may have cost or other competitive advantages over us.

We may not be successful in the expansion of our business.

We routinely consider possible expansions of our business, both within the United States and elsewhere. Major investments in our business, including as a result of acquisitions, partnerships, joint ventures, business combination transactions or other major investments require significant managerial resources, the diversion of which from our other activities may impair the operation of our business. We may be unable to identify or successfully compete for certain acquisition targets, which may hinder or prevent us from acquiring a target or completing other transactions. The risks of any expansion of our business through investments, acquisitions, partnerships, joint ventures or business combination transactions are increased due to the significant capital and other resources that we may have to commit to any such expansion, which may not be recoverable if the expansion initiative to which they were devoted is ultimately not implemented. As a result of these and other factors, including general economic risk, we may not be able to realize our projected returns from any future acquisitions, partnerships, joint ventures, business combination transactions or other major investments. Among the risks associated with the pursuit and consummation of acquisitions, partnerships, joint ventures or other major investments or business combination transactions are those involving:

•

difficulties in integrating the parties’ operations, systems, technologies, products and personnel;

•

incurrence of significant transaction-related expenses;

•

potential integration or restructuring costs;

•

potential impairment charges related to the goodwill, intangible assets or other assets to which any such transaction relates, in the event that the economic benefits of such transaction prove to be less than anticipated;

•

other unanticipated costs associated with such transactions;

•

our ability to achieve operating and financial efficiencies, synergies and cost savings;

•

our ability to obtain the desired financial or strategic benefits from any such transaction;

•

the parties’ ability to retain key business relationships, including relationships with employees, customers, partners and suppliers;

•

potential loss of key personnel;

•

entry into markets or involvement with products with which we have limited current or prior experience or in which competitors may have stronger positions;

•

assumption of contingent liabilities, including litigation;

•

exposure to unanticipated liabilities;

•

differences in the parties’ internal control environments, which may require significant time and resources to resolve in conformity with applicable legal and accounting standards;

•

increased scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations;

•

the tax effects of any such transaction; and

•

the potential for costly and time-consuming litigation, including stockholder lawsuits.

International acquisitions, partnerships, joint ventures, business combinations or investments and other international expansions of our business involve additional risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to:

•

the impact of particular economic, tax, currency, political, legal and regulatory risks associated with specific countries;

•

challenges caused by distance and by language and cultural differences;

•

difficulties and costs of complying with a wide variety of complex laws, treaties and regulations;

•

unexpected changes in regulatory environments;

•

political and economic instability, including the possibility for civil unrest;

•

nationalization of properties by foreign governments;

•

tax rates that may exceed those in the United States, and earnings that may be subject to withholding requirements;

•

the imposition of tariffs, exchange controls or other restrictions; and

•

the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations.

If we finance acquisitions, partnerships, joint ventures, business combination transactions or other major investments by issuing equity or convertible or other debt securities or loans, our existing stockholders may be diluted or we could face constraints under the terms of, and as a result of the repayment and debt-service obligations under, the additional indebtedness. A business combination transaction between us and another company could result in our stockholders receiving cash or shares of another entity on terms that such stockholders may not consider desirable. Moreover, the regulatory approvals associated with a business combination may result in divestitures or other changes to our business, the effects of which are difficult to predict.



CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

Our operating results fluctuate due to seasonality. Our inability to predict future seasonal fertilizer demand accurately could result in our having excess inventory, potentially at costs in excess of market value, or product shortages.

The fertilizer business is seasonal. The degree of seasonality of our business can change significantly from year to year due to conditions in the agricultural industry and other factors. The strongest demand for our products in North America occurs during the spring planting season, with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest. We and our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons. Seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the short application season and the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product. The seasonality of fertilizer demand generally results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring planting season.

If seasonal demand is less than we expect, we may be left with excess inventory that will have to be stored (in which case our results of operations will be negatively affected by any related increased storage costs) or liquidated (in which case the selling price may be below our production, procurement and storage costs). The risks associated with excess inventory and product shortages are exacerbated by the volatility of natural gas and nitrogen fertilizer prices and the relatively brief periods during which farmers can apply nitrogen fertilizers. If prices for our products rapidly decrease, we may be subject to inventory write-downs, adversely affecting our operating results. If seasonal demand is greater than we expect, we may experience product shortages, and customers of ours may turn to our competitors for products that they would otherwise have purchased from us.

A change in the volume of products that our customers purchase on a forward basis, or the percentage of our sales volume that is sold to our customers on a forward basis, could increase our exposure to fluctuations in our profit margins and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We offer our customers the opportunity to purchase products from us on a forward basis at prices and delivery dates we propose. Under our forward sales programs, customers generally make an initial cash down payment at the time of order and pay the remaining portion of the contract sales value in advance of the shipment date. Forward sales improve our liquidity due to the cash payments received from customers in advance of shipment of the product and allow us to improve our production scheduling and planning and the utilization of our manufacturing and distribution assets.

Any cash payments received in advance from customers in connection with forward sales are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as a current liability until the related orders are shipped, which can take up to several months.

We believe the ability to purchase products on a forward basis is most appealing to our customers during periods of generally increasing prices for nitrogen fertilizers. Our customers may be less willing or even unwilling to purchase products on a forward basis during periods of generally decreasing or stable prices or during periods of relatively high fertilizer prices due to the expectation of lower prices in the future or limited capital resources. In periods of rising fertilizer prices, selling our nitrogen fertilizers on a forward basis may result in lower profit margins than if we had not sold fertilizer on a forward basis. Conversely, in periods of declining fertilizer prices, selling our nitrogen fertilizers on a forward basis may result in higher profit margins than if we had not sold fertilizer on a forward basis. In addition, fixing the selling prices of our products, often months in advance of their ultimate delivery to customers, typically causes our reported selling prices and margins to differ from spot market prices and margins available at the time of shipment.

Our business is subject to risks involving derivatives and the risk that our hedging activities might not prevent losses.

We often utilize natural gas derivatives to hedge our financial exposure to the price volatility of natural gas, the principal raw material used in the production of nitrogen-based products. We have used futures, financial swaps and option contracts traded in the over-the-counter markets or on exchanges. In order to manage our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, from time to time, we may use foreign currency derivatives, primarily forward exchange contracts.

Our use of derivatives can result in volatility in reported earnings due to the unrealized mark-to-market adjustments that occur from changes in the value of the derivatives that do not qualify for, or to which we do not apply, hedge accounting. To the extent that our derivative positions lose value, we may be required to post collateral with our counterparties, adversely affecting our liquidity.

We have also used fixed-price, physical purchase and sales contracts to hedge our exposure to natural gas price volatility. Hedging arrangements are imperfect and unhedged risks will always exist. In addition, our hedging activities may themselves give rise to various risks that could adversely affect us. For example, we are exposed to counterparty credit risk when our derivatives are in a net asset position. The counterparties to our derivatives are multi-national commercial banks, major financial institutions or large energy companies.



CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

Our liquidity could be negatively impacted by a counterparty default on settlement of one or more of our derivative financial instruments or by the trigger of any cross default provisions or credit support requirements. Additionally, the International Swaps and Derivative Association master netting arrangements for most of our derivative instruments contain credit-risk-related contingent features, such as cross default provisions and credit support requirements. In the event of certain defaults or a credit ratings downgrade, our counterparty may request early termination and net settlement of certain derivative trades or may require us to collateralize derivatives in a net liability position.

We are subject to risk associated with our strategic venture with CHS Inc.

We may not realize the full benefits from our strategic venture with CHS that are expected. The realization of the expected benefits of the CHS strategic venture depends on our ability to operate and manage the strategic venture successfully, and on the market prices of the nitrogen fertilizer products that are the subject of our supply agreement with CHS over the life of the agreement, among other factors. Additionally, any challenges related to the CHS strategic venture could harm our relationships with CHS or our other customers.

We are exposed to risks associated with our joint venture.

We have a 50% ownership interest in PLNL, which owns and operates an ammonia production facility in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago. Our joint venture partner shares a measure of control over the operations of our PLNL joint venture. As a result, our investment in our PLNL joint venture involves risks that are different from the risks involved in owning facilities and operations independently. These risks include the possibility that our PLNL joint venture or our partner: have economic or business interests or goals that are or become inconsistent with our economic or business interests or goals; are in a position to take action contrary to (or have veto rights over) our instructions, requests, policies or objectives; subject our PLNL joint venture to liabilities exceeding those contemplated; take actions that reduce our return on investment; or take actions that harm our reputation or restrict our ability to run our business.

In addition, we may become involved in disputes with our PLNL joint venture partner, which could lead to impasses or situations that could harm the joint venture, which could reduce our revenues or increase our costs.

PLNL's ammonia plant relies on natural gas supplied, under a Gas Sales Contract (the NGC Contract), by the National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago Limited (NGC). The joint venture has experienced curtailments in the supply of natural gas from NGC, which have reduced the ammonia production at PLNL. The NGC Contract had an initial expiration date of September 2018 and has been extended on the same terms until September 2023. Any NGC commitment to supply gas beyond 2023 will need to be based on new agreements regarding volume and price. PLNL and NGC are currently parties to arbitration proceedings where the main issue remaining in dispute is PLNL's claims for damages from curtailments. Although the joint venture believes its claims against NGC to be meritorious, it is not possible to predict the outcome of the arbitration. There are significant assumptions in the future operations of the joint venture, beyond 2023, that are uncertain at this time, including the quantities of gas NGC will make available, the cost of such gas, the estimates that are used to determine the useful lives of fixed assets and the assumptions in the discounted cash flow models utilized for recoverability and impairment testing.

As part of our impairment assessment of our equity method investment in PLNL, we determined the carrying value exceeded the fair value and recognized a

$134 million

impairment charge in


. Previously, in


, we recognized an impairment charge of $62 million related to our equity method investment in PLNL. The carrying value of our equity method investment in PLNL at

December 31, 2017

is

$108 million

. Failure to secure a long-term gas supply from NGC after 2023 on a cost effective basis could adversely affect our ability to produce ammonia at the joint venture and could result in further impairment to the value of the joint venture, such as ceasing operations and writing off the remaining investment in PLNL, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

Acts of terrorism and regulations to combat terrorism could negatively affect our business.

Like other companies with major industrial facilities, we may be targets of terrorist activities. Many of our plants and facilities store significant quantities of ammonia and other materials that can be dangerous if mishandled. Any damage to infrastructure facilities, such as electric generation, transmission and distribution facilities, or injury to employees, who could be direct targets or indirect casualties of an act of terrorism, may affect our operations. Any disruption of our ability to produce or distribute our products could result in a significant decrease in revenues and significant additional costs to replace, repair or insure our assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Due to concerns related to terrorism or the potential use of certain fertilizers as explosives, we are subject to various security laws and regulations. In the United States, these security laws include the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 and the Chemical Facilities Anti-Terrorism Standards regulation. In addition, President Obama issued in 2013 Executive



CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

Order 13650 Improving Chemical Facility Safety and Security to improve chemical facility safety in coordination with owners and operators. Governmental entities could implement new or impose more stringent regulations affecting the security of our plants, terminals and warehouses or the transportation and use of fertilizers. These regulations could result in higher operating costs or limitations on the sale of our products and could result in significant unanticipated costs, lower revenues and reduced profit margins. We manufacture and sell certain nitrogen products that can be used as explosives. It is possible that governmental entities in the United States or elsewhere could impose additional limitations on the use, sale or distribution of nitrogen products, thereby limiting our ability to manufacture or sell those products, or that illicit use of our products could result in liability for us.

In October 2016, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) released its new Chemical Security Assessment Tool (CSAT 2.0) surveys and enhanced risk tiering methodology. Facilities that had previously submitted a survey response to the DHS were notified to resubmit responses to online questionnaires to be evaluated through the revised and enhanced risk tiering methodology. In April 2017, the DHS began sending tiering determination letters to chemical facilities based on the new methodology. Depending on the risk classification resulting from the application of CSAT 2.0, our plants and terminals could be subject to more stringent stringent requirements related to chemical security.

We are subject to risks associated with international operations.

Our international business operations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including difficulties and costs associated with complying with a wide variety of complex laws, treaties and regulations; unexpected changes in regulatory environments; currency fluctuations; tax rates that may exceed those in the United States; earnings that may be subject to withholding requirements; and the imposition of tariffs, exchange controls or other restrictions.

Our principal reporting currency is the U.S. dollar and our business operations and investments outside the United States increase our risk related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The main currencies to which we are exposed, besides the U.S. dollar, are the Canadian dollar, the British pound and the euro. These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and economic conditions change, including, for example, in response to sudden global economic conditions resulting from measures like the referendum in the United Kingdom in June 2016, which resulted in a vote in favor of exiting the European Union (Brexit). We may selectively reduce some foreign currency exchange rate risk by, among other things, requiring contracted purchases of our products to be settled in, or indexed to, the U.S. dollar or a currency freely convertible into U.S. dollars, or hedging through foreign currency derivatives. These efforts, however, may not be effective and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We are subject to anti-corruption laws and regulations and economic sanctions programs in various jurisdictions, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, the United Kingdom Bribery Act of 2010, the Canadian Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act, and economic sanctions programs administered by the United Nations, the European Union and the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, and regulations set forth under the Comprehensive Iran Accountability Divestment Act. As a result of doing business internationally, we are exposed to a risk of violating anti-corruption laws and sanctions regulations applicable in those countries where we, our partners or agents operate. Violations of anti-corruption and sanctions laws and regulations are punishable by civil penalties, including fines, denial of export privileges, injunctions, asset seizures, debarment from government contracts (and termination of existing contracts) and revocations or restrictions of licenses, as well as criminal fines and imprisonment. The violation of applicable laws by our employees, consultants, agents or partners could subject us to penalties and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We are subject to antitrust and competition laws in various countries throughout the world. We cannot predict how these laws or their interpretation, administration and enforcement will change over time. Changes in antitrust laws globally, or in their interpretation, administration or enforcement, may limit our existing or future operations and growth.

Deterioration of global market and economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

A slowdown of, or persistent weakness in, economic activity caused by a deterioration of global market and economic conditions could adversely affect our business in the following ways, among others: conditions in the credit markets could affect the ability of our customers and their customers to obtain sufficient credit to support their operations; the failure of our customers to fulfill their purchase obligations could result in increases in bad debts and impact our working capital; and the failure of certain key suppliers could increase our exposure to disruptions in supply or to financial losses. We also may experience declining demand and falling prices for some of our products due to our customers’ reluctance to replenish inventories. Changes in global economic conditions can arise suddenly and the full impact of such changes can be difficult to ascertain, resulting in anxiety among market participants that can persist for protracted periods. For example, concern and



CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

uncertainty over the potential impact of Brexit on the global economy has resulted in increased volatility in global financial markets. The overall impact of changes in global economic conditions on us is difficult to predict, and our business could be materially adversely impacted.

In addition, conditions in the international market for nitrogen products significantly influence our operating results. The international market for nitrogen products is influenced by such factors as currency exchange rates, including the relative value of the U.S. dollar and its impact upon the cost of importing of nitrogen products into the United States, foreign agricultural policies, the existence of, or changes in, import or foreign currency exchange barriers in certain foreign markets and the laws and policies of the markets in which we operate that affect foreign trade and investment.

Litigation

West Fertilizer Co.

On April 17, 2013, there was a fire and explosion at the West Fertilizer Co. fertilizer storage and distribution facility in West, Texas. According to published reports, 15 people were killed and approximately 200 people were injured in the incident, and the fire and explosion damaged or destroyed a number of homes and buildings around the facility. Various subsidiaries of CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (the CF Entities) have been named as defendants along with other companies in lawsuits filed in 2013, 2014 and 2015 in the District Court of McLennan County, Texas by the City of West, individual residents of the County and other parties seeking recovery for damages allegedly sustained as a result of the explosion. The cases have been consolidated for discovery and pretrial proceedings in the District Court of McLennan County under the caption "In re: West Explosion Cases." The two-year statute of limitations expired on April 17, 2015. As of that date, over 400 plaintiffs had filed claims, including at least 9 entities, 325 individuals, and 80 insurance companies. Plaintiffs allege various theories of negligence, strict liability, and breach of warranty under Texas law. Although we do not own or operate the facility or directly sell our products to West Fertilizer Co., products that the CF Entities have manufactured and sold to others have been delivered to the facility and may have been stored at the West facility at the time of the incident.

The Court granted in part and denied in part the CF Entities' Motions for Summary Judgment in August 2015. Over one hundred sixty cases have been resolved pursuant to confidential settlements that have been or we expect will be fully funded by insurance. The remaining cases are in various stages of discovery and pre-trial proceedings. The next trial is expected to be scheduled for later in 2018. We believe we have strong legal and factual defenses and intend to continue defending the CF Entities vigorously in the pending lawsuits. The Company cannot provide a range of reasonably possible loss due to the lack of damages discovery for many of the remaining claims and the uncertain nature of this litigation, including uncertainties around the potential allocation of responsibility by a jury to other defendants or responsible third parties. The recognition of a potential loss in the future in the West Fertilizer Co. litigation could negatively affect our results in the period of recognition. However, based upon currently available information, including available insurance coverage, we do not believe that this litigation will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Yazoo City Clean Air Act

On February 10, 2016, CFN was orally informed by representatives of the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) of MDEQ’s intent to impose a civil penalty of an amount exceeding $100,000 for alleged violations of certain fuel firing rate limits in the Company’s Clean Air Act Title V Permit for the Yazoo City, Mississippi facility. Representatives of the Company attended an administrative conference with MDEQ in early July 2016 to discuss MDEQ’s findings and calculation of the proposed penalty. On July 20, 2017, the Company and MDEQ executed an Agreed Order with MDEQ that that requires the Company to pay $95,625 that fully and finally resolves the alleged permit limit exceedances at issue in this matter.

Environmental

Florida Environmental Matters

On March 17, 2014, we completed the sale of our phosphate mining and manufacturing business, which was located in Florida, to Mosaic. Pursuant to the terms of the definitive agreement executed in October 2013 among CF Industries Holdings, Inc., CF Industries and Mosaic, Mosaic assumed the following environmental matters and we agreed to indemnify Mosaic with respect to losses arising out of the matters below, subject to a maximum indemnification cap and the other terms of the definitive agreement.

Clean Air Act Notice of Violation

We received a Notice of Violation (NOV) from the EPA by letter dated June 16, 2010, alleging that we violated the Prevention of Significant Deterioration Clean Air Act regulations relating to certain projects undertaken at the former Plant City, Florida facility's sulfuric acid plants. This NOV further alleges that the actions that are the basis for the alleged PSD violations also resulted in violations of Title V air operating permit regulations. Finally, the NOV alleges that we failed to comply with certain compliance dates established by hazardous air pollutant regulations for phosphoric acid manufacturing plants and phosphate fertilizer production plants. We had several meetings with the EPA with respect to this matter prior to our sale of the phosphate mining and manufacturing business in March 2014. We and Mosaic have separately had continued discussions with the EPA subsequent to our sale of the phosphate mining and manufacturing business with respect to this matter. We do not know at this time if this matter will be settled prior to initiation of formal legal action.

We cannot estimate the potential penalties, fines or other expenditures, if any, that may result from the Clean Air Act NOV and, therefore, we cannot determine if the ultimate outcome of this matter will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

EPCRA/CERCLA Notice of Violation

By letter dated July 6, 2010, the EPA issued a NOV to us alleging violations of Section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) in connection with the former Plant City facility. EPCRA requires annual reports to be submitted with respect to the use of certain toxic chemicals. The NOV also included an allegation that we violated Section 304 of EPCRA and Section 103 of CERCLA by failing to file a timely notification relating to the release of hydrogen fluoride above applicable reportable quantities. We do not know at this time if this matter will be settled prior to initiation of formal legal action.

We do not expect that penalties or fines, if any, that may arise out of the EPCRA/CERCLA matter will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Overview of CF Holdings

Our Company

We are one of the largest manufacturers and distributors of nitrogen fertilizer products and other nitrogen products in the world. Our principal customers are cooperatives, independent fertilizer distributors, farmers and industrial users. Our principal nitrogen fertilizer products are ammonia, granular urea, urea ammonium nitrate solution (UAN) and ammonium nitrate (AN). Our other nitrogen products include diesel exhaust fluid (DEF), urea liquor, nitric acid and aqua ammonia, which are sold primarily to our industrial customers, and compound fertilizer products (NPKs), which are solid granular fertilizer products for which the nutrient content is a combination of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. We operate world-class nitrogen manufacturing complexes in Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States, and distribute plant nutrients through a system of terminals, warehouses, and associated transportation equipment located primarily in the Midwestern United States. We also export nitrogen fertilizer products from our Donaldsonville, Louisiana and Yazoo City, Mississippi manufacturing facilities, and our United Kingdom manufacturing facilities in Billingham and Ince.

Our principal assets include:

•

four U.S. nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities, located in Donaldsonville, Louisiana (the largest nitrogen fertilizer complex in the world); Port Neal, Iowa; Yazoo City, Mississippi; and Woodward, Oklahoma. These facilities are owned by CF Industries Nitrogen, LLC (CFN), of which we own approximately 89% and CHS Inc. (CHS) owns the remainder. See Note

16—Noncontrolling Interests

for additional information on our strategic venture with CHS;

•

an approximately 75.3% interest in Terra Nitrogen Company, L.P. (TNCLP), a publicly traded limited partnership of which we are the sole general partner and the majority limited partner and which, through its subsidiary Terra Nitrogen, Limited Partnership (TNLP), operates a nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facility in Verdigris, Oklahoma;

•

two Canadian nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities, located in Medicine Hat, Alberta (the largest nitrogen fertilizer complex in Canada) and Courtright, Ontario;

•

two United Kingdom nitrogen manufacturing complexes, located in Billingham and Ince;



CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

•

an extensive system of terminals and associated transportation equipment located primarily in the midwestern United States; and

•

a 50% interest in Point Lisas Nitrogen Limited (PLNL), an ammonia production joint venture located in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago that we account for under the equity method.

On February 7, 2018, we announced that Terra Nitrogen GP Inc. (TNGP), the sole general partner of TNCLP and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of CF Holdings, elected to exercise its right to purchase all of the 4,612,562 publicly traded common units of TNCLP on April 2, 2018, for a cash purchase price of $84.033 per unit in accordance with the terms of TNCLP’s partnership agreement. The purchase price of $84.033 per unit was determined under the terms of TNCLP’s partnership agreement as the average of the daily closing prices per common unit for the 20 consecutive trading days beginning with January 5, 2018 and ending with February 2, 2018. The purchase price of all of the 4,612,562 publicly traded common units of TNCLP is approximately $390 million. We intend to fund the purchase with cash on hand. As of the April 2, 2018 purchase date, all rights of the holders of the units will terminate, with the exception of the right to receive payment of the purchase price. Upon completion of the purchase, we will own 100 percent of the general and limited partnership interests of TNCLP, and the common units representing limited partner interests will cease to be publicly traded or listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

Industry Factors

We operate in a highly competitive, global industry. Our operating results are influenced by a broad range of factors, including those outlined below.

Global Supply and Demand Factors

Our products are globally traded commodities and are subject to price competition. The customers for our products make their purchasing decisions principally on the basis of delivered price and, to a lesser extent, on customer service and product quality. The selling prices of our products fluctuate in response to global market conditions, changes in supply and demand and different cost factors.

Historically, global fertilizer demand has been driven primarily by population growth, gross domestic product growth, changes in dietary habits, planted acreage, and application rates, among other things. We expect these key variables to continue to have major impacts on long-term fertilizer demand for the foreseeable future. Short-term fertilizer demand growth may depend on global economic conditions, weather patterns, the level of global grain stocks relative to consumption, governmental regulations, including fertilizer subsidies or requirements mandating increased use of bio-fuels or industrial nitrogen products and farm sector income. Other geopolitical factors like temporary disruptions in fertilizer trade related to government intervention or changes in the buying/selling patterns of key exporting/consuming countries such as China, India, Russia and Brazil, among others, often play a major role in shaping near-term market fundamentals. The economics of nitrogen-based fertilizer manufacturing play a key role in decisions to increase or reduce production capacity. Supply of fertilizers is generally driven by available capacity and operating rates, raw material costs and availability, government policies and global trade. Raw materials are dependent on energy sources such as natural gas or coal; supply costs are affected by the supply of and demand for these commodities.

Over the last decade, strong demand, high capacity utilization and increasing operating margins as a result of higher global nitrogen fertilizer prices stimulated global investment in nitrogen production facilities, which resulted in an increase in global nitrogen fertilizer production capacity. As a result, global nitrogen fertilizer capacity increased faster than global nitrogen fertilizer demand, creating a surplus of global nitrogen capacity in the market, and leading to lower nitrogen fertilizer selling prices. In addition, global feedstock commodity prices declined, including coal and oil-linked gas, contributing to the lower nitrogen fertilizer prices.



CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

Global Trade in Fertilizer

In addition to the relationship between global supply and demand, profitability within a particular geographic region is determined by the supply/demand balance within that region. Regional supply and demand can be influenced significantly by factors affecting trade within regions. Some of these factors include the relative cost to produce and deliver product, relative currency values, the availability of credit and governmental trade policies. The development of additional natural gas reserves in North America over the last decade has decreased natural gas costs relative to the rest of the world, making North American nitrogen fertilizer producers more competitive. These lower natural gas costs contributed to announcements of several nitrogen fertilizer capacity expansion projects in North America, including our capacity expansion projects in Donaldsonville, Louisiana and Port Neal, Iowa, which were completed in December 2016. Changes in currency values may also alter our cost competitiveness relative to producers in other regions of the world.

Imports account for a significant portion of the nitrogen fertilizer consumed in North America. Producers of nitrogen-based fertilizers located in the Middle East, Ukraine, the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, Venezuela, North Africa, Russia and China have been major exporters to North America.

Farmers' Economics

The demand for fertilizer is affected by the aggregate crop planting decisions and fertilizer application rate decisions of individual farmers. Individual farmers make planting decisions based largely on prospective profitability of a harvest, while the specific varieties and amounts of fertilizer they apply depend on factors like their current liquidity, soil conditions, weather patterns, crop prices and the types of crops planted.



CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

Items Affecting Comparability of Results

Tax Cuts and Jobs Act

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Act" or "Tax Reform") which includes a number of changes to U.S. tax law that affect us. As a result of the Tax Act we recognized a

$491 million

income tax benefit, which has a significant impact on our 2017 financial results. This impact generally results from the following two major provisions:

•

Impact of Tax Rate Change on Deferred Tax Liabilities

- The most significant impact of Tax Reform is the reduction of the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. This change necessitates the revaluation of all of our U.S. deferred tax balances which resulted in an income tax benefit of $552 million that was recorded in 2017.

•

Transition Tax (Repatriation Tax) on Foreign Earnings and Profits

- Tax Reform requires us to pay U.S. tax on our previously untaxed foreign earnings. Foreign earnings held in the form of cash and cash equivalents are taxed at a 15.5% rate, and the remaining earnings are taxed at an 8% rate. We intend to elect to pay the transition tax in installments over an eight-year period and have recognized a tax charge and liability of $57 million in 2017 for this item.

Nitrogen Fertilizer Selling Prices

A significant amount of new nitrogen production capacity came on line in 2016 and 2017, including an increase in production capacity located in North America, which has further increased supply. Additional production capacity is expected to come on line in 2018. As a result, we expect the lower priced environment to continue until global supply and demand become more balanced through a combination of continued demand growth and supply reductions as producers respond to lower realized margins by taking higher cost production facilities off line.

The U.S. Gulf is a major global fertilizer pricing point due to the volume of nitrogen fertilizer that trades there. Through most of 2016, nitrogen pricing at the U.S. Gulf declined, often trading below parity with other international pricing points due to continued imports from various exporting regions and delayed North American buyer interest as a result of greater global nitrogen supply availability. Seasonal decreases in agricultural demand combined with delayed customer purchasing activity resulted in multi-year lows in nitrogen fertilizer selling prices in the second half of 2016. Early in the first quarter of 2017, prices began to increase as the supply and demand balance tightened in anticipation of spring fertilizer demand for the planting and growing season. However, as the first quarter progressed, increased imports into North America increased fertilizer supply in the region, which pressured selling prices downward as the quarter ended. During the second quarter of 2017, excess supply through imports into the United States that occurred in the first quarter of 2017 continued in the second quarter, negatively impacting selling prices. During the third quarter of 2017, prices hit yearly lows and then selling prices for most nitrogen products increased throughout the quarter, ending higher than at the beginning of the quarter, driven by significantly lower Chinese exports, higher energy and production costs in parts of the world, a weaker U.S. dollar and strong global demand. During the fourth quarter of 2017, certain announced nitrogen industry capacity additions that were expected to occur, were delayed, and certain maintenance outages all led to a favorable supply demand balance and contributed to a rise in nitrogen pricing.

The significant price fluctuations we have experienced in 2017 are symptoms of a market in transition as new capacity comes on line and global trade flows adjust, and this transition is not complete. We expect the final set of North American capacity additions to come fully on line by mid-2018. Should imports of nitrogen products into North America continue at high rates, the oversupply in the region will continue, which could lead to lower prices, similar to those experienced in early 2017. New global nitrogen capacity additions coming on line after 2018 are expected to be lower than recent years, which will support the market transition or more balanced supply and demand.

The greater global nitrogen supply availability and resulting low nitrogen fertilizer selling prices significantly impacted our results. The average selling price for our products for


,


and


was

$207

per ton,

$217

per ton and

$314

per ton, respectively. The decline in average selling prices from 2016 to 2017 reduced net sales by $293 million, while the decline in average selling prices from 2015 to 2016 reduced net sales by $1.4 billion. In addition to the direct impact of lower selling prices, during periods of declining prices, customers tend to delay purchasing fertilizer in anticipation of prices in the future being lower than current prices.

Depreciation and amortization

Total depreciation and amortization expense recognized in

and


was

$883 million

,

$678 million

and

$480 million

, respectively. This increase in depreciation expense reflects the completion of our capacity expansion projects and placing in service all five of the new plants prior to the end of 2016. The capacity expansion projects were originally announced in 2012 and included the construction of new ammonia, urea, and UAN plants at our Donaldsonville, Louisiana complex and new ammonia and urea plants at our Port Neal, Iowa complex. These plants increased our overall production capacity by approximately 25%, improved our product mix flexibility at Donaldsonville, and improved our ability to serve upper-Midwest urea customers from our Port Neal location. The following table indicates the quarter in which each of the five expansion plants were placed in service.

Depreciation expense pertaining to each of our capacity expansion plants commenced once the applicable plant was placed in service.

Unrealized net mark-to-market loss (gain) on natural gas derivatives

Natural gas is typically the largest and most volatile single component of the manufacturing cost for nitrogen-based products. We manage the risk of changes in natural gas prices through the use of derivative financial instruments. The derivatives that we use for this purpose are primarily natural gas fixed price swaps and natural gas options. We use natural gas derivatives as an economic hedge of natural gas price risk, but without the application of hedge accounting. This can result in volatility in reported earnings due to the unrealized mark-to-market adjustments that occur from changes in the value of the derivatives, which is reflected in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations. In


,


and


, we recognized unrealized net mark-to-market losses (gains) on natural gas derivatives of

$61 million

,

$(260) million

and

$176 million

, respectively.

Loss (gain) on foreign currency transactions including intercompany loans

In


,


and


, we recognized losses (gains) of

$2 million

,

$93 million

and

$(8) million

, respectively, from the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on primarily British pound and Canadian dollar denominated intercompany loans that were not permanently invested.

Equity method investment tax contingency accrual

The Trinidad tax authority (the Board of Inland Revenue) has issued a tax assessment against our equity method investment in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, PLNL, related to a dispute over whether tax depreciation must be claimed during a tax holiday period that was granted to PLNL under the Trinidad Fiscal Incentives Act. The tax holiday was granted as an incentive to construct PLNL’s ammonia plant. Based on the facts and circumstances of this matter, PLNL recorded a tax contingency accrual, which reduced our equity in earnings of PLNL for


by approximately

$7 million

reflecting our 50% ownership interest. In early 2018, PLNL settled this matter with the Board of Inland Revenue for the amounts accrued.

Strategic venture with CHS

We commenced a strategic venture with CHS on February 1, 2016, at which time CHS purchased a minority equity interest in CFN for $2.8 billion. CHS also began receiving deliveries pursuant to a supply agreement under which CHS has the right to purchase annually from CFN up to approximately 1.1 million tons of granular urea and 580,000 tons of UAN at market prices. As a result of its minority equity interest in CFN, CHS is entitled to semi-annual cash distributions from CFN. We are also entitled to semi-annual cash distributions from CFN. The amounts of distributions from CFN to us and CHS are based generally on the profitability of CFN and determined based on the volume of granular urea and UAN sold by CFN to us and CHS pursuant to supply agreements, less a formula driven amount based primarily on the cost of natural gas used to produce the granular urea and UAN, and adjusted for the allocation of items such as operational efficiencies and overhead amounts.

We began recognizing the noncontrolling interest pertaining to CHS’ ownership interest in CFN on February 1, 2016. During


and


, we recognized earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest in CFN of

$73 million

and



CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

Under the terms of our strategic venture with CHS, if our credit rating as determined by two of three specified credit rating agencies is below certain levels, we are required to make a non-refundable yearly payment of $5 million to CHS. Since our credit ratings were below certain levels in 2016 and 2017, we made a payment of $5 million to CHS in each year. These payments will continue on a yearly basis until the earlier of the date that our credit rating is upgraded to or above certain levels by two of three specified credit rating agencies or February 1, 2026. This obligation is recognized on our consolidated balance sheets as an embedded derivative. During

Debt activity

On December 1, 2017, we redeemed all of the $800 million outstanding principal amount of the 6.875% senior notes due May 2018 (the 2018 Notes) in accordance with the optional redemption provisions provided in the indenture governing the 2018 Notes. The total aggregate redemption price was approximately $817 million. On December 26, 2017, we purchased approximately $300 million aggregate principal amount of the $800 million outstanding principal amount of the 7.125% senior notes due 2020 (the 2020 Notes) pursuant to a tender offer. The aggregate purchase price was approximately

$331 million

. As a result of the early redemption of the 2018 Notes and the purchase of the 2020 Notes, we recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of

$53 million

, primarily consisting of $48 million of total premiums paid for the early retirement of debt for the 2018 Notes and 2020 Notes.

In the fourth quarter of 2016, due to the uncertain duration of the prevailing low nitrogen fertilizer selling price environment and in order to provide liquidity and covenant flexibility for the future, we took certain steps with respect to the Revolving Credit Agreement and our senior notes due 2022, 2025 and 2027 (the Private Senior Notes). On November 21, 2016, we prepaid the $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of the Private Senior Notes, and paid the related make-whole amount of approximately $170 million. We made the prepayment and make-whole payment using the proceeds from an offering of

$1.25 billion

aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes consisting of $500 million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due 2021 and $750 million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due 2026 (collectively referred to as the “Senior Secured Notes”). We recognized $167 million of the $170 million cash make-whole payment on the Private Senior Notes as a loss on debt extinguishment, with the $3 million remainder being a debt modification cost that is being amortized over the term of the Senior Secured Notes.

In connection with the completion of the offering of the Senior Secured Notes and the prepayment of the Private Senior Notes in November 2016, certain amendments to the Revolving Credit Agreement became effective. The amendments included, among other things, changes in and additions to the financial and other covenants and a reduction in the size of the facility from $1.5 billion to $750 million.

In conjunction with our debt restructuring, including amendments to the Revolving Credit Agreement, we recognized $18 million of debt issuance and amendment fees in 2016. See further discussion under "Liquidity and Capital Resources" below and Note

CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

Transaction costs and

t

ermination of agreement with OCI

On August 6, 2015, we entered into a definitive agreement (as amended, the Combination Agreement) to combine with the European, North American and global distribution businesses of OCI N.V. (OCI). On May 22, 2016, CF Holdings, OCI and the other parties to the Combination Agreement entered into a termination agreement (the Termination Agreement) under which the parties agreed to terminate the Combination Agreement by mutual written consent. Pursuant to the Termination Agreement, CF Holdings paid OCI a termination fee of

$150 million

. Under the Termination Agreement, the parties to the Combination Agreement also agreed to release each other from any and all claims, actions, obligations, liabilities, expenses and fees in connection with, arising out of or related to the Combination Agreement and all ancillary agreements contemplated thereby (other than the confidentiality agreement between CF Holdings and OCI) or the transactions contemplated therein or thereby.

In


, we incurred

$179 million

of transaction costs associated with the proposed combination with certain businesses of OCI and our strategic venture with CHS. This includes the

$150 million

termination fee paid to OCI in the second quarter of 2016, which is described above, and costs for various consulting and legal services. In


, we incurred

$57 million

of transaction costs associated with the proposed combination with certain businesses of OCI, our strategic venture with CHS, and the acquisition of the remaining 50% equity interest in CF Fertilisers UK not previously owned by us.

On September 18, 2015, in connection with our proposed combination with OCI, we entered into a senior unsecured 364-day Bridge Credit Agreement (as amended, the Bridge Credit Agreement). Upon the termination of the Combination Agreement on May 22, 2016, the lenders' commitment under the Bridge Credit Agreement terminated automatically and we recognized

$28 million

in bridge loan commitment fees. In


, we recognized

$6 million

of fees related to the initiation of the bridge loan.

CF Fertilisers UK acquisition

On July 31, 2015, we acquired the remaining 50% equity interest in CF Fertilisers UK Group Limited (formerly known as GrowHow UK Group Limited) (CF Fertilisers UK) not previously owned by us for total consideration of $570 million, and CF Fertilisers UK became a wholly owned subsidiary. Upon the acquisition, we recognized a

$94 million

gain on the remeasurement to fair value of our initial 50% equity investment in CF Fertilisers UK. CF Fertilisers UK Limited (formerly known as GrowHow UK Limited), a wholly owned subsidiary of CF Fertilisers UK, operates

two

nitrogen manufacturing complexes in the United Kingdom, in the cities of Ince and Billingham. This transaction increased our manufacturing capacity with the acquisition of CF Fertilisers UK’s nitrogen manufacturing complexes. The Ince complex is located in northwestern England and consists of an ammonia plant, three nitric acid plants, an AN plant and three NPK plants. The Billingham complex is located in the Teesside chemical area in northeastern England, and consists of an ammonia plant, three nitric acid plants, a carbon dioxide plant and an AN fertilizer plant.

Equity method investments

In the fourth quarter of 2017, we recognized a gain of

$14 million

related to the sale of our interest in a joint venture that owns a carbon dioxide liquefaction and purification facility. During


, we recognized a loss of

$43 million

related to the sale of our 50% investment in Keytrade AG and the sale of our 50% investment in an ammonia storage joint venture in Houston, Texas.

Our equity in earnings (losses) of operating affiliates for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, includes an impairment charge of our equity method investment in PLNL of

$134 million

and

$62 million

, respectively. PLNL is our joint venture investment in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago and operates an ammonia plant that relies on natural gas supplied by the National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago Limited (NGC) pursuant to a gas sales contract (the NGC Contract). PLNL had experienced curtailments in the supply of natural gas from NGC, which reduced the ammonia production at PLNL. See "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" below, for additional information.

CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

Financial Executive Summary

Net earnings (loss)

We reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of

$358 million

in


compared to a net loss of

$277 million

in


, or an increase in net earnings between the periods of

$635 million

. Tax Reform had a significant impact on our reported results in 2017 as we recognized

$491 million

of income in our tax provision related to the enactment of Tax Reform in the United States. Further information regarding the impact of Tax Reform can be found above under "Items Affecting Comparability of Results—Tax Cuts and Jobs Act." Diluted net earnings per share attributable to common stockholders was

$1.53

in


compared to diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders of

$1.19

in


, or an increase of

$2.72

per share. The impact of Tax Reform added

$2.10

to diluted earnings per share in 2017.

(Loss) earnings before income taxes

Earnings before income taxes increased by

$101 million

to a loss of

$125 million

in 2017 from a loss of

$226 million

in 2016. The increase in earnings before income taxes is due to a combination of the following three categories of items which are described below:

•

$617 million of charges that were recognized in 2016 that did not reoccur in 2017; partially offset by

•

$410 million

reduction in gross margin from operations; and

•

$108 million increase in net interest expense.

Significant charges in 2016

In 2016, we recognized $617 million of certain significant charges from the following items:

•

Transaction costs of

$179 million

pertaining to our proposed combination with certain businesses of OCI (that was ultimately terminated in 2016) and costs associated with establishing our strategic venture with CHS.

•

An impairment charge of

$134 million

related to our investment in Point Lisas Nitrogen Limited.

•

We took actions in both 2016 and 2017 to make modifications to our outstanding debt in response to changes in market conditions.  Losses on debt extinguishments declined by

$114 million

as 2016 had losses of

$167 million

and 2017 had losses of

$53 million

.

•

Other operating expenses declined by $190 million in 2017 from an expense of $208 million in 2016 to an expense of $18 million in 2017. Other operating expenses are primarily pertaining to losses on foreign currency exchange rate impacts of the British pound and Canadian dollar on certain intercompany loans, certain costs pertaining to our capacity expansion projects and fair value adjustments for a derivative related to our strategic venture with CHS.

Gross margin from operations in 2017

As discussed earlier in "Overview of CF Holdings—Industry Factors and Items Affecting Comparability of Results," our operating results continue to be impacted by a surplus of capacity in the nitrogen industry, which has impacted product selling prices. Industry pricing conditions in 2017 declined early in the year to multi-year lows as oversupply conditions persisted, but selling prices rose as the year ended when supply and demand conditions were more in balance due to delays in the start-up of certain new industry capacity and stronger demand in certain regions. Our results in 2017 also included the full impact of all of our new capacity expansion plants. As a result, we set both production and sales volume records in 2017.

Our gross margin declined by

$410 million

in


to

$430 million

from

$840 million

in


. The following major factors contributed to the decline in gross margin:

•

a higher unrealized net mark-to-market

loss

on natural gas derivatives, which decreased gross margin by

$321 million

as


included a

$61 million

loss and


included a

$260 million

gain,

•

a

decrease

in average selling prices of

5%

, which reduced gross margin by $293 million, including the impact of foreign currency exchange rates. In


, the average selling prices for ammonia, UAN and granular urea declined by

13%

,

11%

, and

3%

, respectively, while the average selling price for AN increased by

10%

,

•

an increase in physical natural gas costs in


, partially offset by the impact of natural gas derivatives that settled in the period, which decreased gross margin by $162 million as compared to


, and



CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

•

the impact of an increase in depreciation and amortization, excluding the impact from higher sales volume, of

$160 million

in 2017 as compared to 2016 due primarily to the completion and start-up of our capacity expansion projects,

•

partially offset by an

increase

in sales volume of

18%

, which

increase

d gross margin by $275 million, primarily driven by an increase in sales volume for ammonia and granular urea of

43%

and

21%

, respectively,

•

targeted cost reduction initiatives and production efficiencies due to increased volume, and

•

start-up costs of

$52 million

in 2016 for the new ammonia plants at our Donaldsonville and Port Neal facilities.

Interest expense

—

net

Net interest expense increased by

$108 million

to

$303 million

in 2017 from

$195 million

in 2016. The increase is due primarily to a decrease in the amount of interest capitalized due to the completion of our capacity expansion projects in 2016.

Cash Position

Our cash and cash equivalents balance was

$835 million

at December 31, 2017, a decline of $329 million from

$1.16 billion

at December 31, 2016. During 2017, our cash balance was significantly impacted by the following events, which are further described in "Liquidity and Capital Resources" below.

•

Receipt of a federal tax refund of $815 million due to the carryback of certain tax losses primarily arising from our capacity expansion projects

•

Early redemption and purchase of $1.1 billion in aggregate principal amount of certain senior notes due in 2018 and 2020

CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

Year Ended

December 31, 2017

Compared to Year Ended

December 31, 2016

Net Sales

Our net sales are derived primarily from the sale of nitrogen fertilizers and are determined by the quantities of fertilizers we sell and the selling prices we realize. The volumes, mix and selling prices we realize are determined to a great extent by a combination of global and regional supply and demand factors. Net sales also include shipping and handling costs that are billed to our customers. Sales incentives are reported as a reduction in net sales.

Our total net sales

increased

$445 million

, or

12%

, to

$4.13 billion

in


compared to

$3.69 billion

in


due to an

18%

increase

in sales volume, which

increase

d net sales by $738 million, partially offset by a

5%

decrease

in average selling prices, which reduced net sales by $293 million.

Average selling prices were

$207

per ton in


compared to

$217

per ton in


due primarily to lower ammonia, UAN and granular urea average selling prices in


. Selling prices were negatively impacted by greater supply availability which continues to pressure selling prices globally. During the fourth quarter of 2017, certain announced nitrogen industry capacity additions that were expected to occur, were delayed, and certain maintenance outages all led to a favorable supply demand balance and contributed to a rise in nitrogen pricing.

The

increase

in total sales volume of

18%

was due primarily to higher ammonia and granular urea sales volumes, driven by increased production from the completion of our capacity expansion projects in December 2016.

Cost of Sales

Our cost of sales includes manufacturing costs, purchased product costs, and distribution costs. Manufacturing costs, the most significant element of cost of sales, consist primarily of raw materials, realized and unrealized gains and losses on natural gas derivative instruments, maintenance, direct labor, depreciation and other plant overhead expenses. Purchased product costs primarily include the cost to purchase nitrogen fertilizers to augment or replace production at our facilities. Distribution costs include the cost of freight required to transport finished products from our plants to our distribution facilities and storage costs incurred prior to final shipment to customers.

Our cost of sales

increased

$855 million

, or

30%

, from


to


. The increase in cost of sales was primarily due to the impact of higher sales volume, higher unrealized net mark-to-market

loss

es on natural gas derivatives and higher realized natural gas costs, including the impact of realized derivatives, in addition to higher depreciation expense related to the completion of our capacity expansion projects and placing those assets into service. These increases to cost of sales were partially offset by targeted cost reduction initiatives, production efficiencies due to increased volume in 2017 and the absence of start-up costs of the new ammonia plant at our Donaldsonville facility and the new ammonia and urea plants at our Port Neal facility that occurred in 2016. The cost of sales per ton averaged

$185

in


, a

10%

increase from

$168

per ton in


. Cost of sales includes a

$61 million

unrealized net mark-to-market loss in


compared to a

$260 million

unrealized net mark-to-market gain in


. Additionally, realized natural gas costs, including the impact of realized derivatives, increased

11%

from

$3.07

per MMBtu in 2016 to

$3.40

in 2017.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of corporate office expenses such as salaries and other payroll-related costs for our executive, administrative, legal, financial and marketing functions, as well as certain taxes and insurance and other professional service fees, including those for corporate initiatives.

Selling, general and administrative expenses

increase

d

$18 million

to

$192 million

in


from

$174 million

in


. The

increase

was due primarily to the combination of certain corporate office initiatives and higher incentive compensation due to improvements in operating performance.

Transaction Costs

Transaction costs consist of various consulting and legal services associated with the proposed combination with certain businesses of OCI that was terminated on May 22, 2016; our strategic venture with CHS, which began on February 1, 2016; and our July 31, 2015 acquisition of the remaining 50% equity interest in CF Fertilisers UK not previously owned by us.

In


, we incurred

$179 million

of transaction costs, including the

$150 million

termination fee paid to OCI in the second quarter of 2016 as a result of the termination of the Combination Agreement and costs for various consulting and legal services.



CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

Other Operating—Net

Other operating—net includes administrative costs that do not relate directly to our central operations and costs associated with our capacity expansion projects. Costs included in "other costs" can include foreign exchange gains and losses, unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency derivatives, costs associated with our closed facilities, amounts recorded for environmental remediation for other areas of our business, litigation expenses and gains and losses on the disposal of fixed assets.

Other operating—net was

$18 million

of expense in


compared to

$208 million

of expense in


. The decreased expense was due primarily to a

$93 million

loss in


from the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on primarily British pound and Canadian dollar denominated intercompany loans that were not permanently invested. Due to a restructuring of certain intercompany loans, we did not incur the same level of foreign exchange rate impacts in


. The decreased expense is also due to expansion project expenses in


of

$73 million

, generally consisting of administrative and other project costs that did not qualify for capitalization, and a

$23 million

charge representing the net fair value adjustments to an embedded derivative related to our strategic venture with CHS. See Note

8—Fair Value Measurements

for additional information.

Equity in Earnings (Losses) of Operating Affiliates

Equity in earnings (losses) of operating affiliates primarily consists of our

50%

ownership interest in PLNL. We include our share of the net earnings from our equity method investment in PLNL as an element of earnings from operations because this investment provides additional production and is integrated with our other supply chain and sales activities. Our share of the net earnings includes the amortization of certain tangible and intangible assets identified as part of the application of purchase accounting at acquisition. In 2016, equity in earnings (losses) of operating affiliates also includes impairment of our equity method investment in PLNL.

Equity in earnings (losses) of operating affiliates was

$9 million

of earnings in


compared to

$145 million

of losses in


. Earnings in


includes a gain of

$14 million

related to the sale of our interest in a joint venture that owns a carbon dioxide liquefaction and purification facility. In the fourth quarter of


, we recognized a

$134 million

impairment of our equity method investment in PLNL. For additional information regarding the impairment of our equity method investment in PLNL, see "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates," below, and Note

7—Equity Method Investments

.

Interest Expense—Net

Our interest expense—net includes the interest expense on our long-term debt, amortization of the related fees required to execute financing agreements and annual fees pursuant to our Revolving Credit Agreement. Capitalized interest relating to the construction of major capital projects reduces interest expense as the interest is capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful lives of the facility along with all other construction costs. Our interest expense—net also includes interest income, which represents amounts earned on our cash, cash equivalents and investments.

Net interest expense increased by

$108 million

to

$303 million

in


from

$195 million

in 2015. The

$108 million

increase

was due primarily to a decrease in the amount of interest capitalized due to the completion of our capacity expansion projects. In


, capitalized interest was

$166 million

compared to

$2 million

in


. Net interest expense in


also includes the amortization of capitalized bridge credit agreement fees of $28 million pertaining to the bridge loan for our proposed combination with certain businesses of OCI. Upon the termination of the proposed combination with OCI, the unamortized portion of these fees was expensed.

During


, due to the uncertain duration of the prevailing low nitrogen fertilizer selling price environment and in order to provide liquidity and covenant flexibility for the future, we modified the Revolving Credit Agreement by reducing its size from $2.0 billion to $750 million and modifying certain covenants and other terms. As a result of these changes, we recognized

$16 million

of debt amendment fees and accelerated amortization of loan fees in interest expense in


.

Loss on Debt Extinguishment

Loss on debt extinguishment of

$53 million

in 2017 primarily consists of premiums paid for the early retirement of debt for the 2018 Notes and 2020 Notes. Loss on debt extinguishment of

$167 million

in 2016 consists of the make-whole payment, which resulted from our November 21, 2016 prepayment of the $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of Private Senior Notes. The loss on debt extinguishment of

$167 million

excludes $3 million (of the $170 million make-whole payment), which was accounted for as a modification and recognized on our consolidated balance sheet as deferred financing fees, a reduction of long-term debt, and is being amortized using the effective interest rate method over the term of the Senior Secured Notes.



CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

Income Tax (Benefit) Provision

Our income tax benefit for


was

$575 million

on a pre-tax loss of

$125 million

, compared to an income tax benefit of

$68 million

on a pre-tax loss of

$226 million

in the prior year. The higher income tax benefit in


is due primarily to the impact of the Tax Act, which resulted in an income tax benefit of

$491 million

recorded in the fourth quarter of


, reflecting our best estimate of the impact of the Tax Act.

The primary impact of the Tax Act is the revaluation of all of our U.S. deferred tax balances, as result of the reduction of the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, which resulted in an income tax benefit of $552 million that was recorded in 2017. This income tax benefit was partially offset by a tax charge and liability of $57 million, which represents our best estimate of the transition tax, or repatriation tax, on foreign earnings and profits, as described above under "Items Affecting Comparability—Tax Cuts and Jobs Act."

In addition, in both years, our effective tax rate is impacted by earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in CFN and TNCLP, as our consolidated income tax (benefit) provision does not include a tax provision on the earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interests. As a result, earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interests of

$92 million

and

$119 million

in 2017 and 2016, respectively, which are included in our pre-tax loss, impact the effective tax rate in both years. See Note

16—Noncontrolling Interests

for additional information.

Due primarily to the

$491 million

income tax benefit from the Tax Act, we recognized a

$575 million

income tax benefit in 2017 on a pre-tax loss of $125 million. Our effective tax rate in 2017, exclusive of the tax benefit from the Tax Act and exclusive of the earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interests of $92 million from our pre-tax loss, results in an effective tax rate of 38.8%. Our effective tax rate in 2016, exclusive of the earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interests of $119 million from our pre-tax income, resulted in an effective tax rate of 19.6%.

In the fourth quarter of 2016, we determined the carrying value of our equity method investment in PLNL exceeded fair value and recognized an impairment of our equity method investment in PLNL of

$134 million

, which is included in the equity in earnings of operating affiliates. Our 2016 income tax provision does not include a tax benefit for the impairment of our equity method investment as it will not give rise to a tax deduction, which reduced our 2016 effective tax rate.

Both 2017 and 2016 were impacted by additional discrete tax items. See Note

9—Income Taxes

for additional information.

Net Earnings Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests

Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests includes the net earnings attributable to the

24.7%

interest of the publicly-held common units of TNCLP. We own approximately

75.3%

of TNCLP and outside investors own the remaining

24.7%

. Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests also includes the net earnings attributable to the approximately 11% CHS minority equity interest in CFN, a subsidiary of CF Holdings, purchased for

$2.8 billion

on February 1, 2016.

Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests

decreased

$27 million

in


compared to


due primarily to lower earnings from both CFN and TNCLP as both were impacted by lower average selling prices due to greater global nitrogen supply availability due to global capacity additions. The earnings of CFN were also impacted by higher natural gas prices and the impact of higher depreciation as a result of the completion of our capacity expansion projects and placing those assets into service.

Diluted Net Earnings (Loss) Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders

Diluted net earnings (loss) per share attributable to common stockholders, including the impact of Tax Reform,

increase

d

$2.72

to earnings of

$1.53

per share in


from a loss of

$1.19

per share in


. This

increase

is due primarily to the impact of Tax Reform partially offset by lower gross margin primarily driven by an increase in unrealized net mark-to-market losses on natural gas derivatives, the impact of lower selling prices due to greater global nitrogen supply availability, higher realized natural gas costs, including the impact of realized derivatives, and higher depreciation expense.

Net Sales

Our total net sales

decreased

$623 million

, or

14%

, to

$3.69 billion

in


compared to

$4.31 billion

in


. The impact of the CF Fertilisers UK acquisition increased our net sales by $269 million, or 6%. The remaining decline in our net sales of $892 million, or 21%, was due to a 31% decline in average selling prices partially offset by a 14% increase in sales volume.



CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

Average selling prices, excluding the CF Fertilisers UK acquisition impact, were $218 per ton in


compared to $318 per ton in


due primarily to lower selling prices across all products. Selling prices were negatively impacted by excess global nitrogen supply. Pricing for nitrogen fertilizer products in the U.S. Gulf declined during most of 2016, often trading below parity with other international pricing points, as a result of continued imports from various exporting regions and decreased buyer interest. Seasonal decreases in agricultural demand combined with delayed customer purchasing activity resulted in multi-year lows in nitrogen fertilizer selling prices in the second half of the year.

Our total sales volume increased by 24% from


to


. The impact of the CF Fertilisers UK acquisition increased our sales volume by 10%. The remaining increase in our sales volume of 14% was due primarily to greater granular urea and UAN volume available for sale due to our completed capacity expansion projects, partly offset by lower ammonia sales volume due to lower demand in North America during the fall application season. In addition, our ammonia sales volumes were lower in 2016 as we upgraded existing ammonia production as a result of our granular urea and UAN capacity expansion projects coming on line at our Donaldsonville, Louisiana complex.

Cost of Sales

Our cost of sales increased

$84 million

, or

3%

, from


to


. The overall increase in cost of sales is due primarily to the impact of the CF Fertilisers UK acquisition, which increased cost of sales by $251 million, or 9%, as


includes a full year of CF Fertilisers UK results and 2015 includes five months of CF Fertilisers UK results. The remaining decrease in our cost of sales of $167 million, or 6%, was due primarily to the combination of unrealized net mark-to-market gains on natural gas derivatives and lower realized natural gas costs, partly offset by higher capacity expansion project related costs. Cost of sales includes a

$260 million

unrealized net mark-to-market gain in


as compared to a

$176 million

unrealized net mark-to-market loss in


. Realized natural gas costs, including the impact of lower purchased natural gas costs and realized derivatives, declined

6%

from

$3.28

per MMBtu in


to

$3.07

per MMBtu in


as natural gas prices were lower in

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased

$4 million

to

$174 million

in


from

$170 million

in


. The increase was due primarily to the impact of the CF Fertilisers UK acquisition, partly offset by lower costs for corporate office initiatives and lower intangible asset amortization expense.

Transaction Costs

In


, we incurred

$179 million

of transaction costs associated with the proposed combination with certain businesses of OCI and our strategic venture with CHS. This includes the $150 million termination fee paid by CF Holdings to OCI in the second quarter of


as a result of the termination of the Combination Agreement and costs for various consulting and legal services. In


, we incurred

$57 million

of transaction costs associated with the proposed combination with certain businesses of OCI, our strategic venture with CHS and the acquisition of the remaining 50% equity interest in CF Fertilisers UK not previously owned by us.

Other Operating—Net

Other operating—net was

$208 million

in


compared to

$92 million

in


. The increased expense was due primarily to

$93 million

of realized and unrealized losses on foreign currency transactions primarily related to British pound denominated intercompany debt that has not been permanently invested. In addition, the increased expense also reflects higher expansion project costs pertaining to our Donaldsonville, Louisiana and Port Neal, Iowa capacity expansion projects that did not qualify for capitalization and the loss of

$23 million

representing the net fair value adjustments to an embedded derivative related to our strategic venture with CHS. See Note

Interest Expense—Net

Net interest expense increased by

$64 million

to

$195 million

in


from

$131 million

in


. The

$64 million

increase in net interest expense was due primarily to the combination of higher debt levels due to the issuance of $1.0 billion of Private Senior Notes in September 2015 and debt amendment fees and accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs due to the restructuring of our debt and the Revolving Credit Agreement in


. Due to the uncertain duration of the prevailing low nitrogen fertilizer selling price environment and in order to provide liquidity and covenant flexibility for the future, we modified the Revolving Credit Agreement in 2016 by reducing its size from $2.0 billion to $750 million and modifying certain covenants and other terms. As a result of these changes, we recognized

$16 million

of debt amendment fees and accelerated amortization of loan fees in interest expense. The increase in interest expense—net in


also includes the amortization of capitalized Bridge Credit Agreement fees of $28 million pertaining to the bridge loan for our proposed combination with certain of the OCI businesses. We also recorded capitalized interest of

$166 million

in


related primarily to our capacity expansion projects compared to

$154 million

in


.

Loss on Debt Extinguishment

Loss on debt extinguishment of

$167 million

in 2016 consists of the make-whole payment, which resulted from our November 21, 2016 prepayment of the $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of Private Senior Notes. This amount excludes $3 million (of the $170 million make-whole payment), which was accounted for as a modification and recognized on our consolidated balance sheet as deferred financing fees, a reduction of long-term debt, and is being amortized using the effective interest rate method over the term of the Senior Secured Notes.

Income Tax (Benefit) Provision

Our income tax benefit for


was $68 million on a pre-tax loss of $226 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 30.0%, compared to an income tax provision of $396 million on pre-tax income of $1.06 billion, or an effective tax rate of 37.4%, in the prior year.

State income taxes for


were favorably impacted by investment tax credits of $13 million related to capital assets placed in service at our production facilities in Oklahoma that are indefinitely available to offset income taxes in that jurisdiction in future years. Our effective state income tax rate was also reduced as a result of the changes to our legal entity structure effected in the first quarter of 2016 as part of our strategic venture with CHS. See Note

16—Noncontrolling Interests

for additional information.

State income taxes for


includes a tax benefit of $46 million, net of federal tax effect, for state net operating loss carryforwards.

The income tax provision for


includes the tax impact of the recaptured U.S. manufacturing profits deductions claimed in prior years that will not be deductible as a result of our intention to carryback the tax net operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2016 to those prior tax years.

Non-deductible capital costs for the tax year ended December 31, 2016 include certain transaction costs capitalized in the prior year that are now deductible as a result of the termination of the proposed combination with certain businesses of OCI.

Foreign subsidiaries of the Company have incurred capital losses of $109 million that are indefinitely available to offset capital gains in those foreign jurisdictions. As the future realization of these carryforwards is not anticipated, a valuation allowance of $28 million was recorded in

$134 million

and

$62 million

,



CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

respectively, which is included in the equity in earnings of operating affiliates. Our respective income tax provisions do not include a tax benefit for the impairment of our equity method investment as it will not give rise to a tax deduction.

During the third quarter of


, we acquired the remaining 50% equity interest in CF Fertilisers UK not previously owned by us and recognized a $94 million gain on the remeasurement to fair value of our initial 50% equity interest in CF Fertilisers UK. The earnings in CF Fertilisers UK have been permanently reinvested. Therefore, the recognition of the $94 million million gain on the remeasurement of the historical equity investment does not include the recognition of tax expense on the gain.

In addition, our effective tax rate is impacted by earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in CFN and TNCLP, as our consolidated income tax provision does not include a tax provision on the earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interests. As a result, earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interests of

$119 million

and

$34 million

in 2016 and 2015, respectively, which are included in (loss) earnings before income taxes and equity in earnings of non-operating affiliates, impact the effective tax rate in both years. Earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests increased in


due to our strategic venture with CHS that commenced on February 1, 2016, at which time CHS purchased a minority equity interest in CFN. See Note

Operating Results by Business Segment

Our reportable segment structure reflects how our chief operating decision maker, as defined in the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP), assesses the performance of our reportable segments and makes decisions about resource allocation. These segments are differentiated by products. Our management uses gross margin to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. Total other operating costs and expenses (consisting of selling, general and administrative expenses and other operating—net) and non-operating expenses (interest and income taxes), are centrally managed and are not included in the measurement of segment profitability reviewed by management.

Ammonia Segment

Our ammonia segment produces anhydrous ammonia (ammonia), which is our most concentrated nitrogen fertilizer as it contains 82% nitrogen. The results of our ammonia segment consist of sales of ammonia to external customers. In addition, ammonia is the "basic" nitrogen product that we upgrade into other nitrogen products such as granular urea, UAN and AN. We produce ammonia at all of our nitrogen manufacturing complexes.

The remaining decrease in our ammonia net sales of $568 million, or 37%, was due primarily to lower average selling prices and sales volume. Selling prices declined due to excess global nitrogen supply. In addition, our selling prices reflect the impact of a higher proportion of export sales, the volumes of which increased as a result of the weak fall application season attributable to the combined impact of weather conditions and low crop prices on our customers' decisions related to applying fertilizer in the fall. Sales volume in 2016 declined due to the combination of the weak fall application season and the impact of upgrading additional ammonia production at our Donaldsonville facility into granular urea and UAN as a result of our capacity expansion projects coming on line at our Donaldsonville, Louisiana complex.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our primary uses of cash are generally for operating costs, working capital, capital expenditures, debt service, investments, taxes, share repurchases and dividends. Our working capital requirements are affected by several factors, including demand for our products, selling prices, raw material costs, freight costs and seasonal factors inherent in the business. Generally, our primary source of cash is cash from operations, which includes cash generated by customer advances. We may also from time to time access the capital markets or engage in borrowings under our credit agreements.

At

December 31, 2017

, we were in compliance with all applicable covenant requirements under the Revolving Credit Agreement and our senior notes.

Our cash and cash equivalents balance was

$835 million

at

December 31, 2017

, a decline of $329 million from

$1.16 billion

at December 31, 2016. During 2017, our cash balance was significantly impacted by the following events, which are further described below.

•

Receipt of a federal tax refund of $815 million due to the carryback of certain tax losses primarily arising from our capacity expansion projects

•

Early redemption and purchase of $1.1 billion in aggregate principal amount of certain senior notes due in 2018 and 2020

Capacity Expansion Project and Receipt of Tax Refund From Tax Loss Carryback

In 2016, we completed capacity expansion projects at Donaldsonville, Louisiana and Port Neal, Iowa that were originally announced in 2012. These projects provided us with an increase of approximately 25% in production capacity and had a total capital cost of $5.2 billion. The completion of our capacity expansion projects has reduced what had been a substantial use of liquidity in recent years. See discussion under "Overview of CF Holdings—Items Affecting Comparability of Results—Depreciation and amortization," above, and "—Capital Spending," below, for further information on these projects.

A significant portion of the capital assets that were constructed as part of the capacity expansion projects qualified for bonus depreciation under the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 (the PATH Act). Under the provisions of the PATH Act, eligible capital additions are subject to 50% bonus depreciation in the year the asset is placed in service. We generated a substantial federal net operating loss in 2016, primarily as a result of the bonus depreciation deductions. In the second quarter of 2017, we received a federal tax refund of $815 million as a result of the claim to carry back the 2016 federal net operating loss to prior income tax years.

On December 1, 2017, we redeemed all of the $800 million outstanding principal amount of the 6.875% senior notes due May 2018 (the 2018 Notes) in accordance with the optional redemption provisions provided in the indenture governing the 2018 Notes. The total aggregate redemption price was approximately $817 million. On December 26, 2017, we purchased approximately $300 million aggregate principal amount of the $800 million outstanding principal amount of the 7.125% senior notes due 2020 (the 2020 Notes) at a total purchase price of approximately $331 million. As a result of the early redemption of the 2018 Notes and the purchase of the 2020 Notes, we recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of

$53 million

, primarily consisting of $48 million of total premiums paid for the early retirement of debt for the 2018 Notes and 2020 Notes. See discussion under "Debt—Senior Notes—Senior Secured Notes," below, for further information.

Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents include highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash with original maturities of three months or less. Under our short-term investment policy, we may invest our cash balances, either directly or through mutual funds, in several types of investment-grade securities, including notes and bonds issued by governmental entities or corporations. Securities issued by governmental entities include those issued directly by the U.S. and Canadian federal governments; those issued by state, local or other governmental entities; and those guaranteed by entities affiliated with governmental entities.

Capital Spending

We make capital expenditures to sustain our asset base, increase our capacity, improve plant efficiency and comply with various environmental, health and safety requirements. Capital expenditures totaled

$473 million

in


compared to

$2.21 billion

in


with the decrease primarily due to completion in 2016 of our capacity expansion projects at Donaldsonville, Louisiana and Port Neal, Iowa. Capital expenditures in


include approximately

$110 million

of payments to contractors and vendors for work completed on our capacity expansion projects in 2016.

Projected Capital Spending

Capital expenditures for new activity in


are estimated to be in the range of $400 to $450 million. Planned capital expenditures are subject to change due to delays in regulatory approvals or permitting, unanticipated increases in cost, changes in scope and completion time, performance of third parties, delay in the receipt of equipment, adverse weather, defects in materials and workmanship, labor or material shortages, transportation constraints, acceleration or delays in the timing of the work and other unforeseen difficulties.

Purchase of Publicly Traded Common Units of TNCLP

On February 7, 2018, we announced that TNGP elected to exercise its right to purchase all of the 4,612,562 publicly traded common units of TNCLP on April 2, 2018, for a cash purchase price of $84.033 per unit in accordance with the terms of TNCLP’s partnership agreement. The purchase price of all of the 4,612,562 publicly traded common units of TNCLP is approximately $390 million. Upon completion of the purchase, we will own 100 percent of the general and limited partnership interests of TNCLP. See Note

Government Policies

The policies or laws of governments around the world can result in the imposition of taxes, duties, tariffs or other restrictions or regulatory requirements on imports and exports of raw materials, finished goods or services from a particular country or region of the world.  The policies and laws of governments can also impact the subsidization of natural gas prices, and subsidies or quotas applied to domestic producers, or farmers. Due to the critical role that fertilizers play in food production, the construction and operation of fertilizer plants often are influenced by economic, political and social objectives. Additionally, the import or export of fertilizer can be subject to local taxes imposed by governments which can have the effect of either encouraging or discouraging import and export activity. The impact of changes in governmental policies or laws or the political or social objectives of a country could have a material impact on fertilizer demand and selling prices and therefore could impact our liquidity.

Ethanol Industry and the Renewable Fuel Standard

Corn used to produce ethanol accounts for approximately 38% of total U.S. corn demand. U.S. government policy, as expressed in the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), is a major determinant for the ethanol market. The RFS establishes minimum volumes of various types of renewable fuels, including ethanol, that must be included in the United States’ supply of fuel for transportation. In addition, the U.S. Congress, at various times, has proposed legislation to either reduce or eliminate the RFS. While past legislation proposing changes to the RFS has not been enacted into law, there can be no assurance that future legislation will not be enacted into law. Other factors that drive the ethanol market include the prices of ethanol, gasoline and corn. Lower gasoline prices may put pressure on ethanol prices that could result in reduced profitability and lower production for the ethanol industry, which could impact the demand for corn and nitrogen fertilizer and therefore could impact our liquidity.



CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

Repatriation of Foreign Earnings and Income Taxes

We have operations in Canada, the United Kingdom and an interest in a joint venture in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago. Historically, the estimated additional U.S. and foreign income taxes due upon repatriation of the earnings of these foreign operations to the U.S. were recognized in our consolidated financial statements as the earnings were recognized, unless the earnings were considered to be permanently reinvested based upon our then current plans. However, the cash payment of the income tax liabilities associated with repatriation of earnings from foreign operations occurred at the time of the repatriation. As a result, the recognition of income tax expense related to foreign earnings, as applicable, and the payment of taxes resulting from repatriation of those earnings could occur in different periods.

In light of changes made by the Tax Act, commencing with the 2018 tax year, the United States no longer taxes earnings of foreign subsidiaries even when such earnings are earned or repatriated to the United States, unless such earnings are subject to U.S. rules on passive income or certain anti-abuse provisions. Foreign subsidiary earnings may still be subject to withholding taxes when repatriated to the United States.

Cash balances held by our joint venture are maintained at sufficient levels to fund local operations as accumulated earnings are repatriated from the joint venture on a periodic basis.

As of

December 31, 2017

, approximately $152 million of our consolidated cash and cash equivalents balance of

$835 million

was held primarily by our Canadian and United Kingdom subsidiaries. Historically, the cash balance held by the Canadian subsidiaries represented accumulated earnings of our foreign operations that were not considered to be permanently reinvested. As of

December 31, 2017

, as a result of the amounts accrued in the transition tax liability recorded as a result of the Tax Act, we would not expect any additional cash tax cost to repatriate the Canadian and United Kingdom cash balances if we were to repatriate this cash in the future.

Debt

Revolving Credit Agreement

We have a senior secured revolving credit agreement (the Revolving Credit Agreement) providing for a revolving credit facility of up to

$750 million

with a maturity of September 18, 2020. The Revolving Credit Agreement includes a letter of credit sub-limit of

$125 million

. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. CF Industries may designate as borrowers one or more wholly owned subsidiaries that are organized in the United States or any state thereof, or the District of Columbia.

Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement may be denominated in U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars, euro and British pounds, and bear interest at a per annum rate equal to an applicable eurocurrency rate or base rate plus, in either case, a specified margin, and the borrowers are required to pay an undrawn commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the commitments under the Revolving Credit Agreement and customary letter of credit fees. The specified margin and the amount of the commitment fee depend on CF Holdings’ credit rating at the time.

The borrowers and guarantors under the Revolving Credit Agreement, which are currently comprised of CF Holdings, CF Industries and CF Holdings’ wholly owned subsidiaries CF Industries Enterprises, Inc. (CFE) and CF Industries Sales, LLC (CFS), are referred to together herein as the Loan Parties. CF Holdings and CF Industries guaranteed the obligations of the Loan Parties under the Revolving Credit Agreement prior to the effectiveness of the November 2016 Credit Agreement Amendment, and, upon the effectiveness of the November 2016 Credit Agreement Amendment, CFE and CFS also became guarantors of the obligations of the Loan Parties under the Revolving Credit Agreement. Subject to specified exceptions, the Revolving Credit Agreement requires that each direct or indirect domestic subsidiary of CF Holdings that guarantees debt for borrowed money of any Loan Party in excess of

$150 million

become a guarantor under the Revolving Credit Agreement. Subject to specified exceptions, the Revolving Credit Agreement requires a grant of a first priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of the Loan Parties, including a pledge by CFS of its equity interests in CF Industries Nitrogen, LLC (CFN) and mortgages over certain material fee-owned domestic real properties, to secure the obligations of the Loan Parties thereunder.

In addition to the obligations under the Revolving Credit Agreement, the Loan Parties also guarantee the obligations under any (i) letter of credit facilities, letter of credit reimbursement agreements, letters of credit, letters of guaranty, surety bonds or similar arrangements in an aggregate amount up to

$300 million

and (ii) interest rate or other hedging arrangements, in each case between CF Holdings or certain of its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any person that is a lender or the administrative agent under the Revolving Credit Agreement or an affiliate of such person, on the other hand, that are designated by CF Industries as Secured Bilateral LC Facilities or Secured Swap Agreements (each as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement), as applicable, pursuant to the terms of the Revolving Credit Agreement (such additional obligations, the Additional



CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

Guaranteed Obligations). Obligations under Secured Bilateral LC Facilities in an aggregate amount up to

$300 million

and obligations under Secured Swap Agreements are secured by the same security interest that secures the obligations under the Revolving Credit Agreement.

The Revolving Credit Agreement contains representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants customary for a financing of this type. Prior to the effectiveness of the November 2016 Credit Agreement Amendment, the Revolving Credit Agreement limited the ability of non-guarantor subsidiaries of CF Holdings to incur indebtedness and limited the ability of CF Holdings and its subsidiaries to grant liens, merge or consolidate with other entities and sell, lease or transfer all or substantially all of the assets of CF Holdings and its subsidiaries to another entity, in each case, subject to specified exceptions. The November 2016 Credit Agreement Amendment modified the negative covenants in the Revolving Credit Agreement to limit further the ability of CF Holdings and its subsidiaries to grant liens and add limitations on the ability of CF Holdings and its subsidiaries to incur debt, pay dividends, voluntarily prepay certain debt, make investments and dispose of assets, in each case, subject to specified exceptions (such further and additional limitations, the Additional Negative Covenants).

The financial covenants applicable to CF Holdings and its subsidiaries in the Revolving Credit Agreement (the New Financial Covenants):

(i)

restrict the ratio of total secured debt to EBITDA (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters most recently ended to a maximum of

3.75

:1.00,

(ii)

require the ratio of EBITDA for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters most recently ended to consolidated interest expense (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters most recently ended to be a minimum of

1.20

:1.00 for the fiscal quarters ending on or prior to December 31, 2018, and

1.50

:1.00 thereafter, and

(iii)

require the ratio of total debt to total capitalization as of the last day of any fiscal quarter to be less than or equal to

0.60

:1.00.

Under the Revolving Credit Agreement, if on any date certain conditions were met, including (i) an absence of an event of default under the Revolving Credit Agreement, (ii) the receipt of an investment grade corporate rating for CF Holdings from

two

of

three

selected ratings agencies and (iii) the ratio of CF Holdings’ total net debt to EBITDA for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters most recently ended being less than

3.75

:1.00, CF Industries would be able to, at its option, choose to (w) suspend the Additional Negative Covenants, (x) replace the New Financial Covenants with covenants requiring the ratio of total net debt to EBITDA for the period of four fiscal consecutive quarters most recently ended to be less than or equal to

3.75

:1.00 and the ratio of EBITDA for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters most recently ended to consolidated interest expense for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters most recently ended to be not less than

2.75

:1.00, (y) release the collateral securing the obligations under the Revolving Credit Agreement and (z) release the guarantees supporting, and the collateral securing, the Secured Bilateral LC Facilities and the Secured Swap Agreements. Such a choice by CF Industries would commence a "Covenant Suspension Period" that would expire upon the Company's no longer having an investment grade corporate rating from two of three selected rating agencies. Upon the expiration of a Covenant Suspension Period, the Additional Negative Covenants and the New Financial Covenants would be reinstated, and the Loan Parties party to the Revolving Credit Agreement would be required to guarantee the Additional Guaranteed Obligations and grant a first priority security interest in substantially all of each Loan Party’s assets, including a pledge by CFS of its equity interests in CFN and mortgages over certain material fee-owned domestic real properties, subject to certain exceptions, to secure the obligations under the Revolving Credit Agreement, the Secured Bilateral LC Facilities and the Secured Swap Agreements.

The Revolving Credit Agreement contains events of default (with notice requirements and cure periods, as applicable) customary for a financing of this type, including, but not limited to, non-payment of principal, interest or fees; inaccuracy of representations and warranties in any material respect; and failure to comply with specified covenants. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default under the Revolving Credit Agreement and after any applicable cure period, subject to specified exceptions, the administrative agent may, and at the request of the requisite lenders is required to, accelerate the loans under the Revolving Credit Agreement or terminate the lenders’ commitments under the Revolving Credit Agreement.

As of

December 31, 2017

, we had excess borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Agreement of

$695 million

(net of outstanding letters of credit of

$55 million

). There were

no

borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement as of

December 31, 2017

or

December 31, 2016

, or during 2017. Maximum borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement during the year ended

December 31, 2016

were

$150 million

with a weighted-average annual interest rate of

1.85%

.

Public Senior Notes

Under the indentures (including the applicable supplemental indentures) governing our senior notes due 2018, 2020, 2023, 2034, 2043 and 2044 (the Public Senior Notes), each series of Public Senior Notes is guaranteed by CF Holdings, and, in connection with the effectiveness of the November 2016 amendment to our Revolving Credit Agreement, CF Holdings' wholly owned subsidiaries CF Industries Enterprises, Inc. (CFE) and CF Industries Sales, LLC (CFS) became subsidiary guarantors of the Public Senior Notes.

Interest on the Public Senior Notes is payable semiannually, and the Public Senior Notes are redeemable at our option, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at specified make-whole redemption prices.

If a Change of Control occurs together with a Ratings Downgrade (as both terms are defined under the indentures governing the Public Senior Notes), CF Industries would be required to offer to repurchase each series of Public Senior Notes at a price equal to

101%

of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, in the event that a subsidiary of CF Holdings, other than CF Industries, becomes a borrower or a guarantor under the Revolving Credit Agreement (or any renewal, replacement or refinancing thereof), such subsidiary would be required to become a guarantor of the Public Senior Notes, provided that such requirement will no longer apply with respect to the Public Senior Notes due 2023, 2034, 2043 and 2044 following the repayment of the Public Senior Notes due 2018 and 2020 or the subsidiaries of ours, other than CF Industries, otherwise becoming no longer subject to such a requirement to guarantee the Public Senior Notes due 2018 and 2020.

On December 1, 2017, we redeemed all of the $800 million outstanding principal amount of the 6.875% senior notes due May 2018 (the 2018 Notes) in accordance with the optional redemption provisions provided in the indenture governing the 2018 Notes. The total aggregate redemption price was approximately $817 million. On December 26, 2017, we purchased



CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

approximately $300 million aggregate principal amount of the $800 million outstanding principal amount of 7.125% senior notes due 2020 (the 2020 Notes). The aggregate purchase price was approximately $331 million. As a result of the early redemption of the 2018 Notes and the purchase of the 2020 Notes, we recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of

$53 million

, primarily consisting of $48 million of premiums paid for the early retirement of debt for the 2018 Notes and 2020 Notes.

Senior Secured Notes

On November 21, 2016, CF Industries issued

$500 million

aggregate principal amount of

3.400%

senior secured notes due 2021 (the 2021 Notes) and

$750 million

aggregate principal amount of

4.500%

senior secured notes due 2026 (the 2026 Notes, and together with the 2021 Notes, the Senior Secured Notes). The net proceeds, after deducting discounts and offering expenses, from the issuance and sale of the Senior Secured Notes were approximately

$1.23 billion

. CF Industries used approximately

$1.18 billion

of the net proceeds for the prepayment (including payment of a make-whole amount of approximately

$170 million

and accrued interest) in full of the outstanding

$1.0 billion

aggregate principal amount of the senior notes 2022, 2025 and 2027 (Private Senior Notes) issued by CF Industries on September 24, 2015.

Interest on the Senior Secured Notes is payable semiannually on December 1 and June 1 beginning on June 1, 2017, and the Senior Secured Notes are redeemable at our option, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at specified make-whole redemption prices.

Under the terms of the applicable indenture, the Senior Secured Notes of each series are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior secured basis, jointly and severally, by CF Holdings and each current and future domestic subsidiary of CF Holdings (other than CF Industries) that from time to time is a borrower, or guarantees indebtedness, under the Revolving Credit Agreement. The requirement for any subsidiary of CF Holdings to guarantee the Senior Secured Notes of a series will apply only until, and the subsidiary guarantees of the Senior Secured Notes of a series will be automatically released upon, the latest to occur of (a) CF Holdings having an investment grade corporate rating, with a stable or better outlook, from two of three selected ratings agencies and there being no default or event of default under the applicable Indenture, (b) the retirement, discharge or legal or covenant defeasance of, or satisfaction and discharge of the supplemental indenture governing, the Public Senior Notes due 2018 or the subsidiaries of CF Holdings (other than CF Industries) otherwise becoming no longer subject to the requirement, described in the second paragraph under "—Public Senior Notes," above, to guarantee the Public Senior Notes due 2018 and (c) the retirement, discharge or legal or covenant defeasance of, or satisfaction and discharge of the supplemental indenture governing, the Public Senior Notes due 2020 or the subsidiaries of CF Holdings (other than CF Industries) otherwise becoming no longer subject to the requirement, described in the second paragraph under "—Public Senior Notes," above, to guarantee the Public Senior Notes due 2020. In accordance with the applicable indenture, CFE and CFS, in addition to CF Holdings, guaranteed the Senior Secured Notes of each series upon the initial issuance of the Senior Secured Notes.

Subject to certain exceptions, the obligations under each series of Senior Secured Notes and each guarantor’s related guarantee are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of CF Industries, CF Holdings and the subsidiary guarantors, including a pledge by CFS of its equity interests in CFN and mortgages over certain material fee-owned domestic real properties (the Collateral). The obligations under the Revolving Credit Agreement, together with certain letter of credit, hedging and similar obligations and future pari passu secured indebtedness, will be secured by the Collateral on a pari passu basis with the Senior Secured Notes. The liens on the Collateral securing the obligations under the Senior Secured Notes of a series and the related guarantees will be automatically released and the covenant under the applicable indenture limiting dispositions of Collateral will no longer apply if, on any date after the initial issuance of the Senior Secured Notes, CF Holdings has an investment grade corporate rating, with a stable or better outlook, from two of three selected ratings agencies and there is no default or event of default under the applicable indenture.

Under each of the indentures governing the Senior Secured Notes, specified changes of control involving CF Holdings or CF Industries, when accompanied by a ratings downgrade, as defined with respect to the applicable series of Senior Secured Notes, constitute change of control repurchase events. Upon the occurrence of a change of control repurchase event with respect to the 2021 Notes or the 2026 Notes, as applicable, unless CF Industries has exercised its option to redeem such Senior Secured Notes, CF Industries will be required to offer to repurchase them at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of repurchase.

The indentures governing the Senior Secured Notes contain covenants that limit, among other things, the ability of CF Holdings and its subsidiaries, including CF Industries, to incur liens on certain assets to secure debt, to engage in sale and leaseback transactions, to sell or transfer Collateral, to merge or consolidate with other entities and to sell, lease or transfer all or substantially all of the assets of CF Holdings and its subsidiaries to another entity. Each of the indentures governing the Senior Secured Notes provides for customary events of default, which include (subject in certain cases to customary grace and cure periods), among others, nonpayment of principal or interest on the applicable Senior Secured Notes; failure to comply with other covenants or agreements under the indenture; certain defaults on other indebtedness; the failure of CF Holdings' or certain subsidiaries’ guarantees of the applicable Senior Secured Notes to be enforceable; lack of validity or perfection of any lien



CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

securing the obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the guarantees with respect to Collateral having an aggregate fair market value equal to or greater than a specified amount; and specified events of bankruptcy or insolvency. Under each indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes, in the case of an event of default arising from one of the specified events of bankruptcy or insolvency, the applicable Senior Secured Notes would become due and payable immediately, and, in the case of any other event of default (other than an event of default related to CF Industries' and CF Holdings' reporting obligations), the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the applicable Senior Secured Notes then outstanding may declare all of such Senior Secured Notes to be due and payable immediately.

Private Senior Notes

The senior notes due 2022, 2025 and 2027 (the Private Senior Notes), issued by CF Industries on September 24, 2015, were governed by the terms of a note purchase agreement (as amended, including by an amendment effective September 7, 2016, the Note Purchase Agreement). The Private Senior Notes were guaranteed by CF Holdings. All obligations under the Note Purchase Agreement were unsecured.

On November 21, 2016, we prepaid in full the outstanding

$1.0 billion

aggregate principal amount of our Private Senior Notes. The prepayment of

$1.18 billion

included the payment of a make-whole amount of approximately

$170 million

and accrued interest. Loss on debt extinguishment of

$167 million

on our consolidated statements of operations excludes $3 million of the make-whole payment, which was accounted for as a modification and recognized on our consolidated balance sheet as deferred financing fees, a reduction of long-term debt, and is being amortized using the effective interest rate method over the term of the Senior Secured Notes.

Bridge Credit Agreement

On September 18, 2015, in connection with our proposed combination with certain businesses of OCI, CF Holdings and CF Industries entered into a senior unsecured 364-Day Bridge Credit Agreement (as amended, the Bridge Credit Agreement). Upon the termination of the Combination Agreement on May 22, 2016, the lenders’ commitments under the Bridge Credit Agreement terminated automatically. There were no borrowings under the Bridge Credit Agreement. See Note

12—Interest Expense

for additional information.

Share Repurchase Programs

Our Board of Directors (the Board) authorized certain programs to repurchase shares of our common stock. Each of these programs permitted repurchases to be made from time to time in the open market, through privately-negotiated transactions, through block transactions or otherwise. Our management determined the manner, timing and amount of repurchases based on the evaluation of market conditions, stock price and other factors. On August 6, 2014, the Board authorized a program to repurchase up to

$1 billion

of the common stock of CF Holdings through December 31, 2016 (the 2014 Program). As of

December 31, 2016

,

15.9 million

shares had been repurchased for an aggregate expenditure of

$900 million

. The remaining $100 million of share repurchase authorization under the 2014 Program expired on December 31, 2016. No share repurchase programs were authorized by the Board in 2017.

Forward Sales and Customer Advances

We offer our customers the opportunity to purchase products from us on a forward basis at prices and on delivery dates we propose. Therefore, our reported fertilizer selling prices and margins may differ from market spot prices and margins available at the time of shipment.

Customer advances, which typically represent a portion of the contract's sales value, are received shortly after the contract is executed, with any remaining unpaid amount generally being collected by the time the product is shipped, thereby reducing or eliminating the accounts receivable related to such sales. Any cash payments received in advance from customers in connection with forward sales contracts are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as a current liability until related orders are shipped and revenue is recognized. As of

December 31, 2017

and


, we had

$89 million

and

$42 million

, respectively, in customer advances on our consolidated balance sheets.

While customer advances are generally a significant source of liquidity, the level of forward sales contracts is affected by many factors including current market conditions and our customers' outlook of future market fundamentals. During periods of declining prices, such as the current environment, customers tend to delay purchasing fertilizer in anticipation that prices in the future will be lower than the current prices. If the level of sales under our forward sales programs were to decrease in the future, our cash received from customer advances would likely decrease and our accounts receivable balances would likely increase. Additionally, borrowing under the Revolving Credit Agreement could become necessary. Due to the volatility inherent in our business and changing customer expectations, we cannot estimate the amount of future forward sales activity.



CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

Under our forward sales programs, a customer may delay delivery of an order due to weather conditions or other factors. These delays generally subject the customer to potential charges for storage or may be grounds for termination of the contract by us. Such a delay in scheduled shipment or termination of a forward sales contract due to a customer's inability or unwillingness to perform may negatively impact our reported sales.

Natural Gas Prices

Natural gas is the principal raw material used to produce nitrogen fertilizers. We use natural gas both as a chemical feedstock and as a fuel to produce ammonia, granular urea, UAN, AN and other nitrogen products. Expenditures on natural gas represent a significant portion of our production costs. For example, natural gas costs, including realized gains and losses, comprised approximately

47%

of our total production costs in


. As a result, natural gas prices have a significant impact on our operating expenses and can thus affect our liquidity.

Because most of our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities are located in the United States and Canada, the price of natural gas in North America directly impacts a substantial portion of our operating expenses. Due to increases in natural gas production resulting from the rise in production from shale gas formations, natural gas prices in North America have declined since 2008, but are subject to volatility. During


, the daily closing price at the Henry Hub, the most heavily-traded natural gas pricing point in North America, reached a low of

$2.44

per MMBtu on

February 28, 2017

and a high of

$3.65

per MMBtu on three consecutive days in January 2017. During the three-year period ended

December 31, 2017

, the daily closing price at the Henry Hub reached a low of

$1.49

per MMBtu on three consecutive days in March 2016 and a high of

$3.77

per MMBtu on

December 8, 2016

.

We also have manufacturing facilities located in the United Kingdom. These facilities are subject to fluctuations associated with the price of natural gas in Europe. The major natural gas trading point for the United Kingdom is the National Balancing Point (NBP). During


, the daily closing price at NBP reached a low of

$3.30

per MMBtu on

June 15, 2017

and a high of

$9.00

per MMBtu on

December 12, 2017

. During the three-year period ended

December 31, 2017

, the daily closing price at NBP reached a low of

$2.80

per MMBtu on September 1, September 12 and September 14, 2016, and a high of

$9.00

per MMBtu on

December 12, 2017

Natural gas costs in our cost of sales, including the impact of realized natural gas derivatives, increased

Derivative Financial Instruments

We use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to changes in prices for natural gas that will be purchased in the future. Natural gas is the largest and most volatile component of our manufacturing cost for nitrogen-based fertilizers. From time to time, we also use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Because we use derivative instruments, volatility in reported quarterly earnings can result from the unrealized mark-to-market adjustments in the value of the derivatives. In


,


and


, we recognized unrealized net mark-to-market losses (gains) on natural gas derivatives of

$61 million

,

$(260) million

and

$176 million

, respectively, which is reflected in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations.

Derivatives expose us to counterparties and the risks associated with their ability to meet the terms of the contracts. For derivatives that are in net asset positions, we are exposed to credit loss from nonperformance by the counterparties. We control our credit risk through the use of multiple counterparties that are multinational commercial banks, other major financial institutions or large energy companies, and, in most cases, the use of International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) master netting arrangements. The ISDA agreements are master netting arrangements commonly used for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives that mitigate exposure to counterparty credit risk, in part, by creating contractual rights of netting and setoff, the specifics of which vary from agreement to agreement.

The ISDA agreements to most of our derivative instruments contain credit-risk-related contingent features, such as cross default provisions and credit support thresholds. In the event of certain defaults or a credit ratings downgrade, our counterparty may request early termination and net settlement of certain derivative trades or may require us to collateralize derivatives in a net liability position. The Revolving Credit Agreement, at any time when it is secured, provides a cross collateral feature for those of our derivatives that are with counterparties that are party to, or affiliates of parties to, the Revolving Credit Agreement so that no separate collateral would be required for those counterparties in connection with such derivatives. In the event the Revolving Credit Agreement becomes unsecured, separate collateral could be required in connection with such derivatives.

As of

December 31, 2017

and


, the aggregate fair value of the derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features in net liability positions was

$12 million

and

zero

, respectively, which also approximates the fair value of the maximum amount of additional collateral that would need to be posted or assets needed to settle the obligations if the credit-

risk-related contingent features were triggered at the reporting dates. As of

December 31, 2017

and


, we had open natural gas derivative contracts for

35.9 million

MMBtus and

183.0 million

MMBtus, respectively. At both

December 31, 2017

and


, we had no cash collateral on deposit with counterparties for derivative contracts.

Embedded Derivative Liability

Under the terms of our strategic venture with CHS, if our credit rating as determined by two of three specified credit rating agencies is below certain levels, we are required to make a non-refundable yearly payment of $5 million to CHS. Since our credit ratings were below certain levels in 2016 and 2017, we made a payment of $5 million to CHS in each year. These payments will continue on a yearly basis until the earlier of the date that our credit rating is upgraded to or above certain levels by two of three specified credit rating agencies or February 1, 2026.

This obligation is recognized on our consolidated balance sheet as an embedded derivative and its value is included in other liabilities. See Note

16—Noncontrolling Interests

for additional information.

Defined Benefit Pension Plans

We contributed

$82 million

to our pension plans in


. The contributions in 2017 include a voluntary contribution of $59 million made in the second quarter of 2017. We expect to contribute approximately

$41 million

to our pension plans in


.

Distributions on Noncontrolling Interest in CFN

The CFN Board of Managers approved semi-annual distribution payments during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, in accordance with the Second Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of CFN, as follows:

Cash Flows

Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities

in


was

$1.63 billion

as compared to

$617 million

in


, an

increase

of

$1,014 million

. The

increase

was primarily due to working capital changes including the receipt of our $815 million income tax refund related to the claim to carry back the 2016 federal tax loss to prior income tax years. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was also a result of entering 2017 with a lower level of customer advances than 2016 due to customer reluctance to enter into prepaid contracts in a declining fertilizer price environment. These increases were partially offset by higher contributions to our pension plans. In


, we contributed

$82 million

to our pension plans compared to $23 million in 2016.

Net cash provided by operating activities

in


was

$617 million

as compared to

$1.21 billion

in


, a decline of

$590 million

. The decline resulted primarily from lower net earnings during


due to lower selling prices from excess global nitrogen supply, partially offset by lower amounts of cash used for working capital purposes. Lower working capital levels in accounts receivable and inventory, plus lower amounts paid for income taxes and certain income tax refunds received in 2016, contributed to the reduction in cash used for working capital. Favorable changes in working capital also included a greater proportion of sales paid in 2016 as compared to the prior year period as we entered 2016 with a lower level of customer advances than in 2015 due to customers’ hesitancy to enter into prepaid contracts in a declining fertilizer price environment.

Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities

was

$408 million

in


compared to

$2.18 billion

in


. This

$1.77 billion

decrease is due primarily to lower capital expenditures as a result of the completion of our capacity expansion projects in Donaldsonville, Louisiana and Port Neal, Iowa at the end of 2016. During


, capital expenditures totaled

$473 million

compared to

$2.21 billion

in


. The

$2.98 billion

net cash used in investing activities in


included

$2.47 billion

in capital expenditures and the 2015 acquisition of the remaining 50% equity interest in CF Fertilisers UK not previously owned by us for a net cash payment of $552 million, which was net of cash acquired of $18 million.

Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities was

$1.56 billion

in


compared to net cash provided by financing activities of

$2.44 billion

in


and

$77 million

in


. In


, we paid

$1.15 billion

in connection with the early redemption of

$800 million

in aggregate principal amount of our 2018 Notes, the purchase of approximately $300 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2020 Notes pursuant to a tender offer and premiums paid for the early retirement of long-term debt. In


, CHS purchased a minority equity interest in CFN for

$2.8 billion

. In


and


, we distributed

$131 million

and

$119 million

, respectively, to the noncontrolling interests in CFN and TNCLP. In


, we distributed

$45 million

to the noncontrolling interest in TNCLP. The increase in distributions to noncontrolling interests in 2016 compared to 2015 was due to the CHS strategic venture, which increased the distributions by

$79 million

, representing the distributions paid to CHS in the third quarter of 2016 for the distribution period ended June 30, 2016.

In 2016, we received proceeds of approximately

$1.24 billion

, net of discounts, from the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes which were used to fund the prepayment of the

$1.0 billion

of Private Senior Notes and the related make-whole payment of $170 million. In


, we issued the Private Senior Notes and received proceeds of approximately $1.0 billion. No share repurchases were made during

compared to cash used for share repurchases in


of

$556 million

CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We have operating leases for certain property and equipment under various noncancelable agreements, the most significant of which are rail car leases and barge tow charters for the transportation of our products. The rail car leases currently have minimum terms ranging from

one

to

eleven years

and the barge charter commitments range from

one

to

seven years

. We also have terminal and warehouse storage agreements for our distribution system, some of which contain minimum throughput requirements. The storage agreements contain minimum terms generally ranging from

one

to

five years

and commonly contain automatic annual renewal provisions thereafter unless canceled by either party. See Note

23—Leases

for additional information.

We do not have any other off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. U.S. GAAP requires that we select policies and make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience, technological assessment, opinions of appropriate outside experts, and the most recent information available to us. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Changes in estimates that may have a material impact on our results are discussed in the context of the underlying financial statements to which they relate. The following discussion presents information about our most critical accounting policies and estimates.

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue when title and risk of loss are transferred to the customer, which can be at the plant gate, a distribution facility, a supplier location or a customer destination. In some cases, application of this policy requires that we make certain assumptions or estimates regarding a component of revenue, discounts and allowances, rebates, or creditworthiness of some of our customers. We base our estimates on historical experience, and the most recent information available to us, which can change as market conditions change. Amounts related to shipping and handling that are billed to our customers in sales transactions are classified as sales in our consolidated statements of operations. Sales incentives are reported as a reduction in net sales.

Income Taxes

We recognize expenses, assets and liabilities for income taxes based on estimates of amounts that ultimately will be determined to be taxable or deductible in tax returns filed in various jurisdictions. U.S. income taxes are provided on that portion of the earnings of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the U.S. and be taxable. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors and judgments, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state and international tax audits. The judgments made at any point in time may change from previous conclusions based on the outcome of tax audits, as well as changes to, or further interpretations of, tax laws and regulations. We adjust income tax expense in the period in which these changes occur.

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are projected to be recovered or settled. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character in future periods. A valuation allowance is established if it is determined to be more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Significant judgment is applied in evaluating the need for and the magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are reported as interest expense and income tax expense, respectively.

Historically, a deferred income tax liability was recorded for income taxes that would result from the repatriation of the portion of the investment in our non-U.S. subsidiaries and joint venture that were considered to not be permanently reinvested. No deferred income tax liability was recorded for the remainder of our investment in non-U.S. subsidiaries and joint venture, which we believed to be permanently reinvested. In light of changes made by the Tax Act, the Company is evaluating whether it will continue to treat foreign subsidiary earnings as being permanently reinvested.



CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

As a large commercial enterprise with international operations, our income tax expense and our effective tax rate may change from period to period due to many factors. The most significant of these factors are changes in tax legislation in the countries in which we operate, changes in the geographic mix of earnings, the tax characteristics of our income, the ability to realize certain foreign tax credits and net operating losses, and the portion of the income of our foreign subsidiaries and foreign joint venture that could be subjected to U.S. taxation. It is reasonably likely that these items will impact income tax expense, net income and liquidity in future periods.

We operate in a number of countries and as a result have a significant amount of cross border transactions. The taxability of cross border transactions has received an increasing level of scrutiny among regulators in countries across the globe, including the countries in which we operate. The tax rules and regulations within the various countries in which we operate are complex and in many cases there is not symmetry between the rules of the various countries. As a result, there are instances where regulators within the countries involved in a cross border transaction may reach different conclusions regarding the taxability of the transaction in their respective jurisdictions based on the same set of facts and circumstances. We work closely with regulators to reach a common understanding and conclusion regarding the taxability of cross border transactions.  However, there are instances where reaching a common understanding is not possible or practical. As of

December 31, 2017

, we have recorded a reserve for unrecognized tax benefits, including penalties and interest, of

$151 million

, which is related predominantly to certain potential tax exposures involving cross border transactions. This amount represents our best estimate of the potential amounts due based on our interpretations of the rules and the facts and circumstances of the transactions. Differences in interpretation of the tax laws, including agreements between governments surrounding our cross border transactions, can result in differences in taxes paid which may be higher or lower than our estimates.

Recoverability of Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill and Investments in Unconsolidated Subsidiaries

We review the carrying values of our property, plant and equipment and other long-lived assets, including our finite-lived intangible assets, goodwill and investments in affiliates including joint ventures in accordance with U.S. GAAP in order to assess recoverability. Factors that we must estimate when performing impairment tests include sales volume, selling prices, raw material costs, operating rates, operating expenses, inflation, discount rates, exchange rates, tax rates and capital spending. Significant judgment is involved in estimating each of these factors, which include inherent uncertainties. The factors we use are consistent with those used in our internal planning process. The recoverability of the values associated with our goodwill, long-lived assets and investments in unconsolidated affiliates is dependent upon future operating performance of the specific businesses to which they are attributed. Certain of the operating assumptions are particularly sensitive to the cyclical nature of the fertilizer business. Adverse changes in demand for our products, increases in supply and the availability and costs of key raw materials could significantly affect the results of our review.

The recoverability and impairment tests of long-lived assets are required only when conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. For goodwill, impairment tests are required at least annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that it may be impaired. Our investments in unconsolidated affiliates are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. When circumstances indicate that the fair value of our investment in any such affiliate is less than its carrying value, and the reduction in value is other than temporary, the reduction in value is recognized immediately in earnings.

PLNL is our joint venture investment in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago and operates an ammonia plant that relies on natural gas supplied by the NGC pursuant to the NGC Contract. The joint venture is accounted for under the equity method. The joint venture has experienced curtailments in the supply of natural gas from NGC, which have reduced the ammonia production at PLNL. The NGC Contract had an initial expiration date of September 2018 and has been extended on the same terms until September 2023. Any NGC commitment to supply gas beyond 2023 will need to be based on new agreements regarding volume and price. PLNL and NGC are currently parties to arbitration proceedings where the main issue remaining in dispute is PLNL's claims for damages for past and ongoing curtailments.

Although the joint venture believes its claims against NGC to be meritorious, it is not possible to predict the outcome of the arbitration. There are significant assumptions in the future operations of the joint venture, beyond 2023, that are uncertain at this time, including the quantities of gas NGC will make available, the cost of such gas, the estimates that are used to determine the useful lives of fixed assets and the assumptions in the discounted cash flow models utilized for recoverability and impairment testing. As part of our 2016 impairment assessment of our equity method investment in PLNL, we determined the carrying value exceeded the fair value and recognized a

$134 million

impairment charge. Previously, in 2015, we recognized an impairment charge of

$62 million

related to our equity method investment in PLNL. The carrying value of our equity method investment in PLNL at

December 31, 2017

is

$108 million

. If NGC does not make sufficient quantities of natural gas available to PLNL at prices that permit profitable operations, PLNL may cease operating its facility and we would write off the remaining investment in PLNL.



CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

We evaluate goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter at the reporting unit level. Our evaluation can begin with a qualitative assessment of the factors that could impact the significant inputs used to estimate fair value. If after performing the qualitative assessment, we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, then no further testing is performed. However, if it is unclear based on the results of the qualitative test, we perform a quantitative test involving potentially two steps. The first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. We use an income-based valuation method, determining the present value of future cash flows, to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its positive carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired, and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary. The second step of the goodwill impairment test, if needed, compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. We recognize an impairment loss immediately to the extent the carrying value exceeds its implied fair value. We identified no goodwill impairment in our


,


or


reviews. As of

December 31, 2017

and


, the carrying value of our goodwill was

$2.37 billion

and

$2.35 billion

, respectively.

Intangible assets identified in connection with our 2010 acquisition of Terra Industries Inc. consist of customer relationships, which are being amortized over a period of 18 years. The intangible assets identified in connection with our 2015 acquisition of

CF Fertilisers UK

consist of customer relationships and trade names which are being amortized over a period of approximately


years. Our intangible assets are presented in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets. See Note

6—Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

for additional information regarding our goodwill and other intangible assets.

Pension Assets and Liabilities

Pension assets and liabilities are affected by the fair value of plan assets, estimates of the expected return on plan assets, plan design, actuarial estimates and discount rates. Actual changes in the fair value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets affect the amount of pension expense ultimately recognized. Key assumptions that affect our projected benefit obligation (PBO) are discount rates and, in addition for our United Kingdom plans, an adjusted retail price index (RPI). Key assumptions affecting pension expense include discount rates, the expected long-term rate of return on assets (EROA) and, in addition for our United Kingdom plans, RPI.

The

December 31, 2017

PBO was computed based on a weighted-average discount rate of

3.6%

for our North America plans and

2.5%

for our United Kingdom plans, which were based on yields for high-quality (AA rated or better) fixed income debt securities that match the timing and amounts of expected benefit payments as of the measurement date of December 31. Declines in comparable bond yields would increase our PBO. The weighted-average discount rate used to calculate pension expense in


was

4.0%

for North America plans and

2.8%

for United Kingdom plans. Our net benefit obligation, after deduction of plan assets, could increase or decrease depending on the extent to which returns on pension plan assets are lower or higher than the discount rate. The

4.2%

weighted-average EROA used to calculate pension expense in


for our North America plans is based on studies of actual rates of return achieved by equity and non-equity investments, both separately and in combination over historical holding periods. The

4.6%

weighted-average EROA used to calculate pension expense in


for our United Kingdom plans is based on expected long-term performance of underlying investments.  The EROA for both North America and United Kingdom plans are adjusted for expenses and diversification bonuses. The

3.2%

RPI used to calculate our United Kingdom plan PBO and the

3.3%

RPI used to calculate


pension expense is developed using the Bank of England implied retail price inflation curve, which is based on the difference between yields on fixed interest government bonds and index-linked government bonds.

For North America qualified pension plans, our PBO was

$805 million

as of

December 31, 2017

, which was

$67 million

higher than pension plan assets. For our United Kingdom pension plans, our PBO was

$590 million

as of

December 31, 2017

which was

$176 million

higher than pension plan assets. The tables below estimate the impact of a 50 basis point increase or decrease in the key assumptions on our

December 31, 2017

PBO and


pension expense:

CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

We are exposed to the impact of changes in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.

Commodity Prices

Our net sales, cash flows and estimates of future cash flows related to nitrogen-based fertilizers are sensitive to changes in fertilizer prices as well as changes in the prices of natural gas and other raw materials unless these costs have been fixed or hedged. A $1.00 per MMBtu change in the price of natural gas would change the cost to produce a ton of ammonia, granular urea, UAN (32%) and AN by approximately $32, $22, $14 and $15, respectively.

Natural gas is the largest and most volatile component of the manufacturing cost for nitrogen-based fertilizers. We manage the risk of changes in natural gas prices primarily with the use of derivative financial instruments covering periods through December 2018. The derivative instruments that we use are primarily natural gas fixed price swaps and natural gas options. These derivatives settle using primarily NYMEX futures price indexes, which represent the basis for fair value at any given time. The contracts represent anticipated natural gas needs for future periods and settlements are scheduled to coincide with anticipated natural gas purchases during those future periods.

As of

December 31, 2017

and


, we had open derivative contracts for

35.9 million

MMBtus and

183.0 million

MMBtus, respectively. A $1.00 per MMBtu increase in the forward curve prices of natural gas at

December 31, 2017

would result in a favorable change in the fair value of these derivative positions of

$33 million

, and a $1.00 per MMBtu decrease in the forward curve prices of natural gas would change their fair value unfavorably by

$33 million

.

From time to time we may purchase nitrogen products on the open market to augment or replace production at our facilities.

Interest Rates

As of

December 31, 2017

, we had seven series of senior notes totaling

$4.75 billion

of principal outstanding with maturity dates of

May 1, 2020

,

December 1, 2021

, June 1, 2023,

December 1, 2026

,

March 15, 2034

, June 1, 2043 and March 15, 2044. The senior notes have fixed interest rates. As of

December 31, 2017

, the carrying value and fair value of our senior notes was approximately

$4.69 billion

and

$4.80 billion

, respectively.

Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement bear current market rates of interest and we are subject to interest rate risk on such borrowings. There were

no

borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement as of

December 31, 2017

or

December 31, 2016

, or during 2017. Maximum borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement during 2016 were $150 million with a weighted-average annual interest rate of

1.85%

.

Upon the termination of the Combination Agreement on May 22, 2016, the lenders’ commitments under the Bridge Credit Agreement terminated automatically. There were no borrowings under the Bridge Credit Agreement.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rates

From the fourth quarter of 2012 through 2016, we had entered into euro/U.S. dollar derivative hedging transactions related to the euro-denominated construction costs associated with our capacity expansion projects at our Donaldsonville, Louisiana and Port Neal, Iowa facilities. All of these foreign currency derivatives settled prior to December 31, 2016.

We are directly exposed to changes in the value of the Canadian dollar, the British pound and the euro. Outside of the transactions described above, we generally do not maintain any exchange rate derivatives or hedges related to these currencies.

.     Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Consolidation and Noncontrolling Interests

The consolidated financial statements of CF Holdings include the accounts of CF Industries and all majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.

TNCLP is a master limited partnership that is consolidated in the financial statements of CF Holdings. TNCLP owns the nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facility in Verdigris, Oklahoma. We own approximately

75.3%

of TNCLP and outside investors own the remaining approximately

24.7%

. Partnership interests in TNCLP are traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). As a result, TNCLP files separate financial reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The outside investors' limited partnership interests in the partnership are included in noncontrolling interests in our consolidated financial statements. This noncontrolling interest represents the noncontrolling unitholders' interest in the partners' capital of TNCLP.

On February 1, 2016, CHS purchased a minority equity interest in CFN. We own approximately

89%

of CFN and consolidate CFN in our financial statements. CHS' minority equity interest in CFN is included in noncontrolling interests in our consolidated financial statements, and represents CHS' interest in the membership interests of CFN.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented. Significant estimates and assumptions are used for, but are not limited to, net realizable value of inventories, environmental remediation liabilities, environmental and litigation contingencies, the cost of customer incentives, useful lives of property and identifiable intangible assets, the assumptions used in the evaluation of potential impairments of property, investments, identifiable intangible assets and goodwill, income tax and valuation reserves, allowances for doubtful accounts receivable, the measurement of the fair values of investments for which markets are not active, assumptions used in the determination of the funded status and annual expense of defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans, the assumptions used to determine the relative fair values of new reportable segments and the assumptions used in the valuation of stock-based compensation awards granted to employees.

Revenue Recognition

The basic criteria necessary for revenue recognition are: (1) evidence that a sales arrangement exists, (2) delivery of goods has occurred, (3) the seller's price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. We recognize revenue when these criteria have been met and when title and risk of loss transfers to the customer, which can be at the plant gate, a distribution facility, a supplier location or a customer destination. Revenue from forward sales programs is recognized on the same basis as other sales (when title and risk of loss transfers to the customer) regardless of when the customer advances are received.

We offer certain incentives that typically involve rebates if a customer reaches a specified level of purchases. Customer incentives are accrued monthly and reported as a reduction in net sales. This process is intended to report sales at the ultimate net realized price and requires the use of estimates.

Shipping and handling fees billed to customers are reported in revenue. Shipping and handling costs incurred by us are included in cost of sales.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash with original maturities of

three

months or less. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value.

Investments

Short-term investments and noncurrent investments are accounted for primarily as available-for-sale securities reported at fair value with changes in fair value reported in other comprehensive income unless fair value is below amortized cost (i.e., the investment is impaired) and the impairment is deemed other-than-temporary, in which case, some or all of the decline in value would be charged to earnings. The carrying values of short-term investments approximate fair values because of the short maturities and the highly liquid nature of these investments.

Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Accounts receivable includes trade receivables and non-trade receivables. Accounts receivable are recorded at face amounts less an allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance is an estimate based on historical collection experience, current economic and market conditions, and a review of the current status of each customer's trade accounts receivable. A receivable is past due if payments have not been received within the agreed-upon invoice terms. Account balances are charged-off against the allowance when management determines that it is probable that the receivable will not be recovered.



CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

Inventories

Inventories are reported at the lower of cost and net realizable value with cost determined on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) and average cost basis. Inventory includes the cost of materials, production labor and production overhead. Inventory at warehouses and terminals also includes distribution costs to move inventory to the distribution facilities. Net realizable value is reviewed at least quarterly. Fixed production costs related to idle capacity are not included in the cost of inventory but are charged directly to cost of sales in the period incurred.

Investment in Unconsolidated Affiliate

The equity method of accounting is used for investments in affiliates that we do not consolidate, but over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence. Our equity method investment for which the results are included in operating earnings consists of our

50%

ownership interest in PLNL, which operates an ammonia production facility in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago. Our share of the net earnings from this investment is reported as an element of earnings from operations because PLNL's operations provide additional production and are integrated with our supply chain and sales activities in the ammonia segment. See Note

7—Equity Method Investments

for additional information.

Profits resulting from sales or purchases with equity method investees are eliminated until realized by the investee or investor, respectively. Investments in affiliates are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. When circumstances indicate that the fair value of an investment in an affiliate is less than its carrying value, and the reduction in value is other than temporary, the reduction in value is recognized immediately in earnings.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method or the units-of-production (UOP) method and are recorded over the estimated useful life of the property, plant and equipment. Useful lives are as follows:

We periodically review the useful lives assigned to our property, plant and equipment, as well as estimated production capacities used to develop UOP depreciation expense, and we change the estimates to reflect the results of those reviews.

Scheduled inspections, replacements and overhauls of plant machinery and equipment at our continuous process manufacturing facilities during a full plant shutdown are referred to as plant turnarounds. Plant turnarounds are accounted for under the deferral method, as opposed to the direct expense or built-in overhaul methods. Under the deferral method, expenditures related to turnarounds are capitalized in property, plant and equipment when incurred and amortized to production costs on a straight-line basis over the period benefited, which is until the next scheduled turnaround in up to

five

years. If the direct expense method were used, all turnaround costs would be expensed as incurred. Internal employee costs and overhead amounts are not considered turnaround costs and are not capitalized. Turnaround costs are classified as investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. See Note

5—Property, Plant and Equipment—Net

for additional information.

Recoverability of Long-Lived Assets

We review property, plant and equipment and other long-lived assets in order to assess recoverability based on expected future undiscounted cash flows whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. If the sum of the expected future net cash flows is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized. The impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized, but is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if certain impairment conditions arise. We perform our annual goodwill impairment review in the fourth quarter of each year at the reporting unit level. Our evaluation can begin with a qualitative assessment of the factors that could impact the significant



CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

inputs used to estimate fair value. If after performing the qualitative assessment, we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, then no further testing is performed. However, if it is unclear based on the results of the qualitative test, we perform a quantitative test involving potentially two steps. The first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. We use an income-based valuation method, determining the present value of future cash flows, to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its positive carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired, and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary. The second step of the goodwill impairment test, if needed, compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. We recognize an impairment loss immediately to the extent the carrying value exceeds its implied fair value.

Our intangible assets are presented in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets. See Note

6—Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

for additional information regarding our goodwill and other intangible assets.

Leases

Leases may be classified as either operating leases or capital leases. Assets acquired under capital leases, if any, would be depreciated on the same basis as property, plant and equipment. For operating leases, rental payments, including rent holidays, leasehold incentives, and scheduled rent increases are expensed on a straight-line basis. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the depreciable lives of the corresponding fixed assets or the lease term including any applicable renewals.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are projected to be recovered or settled. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character in future periods. A valuation allowance is established if it is determined to be more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Significant judgment is applied in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are reported as interest expense and income tax expense, respectively.

Historically, a deferred income tax liability was recorded for income taxes that would result from the repatriation of the portion of the investment in the Company's non-U.S. subsidiaries and joint venture that were considered to not be permanently reinvested.

No

deferred income tax liability was recorded for the remainder of our investment in non-U.S. subsidiaries and joint venture, which we believed to be permanently reinvested.

Customer Advances

Customer advances represent cash received from customers following acceptance of orders under our forward sales programs. Such advances typically represent a significant portion of the contract's sales value and are generally collected by the time the product is shipped, thereby reducing or eliminating accounts receivable from customers upon shipment. Revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss transfers upon shipment or delivery of the product to customers.

Derivative Financial Instruments

Natural gas is the principal raw material used to produce nitrogen fertilizers. We manage the risk of changes in natural gas prices primarily through the use of derivative financial instruments. The derivative instruments that we use are primarily fixed price swaps and options traded in the over-the-counter (OTC) markets. The derivatives reference primarily NYMEX futures contract prices, which represent the basis for fair value at any given time. These derivatives are traded in months forward and settlements are scheduled to coincide with anticipated gas purchases during those future periods.

In order to manage our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our capacity expansion projects, we used foreign currency derivatives, primarily forward exchange contracts. All of these foreign currency derivatives settled in 2016.

The accounting for the change in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether the instrument has been designated as a hedging instrument and whether the instrument is effective as part of a hedging relationship. Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments and the ineffective portion of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations as the changes occur. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments considered effective are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) as the changes occur, and are reclassified into income or expense as the hedged item is recognized in earnings.



CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

Derivative financial instruments are accounted for at fair value and recognized as current or noncurrent assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. The fair values of derivative instruments and any related cash collateral are reported on a gross basis rather than on a net basis.

Cash flows related to natural gas derivatives are reported as operating activities. Cash flows related to foreign currency derivatives were reported as investing activities since they hedged future payments for the construction of long-term assets.

We do not use derivatives for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives. See Note

14—Derivative Financial Instruments

for additional information.

Debt Issuance Costs

Costs associated with the issuance of debt are recorded on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability. Costs associated with entering into revolving credit facilities are recorded as an asset in noncurrent assets. All debt issuance costs are amortized over the term of the related debt. Debt issuance discounts are netted against the related debt and are amortized over the term of the debt using the effective interest method. See Note

11—Financing Agreements

for additional information.

Environmental

Environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate. Expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations are expensed. Expenditures that increase the capacity or extend the useful life of an asset, improve the safety or efficiency of the operations, or mitigate or prevent future environmental contamination are capitalized. Liabilities are recorded when it is probable that an obligation has been incurred, the costs can be reasonably estimated, and the liability would not be discounted.

Stock-based Compensation

We grant stock-based compensation awards under our equity and incentive plans. The awards that have been granted to date are nonqualified stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and performance share units. The cost of employee services received in exchange for the awards is measured based on the fair value of the award on the grant date and is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the period during which the employee is required to provide the services. See Note

18—Stock-Based Compensation

for additional information.

Treasury Stock

We periodically retire treasury shares acquired through repurchases of our common stock and return those shares to the status of authorized but unissued. We account for treasury stock transactions under the cost method. For each reacquisition of common stock, the number of shares and the acquisition price for those shares is added to the treasury stock count and total value. When treasury shares are retired, we allocate the excess of the repurchase price over the par value of shares acquired to both retained earnings and paid-in capital. The portion allocated to paid-in capital is determined by applying the average paid-in capital per share, and the remaining portion is recorded to retained earnings.

Litigation

From time to time, we are subject to ordinary, routine legal proceedings related to the usual conduct of our business. We may also be involved in proceedings regarding public utility and transportation rates, environmental matters, taxes and permits relating to the operations of our various plants and facilities. Accruals for such contingencies are recorded to the extent management concludes their occurrence is probable and the financial impact of an adverse outcome is reasonably estimable. Legal fees are recognized as incurred and are not included in accruals for contingencies. Disclosure for specific legal contingencies is provided if the likelihood of occurrence is at least reasonably possible and the exposure is considered material to the consolidated financial statements. In making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters, many factors are considered. These factors include, but are not limited to, past history, scientific and other evidence, and the specifics and status of each matter. If the assessment of various factors changes, the estimates may change. Predicting the outcome of claims and litigation, and estimating related costs and exposure involves substantial uncertainties that could cause actual costs to vary materially from estimates and accruals.

Foreign Currency Translation

We translate the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies using period-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities and weighted-average exchange rates for each period for revenues and expenses. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of AOCI within stockholders' equity.



CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

Foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities are remeasured into U.S. dollars at exchange rates existing at the respective balance sheet dates. Gains and losses resulting from these foreign currency transactions are included in other operating—net on our consolidated statements of operations. Gains and losses resulting from intercompany foreign currency transactions that are of a long-term investment nature, if any, are reported in other comprehensive income.


.     New Accounting Standards

Recently Adopted Pronouncements

On January 1, 2017, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory. ASU No. 2015-11 changes the inventory measurement principle for entities using the FIFO or average cost methods. For entities utilizing one of these methods, the inventory measurement principle changed from lower of cost or market to the lower of cost and net realizable value. We follow the FIFO or average cost methods and the adoption of ASU No. 2015-11 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Recently Issued Pronouncements

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 605, Revenue Recognition. This ASU is based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments. Additionally, the costs to obtain and fulfill a contract, including assets to be recognized, are to be capitalized and amortized and such capitalized costs should be disclosed. In 2016, the FASB issued additional ASUs that enhance the operability of the principal versus agent guidance in ASU No. 2014-09 by clarifying that an entity should consider the nature of each good or service promised to a customer at the individual good or service level, clarify that ASU No. 2014-09 should not be applied to immaterial performance obligations, and enhance the guidance around the treatment of shipping costs incurred to fulfill performance obligations. We adopted ASU No. 2014-09 on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective approach. While we will provide expanded disclosures as a result of ASU No. 2014-09, the adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which supersedes the lease accounting requirements in ASC Topic 840, Leases. This ASU will require lessees to recognize the rights and obligations resulting from virtually all leases (other than leases that meet the definition of a short-term lease) on their balance sheets as right-of-use assets with corresponding lease liabilities. Extensive quantitative and qualitative disclosures, including significant judgments made by management, will be required to provide greater insight into the extent of income and expense recognized and expected to be recognized from existing contracts. This ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted, and requires the modified retrospective method of adoption. While we are continuing to evaluate the impact of the adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements, we currently believe the most significant change relates to the recognition of new right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on our balance sheet for operating leases for certain property and equipment, including rail car leases and barge tow charters that are utilized for the distribution of our products. See Note

23—Leases

for additional information.

In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory, which requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. The amendments are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017, and should be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. We adopted ASU No. 2016-16 on January 1, 2018. The adoption of ASU No. 2016-16 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-07, Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost, which will change the presentation of net benefit cost related to employer sponsored defined benefit plans and other postretirement benefits. Service cost will be included within the same income statement line item as other compensation costs arising from services rendered during the period, while other components of net benefit cost will be presented separately outside of operating income. Additionally, only service costs may be capitalized on the balance sheet. This ASU is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. On January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU No. 2017-07 retrospectively for the income statement classification requirements and prospectively for the capitalization guidance. The adoption of ASU No. 2017-07 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.



CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities, which improves the financial reporting of hedging relationships in order to better portray the economic results of an entity's risk management activities in its financial statements. The amendments are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018, and should be applied to existing hedging relationships as of the date of adoption. We do not expect the adoption of this ASU will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-2, Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. This ASU allows a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and for interim periods therein. Early adoption of this ASU is permitted. We do not expect the adoption of this ASU will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. See Note

Scheduled replacements and overhauls of plant machinery and equipment include the dismantling, repair or replacement and installation of various components including piping, valves, motors, turbines, pumps, compressors, heat exchangers and the replacement of catalysts when a full plant shutdown occurs. Scheduled inspections are also conducted during full plant shutdowns, including required safety inspections which entail the disassembly of various components such as steam boilers, pressure vessels and other equipment requiring safety certifications. Internal employee costs and overhead amounts are not considered turnaround costs and are not capitalized.

.   Equity Method Investments

Operating Equity Method Investment

We have a

50%

ownership interest in PLNL, which operates an ammonia production facility in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago. We include our share of the net earnings from this equity method investment as an element of earnings from operations because PLNL provides additional production to our operations and is integrated with our other supply chain and sales activities in the ammonia segment.

As of

December 31, 2017

, the total carrying value of our equity method investment in PLNL of approximately

$108 million

was

$55 million

more than our share of PLNL's book value. The excess is attributable to the purchase accounting impact of our acquisition of the investment in PLNL and primarily reflects the revaluation of property, plant and equipment and the value of an exclusive natural gas contract. The increased basis for property, plant and equipment and the gas contract are being amortized over a remaining period of approximately


years and


months, respectively. Our equity in earnings of PLNL is different from our ownership interest in income reported by PLNL due to amortization of these basis differences.

We have transactions in the normal course of business with PLNL reflecting our obligation to purchase

50% of the ammonia produced by PLNL

at current market prices. Our ammonia purchases from PLNL totaled

$76 million

,

$62 million

and

$121 million

in


,


and


, respectively.

PLNL operates an ammonia plant that relies on natural gas supplied, under a Gas Sales Contract (the NGC Contract), by The National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago Limited (NGC). PLNL has experienced curtailments in the supply of natural gas from NGC, which have reduced the ammonia production at PLNL. The NGC Contract had an initial expiration date of September 2018 and has been extended on the same terms until September 2023. Any NGC commitment to supply gas beyond 2023 will need to be based on new agreements regarding volume and price. PLNL and NGC are currently parties to arbitration proceedings where the main issue remaining in dispute is PLNL's claims for damages from the supply curtailments.

Although PLNL believes its claims against NGC to be meritorious, it is not possible to predict the outcome of the arbitration. There are significant assumptions in the future operations of the joint venture, beyond 2023, that are uncertain at this time, including the quantities of gas that NGC will make available, the cost of such gas, the estimates that are used to determine the useful lives of fixed assets and the assumptions in the discounted cash flow models utilized for recoverability and impairment testing. As part of our impairment assessment of our equity method investment in PLNL during the fourth quarters of 2016 and 2015, we determined the carrying value exceeded the fair value and recognized a

$134 million

and

$62 million

impairment charge in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The carrying value of our equity method investment in PLNL at

December 31, 2017

is

$108 million

. If NGC does not make sufficient quantities of natural gas available to PLNL at prices that permit profitable operations, PLNL may cease operating its facility and we would write off the remaining investment in PLNL.

The Trinidad tax authority (the Board of Inland Revenue) has issued a tax assessment against PLNL related to a dispute over whether tax depreciation must be claimed during a tax holiday period that was granted to PLNL under the Trinidad Fiscal Incentives Act. The tax holiday was granted as an incentive to construct PLNL’s ammonia plant. Based on the facts and circumstances of this matter, PLNL recorded a tax contingency accrual in the second quarter of 2017, which reduced our equity in earnings of PLNL for


by approximately

$7 million

reflecting our

50%

ownership interest. In early 2018, PLNL settled this matter with the Board of Inland Revenue for the amounts accrued.

In the fourth quarter of 2017, we sold our interest in a joint venture that owns a carbon dioxide liquefaction and purification facility and recognized a gain of

$14 million

, which is included in equity in earnings (losses) of operating affiliates in our consolidated statements of operations.

Non-Operating Equity Method Investments

We no longer have non-operating equity method investments as a result of the sale of our

50%

ownership interest in KEYTRADE AG (Keytrade) during the second quarter of 2015 and our July 31, 2015 acquisition of the remaining

50%

equity interest in CF Fertilisers UK not previously owned by us for total consideration of

$570 million

. As a result of the acquisition,

CF Fertilisers UK

became a wholly owned subsidiary. The financial results of

CF Fertilisers UK

have been consolidated within our financial results since July 31, 2015.

Equity in earnings of non-operating affiliates—net of taxes for the year ended

December 31, 2015

Restricted Cash

We maintained a cash account for which the use of the funds was restricted. The restricted cash account was put in place to satisfy certain requirements included in our engineering and procurement services contract for our capacity expansion projects. Under the terms of this contract, we were required to grant an affiliate of ThyssenKrupp Industrial Solutions a security interest in a restricted cash account. During 2017, the remaining balance in our restricted cash account was returned to us and the account was closed.

Nonqualified Employee Benefit Trusts

We maintain trusts associated with certain nonqualified supplemental pension plans. The investments are accounted for as available-for-sale securities. The fair values of the trust assets are based on daily quoted prices in an active market, which represents the net asset values of the shares held in the trusts. These trusts are included on our consolidated balance sheets in other assets.

Derivative Instruments

The derivative instruments that we use are primarily natural gas fixed price swaps and natural gas options traded in the over-the-counter (OTC) markets with multi-national commercial banks, other major financial institutions or large energy companies. The natural gas derivative contracts represent anticipated natural gas needs for future periods and settlements are scheduled to coincide with anticipated natural gas purchases during those future periods. The natural gas derivative contracts settle using primarily NYMEX futures prices. To determine the fair value of these instruments, we use quoted market prices from NYMEX and standard pricing models with inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data such as forward curves supplied by an industry-recognized independent third party. See Note

14—Derivative Financial Instruments

for additional information.

Embedded Derivative Liability

Under the terms of our strategic venture with CHS, if our credit rating as determined by two of three specified credit rating agencies is below certain levels, we are required to make a non-refundable yearly payment of

$5 million

to CHS. Since our credit ratings were below certain levels in 2016 and 2017, we made a payment of

$5 million

to CHS in each year. These payments will continue on a yearly basis until the earlier of the date that our credit rating is upgraded to or above certain levels by two of the three specified credit rating agencies or February 1, 2026. This obligation is recognized on our consolidated balance sheets as an embedded derivative. As of

December 31, 2017

and


, the embedded derivative liability of

$25 million

and

$26 million

, respectively, is included in other current liabilities and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. The inputs into the fair value measurement include the probability of future upgrades and downgrades of our credit rating based on historical credit rating movements of other public companies and the discount rates to be applied to potential annual payments based on applicable credit spreads of other public companies at different credit rating levels. Based on these inputs, our fair value measurement is classified as Level 2.

Financial Instruments

The carrying amounts and estimated fair value of our financial instruments are as follows:

The fair value of our long-term debt was based on quoted prices for identical or similar liabilities in markets that are not active or valuation models in which all significant inputs and value drivers are observable and, as a result, they are classified as Level 2 inputs.

The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, as well as instruments included in other current assets and other current liabilities that meet the definition of financial instruments, approximate fair values because of their short-term maturities.

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis

We also have assets and liabilities that may be measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, the assets and liabilities are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis, but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances, such as when there is evidence of impairment, allocation of purchase price in an acquisition or when a new liability is being established that requires fair value measurement. These include long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries, such as equity method investments, which may be written down to fair value as a result of impairment. The fair value measurements related to each of these rely primarily on Company-specific inputs and the Company's assumptions about the use of the assets. Since certain of the Company’s assumptions would involve inputs that are not observable, these fair values would reside within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

We review the carrying value of our goodwill, definite lived intangible assets, and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries to assess recoverability as part of our annual impairment review in the fourth quarter of each year. As part of the assessment process when performing impairment tests, we estimate many factors including future sales volume, selling prices, raw materials costs, operating rates, operating expenses, inflation, discount rates, exchange rates, tax rates and capital spending. The assumptions we make are material estimates that are used in the impairment testing.

Our equity method investment in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, PLNL, operates an ammonia plant that relies on natural gas supplied by NGC pursuant to the NGC Contract. As part of our impairment assessment of our equity method investment in PLNL during the fourth quarter of 2016, we determined the carrying value exceeded the fair value and recognized a

$134 million

impairment charge in 2016. Previously, in 2015, we recognized an impairment charge of

$62 million

related to our equity method investment in PLNL. See Note

.   Income Taxes

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Act" or "Tax Reform"). The impact of this new legislation is included in the period of enactment in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The most significant impact of this legislation to us is the revaluation of our deferred taxes as a result of the reduction in the federal tax rate from 35% to 21%, which is effective on January 1, 2018. The Tax Act also imposes a transition tax liability on our previously untaxed foreign earnings that is payable over an eight-year period beginning in 2018. The amount recorded in the period of enactment for the transition tax liability represents our current estimate of the provisions of the Tax Act and is a provisional amount based on amounts reasonably estimable. See further discussion below related to this estimate, which may be adjusted as more information becomes available prior to the end of the one-year measurement period in December 2018.

The components of (loss) earnings before income taxes and equity in earnings of non-operating affiliates are as follows:

The components of the income tax (benefit) provision are as follows:



CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

Our preliminary estimate of the transition tax liability resulting from the Tax Act could be impacted by further regulatory or other government guidance relating to provisions of existing laws or the Tax Act. If more information becomes available to cause our provisional amount to change, we will adjust our liability within the measurement period ending in December 2018.

Differences in the expected income tax (benefit) provision based on statutory rates applied to (loss) earnings before income taxes and the income tax (benefit) provision reflected in the consolidated statements of operations are summarized below:

(1)

Income tax (benefit) provision before Tax Reform reflects the income tax (benefit) provision less the Tax Reform impacts included in the table above consisting of U.S. enacted tax rate change (Tax Reform) and transition tax liability and other.

Our effective tax rate is impacted by earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in CFN for 2017 and 2016 and TNCLP for 2017, 2016 and 2015, as our consolidated income tax (benefit) provision does not include a tax provision on the earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interests. As a result, earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interests of

$92 million

,

$119 million

and

$34 million

in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which are included in (loss) earnings before income taxes and equity in earnings of non-operating affiliates, impact the effective tax rate in all three years. See Note

16—Noncontrolling Interests

for additional information.

We recorded a tax receivable of approximately

$22 million

as a result of our intention to carryback the tax net operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 to prior tax years. As a result of the carryback, the income tax provision for the tax year ended December 31, 2017 includes the tax impact of the recaptured U.S. manufacturing profits deductions claimed in prior years that will not be deductible. The tax receivable from the net operating loss carryback has been reduced by an alternative minimum tax of

$36 million

in the carryback periods. The alternative minimum tax that would be incurred as a result of the carryback of the net operating loss will become a refundable tax credit as a result of the impact of the Tax Act. These refundable tax credits are available for tax years subsequent to the tax year ended December 31, 2017 and are recorded in our noncurrent tax receivable. The

$22 million

tax receivable for the net operating loss carryback is included in prepaid income taxes on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2017.

A federal income tax benefit of

$145 million

(

$242 million

before the impact of the Tax Act) was recorded for the amount of the net operating loss for the tax year ended December 31, 2017 that will carryforward to subsequent tax years. The net operating loss carryforward is approximately

$692 million

and is available until the tax year 2037.



CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

State income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 includes a tax benefit of

$30 million

and

$46 million

respectively, net of federal tax effect, for state net operating loss carryforwards.

State income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2016 were impacted by investment tax credits of

$13 million

, net of federal tax effect, related to capital assets placed in service at our production facilities in Oklahoma that are indefinitely available to offset income taxes in that jurisdiction in future years. Our effective state income tax rate was also reduced as a result of the changes to our legal entity structure effected in the first quarter of 2016 as part of our strategic venture with CHS. See Note

16—Noncontrolling Interests

for additional information.

The income tax provision for the tax year ended December 31, 2016 includes the tax impact of the U.S. manufacturing profits deductions claimed in prior years that will not be deductible as a result of the carryback of the tax net operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2016.

Non-deductible capital costs for the tax year ended December 31, 2016 include certain transaction costs capitalized in the prior year that are now deductible as a result of the termination of the proposed combination with certain businesses of OCI N.V. (OCI).

The foreign tax rate differential is impacted by the inclusion of equity earnings from our equity method investment in PLNL, a foreign operating affiliate, which are included in pre-tax earnings on an after-tax basis and the tax effect of net operating losses of a foreign subsidiary of the Company for which a valuation allowance has been recorded. We determined the carrying value of our equity method investment in PLNL exceeded fair value and recognized an impairment of our equity method investment in PLNL of

$134 million

in the fourth quarter of 2016 and

$62 million

in the fourth quarter of 2015. The impairments are included in equity in earnings of operating affiliates. Our income tax provisions do not include a tax benefit for the impairment of our equity method investment as the impairment does not give rise to a tax deduction. See Note

7—Equity Method Investments

for additional information.

Foreign subsidiaries of the Company have incurred capital losses of

$116 million

that are indefinitely available to offset capital gains in the applicable foreign jurisdictions. As the future realization of these carryforwards is not anticipated, a valuation allowance of

$29 million

was recorded in the year ended December 31, 2016.

The foreign tax rate differential for the tax year ended December 31, 2016 includes a

$5 million

deferred tax benefit for an enacted tax rate change.

Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are as follows:



CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

Investments in partnerships in the table above reflects the deferred tax liability for our investments in CFN and TNCLP. These amounts were previously presented in the corresponding deferred tax asset and liability amounts; therefore, the amounts representing the deferred tax liability for our investments in partnerships as of December 31, 2016 have been reclassified to the investments in partnerships to conform to the current year presentation.

A foreign subsidiary of the Company has net operating loss carryforwards of

$383 million

that are indefinitely available in the foreign jurisdiction. As the future realization of these carryforwards is not anticipated, a valuation allowance of

$100 million

has been recorded. Of this amount,

$11 million

and

$17 million

were recorded as valuation allowances in the years ended

December 31, 2017

and


, respectively.

We consider the earnings of certain of our Canadian operating subsidiaries to not be permanently reinvested and we recognize a deferred tax liability for the future repatriation of these earnings, as they are earned. As of

December 31, 2017

, we have recorded a deferred income tax liability of approximately

$28 million

, which reflects the additional U.S. and foreign income taxes that would be due upon the repatriation of the accumulated earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries that are considered to not be permanently reinvested.

We file federal, provincial, state and local income tax returns principally in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, as well as in certain other foreign jurisdictions. In general, filed tax returns remain subject to examination by United States tax jurisdictions for years 1999 and thereafter, by Canadian tax jurisdictions for years 2006 and thereafter, and by United Kingdom tax jurisdictions for years 2015 and thereafter. Our income tax liability or transition tax expense could be impacted by the finalization of currently on-going U.S. or foreign income tax audits of prior tax years falling before the date of enactment of the Tax Act or audits by the U.S. or foreign taxing authorities, which change the amount of our total income allocable to and taxed in the United States or a foreign country.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

Unrecognized tax benefits decreased by

$12 million

in 2017 and

$21 million

in 2016. Our effective tax rate would be affected by

$91 million

if these unrecognized tax benefits were to be recognized in the future.

Interest expense and penalties of

$2 million

,

$4 million

, and

$4 million

were recorded for the years ended

December 31, 2017

,


and


, respectively. Amounts recognized in our consolidated balance sheets for accrued interest and penalties related to income taxes of

$29 million

and

$28 million

are included in other liabilities as of

December 31, 2017

and


, respectively.

On December 18, 2015, the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 (PATH Act) was signed into law and was applicable to tax years 2015 through 2019. One of the provisions of the PATH Act permitted companies to deduct 50% of their capital expenditures for federal income tax purposes in the year qualifying assets were placed into service. We recorded a federal tax receivable of approximately

$816 million

for the year ended December 31, 2016 as a result of our intention at that time to carryback the tax net operating loss that was principally the result of this tax law change. The tax receivable was primarily associated with completion of the new capacity expansion projects that were placed into service at our Donaldsonville, Louisiana and Port Neal, Iowa complexes during November and December of 2016. The tax receivable is included in prepaid income taxes on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016 and was received in the second quarter of 2017.



CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

During the third quarter of 2015, we acquired the remaining

50%

equity interest in CF Fertilisers UK not previously owned by us and recognized a

$94 million

gain on the remeasurement to fair value of our initial

50%

equity interest in CF Fertilisers UK. The earnings in CF Fertilisers UK have been permanently reinvested. Therefore, the recognition of the

$94 million

gain on the remeasurement of the historical equity investment does not include the recognition of tax expense on the gain. See Note

7—Equity Method Investments

for additional information.

We recorded an income tax benefit of

$12 million

during the second quarter of 2015 for the pre-tax losses on the sale of equity method investments. The tax benefit related to the loss on the sale of our interests in Keytrade is included in equity in earnings of non-operating affiliates

.   Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

We maintain

five

funded pension plans

three

in North America (

one

U.S. plan and

two

Canadian plans) and

two

in the United Kingdom.

One

of our Canadian plans is closed to new employees and the

two

United Kingdom plans are closed to new employees and future accruals. We also provide group medical insurance benefits to certain retirees in North America. The specific medical benefits provided to retirees vary by group and location.

Our plan assets, benefit obligations, funded status and amounts recognized on the consolidated balance sheets for our North America and United Kingdom plans as of the

December 31

measurement date are as follows:

In the table above, the line titled "change in assumptions and other" for our pension plans primarily reflects the impact of changes in discount rates, the adoption of new mortality assumptions, and updated census data in the United Kingdom.

Our pension funding policy in North America is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet minimum legal funding requirements plus discretionary amounts that we may deem to be appropriate. Actual contributions may vary from estimated amounts depending on changes in assumptions, actual returns on plan assets, changes in regulatory requirements and funding decisions.

In accordance with United Kingdom pension legislation, our United Kingdom pension funding policy is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet the funding level target agreed between the employer and the trustees of the United Kingdom plans.  Actual contributions are usually agreed with the plan trustees in connection with each triennial valuation and may vary following each such review depending on changes in assumptions, actual returns on plan assets, changes in regulatory requirements and funding decisions.

Our consolidated pension funding contributions for


are estimated to be approximately

$15 million

for the North America plans and

$26 million

for the United Kingdom plans.

The expected future benefit payments for our pension and retiree medical plans are as follows:



CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

The following assumptions were used in determining the benefit obligations and expense:

______________________________________________________________________________

n/a—not applicable

The discount rates for all plans are developed by plan using spot rates derived from a yield curve of high quality (AA rated or better) fixed income debt securities as of the year-end measurement date to calculate discounted cash flows (the projected benefit obligation) and solving for a single equivalent discount rate that produces the same projected benefit obligation. In determining our benefit obligation, we use the actuarial present value of the vested benefits to which each eligible employee is currently entitled, based on the employee’s expected date of separation or retirement.

For our North America plans, the expected long-term rate of return on assets is based on analysis of historical rates of return achieved by equity and non-equity investments and current market characteristics, adjusted for estimated plan expenses and weighted by target asset allocation percentages. As of January 1,


, our weighted-average expected long-term rate of return on assets is

4.5%

.

For our United Kingdom plans, the expected long-term rate of return on assets is based on the expected long-term performance of the underlying investments, adjusted for investment managers' fees. As of January 1,


, our weighted-average expected long-term rate of return on assets is

4.2%

.

The retail price index for the United Kingdom plans is developed using the Bank of England implied retail price inflation curve, which is based on the difference between yields on fixed interest government bonds and index-linked government bonds.

For the measurement of the benefit obligation at

December 31, 2017

for our primary (U.S.) retiree medical benefit plans, the assumed health care cost trend rates, for pre-65 retirees, start with a

8.0%

increase in


, followed by a gradual decline in increases to

4.5%

for


and thereafter. For post-65 retirees, the assumed health care cost trend rates start with a

9.5%

increase in


, followed by a gradual decline in increases to

4.5%

for


and thereafter. For the measurement of the benefit obligation at

December 31, 2016

for our primary (U.S.) retiree medical benefit plans, the assumed health care cost trend rates, for pre-65 retirees, start with a

7.0%

increase in 2017, followed by a gradual decline in increases to

4.5%

for


and thereafter. For post-65 retirees, the assumed health care cost trend rates start with a

8.5%

increase in


, followed by a gradual decline in increases to

4.5%

for


and thereafter.

A one-percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate of our primary (U.S.) retiree medical benefit plans as of

December 31, 2017

would have the following effects on our retiree medical benefit plans:



CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

The objectives of the investment policies governing the pension plans are to administer the assets of the plans for the benefit of the participants in compliance with all laws and regulations, and to establish an asset mix that provides for diversification and considers the risk of various different asset classes with the purpose of generating favorable investment returns. The investment policies consider circumstances such as participant demographics, time horizon to retirement and liquidity needs, and provide guidelines for asset allocation, planning horizon, general portfolio issues and investment manager evaluation criteria. The investment strategies for the plans, including target asset allocations and investment vehicles, are subject to change within the guidelines of the policies.

The target asset allocation for our U.S. pension plan is

80%

non-equity and

20%

equity, which has been determined based on analysis of actual historical rates of return and plan needs and circumstances. The equity investments are tailored to exceed the growth of the benefit obligation and are a combination of U.S. and non-U.S. total stock market index mutual funds. The non-equity investments consist primarily of investments in debt securities and money market instruments that are selected based on investment quality and duration to mitigate volatility of the funded status and annual required contributions. The non-equity investments have a duration profile that is similar to the benefit obligation in order to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes on the funded status. This investment strategy is achieved through the use of mutual funds and individual securities.

The target asset allocation for the CF Canadian plan is

60%

non-equity and

40%

equity, and for the Terra Canadian plan is

85%

non-equity and

15%

equity. The equity investments are passively managed portfolios that diversify assets across multiple securities, economic sectors and countries. The non-equity investments are high quality passively managed portfolios that diversify assets across economic sectors, countries and maturity spectrums. This investment strategy is achieved through the use of mutual funds.

The pension assets in the United Kingdom plans are each administered by a Board of Trustees consisting of employer nominated trustees, member nominated trustees and an independent trustee. Trustees may be appointed or removed by CF Fertilisers UK, provided CF Fertilisers UK fulfills its obligation to have at least one third of the Board of Trustees as member nominated. It is the responsibility of the trustees to ensure prudent management and investment of the assets in the plans. The trustees meet on a quarterly basis to review and discuss fund performance and other administrative matters.

The trustees’ investment objectives are to hold assets that generate returns sufficient to cover prudently each plan's liability without exposing the plans to unacceptable risk. This is accomplished through the asset allocation strategy of each plan.  For both plans, if the asset allocation moves more than plus or minus 5% from the benchmark allocation, the trustees may decide to amend the asset allocation. At a minimum, the trustees review the investment strategy at every triennial actuarial valuation to ensure that the strategy remains consistent with its funding principles. The trustees may review the strategy more frequently if opportunities arise to reduce risk within the investments without jeopardizing the funding position.

Assets of the United Kingdom plans are invested in externally managed pooled funds. The target asset allocation for the United Kingdom Terra plan is

55%

actively managed target return funds,

30%

actively and passively managed bond and gilt funds and

15%

actively managed property funds. The target asset allocation for the United Kingdom Kemira plan is

50%

actively managed target return funds,

45%

actively and passively managed bond and gilt funds and

5%

in an actively managed property fund. The target return funds diversify assets across multiple asset classes (which may include, among others, traditional equities and bonds) and may use derivatives. The bond and gilt funds generally invest in fixed income debt securities including government bonds, gilts, high yield and emerging market bonds, and investment grade corporate bonds and may use derivatives. The property funds are invested predominately in freehold and leasehold property.

Pooled property funds invest primarily in freehold and leasehold property in the United Kingdom.  The funds are valued using NAV as a practical expedient. NAV is determined by the fund managers based on the value of the underlying net assets of the fund.

We have defined contribution plans covering substantially all employees in North America and the United Kingdom. In North America, depending on the specific provisions of each plan, qualified employees receive company contributions based on a percentage of base salary, matching of employee contributions up to specified limits, or a combination of both. Qualified employees in the United Kingdom receive company contributions based on a percentage of base salary that are greater than employee contributions up to specified limits. In

Public Senior Notes

Under the indentures (including the applicable supplemental indentures) governing the senior notes due 2018, 2020, 2023, 2034, 2043 and 2044 identified in the table above (the Public Senior Notes), each series of Public Senior Notes is guaranteed by CF Holdings. Interest on the Public Senior Notes is payable semiannually, and the Public Senior Notes are redeemable at our option, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at specified make-whole redemption prices. The indentures governing the Public Senior Notes contain customary events of default (including cross-default triggered by acceleration of, or a principal payment default that is not cured within an applicable grace period under, other debt having a principal amount of

$150 million

or more) and covenants that limit, among other things, the ability of CF Holdings and its subsidiaries, including CF Industries, to incur liens on certain properties to secure debt.

If a Change of Control occurs together with a Ratings Downgrade (as both terms are defined under the indentures governing the Public Senior Notes), CF Industries would be required to offer to repurchase each series of Public Senior Notes at a price equal to

101%

of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, in the event that a subsidiary of CF Holdings, other than CF Industries, becomes a borrower or a guarantor under the Revolving Credit Agreement (or any renewal, replacement or refinancing thereof), such subsidiary would be required to become a guarantor of the Public Senior Notes, provided that such requirement will no longer apply with respect to the Public Senior Notes due 2023, 2034, 2043 and 2044 following the repayment of the Public Senior Notes due 2018 and 2020 or the subsidiaries of ours, other than CF Industries, otherwise becoming no longer subject to such a requirement to guarantee the Public Senior Notes due 2018 and 2020.

On November 21, 2016, in connection with the effectiveness of the November 2016 Credit Agreement Amendment, CF Industries Enterprises, Inc. (CFE) and CF Industries Sales, LLC (CFS) became subsidiary guarantors of the Public Senior Notes.

On December 1, 2017, CF Industries completed the early redemption of all of the

$800 million

outstanding principal amount of the 6.875% senior notes due May 2018 (the 2018 Notes) in accordance with the optional redemption provisions provided in the indenture governing the 2018 Notes. The total aggregate redemption price was approximately

$817 million

. On December 26, 2017, CF Industries purchased approximately

$300 million

aggregate principal amount of the

$800 million

outstanding principal amount of the 7.125% senior notes due 2020 (the 2020 Notes) pursuant to a tender offer. The aggregate purchase price was approximately

$331 million

. As a result of the early redemption of the 2018 Notes and the purchase of the 2020 Notes, we recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of

$53 million

, primarily consisting of

$48 million

of premiums paid for the early retirement of debt for the 2018 Notes and 2020 Notes.



CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

Senior Secured Notes

On November 21, 2016, CF Industries issued

$500 million

aggregate principal amount of

3.400%

senior secured notes due 2021 (the 2021 Notes) and

$750 million

aggregate principal amount of

4.500%

senior secured notes due 2026 (the 2026 Notes, and together with the 2021 Notes, the Senior Secured Notes). The net proceeds, after deducting discounts and offering expenses, from the issuance and sale of the Senior Secured Notes were approximately

$1.23 billion

. CF Industries used approximately

$1.18 billion

of the net proceeds for the prepayment (including payment of a make-whole amount of approximately

$170 million

and accrued interest) in full of the outstanding

$1.0 billion

aggregate principal amount of the Private Senior Notes.  See "—Private Senior Notes," below.

Interest on the Senior Secured Notes is payable semiannually on December 1 and June 1 beginning on June 1, 2017, and the Senior Secured Notes are redeemable at our option, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at specified make-whole redemption prices.

Under the terms of the applicable indenture, the Senior Secured Notes of each series are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior secured basis, jointly and severally, by CF Holdings and each current and future domestic subsidiary of CF Holdings (other than CF Industries) that from time to time is a borrower, or guarantees indebtedness, under the Revolving Credit Agreement. In accordance with the applicable indenture, CFE and CFS, in addition to CF Holdings, guaranteed the Senior Secured Notes of each series upon the initial issuance of the Senior Secured Notes.

Subject to certain exceptions, the obligations under each series of Senior Secured Notes and each guarantor’s related guarantee are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of CF Industries, CF Holdings and the subsidiary guarantors, including a pledge by CFS of its equity interests in CFN and mortgages over certain material fee-owned domestic real properties (the Collateral). The obligations under the Revolving Credit Agreement, together with certain letter of credit, hedging and similar obligations and future pari passu secured indebtedness, will be secured by the Collateral on a pari passu basis with the Senior Secured Notes. The liens on the Collateral securing the obligations under the Senior Secured Notes of a series and the related guarantees will be automatically released and the covenant under the applicable indenture limiting dispositions of Collateral will no longer apply if on any date after the initial issuance of the Senior Secured Notes CF Holdings has an investment grade corporate rating, with a stable or better outlook, from two of three selected ratings agencies and there is no default or event of default under the applicable indenture.

Under each of the indentures governing the Senior Secured Notes, specified changes of control involving CF Holdings or CF Industries, when accompanied by a ratings downgrade, as defined with respect to the applicable series of Senior Secured Notes, constitute change of control repurchase events. Upon the occurrence of a change of control repurchase event with respect to the 2021 Notes or the 2026 Notes, as applicable, unless CF Industries has exercised its option to redeem such Senior Secured Notes, CF Industries will be required to offer to repurchase them at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of repurchase.

The indentures governing the Senior Secured Notes contain covenants that limit, among other things, the ability of CF Holdings and its subsidiaries, including CF Industries, to incur liens on certain assets to secure debt, to engage in sale and leaseback transactions, to sell or transfer Collateral, to merge or consolidate with other entities and to sell, lease or transfer all or substantially all of the assets of CF Holdings and its subsidiaries to another entity. Each of the indentures governing the Senior Secured Notes provides for customary events of default, which include (subject in certain cases to customary grace and cure periods), among others, nonpayment of principal or interest on the applicable Senior Secured Notes; failure to comply with other covenants or agreements under the indenture; certain defaults on other indebtedness; the failure of CF Holdings' or certain subsidiaries’ guarantees of the applicable Senior Secured Notes to be enforceable; lack of validity or perfection of any lien securing the obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the guarantees with respect to Collateral having an aggregate fair market value equal to or greater than a specified amount; and specified events of bankruptcy or insolvency. Under each indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes, in the case of an event of default arising from one of the specified events of bankruptcy or insolvency, the applicable Senior Secured Notes would become due and payable immediately, and, in the case of any other event of default (other than an event of default related to CF Industries' and CF Holdings' reporting obligations), the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the applicable Senior Secured Notes then outstanding may declare all of such Senior Secured Notes to be due and payable immediately.

Private Senior Notes

The senior notes due 2022, 2025 and 2027 (the Private Senior Notes), issued by CF Industries on September 24, 2015, were governed by the terms of a note purchase agreement (as amended, including by an amendment effective September 7, 2016, the Note Purchase Agreement). The Private Senior Notes were guaranteed by CF Holdings. All obligations under the Note Purchase Agreement were unsecured.



CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

On November 21, 2016, we prepaid in full the outstanding

$1.0 billion

aggregate principal amount of our Private Senior Notes. The prepayment of

$1.18 billion

included the payment of a make-whole amount of approximately

$170 million

and accrued interest. Loss on debt extinguishment of

$167 million

on our consolidated statements of operations excludes

$3 million

of the make-whole payment, which was accounted for as a modification and recognized on our consolidated balance sheet as deferred financing fees, a reduction of long-term debt, and is being amortized using the effective interest rate method over the term of the Senior Secured Notes.

Bridge Credit Agreement

On August 6, 2015, we entered into a definitive agreement (as amended, the Combination Agreement) to combine with the European, North American and global distribution businesses of OCI N.V. (OCI). On September 18, 2015, in connection with the proposed combination, CF Holdings and CF Industries entered into a senior unsecured


-Day Bridge Credit Agreement (as amended, the Bridge Credit Agreement). Upon the termination of the Combination Agreement in the second quarter of 2016, the lenders’ commitments under the Bridge Credit Agreement terminated automatically. There were no borrowings under the Bridge Credit Agreement. See Note

.   Derivative Financial Instruments

We use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to changes in commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates.

Commodity Price Risk Management

Natural gas is the largest and most volatile component of the manufacturing cost for nitrogen-based products. We manage the risk of changes in natural gas prices primarily through the use of derivative financial instruments. The derivatives that we use for this purpose are primarily natural gas fixed price swaps and natural gas options traded in the OTC markets. These natural gas derivatives settle using primarily a NYMEX futures price index, which represents the basis for fair value at any given time. We enter into natural gas derivative contracts with respect to natural gas to be consumed by us in the future, and settlements of those derivative contracts are scheduled to coincide with our anticipated purchases of natural gas used to manufacture nitrogen products during those future periods. We use natural gas derivatives as an economic hedge of natural gas price risk, but without the application of hedge accounting. As a result, changes in fair value of these contracts are recognized in earnings. As of

December 31, 2017

, we have natural gas derivative contracts covering periods through the end of 2018.

As of

December 31, 2017

and


, we had open natural gas derivative contracts for

35.9 million

MMBtus and

183.0 million

MMBtus, respectively. For the year ended

December 31, 2017

, we used derivatives to cover approximately

42%

of our natural gas consumption.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rates

A portion of the costs for our completed capacity expansion projects at our Donaldsonville, Louisiana complex and Port Neal, Iowa complex were euro-denominated. In order to manage our exposure to changes in the euro to U.S. dollar currency exchange rates, we hedged our projected euro-denominated payments through the end of 2016 using foreign currency forward contracts.



CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

As of

December 31, 2017

and December 31, 2016, accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCL) includes

$6 million

and

$7 million

, respectively, of pre-tax gains related to the foreign currency derivatives that were originally designated as cash flow hedges. The balance in AOCL is being reclassified into income over the depreciable lives of the property, plant and equipment associated with the capacity expansion projects, of which

$1 million

was reclassifed into income in 2017.

The effect of derivatives in our consolidated statements of operations is shown in the table below:

The fair values of derivatives on our consolidated balance sheets are shown below. As of

December 31, 2017

and


, none of our derivative instruments were designated as hedging instruments. See Note

8—Fair Value Measurements

for additional information on derivative fair values.

The counterparties to our derivative contracts are multinational commercial banks, major financial institutions and large energy companies. Our derivatives are executed with several counterparties, generally under International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) agreements. The ISDA agreements are master netting arrangements commonly used for OTC derivatives that mitigate exposure to counterparty credit risk, in part, by creating contractual rights of netting and setoff, the specifics of which vary from agreement to agreement. These rights are described further below:

•

Settlement netting generally allows us and our counterparties to net, into a single net payable or receivable, ordinary settlement obligations arising between us under the ISDA agreement on the same day, in the same currency, for the same types of derivative instruments, and through the same pairing of offices.

•

Close-out netting rights are provided in the event of a default or other termination event (as defined in the ISDA agreements), including bankruptcy. Depending on the cause of early termination, the non-defaulting party may elect to terminate all or some transactions outstanding under the ISDA agreement. The values of all terminated transactions and certain other payments under the ISDA agreement are netted, resulting in a single net close-out amount payable to or by the non-defaulting party. Termination values may be determined using a mark-to-market approach or based on a party's good faith estimate of its loss. If the final net close-out amount is payable by the non-defaulting party, that party's obligation to make the payment may be conditioned on factors such as the termination of all derivative transactions between the parties or payment in full of all of the defaulting party's obligations to the non-defaulting party, in each case regardless of whether arising under the ISDA agreement or otherwise.

•

Setoff rights are provided by certain of our ISDA agreements and generally allow a non-defaulting party to elect to set off, against the final net close-out payment, other matured and contingent amounts payable between us and our counterparties under the ISDA agreement or otherwise. Typically, these setoff rights arise upon the early termination of all transactions outstanding under an ISDA agreement following a default or specified termination event.



CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

Most of our ISDA agreements contain credit-risk-related contingent features such as cross default provisions and credit support thresholds. In the event of certain defaults or a credit ratings downgrade, our counterparty may request early termination and net settlement of certain derivative trades or may require us to collateralize derivatives in a net liability position. The Revolving Credit Agreement, at any time when it is secured, provides a cross collateral feature for those of our derivatives that are with counterparties that are party to, or affiliates of parties to, the Revolving Credit Agreement so that no separate collateral would be required for those counterparties in connection with such derivatives. In the event the Revolving Credit Agreement becomes unsecured, separate collateral could be required in connection with such derivatives. As of

December 31, 2017

and


, the aggregate fair value of the derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features in net liability positions was

$12 million

and

zero

, respectively, which also approximates the fair value of the maximum amount of additional collateral that would need to be posted or assets needed to settle the obligations if the credit-risk-related contingent features were triggered at the reporting dates. As of

December 31, 2017

and


, we had

no

cash collateral on deposit with counterparties for derivative contracts. The credit support documents executed in connection with certain of our ISDA agreements generally provide us and our counterparties the right to set off collateral against amounts owing under the ISDA agreements upon the occurrence of a default or a specified termination event.

The following table presents amounts relevant to offsetting of our derivative assets and liabilities as of

December 31, 2017

and


:

_______________________________________________________________________________

(1)

We report the fair values of our derivative assets and liabilities on a gross basis on our consolidated balance sheets. As a result, the gross amounts recognized and net amounts presented are the same.

We do not believe the contractually allowed netting, close-out netting or setoff of amounts owed to, or due from, the counterparties to our ISDA agreements would have a material effect on our financial position.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of noncontrolling interests and distributions payable to the noncontrolling interests on our consolidated balance sheets is provided below.



CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

CF Industries Nitrogen, LLC (CFN)

We commenced a strategic venture with CHS on February 1, 2016, at which time CHS purchased a minority equity interest in CFN, a subsidiary of CF Holdings, for

$2.8 billion

, which represented approximately

11%

of the membership interest of CFN. We own the remaining membership interest. Under the terms of CFN's limited liability company agreement, each member’s interest will reflect, over time, the impact of the profitability of CFN and any member contributions made to, and distributions received from, CFN. For financial reporting purposes, the assets, liabilities and earnings of the strategic venture are consolidated into our financial statements. CHS' interest in the strategic venture is recorded in noncontrolling interests in our consolidated financial statements. On February 1, 2016, CHS also began receiving deliveries pursuant to a supply agreement under which CHS has the right to purchase annually from CFN up to approximately

1.1 million

tons of granular urea and

580,000

tons of UAN at market prices. As a result of its minority equity interest in CFN, CHS is entitled to semi-annual cash distributions from CFN. We are also entitled to semi-annual cash distributions from CFN. The amounts of distributions from CFN to us and CHS are based generally on the profitability of CFN and determined based on the volume of granular urea and UAN sold by CFN to us and CHS pursuant to supply agreements, less a formula driven amount based primarily on the cost of natural gas used to produce the granular urea and UAN, and adjusted for the allocation of items such as operational efficiencies and overhead amounts.

Additionally, under the terms of the strategic venture, if our credit rating as determined by two of three specified credit rating agencies is below certain levels , we are required to make a non-refundable yearly payment of

$5 million

to CHS. In 2016, our credit ratings were reduced and we made a payment to CHS. In 2017, since our credit ratings had not changed, we made a second

$5 million

payment to CHS. The payment will continue on a yearly basis until the earlier of the date that our credit rating is upgraded to or above certain levels by two of the three specified credit rating agencies or February 1, 2026. This obligation is recognized on our consolidated balance sheets as an embedded derivative. As of

December 31, 2017

and


, the embedded derivative liability of

$25 million

and

$26 million

, respectively, is included in other current liabilities and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Included in other operating—net in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is a net loss of

$4 million

and

$23 million

, respectively. See Note

8—Fair Value Measurements

for additional information.

In the first quarter of

Terra Nitrogen Company, L.P. (TNCLP)

TNCLP is a master limited partnership (MLP) that owns a nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facility in Verdigris, Oklahoma. We own approximately

75.3%

of TNCLP through general and limited partnership interests. Outside investors own the remaining approximately

24.7%

of the limited partnership. For financial reporting purposes, the assets, liabilities and earnings of the partnership are consolidated into our financial statements. The outside investors' limited partnership interests in the partnership are recorded in noncontrolling interests in our consolidated financial statements. The noncontrolling interest represents the noncontrolling unitholders' interest in the earnings and equity of TNCLP. Affiliates of CF Industries are required to purchase all of TNCLP's fertilizer products at market prices as defined in the Amendment to the General and Administrative Services and Product Offtake Agreement, dated September 28, 2010.

TNCLP makes cash distributions to the general and limited partners based on formulas defined within its First Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership (as amended, the TNCLP Agreement of Limited Partnership). Cash available for distribution (Available Cash) is defined in the TNCLP Agreement of Limited Partnership generally as all cash receipts less all cash disbursements, less certain reserves (including reserves for future operating and capital needs) established as the general partner determines in its reasonable discretion to be necessary or appropriate. Changes in working capital affect Available Cash, as increases in the amount of cash invested in working capital items (such as increases in receivables or inventory and decreases in accounts payable) reduce Available Cash, while declines in the amount of cash invested in working capital items increase Available Cash. Cash distributions to the limited partners and general partner vary depending on the extent to which the cumulative distributions exceed certain target threshold levels set forth in the TNCLP Agreement of Limited Partnership.

In each quarter of


,


and


, the minimum quarterly distributions requirements under the TNCLP Agreement of Limited Partnership were satisfied, which entitled TNGP, the general partner of TNCLP and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of CF Holdings, to receive incentive distributions on its general partner interests (in addition to minimum quarterly distributions). TNGP has assigned its right to receive such incentive distributions to an affiliate of TNGP that is also an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of CF Holdings. The earnings attributed to our general partner interest in excess of the threshold levels for the years ended December 31,


,


and


were

$41 million

,

$65 million

and

$116 million

, respectively.



CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

On February 7, 2018, we announced that TNGP elected to exercise its right to purchase all of the

4,612,562

publicly traded common units of TNCLP on April 2, 2018, for a cash purchase price of

$84.033

per unit in accordance with the terms of TNCLP’s partnership agreement. The purchase price of

$84.033

per unit was determined under the terms of TNCLP’s partnership agreement as the average of the daily closing prices per common unit for the


consecutive trading days beginning with January 5, 2018 and ending with February 2, 2018. The purchase price of all of the

4,612,562

publicly traded common units of TNCLP is approximately

$390 million

. We intend to fund the purchase with cash on hand. As of the April 2, 2018 purchase date, all rights of the holders of the units will terminate, with the exception of the right to receive payment of the purchase price. Upon completion of the purchase, we will own 100 percent of the general and limited partnership interests of TNCLP, and the common units representing limited partner interests will cease to be publicly traded or listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

Internal Revenue Service Regulation Impacting Master Limited Partnerships

Currently, no federal income taxes are paid by TNCLP due to its MLP status. Partnerships are generally not subject to federal income tax, although publicly-traded partnerships (such as TNCLP) are treated as corporations for federal income tax purposes (and therefore are subject to federal income tax), unless at least 90% of the partnership's gross income is "qualifying income" as defined in Section 7704 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the partnership is not required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Any change in the tax treatment of income from fertilizer-related activities as qualifying income could cause TNCLP to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes. If TNCLP were taxed as a corporation, under current law, due to its current ownership interest, CF Industries would qualify for a partial dividends received deduction on the dividends received from TNCLP. Therefore, we would not expect a change in the tax treatment of TNCLP to have a material impact on the consolidated financial condition or results of operations of CF Holdings.

On January 19, 2017, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued final regulations on the types of income and activities that constitute or generate qualifying income of a MLP. For calendar year MLPs, the effective date of the regulations is January 1, 2018. The regulations have the effect of limiting the types of income and activities that qualify under the MLP rules, subject to certain transition provisions. The regulations define the activities that generate qualifying income from certain processing or refining and transportation activities with respect to any mineral or natural resource (including fertilizer) as activities that generate qualifying income, but the regulations reserve on specifics regarding fertilizer-related activities. We continue to monitor these IRS regulatory activities.



CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.


.   Stockholders' Equity

Common Stock

Our Board of Directors (the Board) has authorized certain programs to repurchase shares of our common stock. These programs have generally permitted repurchases to be made from time to time in the open market, through privately-negotiated transactions, through block transactions or otherwise. Our management has determined the manner, timing and amount of repurchases under these programs based on the evaluation of market conditions, stock price and other factors.

On August 6, 2014, the Board authorized a program to repurchase up to

$1 billion

of the common stock of CF Holdings through December 31, 2016 (the 2014 Program). The following table summarizes the share repurchases under the 2014 Program.

In 2016, no shares were repurchased under the 2014 Program. The 2014 Program expired on

December 31, 2016

with

$100 million

of repurchase authorization remaining. No share repurchase programs were authorized by the Board in 2017.

During


and 2015, we retired

2.4 million

shares and

10.7 million

shares, respectively, of repurchased stock. The retired shares were returned to the status of authorized but unissued shares. As part of the retirements, we reduced our treasury stock, paid-in capital, and retained earnings balances for 2016 by

$150 million

,

$14 million

, and

$136 million

, respectively, and for 2015 by

$597 million

,

$62 million

, and

$535 million

, respectively. As of

December 31, 2017

,


and 2015, we held in treasury approximately

one thousand

shares,

28 thousand

shares and

2.4 million

shares, respectively, of repurchased stock.

Changes in common shares outstanding are as follows:

CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

Preferred Stock

CF Holdings is authorized to issue

50 million

shares of

$0.01

par value preferred stock. Our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, authorizes the Board, without any further stockholder action or approval, to issue these shares in one or more classes or series, and (except in the case of our Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, 500,000 shares of which are authorized and the terms of which were specified in the original certificate of incorporation of CF Holdings) to fix the rights, preferences and privileges of the shares of each wholly unissued class or series and any of its qualifications, limitations or restrictions. The Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock had been established in CF Holdings’ original certificate of incorporation in connection with our former stockholder rights plan that expired in 2015. In September 2016, in connection with the Plan (as defined below), 500,000 shares of preferred stock were designated as Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock. In July 2017, the Series B Junior Participating Preferred Stock was eliminated in connection with the expiration of the Plan. No shares of preferred stock have been issued.

Tax Benefits Preservation Plan

As of December 31, 2016, we had a stockholders rights plan intended to help protect our tax net operating losses and certain other tax assets by deterring any person from becoming a "5-percent shareholder" (as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended). The terms of the rights were set forth in a Tax Benefits Preservation Plan (the Plan) dated as of September 6, 2016 and amended as of July 25, 2017 between us and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as rights agent. The rights expired on July 25, 2017 without having been exercised

2014 Equity and Incentive Plan

On May 14, 2014, our shareholders approved the CF Industries Holdings, Inc. 2014 Equity and Incentive Plan (the 2014 Equity and Incentive Plan) which replaced the CF Industries Holdings, Inc. 2009 Equity and Incentive Plan. Under the 2014 Equity and Incentive Plan, we may grant incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance awards (payable in cash or stock) and other stock-based awards to our officers, employees, consultants and independent contractors (including non-employee directors). The purpose of the 2014 Equity and Incentive Plan is to provide an incentive for our employees, officers, consultants and non-employee directors that is aligned with the interests of our stockholders.

Share Reserve and Individual Award Limits

The maximum number of shares reserved for the grant of awards under the 2014 Equity and Incentive Plan is the sum of (i)

13.9 million

and (ii) the number of shares subject to outstanding awards under our predecessor plans to the extent such awards terminate or expire without delivery of shares. For purposes of determining the number of shares of stock available for grant under the 2014 Equity and Incentive Plan, each option or stock appreciation right is counted against the reserve as

one

share. Each share of stock granted, other than an option or a stock appreciation right, is counted against the reserve as

1.61

shares. If any outstanding award expires or is settled in cash, any unissued shares subject to the award are again available for grant under the 2014 Equity and Incentive Plan. Shares tendered in payment of the exercise price of an option and shares withheld by the Company or otherwise received by the Company to satisfy tax withholding obligations are not available for future grant under the 2014 Equity and Incentive Plan. As of

December 31, 2017

, we had

9.5 million

shares available for future awards under the 2014 Equity and Incentive Plan. The 2014 Equity and Incentive Plan provides that no more than

5.0 million

underlying shares may be granted to a participant in any

one

calendar year.

Stock Options

Under the 2014 Equity and Incentive Plan and our predecessor plans, we granted to plan participants nonqualified stock options to purchase shares of our common stock. The exercise price of these options is equal to the market price of our common stock on the date of grant. The contractual life of each option is

ten years

and generally

one-third

of the options vest on each of the first three anniversaries of the date of grant.

The fair value of each stock option award is estimated using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. Key assumptions used and resulting grant date fair values are shown in the following table.

The expected volatility of our stock options is based on the combination of the historical volatility of our common stock and implied volatilities of exchange traded options on our common stock. The expected term of options is estimated based on our historical exercise experience, post-vesting employment termination behavior and the contractual term. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury Strip yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the expected term of the options.

$42.54

as of

, which would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options as of that date.

Restricted Stock Awards, Restricted Stock Units and Performance Share Units

The fair value of a restricted stock award (RSA) or an award of restricted stock units (RSU) is equal to the number of shares subject to the award multiplied by the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant. We estimated the fair value of each performance share unit (PSU) on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation. RSU and PSU awards are granted to key employees and generally vest

three years

from the date of grant. The vesting of PSUs is also subject to the attainment of applicable performance goals during the performance period. The RSAs awarded to non-management members of the Board vest the earlier of

one

year from the date of the grant or the date of the next annual stockholder meeting. During the vesting period, the holders of the RSAs are entitled to dividends and voting rights. During the vesting period, the holders of the RSUs are paid dividend equivalents in cash to the extent we pay cash dividends. PSUs accrue dividend equivalents to the extent we pay cash dividends on our common stock during the performance and vesting period. Upon vesting of the PSUs, holders are paid the accrued dividend equivalents based on the shares of common stock, if any, delivered in settlement of PSUs. Holders of RSUs and PSUs are not entitled to voting rights unless and until the awards have vested.

Litigation

West Fertilizer Co.

On April 17, 2013, there was a fire and explosion at the West Fertilizer Co. fertilizer storage and distribution facility in West, Texas. According to published reports,


people were killed and approximately


people were injured in the incident, and the fire and explosion damaged or destroyed a number of homes and buildings around the facility. Various subsidiaries of CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (the CF Entities) have been named as defendants along with other companies in lawsuits filed in 2013, 2014 and 2015 in the District Court of McLennan County, Texas by the City of West, individual residents of the County and other parties seeking recovery for damages allegedly sustained as a result of the explosion. The cases have been consolidated for discovery and pretrial proceedings in the District Court of McLennan County under the caption "In re: West Explosion Cases." The two-year statute of limitations expired on April 17, 2015. As of that date, over


plaintiffs had filed claims, including at least


entities,


individuals, and


insurance companies. Plaintiffs allege various theories of negligence, strict liability, and breach of warranty under Texas law. Although we do not own or operate the facility or directly sell our products to West Fertilizer Co., products that the CF Entities have manufactured and sold to others have been delivered to the facility and may have been stored at the West facility at the time of the incident.

The Court granted in part and denied in part the CF Entities' Motions for Summary Judgment in August 2015. Over

one hundred sixty

cases have been resolved pursuant to confidential settlements that have been or we expect will be fully funded by insurance. The remaining cases are in various stages of discovery and pre-trial proceedings. The next trial is expected to be scheduled for later in 2018. We believe we have strong legal and factual defenses and intend to continue defending the CF Entities vigorously in the pending lawsuits. The Company cannot provide a range of reasonably possible loss due to the lack of damages discovery for many of the remaining claims and the uncertain nature of this litigation, including uncertainties around the potential allocation of responsibility by a jury to other defendants or responsible third parties. The recognition of a potential loss in the future in the West Fertilizer Co. litigation could negatively affect our results in the period of recognition. However, based upon currently available information, including available insurance coverage, we do not believe that this litigation will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Other Litigation

From time to time, we are subject to ordinary, routine legal proceedings related to the usual conduct of our business, including proceedings regarding public utility and transportation rates, environmental matters, taxes and permits relating to the operations of our various plants and facilities. Based on the information available as of the date of this filing, we believe that the ultimate outcome of these routine matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Environmental

Louisiana Environmental Matters

Clean Air Act—Ozone Nonattainment Designation

Our Donaldsonville nitrogen complex is located in a five-parish region near Baton Rouge, Louisiana. On December 15, 2016, the EPA redesignated the Baton Rouge Nonattainment Area as "attainment" with respect to the 2008 8-hour ozone national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS). However, based on 2013-2015 air quality monitoring data, the State of Louisiana recommended that the EPA designate the Baton Rouge area as "non-attainment" pursuant to the updated 2015 8-hour ozone standard. On December 20, 2017, the EPA notified the state of Louisiana that it intends to designate the Baton Rouge area as non-attainment for the 2015 ozone standard. On January 5, 2018, the EPA published notice of a public comment period with respect to the proposed attainment/non-attainment designations of certain air quality regions, including the Baton Rouge area. Designation of the Baton Rouge area as nonattainment with respect to the 2015 ozone standard could result in more stringent air pollution emissions limits for our existing operation and would subject our facilities to more stringent requirements to obtain approvals for plant expansions, or could make it difficult to obtain such approvals.

Florida Environmental Matters

On March 17, 2014, we completed the sale of our phosphate mining and manufacturing business, which was located in Florida, to Mosaic. Pursuant to the terms of the definitive agreement executed in October 2013, Mosaic assumed the following environmental matters and we agreed to indemnify Mosaic with respect to losses arising out of the matters below, subject to a maximum indemnification cap and the other terms of the definitive agreement.



CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

Clean Air Act Notice of Violation

We received a Notice of Violation (NOV) from the EPA by letter dated June 16, 2010, alleging that we violated the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) Clean Air Act regulations relating to certain projects undertaken at the former Plant City, Florida facility's sulfuric acid plants. This NOV further alleges that the actions that are the basis for the alleged PSD violations also resulted in violations of Title V air operating permit regulations. Finally, the NOV alleges that we failed to comply with certain compliance dates established by hazardous air pollutant regulations for phosphoric acid manufacturing plants and phosphate fertilizer production plants. We had several meetings with the EPA with respect to this matter prior to our sale of the phosphate mining and manufacturing business in March 2014. We and Mosaic have separately had continued discussions with the EPA subsequent to our sale of the phosphate mining and manufacturing business with respect to this matter. We do not know at this time if this matter will be settled prior to initiation of formal legal action.

We cannot estimate the potential penalties, fines or other expenditures, if any, that may result from the Clean Air Act NOV and, therefore, we cannot determine if the ultimate outcome of this matter will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

EPCRA/CERCLA Notice of Violation

By letter dated July 6, 2010, the EPA issued a NOV to us alleging violations of Section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) in connection with the former Plant City facility. EPCRA requires annual reports to be submitted with respect to the use of certain toxic chemicals. The NOV also included an allegation that we violated Section 304 of EPCRA and Section 103 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) by failing to file a timely notification relating to the release of hydrogen fluoride above applicable reportable quantities. We do not know at this time if this matter will be settled prior to initiation of formal legal action.

We do not expect that penalties or fines, if any, that may arise out of the EPCRA/CERCLA matter will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Other

CERCLA/Remediation Matters

From time to time, we receive notices from governmental agencies or third parties alleging that we are a potentially responsible party at certain cleanup sites under CERCLA or other environmental cleanup laws. In 2011, we received a notice from the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality (IDEQ) that alleged that we were a potentially responsible party for the cleanup of a former phosphate mine site we owned in the late 1950s and early 1960s located in Georgetown Canyon, Idaho. The current owner of the property and a former mining contractor received similar notices for the site. In 2014, we and the current property owner entered into a Consent Order with IDEQ and the U.S. Forest Service to conduct a remedial investigation and feasibility study of the site. In 2015, we and several other parties received a notice that the U.S. Department of the Interior and other trustees intend to undertake a natural resource damage assessment for a group of former phosphate mines in southeast Idaho, including the former Georgetown Canyon mine. We are not able to estimate at this time our potential liability, if any, with respect to the cleanup of the site or a possible claim for natural resource damages. However, based on currently available information, we do not expect the remedial or financial obligations to which we may be subject involving this or other cleanup sites will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Our reportable segments consist of ammonia, granular urea, UAN, AN, and Other. These segments are differentiated by products. Our management uses gross margin to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources.

.   Supplemental Cash Flow Information

The following provides additional information relating to cash flow activities:



CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.


.   Asset Retirement Obligations

Asset retirement obligations (AROs) are legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development or normal operation of such assets. AROs are initially recognized as incurred when sufficient information exists to estimate fair value. We have AROs at our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing complexes and at our distribution and storage facilities that are conditional upon cessation of operations. These AROs include certain decommissioning activities as well as the removal and disposal of certain chemicals, waste materials, structures, equipment, vessels, piping and storage tanks. Also included are reclamation of land and the closure of certain effluent ponds. The most recent estimate of the aggregate cost of these AROs expressed in


dollars is

$73 million

. We have not recorded a liability for these conditional AROs as of

December 31, 2017

because we do not believe there is currently a reasonable basis for estimating a date or range of dates of cessation of operations at our nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing facilities or our distribution and storage facilities, which is necessary in order to estimate fair value. In reaching this conclusion, we considered the historical performance of each complex or facility and have taken into account factors such as planned maintenance, asset replacements and upgrades of plant and equipment, which if conducted as in the past, can extend the physical lives of our nitrogen manufacturing facilities and our distribution and storage facilities indefinitely. We also considered the possibility of changes in technology, risk of obsolescence, and availability of raw materials in arriving at our conclusion.


.   Leases

We have operating leases for certain property and equipment under various noncancelable agreements, the most significant of which are rail car leases and barge tow charters for the distribution of our products. The rail car leases currently have minimum terms ranging from

one

to

eleven years

and the barge charter commitments range from approximately

one

to

seven years

. We also have terminal and warehouse storage agreements for our distribution system, some of which contain minimum throughput requirements. The storage agreements contain minimum terms generally ranging from

one

to

five years

and commonly contain automatic annual renewal provisions thereafter unless canceled by either party.

Future minimum payments under noncancelable operating leases with initial or remaining noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year as of

December 31, 2017

The following condensed consolidating financial information is presented in accordance with SEC Regulation S-X Rule 3-10,

Financial statements of guarantors and issuers of guaranteed securities registered or being registered

, and relates to (i) the senior notes due 2018, 2020, 2023, 2034, 2043 and 2044 (described in Note

11—Financing Agreements

and referred to in this report as the Public Senior Notes) issued by CF Industries, Inc. (CF Industries), a 100% owned subsidiary of CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (Parent), and guarantees of the Public Senior Notes by Parent and by CFE and CFS (the Subsidiary Guarantors), which are 100% owned subsidiaries of Parent, and (ii) debt securities of CF Industries (Other Debt Securities), and guarantees thereof by Parent and the Subsidiary Guarantors, that may be offered and sold from time to time under registration statements that may be filed by Parent, CF Industries and the Subsidiary Guarantors with the SEC.

In the event that a subsidiary of Parent, other than CF Industries, becomes a borrower or a guarantor under the Revolving Credit Agreement (or any renewal, replacement or refinancing thereof), such subsidiary would be required to become a guarantor of the Public Senior Notes, provided that such requirement will no longer apply with respect to the Public Senior Notes due 2023, 2034, 2043 and 2044 following the repayment of the Public Senior Notes due 2018 and 2020 or the subsidiaries of Parent, other than CF Industries, otherwise becoming no longer subject to such a requirement to guarantee the Public Senior Notes due 2018 and 2020. CFE and CFS became guarantors of the Public Senior Notes as a result of this requirement on November 21, 2016.

All of the guarantees of the Public Senior Notes are, and we have assumed for purposes of this presentation of condensed consolidating financial information that the guarantees of any Other Debt Securities would be, full and unconditional (as such term is defined in SEC Regulation S-X Rule 3-10(h)) and joint and several. The guarantee of a Subsidiary Guarantor will be automatically released with respect to a series of the Public Senior Notes (1) upon the release, discharge or termination of such Subsidiary Guarantor’s guarantee of the Revolving Credit Agreement (or any renewal, replacement or refinancing thereof), (2) upon legal defeasance with respect to the Public Senior Notes of such series or satisfaction and discharge of the indenture with respect to such series of Public Senior Notes or (3) in the case of the Public Senior Notes due 2023, 2034, 2043 and 2044, upon the later to occur of (a) the discharge, termination or release of, or the release of such Subsidiary Guarantor from its obligations under, such Subsidiary Guarantor’s guarantee of the Public Senior Notes due 2018, including, without limitation, any such discharge, termination or release as a result of retirement, discharge or legal or covenant defeasance of, or satisfaction and discharge of the supplemental indenture governing, the Public Senior Notes due 2018, and (b) the discharge, termination or release of, or the release of such Subsidiary Guarantor from its obligations under, such Subsidiary Guarantor’s guarantee of the Public Senior Notes due 2020, including, without limitation, any such discharge, termination or release as a result of retirement, discharge or legal or covenant defeasance of, or satisfaction and discharge of the supplemental indenture governing, the Public Senior Notes due 2020.

For purposes of the presentation of condensed consolidating financial information, the subsidiaries of Parent other than CF Industries, CFE and CFS are referred to as the Non-Guarantors.

In these condensed consolidating financial statements, investments in subsidiaries are presented under the equity method, in which our investments are recorded at cost and adjusted for our ownership share of a subsidiary's cumulative results of operations, distributions and other equity changes, and the eliminating entries reflect primarily intercompany transactions such as sales, accounts receivable and accounts payable and the elimination of equity investments and earnings of subsidiaries. Two of our consolidated entities have made elections to be taxed as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes and are included in the non-guarantor column. Due to the partnership tax treatment, these subsidiaries do not record taxes on their financial statements. The tax provision pertaining to the income of these partnerships, plus applicable deferred tax balances are reflected on the financial statements of the parent company owner that is included in the subsidiary guarantors column in the following financial information.

.   Subsequent Event

On February 7, 2018, we announced that TNGP, the sole general partner of TNCLP and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of CF Holdings, elected to exercise its right to purchase all of the

4,612,562

publicly traded common units of TNCLP on April 2, 2018, for a cash purchase price of

$84.033

per unit in accordance with the terms of TNCLP’s partnership agreement. The purchase price of

$84.033

per unit was determined under the terms of TNCLP’s partnership agreement as the average of the daily closing prices per common unit for the


consecutive trading days beginning with January 5, 2018 and ending with February 2, 2018. The purchase price of all of the

4,612,562

publicly traded common units of TNCLP is approximately

$390 million

. We intend to fund the purchase with cash on hand. As of the April 2, 2018 purchase date, all rights of the holders of the units will terminate, with the exception of the right to receive payment of the purchase price. Upon completion of the purchase, we will own 100 percent of the general and limited partnership interests of TNCLP, and the common units representing limited partner interests will cease to be publicly traded or listed on the NYSE.

ITEM 9A.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

(a)

Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

The Company's management, with the participation of the Company's principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, the Company's principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective in (i) ensuring that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and (ii) ensuring that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including the Company's principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, for the Company. Under the supervision and with the participation of our senior management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of

December 31, 2017

, using the criteria set forth in the

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. Based on this assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as of

December 31, 2017

Basis for Opinion

The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
