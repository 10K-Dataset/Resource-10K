Our Company

All references to “CF
Holdings,” “the Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to CF Industries Holdings, Inc.
and its subsidiaries, including CF Industries, Inc., except where the
context makes clear that the reference is only to CF Holdings itself and not
its subsidiaries. All references to “our pre-IPO owners” refer to the eight
stockholders of CF Industries, Inc. prior to the consummation of our
reorganization transaction and initial public offering (IPO) which closed on August 16,
2005.

We are one of the largest manufacturers and
distributors

of nitrogen and phosphate
fertilizer products in North America. Our operations are organized into two
business segments: the nitrogen fertilizer business and the phosphate fertilizer
business. Our principal products in the nitrogen fertilizer business are
ammonia, urea and urea ammonium nitrate solution (UAN). Our principal products
in the phosphate fertilizer business are diammonium phosphate (DAP) and
monoammonium phosphate (MAP). For the twelve months ended June 30, 2005,
the most recent period for which such information is available, we supplied
approximately 24% of the nitrogen and approximately 12% of the phosphate used
in agricultural fertilizer applications in the United States. Our core market
and distribution facilities are concentrated in the midwestern U.S. grain-producing
states.

Our principal
assets include:

·

the
largest nitrogen fertilizer complex in North America (Donaldsonville,
Louisiana);

·

a
66% economic interest in the largest nitrogen fertilizer complex in Canada
(which we operate in Medicine Hat, Alberta, through Canadian Fertilizers
Limited (CFL), a consolidated variable interest entity);

·

one
of the largest

integrated ammonium phosphate
fertilizer complexes in the United States (Plant City, Florida);

·

the
most-recently constructed phosphate rock mine and associated beneficiation
plant in the United States (Hardee County, Florida); and

·

an
extensive system of terminals, warehouses and associated transportation
equipment located primarily in the midwestern United States.

For the year ended December 31, 2006, we sold
6.3 million tons of nitrogen fertilizers and 2.1 million tons of
phosphate fertilizers, generating net sales of $1.9 billion.

Our principal executive offices are located outside of
Chicago, Illinois, at One Salem Lake Drive, Long Grove, Illinois 60047. Our
Internet website address is at www.cfindustries.com.

We make available free of
charge on or through our Internet website, www.cfindustries.com, all of our

and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC.


CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

Company History

We were founded in 1946 as
a fertilizer brokerage operation by a group of regional agricultural
cooperatives seeking to pool their purchasing power. During the 1960s, we
expanded our distribution capabilities and diversified into fertilizer
manufacturing through the acquisition of several existing plants and
facilities. During the 1970s and again during the 1990s, we expanded our
production and distribution capabilities significantly, spending approximately
$1 billion in each of these decades.

Through the end of 2002,
we operated as a traditional supply cooperative. Our focus was on providing our
pre-IPO owners with an assured supply of fertilizer. Typically, over 80% of our
annual sales volume was to our pre-IPO owners. Though important, financial performance
was subordinate to our mandated supply objective.

In 2002, we reassessed our
corporate mission and adopted a new business model that established financial
performance, rather than assured supply to our pre-IPO owners, as our principal
objective. A critical aspect of the new business model was to establish a more
economically driven approach to the marketplace. Under the new business model,
we began to pursue markets and customers and make pricing decisions with a
primary focus on financial performance. One result of this approach was a
substantial shift in our customer mix. By 2006, our sales to customers other
than our pre-IPO owners and Western Co-operative Fertilizers Limited (Westco),
our joint venture partner in CFL, reached approximately 46% of our total sales
volume for the year, which was more than double the comparable percentage for
2002.

In August 2005, we
completed our initial public offering of common stock and listing on the New
York Stock Exchange. We sold 47,437,500 shares of our common stock in the
offering and received net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions, of approximately $715.4 million. We did not retain any of the
proceeds from the IPO. In connection with the IPO, we consummated a
reorganization transaction whereby we ceased to be a cooperative. In the
reorganization transaction, our pre-IPO owners’ equity interests in CF
Industries, Inc., now our wholly-owned subsidiary, were cancelled in
exchange for all of the proceeds of the offering and 7,562,499 shares of our
common stock.

Operating Segments

Our business is divided
into two operating segments, the nitrogen fertilizer business and the phosphate
fertilizer business.

Nitrogen Fertilizer
Business

We are
one of the leading nitrogen fertilizer producers in North America. Our primary
nitrogen fertilizer products are ammonia, urea and UAN. Our historical sales of
nitrogen fertilizer products are shown in the table below. The sales shown do
not reflect amounts used internally in the manufacture of other products (for
example in 2006, we used about 1.7 million tons of ammonia in the
production of urea and UAN).

CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

Gross margin for the nitrogen fertilizer business was
$98.5 million, $172.9 million and $193.8 million for the fiscal
years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Total assets for the nitrogen fertilizer business were
$493.9 million, $552.5 million and $557.8 million as of December 31,
2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

We operate world-scale

nitrogen
fertilizer production facilities in Donaldsonville, Louisiana and Medicine Hat,
Alberta, Canada. We own the Donaldsonville nitrogen fertilizer complex and have
a 66% economic interest in CFL, a Canadian joint venture that owns the Medicine
Hat nitrogen fertilizer complex. The combined production capacity of these two
facilities represents approximately 20% of North American ammonia capacity, 32%
of North American dry urea capacity and 18% of North American UAN capacity in
2006.

Donaldsonville
Nitrogen Complex

The Donaldsonville nitrogen fertilizer complex is the
largest nitrogen fertilizer production facility in North America. It has four

world-scale ammonia plants, four urea plants and two
UAN plants. It has the capacity to produce annually approximately
2.3 million tons of ammonia (most of which is typically upgraded into urea
and UAN), 2.6 million tons of liquid urea (including amounts upgraded into
UAN) and 2.7 million tons of UAN (measured on a 28% nitrogen content
basis). With UAN operating at capacity, approximately 1.7 million tons of
granular urea can be produced. Granular urea production can be increased to
2 million tons per year if UAN production is reduced.

We believe that this
facility is the most versatile nitrogen fertilizer production complex in North
America. With multiple production units for each product, the complex has
considerable flexibility to adjust its product mix. Donaldsonville is located
near the mouth of the Mississippi River and has three docks that can be used
simultaneously under most river conditions. In addition, Donaldsonville is
located on the Union Pacific railroad and the Valero Ammonia Pipeline,
providing us with flexible and competitively priced transportation to our
in-market nitrogen fertilizer terminals and warehouses by rail and pipeline, as
well as by barge. The facility is capable of docking and unloading into its
storage system ocean-going ship loads of ammonia and UAN, providing us
with direct access to global suppliers. The complex has on-site storage for
70,000 tons of ammonia, 135,000 tons of UAN (measured on a 28% nitrogen content
basis) and 83,000 tons of granular urea, providing us with flexibility to
handle temporary disruptions to shipping activities without impacting
production and also flexibility to purchase and store liquid product for
resale.


CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

Medicine Hat
Nitrogen Complex

Medicine Hat is the largest nitrogen fertilizer
complex in Canada. It has two world-scale ammonia plants that have a
combined gross annual production capacity of approximately 1.3 million
tons and a world-scale urea plant that has a gross annual production
capacity of 810,000 tons. The complex has on-site storage for 60,000 tons of
ammonia and 70,000 tons of urea, providing flexibility to handle temporary
disruptions of outbound shipments.

The Medicine Hat facility is owned by CFL. We own 49%
of the voting common stock of CFL and 66% of CFL’s non-voting preferred stock.
Westco owns 34% of the voting common stock and non-voting preferred stock of
CFL. The remaining 17% of the voting common stock of CFL is owned by GROWMARK, Inc.
(GROWMARK) and La Coop fédérée. We designate four members of CFL’s nine-member
board of directors, Westco designates 3 members and GROWMARK and La Coop
fédérée each designate one member. CFL is included in our consolidated
financial statements.

We operate the Medicine Hat facility and purchase
approximately 66% of the facility’s ammonia and urea production, pursuant to a
management agreement and a product purchase agreement. Both the management
agreement and the product purchase agreement can be terminated by either CF
Industries, Inc. or CFL upon a twelve-month notice. Westco has the
right, but not the obligation, to purchase the remaining 34% of the facility’s
ammonia and urea production under a similar product purchase agreement. To the
extent that Westco does not purchase its 34% of the facility’s production, we
are obligated to purchase any remaining amounts. Since 1995, however, Westco has
purchased at least 34% of the facility’s production each year.

Under the product purchase
agreements, both we and Westco pay the greater of operating cost or market
price for purchases. However, the product purchase agreements also provide that
CFL will distribute its net earnings to us and Westco annually based on the
respective quantities of product purchased from CFL. The product purchase
agreement also requires us to advance funds to CFL in the event that CFL is
unable to meet its debts as they become due. The amount of each advance would
be at least 66% of the deficiency and would be more in any year in which we
purchased more than 66% of Medicine Hat’s production. We and Westco currently
manage CFL such that each party is responsible for its share of CFL’s fixed
costs and that CFL’s production volume meets the parties’ combined
requirements. The management agreement, the product purchase agreements and any
other agreements related to CFL are subject to change with the consent of both
parties.

Nitrogen Fertilizer
Raw Materials

Natural gas is the principal raw material, as well as
the primary fuel source, used in the ammonia production process at both the
Donaldsonville and the Medicine Hat facilities. In 2006, our natural gas
purchases accounted for approximately 54% of our total cost of sales for
nitrogen fertilizers and a substantially higher percentage of cash production
costs (total production costs less depreciation and amortization).
Donaldsonville is located in close proximity to the most heavily-traded
natural gas pricing basis in North America, known as the Henry Hub. Medicine
Hat is located in close proximity to the most heavily-traded natural gas
pricing basis in Canada, known as AECO.

We use a combination of spot and term purchases of
varied duration from a variety of suppliers to maintain a reliable,
competitively-priced natural gas supply. In addition, we use certain
financial instruments to hedge natural gas prices.

In 2006, the
Donaldsonville nitrogen fertilizer complex consumed approximately
73 million MMBtus of natural gas. The facility has access to five natural
gas pipelines which are owned by three companies and obtains gas from several
suppliers. In 2006, the largest individual supplier provided approximately 40%
of


CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

the
Donaldsonville facility’s total gas requirement. The Medicine Hat complex
consumed approximately 41 million MMBtus of natural gas in 2006. The
facility has access to two natural gas pipelines and obtains gas from numerous
suppliers, the largest of which supplied approximately 46% of gas consumption
in 2006.

Nitrogen Fertilizer
Distribution

The Donaldsonville nitrogen fertilizer complex, which
is located on the Mississippi River, includes a deep-water docking facility,
access to an ammonia shipping pipeline, and truck and railroad loading
capabilities. We ship our share of ammonia and urea produced at the Medicine
Hat nitrogen fertilizer complex by truck and rail to customers in the United
States and Canada and to our storage facilities in the northern United States.

Ammonia, urea and UAN from Donaldsonville can be
loaded into river barges and ocean-going vessels for direct shipment to
domestic customers, transport to storage facilities, or export. We own six
ammonia river barges with a total capacity of approximately 16,400 tons. We
contract on a dedicated basis for tug services and the operation of these
barges. As of December 31, 2006, we had 16 UAN river barges contracted on
a dedicated basis with a total capacity of approximately 48,000 tons.
Additional ammonia and UAN barge capacity is contracted for as needed. River
transportation for urea is provided primarily under an agreement with one of
the major inland river system barge operators.

The Donaldsonville facility is connected to the Valero
Ammonia Pipeline. This 2,000-mile long ammonia pipeline is used by
several nitrogen producers to transport ammonia to over 20 terminals and
shipping points located in the midwestern U.S. cornbelt. We are a major
customer of this ammonia pipeline. In 2006, approximately 55% of our ammonia
shipments from our Donaldsonville nitrogen fertilizer complex were transported
via the ammonia pipeline.

We also transport
substantial volumes of urea and UAN from the Donaldsonville nitrogen fertilizer
complex and ammonia and urea from the Medicine Hat nitrogen fertilizer complex
by rail. In addition to rail cars provided by the rail carriers, as of December 31,
2006, we had leases for approximately 500 ammonia tank cars, 1,000 UAN tank
cars and 600 dry product hopper cars.

Phosphate Fertilizer Business

We are
a major manufacturer of phosphate fertilizer products. Our main phosphate

Hardee County
Phosphate Rock Mine

In 1975, we purchased 20,000 acres of land in Hardee
County, Florida that was originally estimated to contain in excess of
100 million tons of recoverable rock reserves. Between 1978 and mid-1993,
we operated a one-million-ton per year phosphate rock mine on a 5,000-acre
portion of these reserves.

In 1992, we initiated a project to expand and relocate
mining operations to the remaining 15,000-acre area of the reserve
property. The new phosphate rock mine began operations in late 1995 at a cost
of $135 million. In 1997, we added approximately 20 million tons to
our reserve base through an exchange with a neighboring rock producer. In 1999,
we acquired 1,400 acres containing an estimated 8 million tons of rock
reserves.

The table below shows the
estimated reserves, as of December 31, 2006, at the Hardee phosphate
complex. Also reflected in the table is the grade of the reserves, expressed as
a percentage of bone phosphate of lime (BPL) and P

CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

Plant City
Phosphate Complex

Our Plant City phosphate
fertilizer complex is one of the largest phosphate fertilizer facilities in
North America. At one million tons per year, its phosphoric acid capacity
represents approximately 9% of the total U.S. capacity. All of Plant City’s
phosphoric acid is converted into ammonium phosphates (DAP and MAP),
representing approximately 12% of U.S. capacity for ammonium phosphate
fertilizer products in 2006. The combination of the Plant City phosphate
fertilizer complex and the Hardee mine gives us one of the largest integrated
ammonium phosphate fertilizer operations in North America with the only
purchased raw materials being sulfur and ammonia.

Bartow Phosphate
Complex

We own a complex in
Bartow, Florida that was idled in 1983 except for operation of one sulfuric
acid plant in 1996-99 and minor phosphate production runs in 1985 and
1988/89. In 2000, we decided to discontinue maintenance on the phosphate
producing portions of the complex. Through 2003, we used the plant’s warehouse
to provide us with additional storage and shipping capacity. In 2004, we
discontinued use of the facility as a warehousing operation. Our current
objective is to minimize the ongoing costs related to the facility, including
our obligations with respect to closing the phosphogypsum stack and disposing
of the site’s process water.

Phosphate Raw
Materials

Phosphate
Rock Supply.

Phosphate rock is the basic
nutrient source for phosphate fertilizers. Approximately 3.5 tons of phosphate
rock are needed to produce one ton of P


O


(the measure of nutrient content of phosphate
fertilizers). Our Plant City phosphate fertilizer complex consumes in excess of
three million tons of rock annually. As of December 31, 2006, our rock
mine had approximately 16 years of fully-permitted recoverable phosphate
reserves remaining at current operating rates. We have initiated the process of
applying for authorization and permits to expand the geographical area at our
Hardee property where we can mine. The expanded area has an estimated
33 million tons of recoverable phosphate reserves. We estimate that we
will be able to conduct mining operations at our Hardee property for
approximately nine additional years at current operating rates, assuming we
secure the authorization and permits to mine in this area.

Sulfur
Supply.

Sulfur is used to produce sulfuric acid,
which is combined with phosphate rock to produce phosphoric acid. Approximately
three-quarters of a long ton of sulfur is needed to produce one ton of P


O

5.

Our Plant City phosphate fertilizer complex
uses approximately 770,000 long tons of sulfur annually when operating at
capacity. We obtain molten sulfur from several domestic and foreign producers
under contracts of varied duration. In 2006, CF Martin Sulphur, our largest
molten sulfur supplier since 2001, supplied approximately 61% of the molten
sulfur used at Plant City. CF Martin Sulphur was created in November 2000
as a joint venture between Martin Resource Management and certain of its
affiliates (Martin) and us. On July 15, 2005, we sold our interest in CF Martin
Sulphur to Martin. Concurrent with the sale, we entered into a multi-year
sulfur supply contract with CF Martin Sulphur.

Ammonia
Supply.

In addition to its 46% phosphate
nutrient content, DAP has a nitrogen content of 18%. MAP has a nitrogen content
of 11%. Ammonia is the primary source of nitrogen in DAP and MAP. Operating at
capacity, our Plant City phosphate fertilizer complex consumes approximately
400,000 tons of ammonia annually.

The ammonia used at our
Plant City phosphate fertilizer complex is shipped by rail from our ammonia
storage facility located in Tampa, Florida. This facility, acquired in 1992,
consists of a 38,000-ton ammonia storage tank, access to a deep-water
dock that is capable of discharging ocean-going vessels, and rail and
truck-loading facilities. In addition to supplying our Plant City
phosphate fertilizer complex, our Tampa ammonia distribution system has the
capacity to support ammonia sales to other customers. Sales of


CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

ammonia
from our Tampa terminal are reported in our nitrogen business segment. The
ammonia supply for Tampa is purchased from offshore sources, providing us with
access to the broad international ammonia market.

In the fourth quarter of
2005, The Mosaic Company and U.S. Agri-Chemicals completed the early termination
of Mosaic’s existing phosphate rock supply agreement with U.S. Agri-Chemicals,
and U.S. Agri-Chemicals ceased phosphate operations at its Florida phosphate
facilities upon exhaustion of its remaining raw materials inventories. In 2005
and 2004, most of the ammonia sales from our Tampa terminal were to U.S.
Agri-Chemicals. In 2005, we realized approximately $44.2 million of sales
revenue on sales volumes of approximately 168,000 tons of ammonia to U.S.
Agri-Chemicals.

Phosphate Distribution

We operate a phosphate
warehouse located at a deep-water port facility in Tampa, Florida. A majority
of the phosphate fertilizer produced at Plant City is shipped by truck or rail
to our Tampa warehouse, where it is loaded onto vessels for sale in the export
market or for transport across the Gulf of Mexico to the Mississippi River. In
2006, our Tampa warehouse handled approximately 1.3 million tons of
phosphate fertilizers, or about 65% of our production for that year. The
remainder of our phosphate fertilizer production is transported by truck or
rail directly to customers or to in-market storage facilities.

Phosphate fertilizer
shipped across the Gulf of Mexico to the Mississippi River is transferred into
river barges near New Orleans. Phosphate fertilizer in these river barges is
transported to our storage facilities or sold and delivered directly to
customers. River transportation is provided primarily under an agreement with
one of the major inland river system barge operators.

Storage Facilities and Other Properties

We currently own or rent
space at 48 in-market storage terminals and warehouses located in a 16-state
region. Including storage at our production facilities and at the Tampa
warehouse and ammonia terminal, we have an aggregate storage capacity for approximately
two million tons of fertilizer.

information on related party transactions, see Item 8. Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data., Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements, Note 30—Related Party Transactions.

In October 2006, we
became a member of Phosphate Chemicals Export Association, Inc, (PhosChem).
PhosChem was founded in 1974 in accordance with the provisions of the U.S.
Webb-Pomerene Act and is the export marketing association for its members.
PhosChem is the largest exporter of concentrated phosphate from North America
and its member companies consist of: Mosaic Fertilizer, LLC, a subsidiary of
The Mosaic Company; PCS Phosphate Company, Inc., an indirect, wholly-owned
subsidiary of Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan, Inc.; and CF Holdings.
Beginning in October 2006, PhosChem became our primary means of exporting
phosphate products. Sales to PhosChem represented approximately 5% of our
fourth quarter 2006 consolidated net sales.

Competition

Our markets are intensely competitive, based primarily
on delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product
quality. During the peak demand periods, product availability and delivery time
also play a role in the buying decisions of customers.

In the nitrogen fertilizer business, our primary North
American-based competitors are Agrium, Koch Nitrogen and Terra
Industries. There is also significant competition from product sourced from
regions of the world with low natural gas costs. Because urea is a widely-traded
fertilizer product and there are limited barriers to entry, competition from
foreign-sourced product is particularly acute with respect to urea.


CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

In the phosphate
fertilizer business, our primary North American-based competitors are
Agrium, Mosaic, Potash Corp. and Simplot. Historically, imports have not been a
factor, as the United States is a large net exporter of phosphate fertilizers.

Seasonality

The sales patterns of all
five of our major products are seasonal. The strongest demand for our products
occurs during the spring planting season, with a second period of strong demand
following the fall harvest. We and/or our customers generally build inventories
during the low demand periods of the year in order to ensure timely product
availability during the peak sales seasons. Seasonality is greatest for ammonia
due to the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store
significant quantities of this product. The seasonality of fertilizer demand
results in our sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring
and our working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start
of the spring season. Our quarterly financial results can vary significantly
from one year to the next due to weather-related shifts in planting
schedules and purchasing patterns.

Financial
Information About Foreign and Domestic Sales and Operations

foreign and domestic markets over the last three fiscal years and the carrying
value of our foreign and domestic assets are set forth in Item 8.
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data., Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements, Note 29—Segment Disclosures.

Environment, Health
and Safety

We are subject to numerous environmental, health and
safety laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to land
reclamation; the generation, treatment, storage, disposal and handling of
hazardous substances and wastes; and the cleanup of hazardous substance
releases. These laws include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), the Toxic Substances Control
Act and various other federal, state, provincial, local and international
statutes. Violations can result in substantial penalties, court orders to
install pollution-control equipment, civil and criminal sanctions, permit
revocations and facility shutdowns. In addition, environmental, health and safety
laws and regulations may impose joint and several liability, without regard to
fault, for cleanup costs on potentially responsible parties who have released
or disposed of hazardous substances into the environment.

We have received notices from time to time from
governmental agencies or third parties alleging that we are a potentially
responsible party at certain sites under CERCLA or other environmental cleanup
laws. We are currently involved in remediation activities at certain of our
current and former facilities. We are also participating in the cleanup of
third-party sites at which we have disposed of wastes. In
April 2002, we were asked by the current owner of a former phosphate mine
and manufacturing facility that we operated in the late 1950s and early 1960s
located in Georgetown Canyon, Idaho, to contribute to a remediation of this
property. We declined to participate in the cleanup. It is our understanding
that the current owner is undertaking an investigation of the environmental
conditions at the site. We do not know if a final remedy has been identified by
the current owner and approved by the state. We anticipate that the current
owner may bring a lawsuit against us seeking contribution for the cleanup
costs, although we do not have sufficient information to determine when such a
suit may be brought. We are not able to estimate at this time our potential
liability with respect to the remediation of this property. Based on currently
available information, we do not expect that any remedial or financial
obligations we may be subject to involving this or other sites will have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of
operations.


CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

In December 2004 and January 2005, the
United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) inspected our Plant City,
Florida phosphate fertilizer complex to evaluate the facility’s compliance with
RCRA, the federal statute that governs the generation, transportation,
treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous wastes. By letter dated September 27,
2005, EPA Region IV issued to the Company a Notice of Violation (NOV) and
Compliance Evaluation Inspection Report. The NOV and Compliance Evaluation
Inspection Report alleged a number of violations of RCRA, including violations
relating to recordkeeping, the failure to properly make hazardous waste
determinations as required by RCRA, and alleged treatment of sulfuric acid
waste without a permit. The most significant allegation in the NOV is that the
Plant City facility’s reuse of phosphoric acid process water (which is
otherwise exempt from regulation as a hazardous waste) in the production of
ammoniated phosphate fertilizer, and the return of this process water to the
facility’s process water recirculating system, has resulted in the disposal of
hazardous waste into the system without a permit. The Compliance Evaluation
Inspection Report indicates that as a result, the entire process water system,
including all pipes, cooling ponds and gypsum stacks, could be regulated as
hazardous waste management units under RCRA. If the EPA’s position is
eventually upheld, the Company could incur material expenditures in order to
modify its practices, or it may be required to comply with regulations
applicable to hazardous waste treatment, storage or disposal facilities. If the
Company is required to comply with such obligations, it could incur material
capital and operating expenditures or may be required to cease operation of the
water recirculating system that does not meet RCRA standards. This would cause
a significant disruption of the operations of the Plant City facility. The EPA
has referred the matter to the Department of Justice for enforcement. For
additional information, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings.

We expect continued government and public emphasis on
environmental issues will result in increased future investments for
environmental controls at ongoing operations. Our environmental, health and
safety capital expenditures in 2006 were approximately $2.7 million. We
estimate that we will spend between $5 million and $8 million
annually in 2007 and 2008 for environmental, health and safety capital
expenditures. Environmental, health and safety laws and regulations are complex,
change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. As a
result we may be required to incur additional expenditures to comply with these
laws and regulations, and they could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

We hold numerous environmental and mining permits
authorizing operations at our facilities. A decision by a government agency to
deny or delay issuing a new or renewed material permit or approval, or to
revoke or substantially modify an existing permit, could have a material
adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at the affected facility.
Any future expansion of our existing operations is also predicated upon
securing the necessary environmental or other permits or approvals.

As of December 31, 2006, the area permitted for
mining at our Hardee phosphate complex had approximately 55 million tons
of recoverable phosphate rock reserves, which will meet our requirements, at
current production rates, for approximately 16 years. We have secured the
necessary permits to mine these reserves from the Florida Department of
Environmental Protection and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. We have
initiated the process of applying for authorization and permits to expand the
geographical area in which we can mine at our Hardee property. The expanded
geographical area has an estimated additional 33 million tons of
recoverable phosphate reserves, which will allow us to conduct mining
operations at our Hardee property for approximately nine additional years at
current operating rates, assuming we secure the authorization and permits to
mine in this area. The estimated recoverable phosphate reserves are reflective
of the anticipated permittable mining areas based on recent similar permitting
efforts. In Florida, local community participation has become an important
factor in the authorization and permitting process for mining companies. A
denial of the authorizations or permits to continue and/or expand our mining
operations at our Hardee property would prevent us from mining all of


CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

our reserves and have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

Likewise, our phosphogypsum stack system at Plant City
has sufficient capacity to meet our requirements through 2014 at current
operating rates and subject to regular renewals of our operating permits. We
have secured the local development authorization to increase the capacity of
this stack system. Based on this authorization, estimated stack system capacity
is expected to meet our requirements until 2040 at current operating rates and
is subject to securing the corresponding operating permits. This time frame is
approximately eight years beyond our current estimate of available phosphate rock
reserves at our Hardee mine. A decision by the state or federal authorities to
deny a renewal of our current permits or to deny operating permits for the
expansion of our stack system could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

In certain cases, as a condition to procuring such
permits and approvals, we may be required to comply with financial assurance
regulatory requirements. The purpose of these requirements is to assure the
government that sufficient company funds will be available for the ultimate
closure, post-closure care and/or reclamation at our facilities. In March 2006,
we established an escrow account for the benefit of the Florida Department of
Environmental Protection as a means of taking advantage of a safe harbor
provision in a 2005 amendment to Florida’s regulations pertaining to financial
assurance requirements for the closure of phosphogypsum stacks. For additional
information on the cash deposit arrangement, see Item 8. Financial Statements
and Supplementary Data., Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 9—Asset
Retirement Obligations.

Several of our permits, including our mining permit at
the Hardee phosphate complex, require us to reclaim any property disturbed by
our operations. At our Hardee property, we currently mine approximately 300 to
400 acres of land each year, all of which must be reclaimed. The costs to
reclaim this land vary based on the type of land involved and range from $3,000
to $20,000 an acre, with an average of $6,000 an acre. For additional
information on our Hardee asset retirement obligations, see Item 8.
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data., Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements, Note 9—Asset Retirement Obligations.

Our phosphate operations in Florida are subject to
regulations governing the closure and long-term maintenance of our
phosphogypsum stack systems. In accordance with those regulations, we closed
the old phosphogypsum stack system at the Plant City phosphate fertilizer complex
and are in the process of closing the phosphogypsum stack system at the Bartow
phosphate complex.

At our Bartow phosphate complex, we estimate that we
will spend approximately $4.5 million between 2007 and 2008 and another
$10.3 million between 2016 and 2023 to complete closure of the
phosphogypsum stack and cooling pond. Water treating expenditures at Bartow are
expected to require about $2.4 million in 2007, $2.9 million in 2008
through 2013 and another $9.5 million in 2014 through 2056. Post-closure
long-term care expenditures at Bartow are estimated to total $73.3 million
for a sixty-seven year period commencing in 2007. To close the
phosphogypsum stack currently in use at the Plant City phosphate complex, we
estimate that we will spend approximately $10.1 million in 2023 and 2024,
approximately $31.2 million during the years 2031 through 2037, and
another $47.9 million in 2087 to close the cooling pond. Water treating
expenditures at Plant City are expected to approximate $5.9 million in
2018, $66.6 million in 2033 through 2037, and roughly $103.4 million
thereafter through 2087. Post-closure long-term care expenditures at Plant City
are estimated to total $112.4 million for a fifty year period commencing
in 2038. These amounts are in nominal dollars using an assumed inflation rate
of 3%. For additional information on our asset retirement obligations, see
Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data., Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 9—Asset Retirement Obligations.


CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

Cost estimates for closure
of our phosphogypsum stack systems are based on formal closure plans submitted
to the State of Florida, which are subject to revision during negotiations over
the next several years. Moreover, the time frame involved in the closure of our
phosphogypsum stack systems extends as far as the year 2087. Accordingly, the
actual amount to be spent also will depend upon factors such as the timing of
activities, refinements in scope, technological developments, cost inflation
and changes in applicable laws and regulations. These cost estimates may also
increase if the Plant City phosphogypsum stack is expanded further. For
additional information on our Plant City asset retirement obligations, see
Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data., Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 9—Asset Retirement Obligations.

Employees and Labor
Relations

As of December 31, 2006, we had approximately
1,400 full-time and 100 part-time employees. Of these employees, 24 operators
at one of our storage facilities are represented by a collective bargaining
agreement with the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing,
Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union or United
Steel Workers.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors.

Our business is subject to a number of risks. If any
of the events contemplated by the following risks actually occur, then our
business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially
adversely affected. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to
us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely
affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our business is
dependent on the price of natural gas in North America, which is both expensive
and highly volatile.

Natural gas is the principal raw material used to
produce nitrogen fertilizers. We use natural gas both as a chemical feedstock
and as a fuel to produce ammonia, urea and UAN. Because all of our nitrogen
fertilizer manufacturing facilities are located in the United States and
Canada, the price of natural gas in North America directly impacts a
substantial portion of our operating expenses. Expenditures on natural gas
comprised approximately 54% of the total cost of our nitrogen fertilizer sales
in 2006 and a substantially higher percentage of cash production costs (total
production costs less depreciation and amortization).

The market price for natural gas in North America is
significantly higher than the price of natural gas in other major fertilizer-producing
regions. For example, during 2006, natural gas prices in the United States
(measured at the Henry Hub, near our Donaldsonville, Louisiana facility)
averaged approximately $6.74 per MMBtu and in Canada (measured at AECO, near
our joint venture’s Medicine Hat, Alberta facility) averaged approximately
$5.76 per MMBtu. In comparison, during 2006, natural gas prices paid by
fertilizer producers are estimated to have been approximately $1.25 per MMBtu in
Russia and approximately $2.65 per MMBtu in the Republic of Trinidad and
Tobago. Many of our competitors benefit from access to lower-priced
natural gas through manufacturing facilities or interests in manufacturing
facilities located in these regions or other regions with abundant supplies of
natural gas.

The price of natural gas in North America is also
highly volatile. During 2006, the median daily price at Henry Hub ranged from a
low of $3.67 per MMBtu on October 2, 2006 to a high of $9.92 per MMBtu on January 4,
2006. During 2005, the median daily price at Henry Hub ranged from a low of
$5.53 per MMBtu on January 4, 2005 to a high of $15.40 per MMBtu on December 14,
2005. The volatility of the price of natural gas in North America compounds our
competitive disadvantage to some of our competitors, who, in addition to having
access to lower-priced natural gas, may also benefit from fixed-price
natural gas contracts.

As a result of global
competition in the fertilizer industry, we may not be able to pass along to our
customers in the form of higher product prices the higher operating costs we
incur due to our dependence on North American natural gas. For example, due to
the high cost of natural gas during the third and fourth quarters of 2005 and
the first quarter of 2006, we curtailed production of fertilizers at our
Donaldsonville complex because market prices of nitrogen fertilizer were below
our cost of production. Unless differences between the prices for natural gas
in North America and other fertilizer-producing regions are reduced, or
we are able to reduce our dependence on North American natural gas, the
relatively expensive and highly volatile cost of natural gas in North America
could make it difficult for us to compete against producers from other parts of
the world.

Our business is
cyclical, which results in periods of industry oversupply during which our
results of operations tend to be negatively impacted.

Historically, selling prices for our products have
fluctuated in response to periodic changes in supply and demand conditions.
Demand is affected by population growth, changes in dietary habits, non-food


CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

usage of crops, and
planted acreage and application rates, among other things. Supply is affected
by available capacity and operating rates, raw material costs, government
policies and global trade.

Periods of high demand, high capacity utilization and
increasing operating margins tend to result in new plant investment and
increased production, causing supply to exceed demand and prices and capacity
utilization to decline. In particular, new ammonia and urea capacity is
expected to be added abroad in low-cost regions. Future growth in demand for
fertilizer may not be sufficient to alleviate any existing or future conditions
of excess industry capacity.

During periods of industry
oversupply, our results of operations tend to be affected negatively as the
price at which we sell our products typically declines, resulting in reduced
profit margins, lower production of our products and possible plant closures.

Our products are
global commodities, and we face intense global competition from other
fertilizer producers.

We are subject to intense price competition from both
domestic and foreign sources. Fertilizers are global commodities, with little
or no product differentiation, and customers make their purchasing decisions
principally on the basis of delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer
service and product quality. We compete with a number of domestic and foreign
producers, including state-owned and government-subsidized
entities. Some of these competitors have greater total resources and are less
dependent on earnings from fertilizer sales, which makes them less vulnerable
to industry downturns and better positioned to pursue new expansion and
development opportunities.

Recent consolidation in the fertilizer industry has
increased the resources of several of our competitors, and we expect
consolidation among fertilizer producers to continue. In light of this industry
consolidation, our competitive position could suffer to the extent we are not
able to expand our own resources either through investments in new or existing
operations or through acquisitions, joint ventures or partnerships. In the
future, we may not be able to find suitable assets to purchase or joint venture
or partnership opportunities to pursue. Even if we are able to locate desirable
opportunities, we may not be able to acquire desired assets or enter into
desired joint ventures or partnerships on economically acceptable terms. Our
inability to compete successfully could result in the loss of customers, which
could adversely affect our sales and profitability.

China is the world’s largest producer and consumer of
fertilizers and has been, and is expected to continue, expanding its fertilizer
production capability. This expected increase in capacity could adversely
affect the balance between global supply and demand and may put downward
pressure on global fertilizer prices, which could adversely affect our results
of operations and financial condition.

We may face increased
competition from Russian and Ukrainian urea, which is currently subject to
antidumping duty orders that impose significant duties on urea imported into
the United States from these two countries. The antidumping orders have been in
place since 1987, and there has been almost no urea imported into the United
States from Russia or Ukraine since that time. Russia and Ukraine currently
have considerable capacity to produce urea and are the world’s largest urea
exporters. Producers in both countries benefit from natural gas prices that are
determined by their governments and which are well below the commercial value
of natural gas in other regions of the world, encouraging urea production and
potential export activity. Following a review by the U.S. Department of
Commerce and the U.S. International Trade Commission, the antidumping orders
were extended for an additional five-year period in November 2005. The
decision to extend the orders has been appealed by the Russian producers. For a
number of reasons, including available capacity, the attractiveness of the U.S.
market and barriers to urea imports in other key consuming markets, we expect
that if the decision to extend the orders is reversed,


CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

imports
of Russian and Ukrainian urea into the United States are likely to increase
significantly, causing our sales and margins to suffer.

Any decline in U.S.
agricultural production or limitations on the use of our products for
agricultural purposes could materially adversely affect the market for our
products.

Conditions in the U.S. agricultural industry can
significantly impact our operating results. The U.S. agricultural industry can
be affected by a number of factors, including weather patterns and field
conditions, current and projected grain inventories and prices, the domestic
and international demand for U.S. agricultural products and U.S. and foreign
policies regarding trade in agricultural products.

State and federal
governmental policies, including farm and ethanol subsidies and commodity
support programs, may also directly or indirectly influence the number of acres
planted, the mix of crops planted and the use of fertilizers for particular
agricultural applications. In addition, several states are currently considering
limitations on the use and application of chemical fertilizers due to concerns
about the impact of these products on the environment.

We have a history
of losses and may incur losses in the future, which could materially and
adversely affect the market price of our common stock.

We incurred net losses in
six out of the last eight years; 1999 through 2003, and 2005. In future
periods, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a
consistent quarterly or annual basis. Failure to maintain consistent
profitability may materially and adversely affect the market price of our
common stock.

Adverse weather
conditions may decrease demand for our fertilizer products.

Weather conditions that
delay or intermittently disrupt field work during the planting and growing
seasons may cause agricultural customers to use different forms of nitrogen
fertilizer, which may adversely affect demand for the forms that we sell.
Adverse weather conditions following harvest may delay or eliminate
opportunities to apply fertilizer in the fall. Weather can also have an adverse
effect on crop yields, which lowers the income of growers and could impair
their ability to purchase fertilizer from our customers.

Our inability to
predict future seasonal fertilizer demand accurately could result in excess
inventory, potentially at costs in excess of market value, or product
shortages.

The fertilizer business is seasonal. The strongest
demand for our products occurs during the spring planting season, with a second
period of strong demand following the fall harvest. We and/or our customers
generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year in order
to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons.
Seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the limited ability of our customers
and their customers to store significant quantities of this product. The
seasonality of fertilizer demand results in our sales volumes and net sales
being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being
the highest just prior to the start of the spring season. Our quarterly
financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to
weather-related shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns.

If seasonal demand exceeds
our projections, our customers may acquire products from our competitors, and
our profitability will be negatively impacted. If seasonal demand is less than
we expect, we will be left with excess inventory that will have to be stored
(in which case our results of operations will be negatively impacted by any
related storage costs) and/or liquidated (in which case the selling price may
be below our production, procurement and storage costs). The risks associated
with excess inventory and


CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

product
shortages are particularly acute with respect to our nitrogen fertilizer
business because of the highly volatile cost of natural gas and nitrogen
fertilizer prices and the relatively brief periods during which farmers can
apply nitrogen fertilizers.

Our customer base
is concentrated, with certain large customers accounting for a substantial
portion of our sales.

During 2006, three
customers, Agriliance, LLC, a 50-50 joint venture between Land O’Lakes, Inc.
and CHS, Inc., GROWMARK, Inc., and ConAgra International Fertilizer
Company made combined fertilizer purchases of approximately $944.0 million
from us, representing approximately 48% of our total net sales. Because we
depend on these customers for a significant portion of our sales, we may have
less flexibility than some of our competitors to diversify our customer base
and seek more profitable direct sales to customers of our significant
customers. Any substantial change in purchasing decisions by any or all of
these customers, whether due to actions by our competitors, our actions in
expanding the direct sale of fertilizers to the customers of our significant
customers or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business.

A reduction in the
use of the forward pricing program by our customers or an increase in the use
of product purchases to support the program could increase our exposure to
fluctuations in our profit margins and materially adversely affect our
operating results, liquidity and financial condition.

In mid-2003, we instituted a forward pricing
program. Through our forward pricing program, we offer our customers the
opportunity to purchase product on a forward basis at prices and delivery dates
we propose. As our customers enter into forward nitrogen fertilizer purchase
contracts with us, we effectively fix the cost of natural gas, the largest and
most volatile component of our supply cost. As a result of fixing the selling
prices of our products under our forward pricing program, often months in
advance of their ultimate delivery to customers, our reported selling prices
and margins may differ from market spot prices and margins available at the
time of shipment. Under our forward pricing program, customers generally pay a
significant portion of the contract’s sales value in advance of shipment,
thereby significantly increasing our liquidity. Any cash payments received in
advance from customers in connection with the forward pricing program are
reflected on our balance sheet as a current liability until the related orders
are shipped, which can take up to several months. As of December 31, 2006,
our current liability for customer advances related to unshipped orders under
this program equaled approximately 32% of our cash, cash equivalents and
short-term investments.

We believe the forward pricing program is most
appealing to our customers during periods of generally increasing prices for
nitrogen fertilizers. Our customers may be less willing or even unwilling to
purchase products on a forward basis during periods of generally decreasing or
stable prices or during periods of relatively high fertilizer prices. For
example, in the fourth quarter of 2005, a period during which prices for
nitrogen fertilizer products reached record high levels, our orders under the
forward pricing program declined significantly as our customers and their
customers preferred to defer purchases of fertilizer products rather than
commit to purchasing products at such high prices. Sales under the forward
pricing program were lower during 2006, a period of relatively high fertilizer
prices, compared to 2005, with forward sales of nitrogen fertilizer products
declining from approximately 70% of our nitrogen fertilizer volume during 2005
to approximately 44% in 2006.

The forward pricing program is also less effective at
reducing our exposure to fluctuations in our profit margins in circumstances
where we intend to purchase the fertilizer product from third parties for
resale, rather than manufacture the product at one of our facilities. For
example, due to the high cost of natural gas in North America during the third
and fourth quarters of 2005, we decided to curtail production at our facilities
and increase our purchases of fertilizer products originating from off-shore,


CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

lower cost producers for
resale to our customers. Because it is generally not feasible to purchase
fertilizer products from these third parties on a forward basis or match
purchased quantities with specific order quantities, we may not be able to fix
our profit margins effectively on fertilizer products that we buy for resale
under our forward pricing program. One method we use to reduce our margin
exposure on sales of purchased products under our forward pricing program is to
purchase the required fertilizer products in advance of the specified delivery
date. In such circumstances, however, we may be required to buy and store the
product sooner and in greater quantities than if produced, thereby reducing the
liquidity benefits otherwise associated with the forward pricing program.

Any significant increase
in our purchases of fertilizer products for resale to our customers or any
reduction in the use of the forward pricing program by our customers due to
changing conditions in the fertilizer market or otherwise could increase our
exposure to fluctuating profit margins and materially adversely affect our
operating results, liquidity and financial condition.

Our operations
involve significant risks and hazards against which we may not be fully
insured.

Our operations are subject to hazards inherent in the
manufacturing, transportation, storage and distribution of chemical
fertilizers, including ammonia, which is highly toxic and corrosive. These
hazards include: explosions; fires; severe weather and natural disasters; train
derailments, collisions, vessel groundings and other transportation and
maritime incidents; leaks and ruptures involving storage tanks, pipelines and
rail cars; spills, discharges and releases of toxic or hazardous substances or
gases; deliberate sabotage and terrorist incidents; mechanical failures;
unscheduled downtime; labor difficulties and other risks. Some of these hazards
can cause bodily injury and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of
property and equipment and environmental damage, and they may result in
suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties and
liabilities. For example, over the course of the past few years, we have been
involved in numerous property damage and personal injury lawsuits arising out
of a hydrogen explosion at our Donaldsonville nitrogen fertilizer complex in
2000, in which three people died and several others were injured. We were also
involved in personal injury lawsuits arising out of a train derailment near
Minot, North Dakota in 2002 that ruptured five tank cars, causing the formation
of an ammonia cloud over the area, in which one person died and numerous others
were injured.

Our exposure to these types of risks is increased
because of our reliance on a limited number of key facilities. Our nitrogen
fertilizer operations are dependent on our nitrogen fertilizer complex in
Donaldsonville, Louisiana and our joint venture’s nitrogen fertilizer complex
in Medicine Hat, Alberta. Our phosphate fertilizer operations are dependent on
our phosphate mine and associated beneficiation plant in Hardee County,
Florida; our phosphate fertilizer complex in Plant City, Florida; and our
ammonia terminal in Tampa, Florida. Any suspension of operations at any of
these key facilities could adversely affect our ability to produce our products
and could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, all of
these facilities, other than the complex in Medicine Hat, are located in
regions of the United States that experience a relatively high level of
hurricane activity. Such storms, depending on their severity and location, have
the potential not only to damage our facilities and disrupt our operations but
also to adversely affect the shipping and distribution of our products and the
supply and price of natural gas and sulfur in the Gulf region.

We maintain property,
business interruption and casualty insurance policies, but we are not fully
insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business. If we
were to incur significant liability for which we were not fully insured, it
could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and
financial condition. We are subject to various self-retentions and deductibles
under these insurance policies. As a result of market conditions, our premiums,
self-retentions and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase
substantially and, in some instances, certain insurance may become unavailable
or available only for reduced amounts of coverage.


CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

We rely on third
party providers of transportation services and equipment, which subjects us to
risks and uncertainties beyond our control that may adversely affect our
operations.

We rely on railroad, trucking, pipeline, river barge
and ocean vessel companies to transport raw materials to our manufacturing
facilities, to deliver finished products to our distribution system and to ship
finished products to our customers. We also lease rail cars from rail car
owners in order to ship raw materials and finished products. These
transportation operations, equipment, and services are subject to various
hazards, including extreme weather conditions, work stoppages, delays, spills,
derailments and other accidents and other operating hazards.

These transportation operations, equipment and
services are also subject to environmental, safety, and regulatory oversight.
Due to concerns related to terrorism, the potential use of fertilizers as
explosives or accidents, local, state and federal governments could implement
new regulations affecting the transportation of our raw materials or finished
products. In addition, new regulations could be implemented affecting the
equipment used to ship our raw materials or finished products.

If we are delayed or
unable to ship our finished products or obtain raw materials as a result of
these transportation companies’ failure to operate properly, or if new and more
stringent regulatory requirements are implemented affecting transportation
operations or equipment, or if there are significant increases in the cost of
these services or equipment, our sales revenues and/or cost of operations could
be adversely affected.

Expansion of our
business may result in unanticipated adverse consequences and may be hindered
by the significant resources that would be required for any such expansion.

In the future, we may seek to expand our business by
investing in new or existing facilities, making acquisitions or entering into
partnerships and joint ventures. Acquisitions, partnerships, joint ventures or
investments may require significant managerial attention, which may be diverted
from our other activities and may impair the operation of our businesses.

International
acquisitions, partnerships, or joint ventures or the international expansion of
our business could involve additional risks and uncertainties, including:

·

difficulties
and costs of complying with a wide variety of complex laws, treaties and
regulations;

·

unexpected
changes in regulatory environments;

·

political
and economic instability, including the possibility for civil unrest;

·

nationalization
of properties by foreign governments;

·

tax
rates that may exceed those in the United States, and earnings that may be
subject to withholding requirements;

·

the
imposition of tariffs, exchange controls or other restrictions; and

·

the
impact of exchange rate fluctuations between the United States dollar and
foreign currencies in the countries where we operate.

Furthermore, any
future acquisitions of businesses or facilities could entail a number of
additional risks, including:

·

problems
with effective integration of operations;

·

the
inability to maintain key pre-acquisition business relationships;


CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

·

loss
of key personnel of the acquired business or facility;

·

exposure
to unanticipated liabilities; and

·

difficulties
in realizing efficiencies, synergies and cost savings.

These risks of unanticipated adverse consequences from
any expansion of our business through investments, acquisitions, partnerships
or joint ventures are increased due to the significant capital and other
resources that we may have to commit to any such expansion. We also face
increased exposure to risks related to acquisitions and international
operations because our experience with acquisitions and international
operations is limited. As a result of these and other factors, including
general economic risk, we may not be able to realize our projected returns from
any future acquisitions, partnerships, joint ventures or other investments.

We may not have access to
the funding required for the expansion of our business or such funding may not
be available to us on acceptable terms. We may finance the expansion of our
business with additional indebtedness and/or by issuing additional equity
securities. We could face financial risks associated with incurring additional
indebtedness, such as reducing our liquidity and access to financial markets
and increasing the amount of cash flow required to service such indebtedness,
or associated with issuing additional equity securities, such as dilution of
ownership and earnings.

We are subject to
numerous environmental and health and safety laws and regulations, as well as
potential environmental liabilities, which may require us to make substantial
expenditures.

We are subject to numerous environmental and health
and safety laws and regulations in the United States and Canada, including laws
and regulations relating to land reclamation; the generation, treatment,
storage, disposal and handling of hazardous substances and wastes; and the
cleanup of hazardous substance releases. These laws include the Clean Air Act,
the Clean Water Act, RCRA, CERCLA, the Toxic Substances Control Act and various
other federal, state, provincial, local and international statutes.

As a fertilizer company working with chemicals and
other hazardous substances, our business is inherently subject to spills,
discharges or other releases of hazardous substances into the environment. Certain
environmental laws, including CERCLA, impose joint and several liability,
without regard to fault, for cleanup costs on persons who have disposed of or
released hazardous substances into the environment. Given the nature of our
business, we have incurred, are incurring currently, and are likely to incur
periodically in the future liabilities under CERCLA and other environmental
cleanup laws at our current or former facilities, adjacent or nearby third-party
facilities or offsite disposal locations. The costs associated with future
cleanup activities that we may be required to conduct or finance may be
material. Additionally, we may become liable to third parties for damages,
including personal injury and property damage, resulting from the disposal or release
of hazardous substances into the environment.

Violations of environmental and health and safety laws
can result in substantial penalties, court orders to install pollution-control
equipment, civil and criminal sanctions, permit revocations and facility
shutdowns. Environmental and health and safety laws change rapidly and have
tended to become more stringent over time. As a result, we have not always been
and may not always be in compliance with all environmental and health and
safety laws and regulations. Additionally, future environmental and health and
safety laws and regulations or more vigorous enforcement of current laws and
regulations, whether caused by violations of environmental and health and
safety laws by us or other chemical fertilizer companies or otherwise, may
require us to make substantial expenditures, and our costs to comply with, or
any liabilities under, these laws and regulations could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

See Item 1. Business.—Environmental
Health and Safety and Item 3. Legal Proceedings.


CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

Our operations are
dependent on numerous required permits and approvals from governmental
authorities.

We hold numerous environmental, mining and other
governmental permits and approvals authorizing operations at each of our
facilities. Expansion of our operations also is predicated upon securing the
necessary environmental or other permits or approvals. A decision by a
government agency to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed material permit or
approval, or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or approval,
could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at
the affected facility and on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

In certain cases, as a condition to procuring such
permits and approvals, we may be required to comply with financial assurance
regulatory requirements. The purpose of these requirements is to assure the
government that sufficient company funds will be available for the ultimate
closure, post-closure care and/or reclamation at our facilities. In March 2006,
we established an escrow account for the benefit of the Florida Department of
Environmental Protection as a means of taking advantage of a safe harbor
provision in a 2005 amendment to Florida’s regulations pertaining to financial
assurance requirements for the closure of phosphogypsum stacks. Additionally,
Florida regulations require mining companies to demonstrate financial
responsibility for wetland and other surface water mitigation measures in
advance of any mining activities. If and when we are able to expand our Hardee
mining activities to areas not currently permitted, we will be required to
demonstrate financial responsibility for wetland and other surface water
mitigation measures in advance of any mining activities. The demonstration of
financial responsibility may be provided by passage of financial tests. In the
event that we are unable to satisfy these financial tests, alternative methods
of complying with the financial assurance requirements would require us to
expend funds for the purchase of bonds, letters of credit, insurance policies
or similar instruments. It is possible that we will not be able to comply with
either current or new financial assurance regulations in the future, which
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

As of December 31, 2006, the area permitted by
local, state and federal authorities for mining at our Hardee phosphate complex
had approximately 55 million tons of recoverable phosphate rock reserves,
which will meet our requirements, at current operating rates, for approximately
16 years. We have initiated the process of applying for authorization and
permits to expand the geographical area in which we can mine at our Hardee
property. The expanded geographical area has an estimated 33 million tons
of recoverable phosphate reserves, which will allow us to conduct mining
operations at our Hardee property for approximately nine additional years at
current operating rates, assuming we secure the authorization and permits to
mine in this area. In Florida, local community participation has become an
important factor in the authorization and permitting process for mining
companies. A denial of the authorizations or permits to continue and/or expand
our mining operations at our Hardee property would prevent us from mining all
of our reserves and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations.

Likewise, our
phosphogypsum stack system at Plant City has sufficient capacity to meet our
requirements through 2014 at current operating rates and is subject to regular
renewals of our operating permits. We have secured the local development
authorization to increase the capacity of this stack system. Based on this
authorization, estimated stack system capacity is expected to meet our
requirements until 2040 at current operating rates and is subject to securing
the corresponding operating permits. This time frame is approximately eight
years beyond our current estimate of available phosphate rock reserves at our
Hardee mine. A decision by the state or federal authorities to deny a renewal
of our current permits or to deny operating permits for the expansion of our
stack system could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

Acts of terrorism
could negatively affect our business.

Like other companies with
major industrial facilities, our plants and ancillary facilities may be targets
of terrorist activities. Many of these plants and facilities store significant
quantities of ammonia and other items that can be dangerous if mishandled. Any
damage to infrastructure facilities, such as electric generation, transmission
and distribution facilities, or injury to employees, who could be direct
targets or indirect casualties of an act of terrorism, may affect our
operations. Any disruption of our ability to produce or distribute our products
could result in a significant decrease in revenues and significant additional
costs to replace, repair or insure our assets, which could have a material
adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. In
addition, due to concerns related to terrorism or the potential use of certain
fertilizers as explosives, local, state and federal governments could implement
new regulations impacting the security of our plants, terminals and warehouses
or the transportation and use of fertilizers. These regulations could result in
higher operating costs or limitations on the sale of our products and could
result in significant unanticipated costs, lower revenues and/or reduced profit
margins.

Our operations are
dependent upon raw materials provided by third parties and any delay or
interruption in the delivery of these raw materials may adversely affect our
business.

We use natural gas,
ammonia and sulfur as raw materials in the manufacture of fertilizers. We
purchase these raw materials from third-party suppliers. These products
are transported by barge, truck, rail or pipeline to our facilities by third-party
transportation providers or through the use of facilities owned by third
parties. Any delays or interruptions in the delivery of these key raw
materials, including those caused by capacity constraints; explosions; fires;
severe weather and natural disasters; train derailments, collisions, vessel
groundings and other transportation and maritime incidents; leaks and ruptures
involving pipelines; deliberate sabotage and terrorist incidents; mechanical
failures; unscheduled downtime; or labor difficulties, could have a material
adverse effect on our business.

The loss of key
members of our management and professional staff may adversely affect our
business.

We believe our continued success depends on the
collective abilities and efforts of our senior management and professional
staff. The loss of one or more key personnel could have a material adverse
effect on our results of operations. Additionally, if we are unable to find,
hire and retain needed key personnel in the future, our results of operations
could be materially and adversely affected.

Environmental

In December 2004 and January 2005, the
United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) inspected our Plant City,
Florida phosphate fertilizer complex to evaluate the facility’s compliance with
the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), the federal statute that governs
the generation, transportation, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous
wastes. This inspection was undertaken as a part of a broad enforcement
initiative commenced by the EPA to evaluate whether mineral processing and
mining facilities, including, in particular, all wet process phosphoric acid
production facilities, are in compliance with RCRA, and the extent to which
such facilities’ waste management practices have impacted the environment.

By letter dated September 27, 2005, EPA Region 4
issued to the Company a Notice of Violation (NOV) and Compliance Evaluation
Inspection Report. The NOV and Compliance Evaluation Inspection Report alleged
a number of violations of RCRA, including violations relating to recordkeeping,
the failure to properly make hazardous waste determinations as required by
RCRA, and alleged treatment of sulfuric acid waste without a permit. The most
significant allegation in the NOV is that the Plant City facility’s reuse of
phosphoric acid process water (which is otherwise exempt from regulation as a
hazardous waste) in the production of ammoniated phosphate fertilizer, and the
return of this process water to the facility’s process water recirculating
system, have resulted in the disposal of hazardous waste into the system without
a permit. The Compliance Evaluation Inspection Report indicates that as a
result, the entire process water system, including all pipes, ditches, cooling
ponds and gypsum stacks, could be regulated as hazardous waste management units
under RCRA.

Several of our competitors have received NOVs making
this same allegation. This particular recycling of process water is common in
the industry and, the Company believes, was authorized by the EPA in 1990. The
Company also believes that this allegation is inconsistent with recent case law
governing the scope of the EPA’s regulatory authority under RCRA. If the EPA’s
position is eventually upheld, the Company could incur material expenditures in
order to modify its practices, or it may be required to comply with regulations
applicable to hazardous waste treatment, storage or disposal facilities. If the
Company is required to comply with such obligations, it could incur material
capital and operating expenditures or may


CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

be required to cease
operation of the water recirculating system if it is determined that it does
not meet RCRA standards. This would cause a significant disruption of the
operations of the Plant City facility.

The NOV indicated that the Company is liable for
penalties up to the statutory maximum (for example, the statutory maximum per
day of noncompliance for each violation that occurred after March 15, 2004
is $32,500 per day). Although penalties of this magnitude are rarely, if ever,
imposed, the Company is at risk of incurring substantial civil penalties with
respect to these allegations. The EPA has referred this matter to the United
States Department of Justice (DOJ) for enforcement. The Company has entered
into discussions with the DOJ that have included not only the issues identified
in the NOV but other operational practices of the Company and its competitors.
The Company does not know if this matter will be resolved prior to the
commencement of litigation by the United States.

In connection with the
RCRA enforcement initiative, the EPA collected samples of soil, groundwater and
various waste streams at the Plant City facility. The analysis of the split
samples collected by the Company during the EPA’s inspection did not identify
hazardous waste disposal issues impacting the site. The EPA’s sampling results
appear to be consistent with the Company’s results. Pursuant to a 1992 consent
order with the State of Florida, the Company captures and reuses groundwater
that has been impacted as a result of the former operation of an unlined gypsum
stack at the site. Although the Company believes that it has evaluated and is
remediating the impacts resulting from its historic activities, the DOJ and the
EPA have indicated that they will be seeking additional environmental
investigation at the facilities subject to the enforcement initiative,
including Plant City. In addition, we understand that the EPA may decide to
inspect our Bartow, Florida property, where we formerly manufactured phosphoric
acid. The EPA has requested and the Company has provided copies of existing
monitoring data for this facility. Depending on the conclusions that the EPA
reaches after reviewing this data, the EPA may require that an investigation of
environmental conditions be undertaken at the Bartow facility.

Overview

Our Company

We are one of the largest manufacturers and
distributors of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer products in North America.
Our operations are organized into two business segments: the nitrogen
fertilizer business and the phosphate fertilizer business. Our principal
products in the nitrogen fertilizer business are ammonia, urea and urea
ammonium nitrate solution, or UAN. Our principal products in the phosphate
fertilizer business are diammonium phosphate, or DAP, and monoammonium
phosphate, or MAP. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2005, the most
recent period for which such information is available, we supplied
approximately 24% of the nitrogen and approximately 12% of the phosphate used
in agricultural fertilizer applications in the United States. Our core market
and distribution facilities are concentrated in the midwestern U.S. grain-producing
states.

Our principal
assets include:

·

the
largest nitrogen fertilizer complex in North America (Donaldsonville,
Louisiana);

·

a
66% economic interest in the largest nitrogen fertilizer complex in Canada
(which we operate in Medicine Hat, Alberta, through Canadian Fertilizers
Limited, or CFL, a consolidated variable interest entity);

·

one
of the largest integrated ammonium phosphate fertilizer complexes in the United
States (Plant City, Florida);

·

the
most-recently constructed phosphate rock mine and associated beneficiation
plant in the United States (Hardee County, Florida); and

·

an extensive system of
terminals, warehouses and associated transportation equipment located primarily
in the midwestern United States.

Company History

We were founded in 1946 as a fertilizer brokerage
operation by a group of regional agricultural cooperatives seeking to pool
their purchasing power. During the 1960s, we expanded our distribution
capabilities and diversified into fertilizer manufacturing through the
acquisition of several existing plants and facilities. During the 1970s and
again during the 1990s, we expanded our production and distribution
capabilities significantly, spending approximately $1 billion in each of
these decades.

Through the end of 2002, we operated as a traditional
supply cooperative. Our focus was on providing our pre-IPO owners with an
assured supply of fertilizer. Typically, over 80% of our annual sales volume
was to our pre-IPO owners. Though important, financial performance was
subordinate to our mandated supply objective.


CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

In 2002, we reassessed our corporate mission and
adopted a new business model that established financial performance, rather
than assured supply to our pre-IPO owners, as our principal objective. A
critical aspect of the new business model was to establish a more economically
driven approach to the marketplace. Under the new business model, we began to
pursue markets and customers and make pricing decisions with a primary focus on
financial performance. One result of this approach was a substantial shift in
our customer mix. By 2006, our sales to customers other than our pre-IPO owners
and Western Co-operative Fertilizers Limited (Westco), our joint venture
partner in CFL, reached approximately 46% of our total sales volume for the
year, which was more than double the comparable percentage for 2002.

CF Holdings was formed as
a Delaware corporation in April 2005 to hold the existing businesses of CF
Industries, Inc. In August of 2005, we completed our initial public
offering of common stock.

Executive Summary

·

We
reported net earnings of $33.3 million in 2006 compared to a net loss of
$39.0 million in 2005. Our results for 2006 included a net
$30.7 million pre-tax mark-to-market loss on natural gas derivatives and a
pre-tax charge of $21.6 million for adjustments to our asset retirement
obligations (AROs) and demolition costs primarily related to our closed Bartow,
Florida complex. The net loss of $39.0 million in 2005 included a
$99.9 million charge to the income tax provision to record a valuation
allowance on the deferred tax asset related to CF Industries, Inc.’s net
operating loss carryforwards generated during pre-IPO operations, a
$28.3 million loss on the extinguishment of debt, a net $9.3 million
pre-tax mark-to-market loss on natural gas derivatives and a $12.8 million
pre-tax charge to AROs primarily related to our Bartow, Florida complex.

·

Our
gross margin decreased $62.0 million to $147.2 million in 2006
compared to $209.2 million in 2005. The decline in gross margin resulted
primarily from unfavorable variances related to natural gas costs and higher
phosphate raw material costs, partially offset by higher average selling prices
for ammonia as well as higher average phosphate fertilizer selling prices.

·

Our
net sales were $1.9 billion for both 2006 and 2005. Higher average selling
prices for ammonia and phosphate fertilizers in 2006 were offset by lower
nitrogen fertilizer sales volumes. Our total sales volume of 8.4 million
tons for 2006 approximated the volume of tons sold in 2005.

·

We
paid cash dividends of $4.4 million in 2006.

The
following significant items affected the comparability of our reported results
for 2006 and our financial position as of December 31, 2006:

On
August 16, 2005, we completed our IPO of common stock. We sold 47,437,500
shares of our common stock in the offering and received net proceeds, after
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, of approximately
$715.4 million. We did not retain any of the proceeds from our IPO. In
connection with our IPO, we consummated a reorganization transaction in which
CF Industries, Inc. ceased to be a cooperative and became our wholly-owned
subsidiary. In the reorganization transaction, all of the equity interests in
CF Industries, Inc. were cancelled in exchange for all of the proceeds of
the IPO and 7,562,499 shares of our common stock.

In
connection with our IPO, we also recorded a charge to the income tax provision
of $99.9 million to reduce to zero what remained of the gross deferred tax
asset related to CF Industries, Inc.’s net operating loss carryforwards as
of August 16, 2005 (CF Industries, Inc.’s last day as a cooperative).
Those net operating loss carryforwards were generated from business conducted
with CF Industries, Inc.’s pre-IPO owners while CF Industries, Inc.
was a cooperative. In connection with our IPO, we entered into an NOL agreement
with the pre-IPO owners of CF Industries, Inc. which provides that in the
event that it is finally determined by the applicable taxing jurisdictions that
CF Industries, Inc.’s pre-IPO NOLs can be utilized,


CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

we will pay the pre-IPO owners an amount
equal to the federal and state income taxes saved by the utilization of the
pre-IPO NOLs. See Notes 12 and 30 to our consolidated financial statements in
Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for further
discussion of the NOL agreement.

In
August of 2005, we replaced our $140 million senior secured revolving
credit facility with a $250 million senior secured revolving credit
facility.

In
August of 2005, we repaid in full $235.6 million of our term notes,
plus associated prepayment penalties and accrued interest in the amount of
$29.3 million, with cash on hand and by liquidating short-term
investments. Prior thereto, we made principal payments of $0.7 million and
$10.0 million on their scheduled maturity dates.

In
connection with these transactions, we incurred a net $17.1 million charge
(after taxes) related to the prepayment penalties associated with the repayment
of our long term debt ($16.0 million) and termination of a long-term
incentive plan ($1.1 million) upon completion of our IPO. We also incurred
a non-cash charge of $1.1 million (after taxes) related to the write-off
of unamortized financing fees related to our previous senior secured revolving
credit facility and long term debt.

Also,
in connection with our IPO, our board of directors adopted a plan under which
we grant stock-based awards to our officers, employees and non-employee
directors. In both 2006 and 2005 (in connection with the IPO), stock—based
awards were granted under this plan. In the third quarter of 2005, we adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R—

Share-Based Payment

which requires us to recognize in
our consolidated statement of operations the grant date fair value of all stock-based
awards. As a result, the total stock-based compensation cost recognized
for 2006 and 2005 was $8.1 million and $3.7 million, respectively.
Most of the stock-based compensation cost was recorded as selling,
general and administrative expenses. We did not have stock-based awards
prior to our initial public offering. See the “Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates” section later in this discussion and analysis for additional
information on stock-based compensation.

Hurricane
activity in the Gulf of Mexico region during the latter portion of 2005
significantly affected the domestic fertilizer industry. These hurricanes
caused substantial damage to the natural gas production and distribution
facilities in the region, affecting the supply and price of natural gas, the
primary raw material used to produce nitrogen fertilizers. By the end of the
first quarter of 2006, natural gas prices had moderated, returning to
approximately pre-hurricane levels. These storms also affected the availability
of barges used to transport urea and DAP/MAP on the Mississippi River and
adversely affected the supply of sulfur, a raw material used in the production
of phosphate fertilizers, by causing refinery closures and transportation
disruptions.

In
the fourth quarter of 2005, we ceased classifying natural gas derivatives as
cash flow hedges as defined in SFAS No. 133—

Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities

. As a
result, realized and unrealized gains or losses related to our derivatives are
now recognized in operations as they occur. Cash flow hedges existing at the
time we discontinued hedge accounting were de-designated as cash flow hedges.
During 2006, we recognized a net $30.7 million pre-tax mark-to-market loss
on natural gas derivatives in cost of sales compared to a net $9.3 million
pre-tax mark-to-market loss in 2005. Despite our change in accounting
treatment, the execution and attendant economic consequences of our hedging
activities have not changed, in that derivatives are still being used to lock
in a substantial portion of our margin on forward pricing program (FPP) sales.
However, because of our change in accounting treatment, gains or losses on
natural gas hedges may not be realized in the same period as the FPP sale to
which they relate. We also establish natural gas derivative positions that are
associated with anticipated natural gas requirements unrelated to our FPP. See
Note 24 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8,
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for further discussion of
derivative financial instruments.


CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

We implemented Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB) Interpretation No. 47—

Accounting
for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations

(FIN No. 47) in
the fourth quarter of 2005. This interpretation of SFAS No. 143—

Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations

requires us to recognize a liability for asset retirement obligations (AROs)
associated with our facilities at the time those obligations are imposed, even
if the timing and manner of settlement are difficult to ascertain. We
identified conditional AROs for costs associated with the cessation of
operations at our facilities. Consequently, we recognized an increase in ARO
liabilities of $4.6 million, and an increase in deferred tax assets of
$1.8 million resulting in a cumulative effect of a change in accounting
principle of $2.8 million that decreased net earnings. See Note 9 to our
consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements
and Supplementary Data, for further discussion of asset retirement obligations.

Key Industry
Factors

We operate in a highly
competitive, global industry. Our products are globally-traded
commodities and, as a result, we compete principally on the basis of delivered
price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality. Moreover,
our operating results are influenced by a broad range of factors, including those
outlined below.

Global Supply &
Demand

Historically, global
fertilizer demand has been driven primarily by population growth, changes in
dietary habits and planted acreage and application rates, among other things.
We expect these key variables to continue to have major impacts on long-term
fertilizer demand for the foreseeable future. Short-term fertilizer demand
depends on global economic conditions, weather patterns, the level of global
grain stocks relative to consumption and farm sector income. Other geopolitical
factors like temporary disruptions in fertilizer trade related to government
intervention or changes in the buying patterns of key consuming countries such
as China, India or Brazil often play a major role in shaping near-term market
fundamentals. The economics of fertilizer manufacturing play a key role in
decisions to increase or reduce capacity. Supply of fertilizers is generally
driven by available capacity and operating rates, raw material costs,
government policies and global trade.

Natural Gas Prices

Natural gas is the most
significant raw material required in the production of nitrogen fertilizers.
For example, in 2006, our natural gas purchases accounted for approximately 54%
of our total cost of sales for nitrogen fertilizers. North American natural gas
prices have increased substantially and, since 1999, have become significantly
more volatile. In 2005, North American natural gas prices reached unprecedented
levels due to the impact Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita had on an already
tight natural gas market. By the end of the first quarter of 2006, natural gas
prices moderated, returning to pre-hurricane levels. Our competitive position,
on a worldwide basis, has been negatively impacted by the higher price of North
American natural gas relative to the gas prices available to fertilizer
producers in other regions of the world.

Farmers’ Economics

The demand for fertilizer
is affected by the aggregate crop planting decisions and fertilizer application
rate decisions of individual farmers. Individual farmers make planting
decisions based largely on prospective profitability of a harvest, while the
specific varieties and amounts of fertilizer they apply depend on factors like
their current liquidity, soil conditions, weather patterns and the types of
crops planted. Fertilizer demand is expected to increase in the future in
response to increased corn acreage required to support the growing ethanol
industry.


CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

Global Trade in
Fertilizer

In addition to the relationship between global supply
and demand, profitability within a particular geographic region is determined
by the supply/demand balance within that region. Regional supply and demand can
be influenced significantly by factors affecting trade within regions. Some of
these factors include the relative cost to produce and deliver product,
relative currency values and governmental policies affecting trade and other
matters. Changes in currency values alter our cost competitiveness relative to
producers in other regions of the world.

Imports account for a significant portion of the
nitrogen fertilizer consumed in North America. Producers of nitrogen-based
fertilizers located in the Middle East, the former Soviet Union, the Republic
of Trinidad and Tobago and Venezuela are major exporters to North America.

The domestic phosphate
fertilizer industry is tied to the global market through its position as the
world’s largest exporter of DAP/MAP. Historically, China has been a major
source of demand for the U.S. phosphate fertilizer industry. China’s reliance
on imported phosphate fertilizers has decreased over the last three years as a
matter of Chinese government policy to achieve self sufficiency in these
products. However, growth in demand in other international markets, including
Latin America, India and Pakistan, has partially offset declining imports by
China.

Political and
Social Government Policies

The political and social
policies of governments around the world can result in the restriction of
imports, the subsidization of domestic producers and/or the subsidization of
exports. Due to the critical role that fertilizers play in food production, the
construction and operation of fertilizer plants often are influenced by these
political and social objectives.

Factors Affecting
Our Results

Net
Sales.

Our net sales are derived from the sale
of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers and are determined by the quantities of
nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers we sell and the selling prices we realize.
The volumes, mix and selling prices we realize are determined to a great extent
by a combination of global and regional supply and demand factors.

Cost
of Sales.

Our cost of sales includes
manufacturing costs, product purchases and distribution costs. Manufacturing
costs, the most significant element of cost of sales, consist primarily of raw
materials, maintenance, direct labor and other plant overhead expenses.
Purchased product costs primarily include the cost to buy ammonia for use in
our phosphate fertilizer business and the cost to purchase nitrogen fertilizers
to augment or replace production at our facilities. Distribution costs include
the cost of freight required to transport finished products from our plants to
our distribution facilities and storage costs prior to final shipment to
customers.

In mid-2003, we instituted a margin risk
management approach utilizing our forward pricing program (FPP), which allows
us to manage some of the risks created by the volatility of fertilizer prices
and natural gas costs. Through our FPP, we offer our customers the opportunity
to purchase product on a forward basis at prices and on delivery dates we
propose. As our customers enter into forward nitrogen fertilizer purchase
contracts with us, we lock in a substantial portion of the margin on these
sales mainly by effectively fixing the cost of natural gas, the largest and
most volatile component of our manufacturing cost, using natural gas derivative
instruments. In the third quarter of 2005 and the first quarter of 2006, due to
the increased volatility of natural gas prices, we fulfilled a significant
amount of FPP orders with a combination of inventory on hand and product
purchases rather than with manufactured product. See “—Forward Pricing Program.”
As a result of fixing the selling prices of our products under our FPP, often


CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

months in advance of their
ultimate delivery to customers, our reported selling prices and margins may
differ from market spot prices and margins available at the time of shipment.

Selling,
General and Administrative Expenses.

Our
selling, general and administrative expenses mainly consist of salaries and
other payroll-related costs for our executive, administrative, legal,
financial and marketing functions, as well as certain taxes, insurance and
professional service fees. Our selling, general and administrative expenses
have increased as a result of the consummation of our IPO. These expenses
include additional legal and corporate governance expenses, stock-based
awards, salary and payroll-related costs for additional accounting staff,
director compensation, exchange listing fees, transfer agent and stockholder-related
fees and increased premiums for director and officer liability insurance
coverage.

Other
Operating—Net.

Other operating—net includes the
costs associated with our closed Bartow phosphate facility and other costs that
do not relate directly to our central operations. Bartow facility costs include
provisions for phosphogypsum stack and cooling pond closure costs, water
treatment costs and costs associated with the cessation of operations. The term
“other costs” refers to amounts recorded for environmental remediation for
other areas of our business, litigation expenses, gains and losses on the sale
of fixed assets and impairment charges for goodwill.

Interest
Expense.

Our interest expense includes the
interest on our long-term debt and notes payable, annual fees on our senior
secured revolving credit facility and amortization of the related fees required
to execute financing agreements.

Interest
Income.

Our interest income represents amounts
earned on our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments.

Minority
Interest.

Amounts reported as minority interest
represent the 34% minority interest in the net operating results of CFL, our
consolidated Canadian joint venture. We own 49% of the voting common stock of
CFL and 66% of CFL’s non-voting preferred stock. Two of our pre-IPO owners own
17% of CFL’s voting common stock, including GROWMARK which owns 9%. The
remaining 34% of the voting common stock and non-voting preferred stock of CFL
is held by Westco. We designate four members of CFL’s nine-member board of
directors, which also has one member designated by each of our two pre-IPO
owners that own an interest in CFL and three members designated by Westco.

We operate the Medicine Hat facility and purchase
approximately 66% of the facility’s ammonia and urea production, pursuant to a
management agreement and a product purchase agreement. Both the management
agreement and the product purchase agreement can be terminated by either us or
CFL upon a twelve-month notice. Westco has the right, but not the
obligation, to purchase the remaining 34% of the facility’s ammonia and urea
production under a similar product purchase agreement. To the extent that
Westco does not purchase its 34% of the facility’s production, we are obligated
to purchase any remaining amounts. Since 1995, however, Westco has purchased at
least 34% of the facility’s production each year.

Under the product purchase agreements, both we and
Westco pay the greater of operating cost or market price for purchases.
However, the product purchase agreements also provide that CFL will distribute
its net earnings to us and Westco annually based on the respective quantities
of product purchased from CFL. The distributions to Westco are reported as
financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows, as we
consider these payments to be similar to dividends.

Our
product purchase agreement also requires us to advance funds to CFL in the
event that CFL is unable to meet its debts as they become due. The amount of
each advance would be at least 66% of the deficiency and would be more in any
year in which we purchased more than 66% of Medicine Hat’s production. We and
Westco currently manage CFL such that each party is responsible for its share
of CFL’s fixed costs and that CFL ‘s production volume meets the parties’
combined requirements. The management agreement, the product


CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

purchase agreements and
any other agreements related to CFL are subject to change with the consent of
both parties.

Impairment
of Investments in Unconsolidated Subsidiaries.

Impairment
of investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries represents the write-down of the
carrying value of our investments in our joint ventures.

Income
Taxes.

Upon the completion of our IPO, CF
Industries, Inc. ceased to be a nonexempt cooperative for federal income
tax purposes. On the date of our IPO, CF Industries, Inc. had a deferred
tax asset related to net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs) generated from
business conducted with CF Industries, Inc.’s pre-IPO owners. These net
operating loss carryforwards totaled $250 million, with expirations
ranging from 2021 through 2023. The income tax provision for the year ended December 31,
2005 includes a charge of $99.9 million to establish a 100% valuation
allowance for the deferred tax asset related to these NOLs. The valuation
allowance is required because there is substantial uncertainty under existing
tax law whether any tax benefits from this deferred tax asset will be realized
since CF Industries, Inc. is no longer a cooperative for federal income
tax purposes.

In connection with the IPO, we entered into a net
operating loss agreement with CF Industries, Inc.’s pre-IPO owners (NOL
Agreement) relating to the future treatment of the pre-IPO NOLs. Under the NOL
Agreement, if it is finally determined that CF Industries, Inc.’s net
operating loss carryforwards can be utilized subsequent to the IPO, we will pay
to CF Industries, Inc.’s pre-IPO owners an amount equal to the resulting
federal and state income taxes actually saved.

CFL operates as a cooperative for Canadian income tax
purposes and distributes all of its earnings as patronage dividends to its
customers, including CF Industries, Inc. For Canadian income tax purposes,
CFL is permitted to deduct an amount equal to the patronage dividends it
distributes to its customers, provided that certain requirements are met. As a
result, CFL records no income tax provision.

On May 13, 2005, the Canadian Income Tax Act was
amended to disallow the deduction of certain patronage distributions paid after
March 22, 2004 to non-arms-length persons. In the settlement of CFL’s
audit for the tax years 1997 through 2000, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA)
agreed that CFL has operated at arms-length with CF Industries with respect to
the deductibility of patronage payments to CF Industries for the 2004 taxation
year, and the Company believes it has continued to operate on an arms-length
basis.

Although CFL is not currently under audit by the
Canadian tax authorities, CFL received a preliminary inquiry from the CRA in
2005, which questioned whether CFL’s past patronage distributions had met the
requirements for full deductibility under Canadian income tax law. While CFL
believes its distributions complied with applicable law, CFL could be subject
to material Canadian income tax liabilities if its distributions were
determined to fail to meet the requirements for deductibility under Canadian
tax law.

Equity
in Earnings of Unconsolidated Subsidiaries—Net of Taxes.

Consolidated Operating Results

In 2006, the domestic
nitrogen fertilizer industry was characterized by adverse conditions early in
the year remaining from the 2005 hurricane effects, more moderate conditions
through the fall and strength late in the year fueled by lower natural gas
prices, a tight international market and expectations of a strong planting
season in the spring of 2007. The first half of 2006 was unfavorably impacted
by high natural gas prices during the first quarter of the year and reduced
demand during the spring planting season. Results during 2006 for our phosphate
fertilizer business were affected positively by increased domestic demand and
relatively balanced international supply/demand conditions. Our total gross
margin decreased by approximately $62.0 million, or 30%, to $147.2 million
for 2006 compared to a gross margin of $209.2 million for 2005. The net
earnings of $33.3 million for 2006 included a pre-tax charge of
$30.7 million for unrealized mark-to-market losses on natural gas
derivatives and a pre-tax charge of $21.6 million for adjustments to AROs
and demolition costs primarily related to our closed Bartow, Florida complex.
The net loss of $39.0 million for 2005 included a $99.9 million charge
to record a valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset related to CF
Industries, Inc.’s net operating loss carryforwards generated during
pre-IPO operations, a $28.3 million loss on the extinguishment of debt, a
gain of approximately $14.0 million associated with the early termination
of certain natural gas hedge positions, a pre-tax charge of $9.3 million
for unrealized mark-to-market losses on natural gas derivatives, a pre-tax
charge of $12.8 million for upward adjustments to AROs primarily related
to our closed Bartow, Florida complex and a $6.1 million tax benefit from
a refund of Canadian income taxes.

Net Sales

Our net sales were
$1.9 billion for both 2006 and 2005. Higher average selling prices for
ammonia and phosphate fertilizers in 2006 were offset by lower nitrogen
fertilizer sales volumes. Our total sales volume of 8.4 million tons for
2006 approximated the volume sold in 2005. Nitrogen fertilizer sales volume
decreased 119,000 tons, or 2%, to 6.3 million tons for 2006 compared
to 6.4 million tons in 2005, due primarily to the cessation of production
by U.S. Agri-Chemicals to whom we had sold ammonia previously. Our total level
of phosphate fertilizer sales of 2.1 million tons for 2006 approximated
the amount sold in 2005. Nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer prices for 2006
averaged 2% and 6% higher, respectively, than the prices for similar products
in 2005.

Cost of Sales

Total cost of sales of our
nitrogen fertilizers averaged $217 per ton for 2006 compared to $202 per ton in
2005, an increase of 7%, primarily due to higher natural gas costs and higher
purchased product costs.


CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

Phosphate
fertilizer cost of sales averaged $207 per ton for 2006 compared to $200 per
ton in the prior year, an increase of 4%, mainly due to higher ammonia and
sulfur costs.

During 2006, we sold
approximately 3.0 million tons of fertilizer under our FPP, representing
approximately 36% of our total fertilizer sales volume for the period. In 2005,
we sold approximately 5.2 million tons of fertilizer under this program,
representing approximately 62% of our total fertilizer sales volume for the
period. The lower level of FPP sales volumes in 2006 reflected the hesitancy of
our customers during the last half of 2005 and the first half of 2006 to make
commitments during the uncertain fertilizer pricing environment prevalent
during those periods.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and
administrative expenses decreased 4% to $54.5 million in 2006 compared to
$57.0 million in 2005. The year-over-year decrease in expense for 2006
resulted largely from the absence of expenses related to our August 2005
IPO, including expenses associated with the termination of a long-term
incentive plan upon completion of our IPO. This decrease was partially offset
by additional stock-based compensation expense and additional administrative
expenses associated with being a publicly held company, both incurred in 2006.

Other Operating—Net

Other operating—net
increased to $21.4 million in 2006 from $14.1 million in 2005. On an
annual basis, we review all aspects of the closed Bartow complex with respect
to asset retirement obligations (AROs) and other plant site closure related
activities. As a result of our 2006 review, we have revised our estimates for
water treatment and phosphogypsum stack system closure costs, as well as costs
to close the Bartow plant site. Additional costs are expected to be incurred to
treat water, mainly in 2007 and 2008, to accommodate closure of the cooling
pond. Phosphogypsum stack system closure costs associated with the cooling
channel are expected to increase due to additional closure work and higher
costs for previously identified activities. We also expect to incur additional
costs related to site closure activities, including closure of wastewater
treatment systems as well as storm water management. Consequently, we recorded
a charge of $14.9 million, primarily in the fourth quarter of 2006, to
reflect these revised estimates. We also recorded a $3.3 million charge,
again primarily in the fourth quarter of 2006, for additional planned demolition
activities at Bartow. In 2005, $11.1 million of adjustments to Bartow
phosphogypsum stack asset retirement costs were recorded as a result of revised
engineering estimates prepared in connection with the preparation of a revised
closure plan for the Plant City phosphogypsum stack and cooling pond system.
For a detailed explanation of the accounting for AROs at Bartow, please refer
to Note 9 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8,
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Interest—Net

Net interest income
increased to $9.6 million in 2006 from $0.6 million in 2005. Interest
expense decreased 79% to $2.9 million in 2006 from $14.0 million in
2005, due to the full repayment of our term notes, out of our cash and
short-term investments, in the third quarter of 2005. This decrease was
partially offset by $1.0 million of interest expense in the second quarter
of 2006 related to a Canadian tax matter. Interest income decreased to
$12.5 million in 2006 from $14.6 million in 2005 as higher average
rates of return were more than offset by lower average balances of invested
cash.

Minority Interest

Amounts reported as
minority interest represent the interest of the 34% minority holder of CFL’s
common and preferred shares. The increase in 2006 was due to improved 2006 CFL
operating results. The improvement in CFL operating results reflects stronger
market conditions for nitrogen fertilizers produced in Canada.


CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

Income Taxes

Our income tax provision
for 2006 was $19.7 million, or an effective tax rate of 37.2%. This
compared with a tax provision of $128.7 million on pre-tax earnings for
2005. For 2005, the income tax provision of $128.7 million included the
following items: income tax expense of $35.4 million on earnings before
income taxes; a charge of $99.9 million to establish a valuation
allowance, as previously discussed; a tax benefit of $0.5 million for
adjustments to prior years’ tax returns; and a tax benefit related to a
Canadian income tax refund of $6.1 million. Our effective tax rate
(exclusive of the $99.9 million non-cash charge and the $6.1 million
refund of Canadian income taxes) was 37.7%. The decrease in the effective tax
rate on earnings before income taxes results principally from lower state
income taxes.

Year Ended
December 31, 2005 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2004

In 2005, the domestic
nitrogen fertilizer industry, which benefited from tight global supply
conditions through most of the year, was adversely impacted by rising natural
gas prices in the third and fourth quarters of the year. The domestic phosphate
fertilizer industry continued to show improvement due primarily to strong
export demand earlier in 2005 and a tighter domestic supply/demand balance in
the second half of the year due to hurricane-related production
curtailments. Our total gross margin decreased by approximately
$6.9 million, or 3%, to $209.2 million in 2005 from
$216.1 million in 2004 due largely to deteriorating nitrogen fertilizer
market conditions in the latter part of the year, partially offset by increased
selling prices for phosphate fertilizers. The net loss of $39.0 million in
2005 included a $99.9 million charge to record a valuation allowance
against the deferred tax asset related to our net operating loss carryforwards
generated during our pre-IPO operations as a cooperative, a $6.1 million
refund of Canadian income taxes, the cumulative effect of a change in
accounting principle related to our accounting for conditional asset retirement
obligations that reduced net earnings by $2.8 million, a
$28.3 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt, a gain of
approximately $14.0 million on our derivatives due to the early
termination of hedge positions recognized in the third quarter, an increase of
$11.1 million in Bartow phosphogypsum stack asset retirement obligations
related to revised engineering cost estimates, and $9.3 million of
unrealized mark-to-market losses on natural gas derivatives.

Net Sales

Our net sales increased
16% to $1.9 billion in 2005 compared to $1.7 billion in 2004, due to
higher average selling prices and an increase in phosphate fertilizer sales
volumes, partially offset by a decrease in nitrogen fertilizer sales volumes.
Nitrogen fertilizer prices in 2005 averaged 19% higher than the prices for
similar products in the comparable period of 2004 reflecting strong demand and
tight supply. Phosphate fertilizer prices in 2005 were 10% higher than
corresponding prices in 2004, resulting primarily from strong international
demand during the first half of the year and tight domestic supply during the
second half of 2005. Our total annual sales volume was 8.4 million tons in
2005 compared to 8.5 million tons in 2004, as a 109,000 ton increase in
the volume of phosphate fertilizers sold in 2005 was more than offset by a
174,000 ton decrease in nitrogen fertilizer sales volume.

Cost of Sales

Total cost of sales of our nitrogen fertilizers
averaged $202 per ton in 2005 compared to $164 per ton in 2004, an increase of
23%, primarily due to higher natural gas prices as well as higher purchased
product costs. Phosphate fertilizer cost of sales averaged $200 per ton in 2005
compared to $187 per ton in the prior year, an increase of 7%, mainly due to
higher phosphate rock and ammonia costs.


CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

Selling, General
and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and
administrative expenses increased 36% to $57.0 million in 2005 compared to
$41.8 million in 2004. The $15.2 million increase in 2005 was largely
due to increased administrative expenses related to completion of our initial
public offering ($6.5 million), our long-term incentive plan
($3.3 million), including expenses associated with the termination of the
plan upon completion of our initial public offering, and compensation expense
associated with our stock-based awards ($3.2 million).

Other Operating—Net

Other operating—net
decreased to $14.1 million in 2005 from $25.1 million in 2004. The
$11.0 million decrease was due primarily to a $4.6 million decrease
in costs related to the Bartow facility in 2005 compared to 2004,
$2.2 million of gains realized in 2005 on the sales of a previously idled
distribution terminal and excess land at our Bartow complex, and a
$3.4 million provision recorded in 2004 for environmental remediation requirements
at our Ahoskie, North Carolina nitrogen facility, which has been closed for 23
years. An $11.8 million charge was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2004
for future expenditures to treat water at Bartow and other Bartow environmental
remediation requirements. Prior to that time, Bartow water treatment costs were
expensed as incurred. A decrease in recurring Bartow water treatment expense in
2005 was partially offset by $11.1 million of adjustments to Bartow
phosphogypsum stack asset retirement obligations as a result of revised
engineering cost estimates. The decrease in recurring Bartow water treatment
expense in 2005 was due to the accounting treatment prior to the fourth quarter
of 2004. For a detailed explanation of the accounting for water treatment costs
at Bartow, please refer to Note 9 of our consolidated financial statements
included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Interest—Net

Interest-net swung to
$0.6 million of net interest income in 2005 from $16.8 million of net
expense in 2004. Interest expense decreased 38% to $14.0 million in 2005
from $22.7 million in 2004, primarily due to lower average debt
outstanding in 2005. The decrease in debt outstanding in 2005 was due to
scheduled principal payments as well as the full repayment of our term notes.
Interest income more than doubled to $14.6 million in 2005 from
$5.9 million in 2004 as a result of higher average rates of return and, to
a lesser extent, higher average balances of invested cash.

Loss on
Extinguishment of Debt

The $28.3 million
loss on extinguishment of debt in 2005 consists of a $26.4 million penalty
associated with the prepayment of our term notes and the write-off of
$1.9 million of unamortized financing fees related to our long-term
debt and our previous senior secured revolving credit facility.

Minority Interest

Amounts reported as
minority interest represent the interest of the 34% minority holder of CFL’s
common and preferred shares. The decrease in 2005 was due to reduced CFL
operating results. The deterioration in CFL operating results reflects weaker
market conditions for nitrogen fertilizers, particularly in the latter half of
2005.

Income Taxes

Our income tax provision
in 2005 included a non-cash charge of $99.9 million recorded in the third
quarter, as previously discussed, a $6.1 million refund of Canadian income
taxes received in the third quarter as well as the normal provision for income
taxes on earnings. Our effective tax rate (exclusive of


CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

the
$99.9 million non-cash charge and the $6.1 million refund of Canadian
income taxes) was approximately 38% in both 2005 and 2004. An increase in our
2005 effective tax rate due to the tax effect of expenses associated with our
initial public offering, which are not deductible for income tax purposes, was
offset by a tax benefit for adjustments for prior years’ tax returns.

Cumulative Effect
of a Change in Accounting Principle—Net of Taxes

In the fourth quarter of 2005, we recorded additional
asset retirement obligations due to implementation of FASB Interpretation (FIN)
No. 47—

Accounting for Conditional Asset
Retirement Obligations

and recorded a related charge for the
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. The cumulative effect of
a change in accounting principle reduced net earnings in 2005 by
$2.8 million. For a discussion of the cumulative effect of a change in
accounting principle, please see the “Overview” section of this discussion and
analysis.

Year Ended December 31,
2006 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2005

Net
Sales.

Nitrogen
fertilizer net sales were $1.5 billion for both 2006 and 2005, as higher
average ammonia selling prices were, for the most part, offset by lower sales
volume. Nitrogen fertilizer sales volume decreased 2% to 6.3 million tons
in 2006 compared to 6.4 million tons in 2005. Ammonia and UAN sales
volumes decreased by 11% and 3%, respectively, for 2006 compared to the prior
year while urea sales volume increased by 4%. Ammonia sales volumes decreased
due primarily to lower sales from our Tampa terminal due to U.S.
Agri-Chemicals, a former customer, ceasing phosphate operations in 2005.
Increases in industry consumption in the fall in anticipation of strong corn
and wheat prices offset a spring during which the industry experienced fewer
corn acres planted and reduced application rates. The decrease in UAN sales
compared to sales for 2005 was due primarily to less corn acreage planted and
reduced demand in the southern portion of the country due to drought
conditions, both experienced during the first half of 2006. The impact of these
factors was partially offset by strong summer and fall fill demand resulting
from the anticipation of a stronger UAN market later in 2006 and into the
spring of 2007. Ammonia sales prices increased by 14% for 2006 compared to the
prior year, primarily due to tight world market conditions and strong fourth
quarter domestic demand.

Cost
of Sales.

Total
cost of sales of our nitrogen fertilizers averaged $217 per ton for 2006,
compared to $202 per ton for 2005, an increase of 7%, largely due to
unfavorable variances related to natural gas derivatives and higher purchased
product costs. While the overall weighted average cost of natural gas supplied
to our Donaldsonville facility and CFL’s Medicine Hat facility decreased by 1%
for 2006 versus the cost in 2005, the favorable effect of this variance was
more than offset by the impact of the realized losses on natural gas
derivatives immediately recognized in cost of sales. We recognized
$30.7 million of unrealized mark-to-market losses on derivatives in 2006
compared to $9.3 million in 2005 due to our discontinuing hedge accounting
in the last quarter of 2005, and the decline in natural gas prices that occurred
during the respective periods. We also recorded approximately
$14.0 million of hedge gains in 2005, mainly in the third quarter. The
costs of finished fertilizer products purchased for resale were approximately $8.9 million
higher in 2006 than in 2005 due to the overall increase in nitrogen fertilizer
prices as well as an increase in the amount of sales volume supported by
purchased products, both factors mainly occurring during the first six months
of 2006. See the “Overview” section of this discussion and analysis for
additional information about the impact of accounting for our natural gas
derivatives.

During 2006, we sold
approximately 2.7 million tons of nitrogen fertilizers under our FPP,
representing approximately 44% of our nitrogen fertilizer sales volume for the
period. In 2005, we sold approximately 4.5 million tons of nitrogen
fertilizers under this program, representing approximately 70% of our nitrogen
fertilizer sales volume for the period. The lower level of FPP sales volumes in
2006 reflected the hesitancy of our customers during the last half of 2005 and
the first half of 2006 to make commitments during the uncertain fertilizer
pricing environment prevalent during those respective periods.

Year Ended December 31,
2005 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2004

Net
Sales.

Nitrogen fertilizer net sales increased
15% to $1.5 billion in 2005 compared to $1.3 billion in 2004, as
higher average selling prices more than offset a decrease in sales volume.
Ammonia, urea and UAN sales prices increased by 14%, 21% and 18%, respectively,
in 2005 compared to the prior year. The increase in ammonia prices in the first
half of 2005 was due to strong U.S. demand and tight supply conditions in
midwestern U.S. markets. During the last half of 2005, the sharp increase in
natural gas prices and the resulting drop in domestic production caused ammonia
prices to increase. Urea prices increased in 2005 due to a tight world market
caused by plant outages abroad, reduced domestic production resulting from
higher natural gas prices and the impact of increased buying related to demand
that had been deferred from previous periods. An improved overall nitrogen
fertilizer market earlier in


CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

2005, combined with tight
supplies resulting from reduced domestic production later in the year because
of higher natural gas prices, supported higher UAN selling prices in 2005. Our
nitrogen fertilizer sales volume decreased 3% in 2005 to 6.4 million tons
as compared to 6.6 million tons sold in 2004. Although both ammonia and
UAN sales volumes decreased by 4% from 2004, urea sales volume was comparable
to the prior year. The decrease in ammonia sales volume was primarily due to
the loss of sales out of our Tampa, Florida terminal due to the loss of a key
customer. UAN sales volume declined in 2005 due to reduced supply availability
resulting from scheduled plant turnarounds and production and shipping
disruptions caused by two hurricanes.

Cost
of Sales.

Total cost of sales of nitrogen
fertilizers averaged $202 per ton in 2005 compared to $164 per ton in 2004, an
increase of 23%, largely due to higher natural gas prices, higher purchased
product costs and unrealized mark-to-market losses, partially offset by the
favorable impact of the early termination of certain natural gas hedge
positions associated with our forward pricing program. The overall weighted
average cost of natural gas supplied to our Donaldsonville and CFL’s Medicine
Hat facilities increased by 29% in 2005 versus the cost in 2004, mainly due to
continued tight market conditions for natural gas and the impact of the two
gulf hurricanes. Purchased product costs were approximately $57.3 million
higher in 2005 than in 2004, due to additional quantities purchased to meet
sales commitments as well as the overall increase in nitrogen fertilizer prices
previously discussed. As previously mentioned, we recognized as a reduction of
cost of sales in the third quarter of 2005, a gain of approximately $14.0 million
which arose from the early termination of FPP-related natural gas positions. We
also recognized $9.3 million of unrealized mark-to-market losses on
derivatives in the fourth quarter of 2005 as an increase in cost of sales due
to our discontinuation of hedge accounting. See the “Overview” section of this
discussion and analysis for additional information about the impact of
accounting for our natural gas derivatives.

During 2005, we sold
approximately 4.5 million tons of nitrogen fertilizer under our forward
pricing program, representing approximately 70% of our nitrogen fertilizer
sales volume. In 2004, we sold approximately 3.6 million tons of nitrogen
fertilizers under this program, representing approximately 54% of our nitrogen
fertilizer sales volume for the year.

Year Ended December 31,
2006 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2005

Net
Sales.

Phosphate
fertilizer net sales increased 10% to $482.3 million for 2006 compared to
$438.7 million in 2005, due to higher average selling prices and increased
sales volumes. Average phosphate fertilizer prices during 2006 increased by 6%
compared to prices in 2005 due to the impact of increased domestic demand on
what was already a relatively tight supply/demand balance. Our total level of
phosphate fertilizer sales volumes of 2.1 million tons in 2006 increased
by 4% over the prior year’s level due primarily to stronger domestic demand for
DAP during the second half of the year. During the fourth quarter of 2006, we
made our first DAP export sales through Phoschem, an export association
representing North American phosphate producers. We joined Phoschem in October of
2006. Phoschem is presently our primary means of exporting phosphate fertilizer
products. Approximately 22% of our 2006 fourth quarter phosphate fertilizer net
sales were made through Phoschem.

Cost
of Sales.

Phosphate
cost of sales averaged $207 per ton for 2006 compared to $200 per ton for 2005.
The 4% increase was mainly due to higher ammonia and sulfur costs. Ammonia
prices increased by 6% during 2006 compared to 2005, reflecting stronger global
market conditions through the first half of 2006. Sulfur costs increased by 3%
for 2006 compared to 2005. The increase, mainly occurring in the first


CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

six months of 2006,
reflected the lingering impact of supply disruptions that occurred in 2005 due
to hurricane activity.

During 2006, we sold
approximately 294,000 tons of phosphate fertilizers under our FPP, representing
approximately 14% of our phosphate fertilizer sales volume for the period. In
2005, we sold approximately 718,000 tons of phosphate fertilizers under this
program, representing approximately 36% of our phosphate fertilizer sales
volume for the period. The lower level of FPP sales volumes in 2006 reflected
the hesitancy of our customers during the last half of 2005 and the first half
of 2006 to make commitments during the uncertain fertilizer pricing environment
prevalent during those respective periods.

Year Ended December 31,
2005 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2004

Net
Sales.

Phosphate fertilizer net sales increased
16% to $438.7 million in 2005 compared to $376.8 million in 2004, due
to a combination of higher average selling prices and increased sales volume.
Our total level of phosphate fertilizer sales of 2.0 million tons in 2005
represented an increase of 6% compared to 2004. Within our total phosphate
fertilizer sales, sales of DAP/MAP to domestic customers increased by 14%,
totaling 1.4 million tons in 2005, compared to 1.2 million tons in
2004. The increase in sales to domestic customers in 2005 as compared to 2004
is due to increased market penetration. Average phosphate fertilizer prices in
2005 increased by 10% compared to prices in 2004, due largely to strong
international phosphate fertilizer demand in the first half of the year, as
well as the impact of domestic industry production cuts occurring mainly over
the second half of 2005.

Cost of Sales.

Phosphate
cost of sales averaged $200 per ton in 2005 compared to $187 per ton in 2004.
The 7% increase was mainly due to higher phosphate rock costs and higher
ammonia costs. Phosphate rock costs increased by 17% in 2005 compared to 2004
due primarily to increased costs resulting from less favorable mining
conditions over the first six months of 2005. Ammonia prices increased by 10%
in 2005 compared to 2004, reflecting stronger global market conditions mainly
in the last three quarters of 2005.

Liquidity and
Capital Resources

Our primary sources of
cash are operating cash flow, which includes customer advances, and our senior
secured revolving credit facility. Our primary uses of cash are operating
costs, working capital needs, capital expenditures and dividends. Our working
capital requirements are affected by several factors, including demand for our
products, selling prices for our products, raw material costs, freight costs
and seasonality factors inherent in the business.

Cash Balances

As of December 31,
2006, we had cash and cash equivalents of $25.4 million, short-term
investments of $300.2 million and a $102.7 million current liability
attributable to customer advances related to cash deposits received under our
forward pricing program. As of December 31, 2005, the comparable amounts
were $37.4 million, $179.3 million and $131.6 million,
respectively. Our short-term investments consist of available-for-sale auction
rate securities that are reported at fair value. We believe that our cash, cash
equivalents and short-term investments, our operating cash flows, and credit
available under our senior secured revolving credit facility are adequate to
fund our cash requirements for the foreseeable future. As of December 31,
2006 and December 31, 2005, we had $176.4 million and $192.6 million
available, respectively, under our senior secured revolving credit facility.


CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

Debt

Notes payable, representing amounts owed by CFL to its
minority interest holder with respect to advances, were $4.2 million as of
December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005. There were no outstanding
borrowings or letters of credit under out $250 million senior secured
revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2006 or December 31,
2005.

On August 16, 2005, we replaced our
$140 million senior secured revolving credit facility with a new
$250 million senior secured revolving credit facility. The senior secured
revolving credit facility bears interest at a variable rate and is available
through August 16, 2010. This facility is secured by working capital,
certain equipment and the Donaldsonville nitrogen fertilizer complex. The
credit facility provides up to $250 million, subject to a borrowing base,
for working capital and general corporate purposes, including up to
$50 million for the issuance of letters of credit. There was
$176.4 million of available credit under the senior secured revolving
credit facility and no outstanding borrowings or letters of credit as of December 31,
2006.

On August 17, 2005,
we repaid in full $235.6 million of our outstanding term notes, plus
associated prepayment penalties and accrued interest in the amount of
$29.3 million, with cash on hand and by liquidating short-term
investments.

Capital Spending

Capital expenditures are
made to sustain our asset base, to increase our capacity and to improve plant
efficiency. In response to the difficult industry environment prior to 2004, we
had deferred non-essential capital expenditures whenever it was possible to do
so without compromising the operational integrity of our facilities or the
safety of our employees. The $10.1 million decrease in capital
expenditures in 2006 as compared to 2005 related primarily to greater plant
turnaround activity during 2005. We expect to spend approximately $110 million
to $120 million on capital expenditures in both 2007 and 2008. The
projection for 2007 includes spending carried over from projects initiated in
2006. These amounts also include approximately $24 million in 2007 and $14 million
in 2008 for capital expenditures at CFL, of which we are obligated to fund 66%.

Financial Assurance Requirements

In addition to various operational and environmental
regulations related to our phosphate fertilizer business, we are subject to
financial assurance requirements. Previously, these financial assurance
requirements were satisfied without the need for any advance expenditure of
corporate funds provided our financial statements met certain criteria,
referred to as the financial tests. However, pursuant to a 2005 amendment to
the Florida regulations governing financial assurance related to the closure of
phosphogypsum stacks, we established an escrow account to meet such future
obligations in order to take advantage of a safe harbor provision in the
regulations that would obviate the need for us to meet the financial test
criteria in the future. In March of 2006, we contributed
$11.1 million to this escrow account, which by rule is earmarked to
cover the closure, long-term maintenance, and monitoring costs for our
phosphosgypsum stacks, as well as any costs incurred to manage the water
contained in the stack system upon closure. In the first quarter of 2007, we
expect to contribute another $9.4 million. Over the next nine years, we
expect to contribute between $4.0 million and $7.0 million annually
based upon the required funding formula as defined in the regulations and an
assumed rate of return of 4% on invested funds. The amount of money that will
accumulate in the account by the year 2016, including interest earned on
invested funds, is currently estimated to be approximately $85 million.
After 2016, contributions to the account are estimated to average less than
$1.0 million annually for the following 17 years. The balance in the
account is estimated to be approximately $170 million by 2033. The amounts
recognized as expense in


CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

operations pertaining to
our phosphogypsum stack closure and land reclamation are determined and
accounted for on an accrual basis as described in Note 9 to our consolidated
financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data. These expense amounts are expected to differ from the
anticipated contributions to the account, which are based on the guidelines set
forth in the Florida regulations. Ultimately, the cash in this account will be
used to settle the asset retirement obligations.

Additionally, Florida
regulations require mining companies to demonstrate financial responsibility
for wetland and other surface water mitigation measures in advance of any
mining activities. We will be required to demonstrate financial responsibility
for wetland and other surface-water-mitigation measures in advance of any
mining activities, if and when we are able to expand our Hardee mining
activities to areas not currently permitted. The demonstration of financial
responsibility by mining companies in Florida may be provided by passing a
financial test or by establishing a cash deposit arrangement. Based on these
current regulations, we will have the option to demonstrate financial
responsibility in Florida utilizing either of these methods.

Forward Pricing Program (FPP)

We offer a FPP to our customers under which product
may be ordered for future delivery, with a significant portion of the sales
proceeds generally being collected before the product is shipped, thereby
reducing or eliminating the accounts receivable related to such sales. As of December 31,
2006 and December 31, 2005, we had approximately $102.7 million and
$131.6 million, respectively, in customer advances on our consolidated
balance sheet. As of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, we had
approximately 1.7 million tons of product and 1.2 million tons of
product, respectively, committed to be sold under the FPP. Most of this product
was scheduled to ship within 150 days of December 31, 2006 and December 31,
2005, respectively.

While customer advances were a significant source of
liquidity in both 2006 and 2005, the level of sales under the FPP is affected
by many factors, including current market conditions and our customers’
perceptions of future market fundamentals. The lower level as of December 31,
2005 reflected the hesitancy of our customers to make commitments in the
uncertain fertilizer pricing environment prevalent during that reporting
period.

The level of our customers’
participation in our FPP may vary over time. Should the level of participation
decrease, there is a risk of increased volatility in the operating earnings of
future periods. If the level of sales under the FPP were to decrease in the
future, our cash received from customer advances would likely decrease, and our
accounts receivable balances would likely increase. Also, borrowing under our
senior secured revolving credit facility could become necessary. Due to the
volatility inherent in our business and changing customer expectations, we
cannot estimate the amount of future FPP sales activity.

Other Liquidity Requirements

We paid cash dividends of $4.4 million on
outstanding common stock during 2006. This amount represents an annual rate
equal to $0.08 per share. We expect to pay quarterly dividends at such a rate
for the foreseeable future. Under certain conditions, our $250 million
senior secured revolving credit facility limits our ability to pay dividends.

We also funded
contributions to our U.S. and Canadian pension plans totaling $8.6 million
in 2006. We expect to contribute $5.6 million to our pension plans in
2007.


CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

Cash Flows

Operating
Activities

Year Ended December 31,
2006 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2005

Net cash generated from operating activities in 2006
was $203.6 million compared to $137.2 million in 2005. The
$66.4 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2006
was primarily due to $95.6 million less cash used to fund working capital
in 2006. Other major factors affecting operating cash flow during 2006 were a
$66.8 million decrease in operating earnings, partially offset by the
adjustment for the $21.4 million non-cash effect of unrealized losses on
derivatives. The $95.6 million reduction in cash used to fund working
capital is the difference between $9.5 million used in 2006 and
$105.1 million consumed in 2005. During 2006, accounts receivable
increased by $61.3 million and customer advances decreased by
$28.9 million, resulting in a net use of cash of $90.2 million, which
was partially offset by a $51.6 million decrease in inventories and a
$17.1 million decrease in margin deposits. The increase in accounts
receivable was primarily due to more volume shipped under normal commercial
terms. A significant portion of the sales proceeds for volumes shipped under
the FPP is generally received prior to shipment. The decrease in customer
advances was due primarily to changes in the product mix of outstanding orders
and lower per-unit contract prices. The decrease in inventories reflects lower
per-unit nitrogen fertilizers manufacturing cost and lower quantities of
phosphate fertilizers held at December 31, 2006. The decrease in margin
deposits was primarily due to lower margin requirements. The use of
$105.1 million in cash in 2005 for working capital changes was primarily
due to a $79.9 million decrease in customer advances and a
$14.8 million change in net product exchanges assets. The decrease in
customer advances was primarily due to lower levels of forward sales on order
as of December 31, 2005 as compared to December 31, 2004.

On the consolidated
balance sheets as of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, a
portion of the spare parts inventory has been reclassified from inventory to
other noncurrent assets, based on our expectations of when these parts will be
utilized. On the consolidated statements of cash flows, corresponding reclassifications
have been made to inventory and other-net in operating activities.

Year Ended December 31,
2005 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2004

Net cash generated from operating activities in 2005
was $137.2 million compared to $344.2 million in 2004. The
$207.0 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2005
was primarily due to a $206.4 million increase in cash used to fund
working capital. Net changes in working capital consumed $105.1 million of
cash in 2005 compared to $101.3 million of cash generated by working
capital reductions in 2004. During 2005, accounts receivable increased by
$9.2 million, inventories increased by $10.3 million, net product
exchange assets increased by $14.8 million and customer advances decreased
by $79.9 million, resulting in a net use of cash of $114.2 million,
which was partially offset by a $10.2 million decrease in margin deposits.
The increase in accounts receivable was due to higher selling prices in December of
2005 versus December of 2004 and reduced sales volume shipped under the
forward pricing program for which a substantial portion of the sales proceeds
is generally received prior to shipment. The increase in inventories was due to
higher per unit manufacturing costs and increased prices for purchased
products, which were partially offset by reduced quantities held at December 31,
2005. The decrease in customer advances was primarily due to lower levels of
forward sales on order as of December 31, 2005 as compared to December 31,
2004. The $101.3 million of cash generated by changes in working capital
in 2004 was primarily due to a $45.5 million increase in customer
advances, a $41.4 million decrease in accounts receivable and a
$44.1 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses. The
increase in customer advances in 2004 was due primarily to higher levels of
forward sales on order as of December 31, 2004 as compared to December 31,
2003. The decrease in accounts receivable was due primarily to an


CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

increase in sales volume
shipped under the forward pricing program for which a substantial portion of
the sales proceeds is generally received prior to shipment. The increased
accounts payable and accrued expenses were largely related to higher trade
credit obligations to our gas suppliers, reflecting higher natural gas prices.

On the consolidated
balance sheets as of December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, amounts
owed and due from product exchanges have been reclassified from a net amount in
inventory to current assets and current liabilities to conform to the 2005 presentation.
On the consolidated statements of cash flows for 2005 and 2004, corresponding
adjustments have been made to inventory and product exchanges—net. These
reclassifications had no impact on previously reported net income (loss) or
cash flow from operations.

Investing
Activities

Years Ended December 31,
2006, 2005 and 2004

Net cash used in investing
activities was $191.3 million in 2006, as compared to net cash provided by
investing activities of $139.3 million in 2005 and net cash used in
investing activities of $309.3 million in 2004. The $330.6 million
swing in cash used in investing activities in 2006, as well as the change from
2004 to 2005, were primarily due to the liquidation of short-term investments
for the $235.6 million prepayment of our term notes in 2005, as previously
discussed. The level of short-term investments, generally auction rate
securities that we liquidate as required over periods ranging from three to
twelve months, is dictated by our current cash position and estimated future
liquidity requirements. Additions to property, plant and equipment-net accounted
for $59.3 million, $69.4 million, and $33.7 million of cash used
in investing activities in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decrease in
additions to property, plant and equipment-net in 2006 was due primarily to a
$15.5 million decrease in deferred plant turnaround costs incurred during
2006 as compared to 2005. In 2005, additions to property, plant and
equipment-net were greater than 2004 due primarily to a $23.6 million
increase in deferred plant turnaround costs incurred. We contributed $11.1 million
in March of 2006 to our asset retirement obligation escrow account. The
$18.6 million of proceeds from sale of unconsolidated subsidiary
represents the cash realized from the July 15, 2005 sale of our interest
in our CF Martin Sulphur joint venture to our joint venture partner, an
affiliate of Martin Resource Management.

Financing
Activities

Years Ended December 31,
2006, 2005 and 2004

Net cash used in financing activities was
$23.3 million, $290.7 million and $61.3 million in 2006, 2005
and 2004, respectively. The $267.4 million decrease in cash used in
financing activities in 2006 versus 2005, as well as the change from 2004 to
2005, was primarily due to the 2005 repayment of $235.6 million of our
term debt and the associated prepayment penalty of $26.4 million as
previously discussed. Distributions to minority interest were higher in 2006,
as all of CFL’s 2005 net earnings were distributed in 2006, whereas the
majority of CFL’s 2004 net earnings were distributed in 2004. The
$715.4 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock and the
corresponding exchange of stock represent the proceeds from our initial public
offering completed in the third quarter of 2005 and the subsequent payments to
our pre-IPO owners. See the “Overview” section of this discussion and analysis
for additional information about our IPO.

Represents the
undiscounted, inflation-adjusted estimated cash outflows required to
settle the AROs. The corresponding present value of these future expenditures
is $87.1 million as of December 31, 2006 and $74.5 million as of
December 31, 2005. The increase in the present value of these future
expenditures is due to recording changes in estimates on existing AROs as
previously discussed.

We also have unrecorded AROs at our Donaldsonville,
Louisiana nitrogen complex, at CFL’s Medicine Hat facility and at our
distribution and storage facilities that are conditional upon cessation of
operations. These AROs include certain decommissioning activities as well as
the removal and disposition of certain chemicals, waste materials, structures,
equipment, vessels, piping and storage tanks. Also included is reclamation of land
and, in the case of Donaldsonville, reclamation of two effluent ponds. The most
recent estimate of the aggregate cost of these AROs expressed in 2006 dollars
is between $12 million and $15 million. We do not currently believe
that there is a reasonable basis for estimating a date or range of dates of
cessation of operations at these facilities. Therefore, the table above does
not contain any cash flows for these AROs. See Note 9 to our consolidated
financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data, for further discussion of our AROs. As described in “—Financial
Assurance Requirements,” we intend to set aside cash on an annual basis in an
escrow account established to cover costs associated with closure of our
phosphogypsum stack system. This account will be the source of a significant
portion of the cash required to settle the AROs pertaining to the phosphogypsum
stack system.

Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangements

We do not have any
off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a
material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in
financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity,
capital expenditures or capital resources.

Critical Accounting
Policies and Estimates

Our discussion and
analysis of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and
capital resources is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which
have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted
accounting principles, or GAAP. GAAP requires that we make estimates and
judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues,
expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an
ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates. We base our estimates on historical
experience, technological assessment, opinions of appropriate outside experts,
and the most recent information available to us. Actual results may differ from
these estimates. Changes in estimates that may have a material impact on our results
are discussed in the context of the underlying financial statements to which
they relate. The following discussion presents information about our most
critical accounting policies and estimates.

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue when
title is transferred to the customer, which can be at the plant gate, a
distribution facility, a supplier location or a customer destination. In some
cases, application of this policy requires that we make certain assumptions or
estimates regarding a component of revenue, discounts and allowances, or
creditworthiness of some of our customers. We base our estimates on historical
experience, and the most recent information available to us, which can change
as market conditions change.

Useful Lives of
Depreciable Assets

In the fourth quarter of 2006 we completed a
comprehensive review of the depreciable lives of our production facilities and
related assets, as well as estimated production capacities used to develop our
units-of-production (UOP) depreciation expense. As a result of this review, we
increased the depreciable lives of certain assets at our nitrogen production
facilities from ten years to fifteen years. Separately, we revised the
estimates of production capacities for certain UOP assets at our
Donaldsonville, Louisiana nitrogen complex and all UOP assets at our Plant
City, Florida phosphate complex. As a result of these changes, we expect that
depreciation expense will be reduced by approximately $11 million during 2007.

Of the $11 million
anticipated reduction in depreciation expense, approximately $10 million
relates to our nitrogen production assets and $1 million relates to our
phosphate production assets. Included in the $10 million expected decrease
in depreciation for nitrogen assets is approximately $1 million relating
to CFL, a joint venture of which we own 66%.


CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

We review the depreciable
lives assigned to our production facilities and related assets on a periodic
basis, and change our estimates to reflect the results of those reviews.

Inventory Valuation

We review our inventory
balances at least quarterly, and more frequently if required by market
conditions, to determine if the carrying amount of inventories exceeds their
net realizable value. This review process incorporates current industry and
customer-specific trends, current operational plans for the inventory and
historical price activity of inventory. If the carrying amount of our inventory
exceeds its estimated net realizable value, we would immediately adjust our
carrying values accordingly. Upon inventory liquidation, if the actual sales
price ultimately realized were less than our initial estimate of net realizable
value, additional losses would be recorded in the period of liquidation.

Asset Retirement
Obligations and Environmental Remediation Liabilities

Costs associated with the closure of our phosphogypsum
stack systems at the Bartow and Plant City, Florida phosphate fertilizer
complexes and costs associated with land reclamation activities at our Hardee,
Florida phosphate rock mine are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 143—

Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations

.
If the cost of closure can be reasonably estimated, asset retirement
obligations (AROs) are recognized in the period in which the related assets are
put into service. Costs associated with the cessation of operations at all of
our facilities are accounted for in accordance with FIN No. 47—

Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement
Obligations

. This interpretation requires us to recognize a
liability for AROs for costs associated with the cessation of operations at our
facilities at the time those obligations are imposed, even if the timing and
manner of settlement are difficult to ascertain. The obligations related to
closure, reclamation and cessation of operations are capitalized at their
present value and a corresponding asset retirement liability is recorded. The
liability is adjusted in subsequent periods through accretion expense.
Accretion expense represents the increase in the present value of the liability
due to the passage of time. The asset retirement costs capitalized as part of
the carrying amount of the related asset are depreciated over their estimated
useful life. The aggregate carrying value of all of our AROs was
$87.1 million as of December 31, 2006 and $74.5 million as of December 31,
2005. The increase in the aggregate carrying value of these AROs is due to
recording changes in estimates on existing AROs as previously discussed.

Environmental remediation liabilities are recognized
when the related costs are considered probable and can be reasonably estimated
consistent with the requirements of SFAS No. 5—

Accounting for Contingencies

. Estimates of these costs are
based upon currently available facts, existing technology, site-specific costs
and currently enacted laws and regulations. In reporting environmental
liabilities, no offset is made for potential recoveries. All liabilities are
monitored and adjusted as new facts or changes in law or technology occur. In accordance
with GAAP, environmental expenditures are capitalized when such costs provide
future economic benefits. Changes in laws, regulations or assumptions used in
estimating these costs could have a material impact on our financial
statements. The amount recorded for environmental remediation liabilities
totaled $9.4 million as of December 31, 2006 and $7.9 million as
of December 31, 2005.

The actual amounts to be
spent on AROs and environmental remediation liabilities will depend on factors
such as the timing of activities, refinements in scope, technological
developments and cost inflation, as well as present and future environmental
laws and regulations. The estimates of amounts to be spent are subject to
considerable uncertainty and long timeframes. Changes in these estimates could
have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.


CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

Recoverability of
Long-Lived Assets

We review the carrying
values of our plant, property and equipment on a regular basis in accordance
with SFAS No. 144—

Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

. If impairment of an
asset has occurred, an impairment charge is recognized immediately. Factors
that we must estimate when performing impairment tests include sales volume,
prices, inflation, discount rates, exchange rates, tax rates and capital
spending. Significant judgment is involved in estimating each of these factors,
which include inherent uncertainties. The recoverability of the values
associated with our long-lived assets is dependent upon future operating
performance of the specific businesses to which the assets are attributed.
Certain of the operating assumptions are particularly sensitive to the cyclical
nature of the fertilizer business.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and
liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which
those differences are projected to be recovered or settled. Realization of deferred
tax assets is dependent on the ability of the Company to generate sufficient
taxable income, of an appropriate character, in future periods. A valuation
allowance is established if it is determined to be more likely than not that a
deferred tax asset will not be realized.

Upon the completion of our IPO, CF Industries, Inc.
ceased to be a nonexempt cooperative for federal income tax purposes. On the
date of our IPO, CF Industries, Inc. had a deferred tax asset related to
net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs) generated from business conducted with
CF Industries, Inc.’s pre-IPO owners. These net operating loss
carryforwards totaled $250 million, with expirations ranging from 2021
through 2023. The income tax provision for the year ended December 31,
2005 includes a charge of $99.9 million to establish a 100% valuation
allowance for the deferred tax asset related to these NOLs. The valuation
allowance is required because there is substantial uncertainty under existing
tax law whether any tax benefits from this deferred tax asset will be realized
since CF Industries, Inc. is no longer a cooperative for federal income
tax purposes.

In connection with the
IPO, we entered into a net operating loss agreement with CF Industries, Inc.’s
pre-IPO owners (NOL Agreement) relating to the future treatment of the pre-IPO
NOLs. Under the NOL Agreement, if it is finally determined that CF Industries, Inc.’s
net operating loss carryforwards can be utilized subsequent to the IPO, we will
pay to CF Industries, Inc.’s pre-IPO owners an amount equal to the
resulting federal and state income taxes actually saved.

Pension Assets and
Liabilities

Pension assets and
liabilities are affected by the market value of plan assets, estimates of the
expected return on plan assets, plan design, actuarial estimates and discount
rates. Actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences
between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets
affect the amount of pension expense ultimately recognized. Our projected
benefit obligation (PBO) related to our qualified pension plans was
$238.5 million at December 31, 2006, which was $29.7 million
higher than pension plan assets. The December 31, 2006 PBO was computed
based on a 5.70% discount rate, which was based on yields for high-quality
corporate bonds with a maturity approximating the duration of our pension
liability. Declines in comparable bond yields would increase our PBO. If the
discount rate used to compute the PBO was lower by 50 basis points, our PBO
would have been $17.4 million higher than the amount previously discussed.
Conversely, if the discount rate used to compute the PBO was higher by 50 basis
points, our PBO would have been $15.6 million lower. The discount rate
used to calculate pension expense in 2006 was 5.50% and was the discount rate
used to


CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

compute
the PBO at December 31, 2005. If the discount rate used to compute 2006
pension expense was lower by 50 basis points, 2006 pension expense would have
been approximately $1.8 million higher than the amount calculated.
Conversely, if the discount rate used to compute 2006 pension expense was
higher by 50 basis points, 2006 pension expense would have been approximately
$1.7 million lower than the amount calculated. Our net benefit obligation,
after deduction of plan assets, could increase or decrease depending on the
extent to which returns on pension plan assets are lower or higher than the
discount rate. The 7.5% expected long-term rate of return on assets is based on
studies of actual rates of return achieved by equity and non-equity
investments, both separately and in combination over historical holding
periods. If the expected long-term rate of return on assets was higher by 50
basis points, pension expense for 2006 would have been $0.9 million lower.
Conversely, if the expected long-term rate of return on assets was lower by 50
basis points, pension expense for 2006 would have been $0.9 million
higher.

Retiree Medical
Benefits

Retiree medical benefits
are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by assumptions, including
discount rates used to compute the present value of the future obligations and
expected increases in health care costs. Changes in the discount rate and
differences between actual and expected health care costs affect the recorded
amount of retiree medical benefits expense.

Stock-Based
Compensation

Costs associated with stock-based compensation
are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 123R—

Share-Based Payment

(SFAS 123R),
which requires us to recognize in our consolidated statement of operations the
grant date fair value of all share-based awards over the service period.
The fair value of nonqualified stock options granted is estimated on the date
of the grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. Key assumptions
used in the Black-Scholes option valuation model include expected
volatility and expected life. The basis for determining these assumptions may
change as more experience is obtained with our own historical stock prices and
employees’ option exercise behavior.

We accrue the cost of
stock-based awards on the straight-line method over the applicable
vesting period. As a result, total compensation cost recognized for 2006 on a
pre-tax basis was $8.1 million. As of December 31, 2006, on a pre-tax
basis there was approximately $11.6 million and $1.4 million of total
unrecognized compensation cost related to nonqualified options and restricted
stock which is expected to be recognized over 1.4 and 1.6 years, respectively.
See Note 26 to our consolidated financial statements included in
Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for further
discussion of stock-based compensation.

Recent Accounting
Pronouncements

We adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(SFAS) No. 158—

Employers’ Accounting for
Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans—an amendment of FASB
Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)

as of December 31,
2006. This Statement requires an entity to recognize the funded status of
benefit plans as assets and/or liabilities on the balance sheet, recognize
gains and losses, prior service costs or credits, and transition assets or
obligations in other comprehensive income, measure the defined benefit plan
assets and obligations as of the date of the employer’s fiscal year-end balance
sheet and provide disclosure in the notes of the effects of the amortization of
amounts included in other comprehensive income on the next fiscal year’s
periodic benefit cost. The measurement provisions of the Statement had no
impact on our consolidated financial statements, as our plan assets and benefit
obligations were already measured as of year-end. The impact of adopting SFAS No. 158
was an increase in liabilities for defined benefit plans of $47.9 million,
a decrease in other noncurrent assets of $0.3 million, a net increase in
deferred income tax assets of $18.1 million and an increase in accumulated
other


CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

comprehensive loss of
$30.1 million. See Notes 3 and 5 to our consolidated financial statements
included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, for
further discussion of the impact of adopting SFAS No. 158.

In 2006, Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation (FIN) No. 48—

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

was issued.

This
Interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes
recognized in accordance with SFAS No. 109—

Accounting
for Income Taxes

. The Interpretation prescribes a recognition
threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and
measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. It
also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and
penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The
Interpretation is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2007. We
are performing a review and analysis to determine the impact of the adoption of
the Interpretation on our consolidated financial statements.

Forward Pricing
Program (FPP)

In mid-2003, we instituted a program that has
reduced the risk inherent in the relationship between volatile fertilizer
prices and natural gas costs for product that we manufacture. Our basic concept
(principally applied to nitrogen fertilizers) is to fix the price of our
principal raw material, natural gas, coincident with the establishment of the
fertilizer sales price, which often occurs months in advance of shipment.
Customer advances, which typically represent a significant portion of the
contract’s sales value, are received shortly after the contract is executed,
with any remaining unpaid amount generally being collected by the time the
product is shipped. Any cash payments received in advance from customers in
connection with the FPP are reflected on our balance sheet as a current
liability until the related orders are shipped, which can take up to several
months. As is the case for all of our sales transactions, revenue is recognized
when title transfers upon shipment or delivery of the product to customers. We
lock in a substantial portion of the margin on these sales mainly by
effectively fixing the cost of natural gas, the largest and most volatile
component of our manufacturing cost, using natural gas derivative instruments,
or in some cases, with a combination of inventory on hand and product
purchases.

During 2006, we sold approximately 2.7 million
tons of nitrogen fertilizer, representing approximately 44% of our nitrogen
fertilizer sales volume, and approximately 294,000 tons of phosphate
fertilizer, representing approximately 14% of our phosphate fertilizer sales
volume, under the FPP. In 2005, we sold approximately 4.5 million tons of
nitrogen fertilizer, representing approximately 70% of our nitrogen fertilizer
sales volume, and approximately 718,000 tons of phosphate fertilizer,
representing approximately 36% of our phosphate fertilizer sales volume, under
the FPP. During 2004, we sold approximately 3.9 million tons of
fertilizer, representing approximately 45% of our sales volume, under the FPP.
As of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, we had approximately
1.7 million tons of product and 1.2 million tons of product,
respectively, committed to be sold under this program. The majority of these
amounts were scheduled to ship within 150 days of December 31, 2006 and December 31,
2005, respectively.

As a result of fixing the selling prices of our
products and a substantial portion of the cost to manufacture the products
under our FPP, often months in advance of their ultimate delivery to customers,
our reported selling prices and margins may differ from market spot prices and
margins available at the time of shipment.

Participation in the FPP
is affected by market conditions and our customers’ expectations. There can be
no assurance that we will transact the same percentage of our business under
the FPP in the future. Should the level of participation decrease, there is a
risk of increased volatility in the operating earnings of future periods.


CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

Discussion of
Seasonality Impacts on Operations

Our sales of fertilizers
to agricultural customers are typically seasonal in nature. The strongest
demand for our products occurs during the spring planting season, with a second
period of strong demand following the fall harvest. We and/or our customers
generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year in order
to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons.
Seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the limited ability of our customers
and their customers to store significant quantities of this product. The
seasonality of fertilizer demand results in our sales volumes and net sales
being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being
the highest just prior to the start of the spring season. Our quarterly
financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to
weather-related shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

We are exposed to the
impact of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and
commodity prices.

Interest Rate
Fluctuations

Borrowings under variable
rate notes payable bear a current market rate of interest such that we are
subject to interest rate risk on these borrowings. The revolving credit
facility bears a similar risk, but as of December 31, 2006, there were no
borrowings under this facility. As of December 31, 2006, a 100 basis point
change in interest rates on our floating rate loans, which totaled
$4.2 million, would result in a $42,000 change in pretax earnings (loss)
on an annual basis.

Foreign Currency
Exchange Rates

We are exposed to changes
in the value of the Canadian dollar as a result of our 66% economic interest
and our 49% common equity interest in CFL. At the present time, we do not
maintain any exchange rate derivatives or hedges related to CFL.

Commodity Prices

Our net sales, cash flows and estimates of future cash
flows related to the nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer sales not made under the
forward pricing program are sensitive to changes in nitrogen and phosphate
fertilizer prices as well as changes in the prices of natural gas and other raw
materials. A $1.00 per MMBtu change in the price of natural gas would change
the cost to produce a ton of ammonia by approximately $33.

We use natural gas in the manufacture of our nitrogen
fertilizer products. Because natural gas prices are volatile, our Natural Gas
Acquisition Policy includes the objective of providing protection against
significant adverse natural gas price movements. We manage the risk of changes
in gas prices through the use of physical gas supply contracts and derivative
financial instruments covering periods not exceeding three years. The derivative
instruments currently used are swaps. These contracts reference primarily NYMEX
futures contract prices, which represent fair value at any given time. The
related contracts are traded in months forward and settlements are scheduled to
coincide with anticipated gas purchases during those future periods. As of
December 31, 2006, we had hedged approximately 30.6 million MMBtus of
natural gas, most of which related to sales that had been contracted to be sold
through our forward pricing program as of December 31, 2006. We also
establish derivative positions in natural gas that are unrelated to forward
pricing program contracts if we consider it appropriate to do so.


CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

Through the third quarter of 2005, we designated,
documented and assessed accounting for hedge relationships, which resulted
primarily in cash flow hedges that required us to record the derivatives as
assets and liabilities at their fair value on the balance sheet with an offset
in other comprehensive income (loss). The gain or loss of an effective cash
flow hedge was deferred in other comprehensive income (loss) until the month
after the hedged natural gas was used to manufacture inventoried products,
which approximated the period of inventory turns of upgraded products and the
release of the cost of the hedged gas to cost of sales. Ineffective hedge gains
and losses were recorded immediately in cost of sales.

Instability in the natural gas market during the last
half of 2005 and our resulting decision to supply FPP orders from sources other
than production reduced our ability to predict future natural gas requirements.
Consequently, we ceased classifying derivatives as cash flow hedges as defined
in SFAS No. 133—

Accounting for
Derivatives and Hedging Activities

, beginning in the fourth quarter
of 2005. As a result, while the derivatives are still carried at their fair
value on the balance sheet, unrealized gains or losses related to the
derivatives are recognized in operations as they occur.

We purchase ammonia and sulfur for use as raw materials
in the production of DAP and MAP. We attempt to include any price fluctuations
related to these raw materials in our selling prices of finished products, but
there can be no guarantee that significant increases in input prices can always
be recovered. We enter into raw material purchase contracts to procure ammonia
and sulfur at market prices. A $10 per related ton change in the cost of a ton
of ammonia or a long ton of sulfur would change DAP production cost by $2.10
per ton and $3.80 per ton, respectively. We also purchase ammonia, urea and UAN
to augment or replace production at our facilities.

financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of CF Industries Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31,
2006 and 2005, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for
each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2006, in

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.

Background
and Basis of Presentation

We are one of the largest
manufacturers and distributors of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer products in
North America. Our operations are organized into two business segments: the
nitrogen fertilizer business and the phosphate fertilizer business. Our
principal products in the nitrogen fertilizer business are ammonia, urea and
urea ammonium nitrate solution, or UAN. Our principal products in the phosphate
fertilizer business are diammonium phosphate, or DAP, and monoammonium
phosphate, or MAP. Our core market and distribution facilities are concentrated
in the midwestern U.S. grain-producing states. Our principal customers
are cooperatives and independent fertilizer distributors.

Our
principal assets include:

·

the
largest nitrogen fertilizer complex in North America (Donaldsonville,
Louisiana);

·

a
66% economic interest in the largest nitrogen fertilizer complex in Canada
(which we operate in Medicine Hat, Alberta, through Canadian Fertilizers
Limited (CFL), a consolidated variable interest entity);

·

one
of the largest

integrated ammonium phosphate
fertilizer complexes in the United States (Plant City, Florida);

·

the
most-recently constructed phosphate rock mine and associated beneficiation
plant in the United States (Hardee County, Florida); and

·

an
extensive system of terminals, warehouses and associated transportation
equipment located primarily in the midwestern United States.

All references to “CF
Holdings,” “the Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to CF Industries Holdings, Inc.
and its subsidiaries, including CF Industries, Inc. after the
reorganization transaction described below, except where the context makes
clear that the reference is only to CF Holdings itself and not its
subsidiaries. All references to “our pre-IPO owners” refer to the eight
stockholders of CF Industries, Inc. prior to the consummation of our
reorganization transaction and initial public offering (IPO) which closed on August 16,
2005.

CF Holdings was formed in April 2005
to hold the existing business of CF Industries, Inc. Prior to August 17,
2005, CF Industries, Inc. operated as a cooperative and was owned by eight
regional agricultural cooperatives. On August 16, 2005, we completed our
initial public offering of common stock. We sold 47,437,500 shares of our
common stock in the IPO and received net proceeds, after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions, of approximately $715.4 million. We did not
retain any of the proceeds from the IPO. In connection with the IPO, we
consummated a reorganization transaction in which CF Industries, Inc.
ceased to be a cooperative and became our wholly-owned subsidiary. In the
reorganization transaction, all of the equity interests in CF Industries, Inc.
were cancelled in exchange for all of the proceeds of the IPO and 7,562,499
shares of our common stock. The reorganization transaction did not result in a
new basis of accounting for the Company.

Reclassifications

Certain prior-year amounts
have been reclassified to conform to the current year’s presentation.

On the consolidated
balance sheets, a portion of the spare parts inventory has been reclassified
from inventory to other noncurrent assets, based on our expectations of when
these parts will be utilized. On the consolidated statements of cash flows,
corresponding reclassifications have been made to inventory and other—net in
operating activities.


CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

2.

Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies

Consolidation

CF Holdings’ consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of CF Industries, Inc., all
majority-owned subsidiaries and variable interest entities in which CF
Holdings is the primary beneficiary. All intercompany transactions and balances
have been eliminated.

Consolidated subsidiaries
include Canadian Fertilizers Limited (CFL), a Canadian joint venture that owns
the nitrogen complex in Medicine Hat, Alberta, Canada and supplies fertilizer
products to CF Industries, Inc. and the other joint venture partner. The
Medicine Hat fertilizer complex is the largest nitrogen fertilizer complex in
Canada, with two world-scale ammonia plants, a world-scale urea
plant and on-site storage for both ammonia and urea. CFL’s sales revenue was
$375.7 million, $349.7 million, and $309.2 million for 2006,
2005 and 2004, respectively. CFL’s assets were $164.6 million and
$150.0 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

CF Industries, Inc. owns
49% of CFL’s voting common shares and 66% of CFL ‘s nonvoting preferred shares.
Western Co-operative Fertilizers Limited (Westco) owns 34% of the voting common
stock and non-voting preferred stock of CFL. The remaining 17% of the voting
common stock of CFL is owned by GROWMARK, Inc. and La Coop fédérée. CFL is
a variable interest entity and we are the primary beneficiary. Amounts reported
as minority interest on the consolidated balance sheet represent the interests
of the 34% holder of CFL’s common and preferred shares and the holders of 17%
of CFL’s common shares. Because the Canadian dollar is CFL’s functional
currency, consolidation of CFL results in a cumulative foreign currency
translation adjustment, which is reported in other comprehensive income (loss).

CF Industries, Inc.
operates the Medicine Hat facility and purchases approximately 66% of the
facility’s ammonia and urea production pursuant to a management agreement and a
product purchase agreement. Both the management agreement and the product
purchase agreement can be terminated by either CF Industries, Inc. or CFL
upon a twelve-month notice. Westco has the right, but not the obligation,
to purchase the remaining 34% of the facility’s ammonia and urea production
under a similar product purchase agreement. To the extent that Westco does not
purchase its 34% of the facility’s production, CF Industries, Inc. is
obligated to purchase any remaining amounts. Since 1995, however, Westco has
purchased at least 34% of the facility’s production each year.

Under the product purchase
agreements, both CF Industries, Inc. and Westco pay the greater of
operating cost or market price for purchases. However, the product purchase
agreements also provide that CFL will distribute its net earnings to CF
Industries, Inc. and Westco annually based on their respective quantities
of product purchased from CFL. The distributions to Westco are reported as
financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows, as we
consider these payments to be similar to dividends. The product purchase
agreement also requires CF Industries, Inc. to advance funds to CFL in the
event that CFL is unable to meet its debts as they become due. The amount of
each advance would be at least 66% of the deficiency and would be more in any
year in which CF Industries, Inc. purchased more than 66% of Medicine Hat’s
production. CF Industries, Inc. and Westco currently manage CFL such that
each party is responsible for its share of CFL’s fixed costs and that CFL’s
production volume meets the parties’ combined requirements.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recognized when
title transfers to the customer, which can be at the plant gate, a distribution
facility, a supplier location or a customer destination. Shipping and handling
costs are included in cost of sales.


CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents
include highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts
of cash with original maturities of three months or less. The carrying values
of cash and cash equivalents approximate fair value.

Investments

Short-term and long-term
investments are accounted for as “available-for-sale securities” in accordance
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 115—

Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities

. Short-term investments consist of available-for-sale
auction rate securities. The carrying values of short-term investments
approximate fair values because of the short maturities and the highly liquid
nature of these investments.

Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful
Accounts

Accounts receivable are
recorded at face amounts less an allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance
is an estimate based on historical collection experience, current economic and
market conditions, and a review of the current status of each customer’s trade
accounts receivable. A receivable is past due if payments have not been
received within the agreed upon invoice terms. Account balances are charged-off
against the allowance when we determine that it is probable the receivable will
not be recovered. Cash flows from trade receivables are included in net cash
provided by operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at
the lower of cost or net realizable value and are determined on a first-in,
first-out or average basis. Inventory includes the cost of materials,
production labor and production overhead. Inventory at our warehouses and
terminals also includes distribution costs. Cash flows from the sale of
inventory are included in cash flows provided by operating activities.

Investments in Unconsolidated Subsidiaries

On July 15, 2005, we
sold our interest in CF Martin Sulphur, L.P. (CFMS). Prior to July 15,
2005, we accounted for this investment under the equity method. In 2004, we
wrote-off the carrying value of our investment in Big Bend Transfer Co., L.L.C.
of $1.1 million. See Note 16 for more information on investments in
unconsolidated subsidiaries.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property,
plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation, depletion and
amortization are computed using the units-of-production method for production
assets and the straight-line method for other assets. Depreciable lives are as
follows:

Years

Mobile and office
  equipment

3 to 18

Production
  facilities and related assets

10 to 15

Distribution
  facilities


Mining assets,
  phosphogypsum stacks and land improvements


Buildings


Expenditures related to
scheduled major maintenance of production facilities (plant turnarounds) are
deferred when incurred and amortized to production costs on a straight-line
basis during the period until the next scheduled turnaround, generally 2.5 to 5
years.


CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

Recoverability of Long-Lived Assets

Property, plant and equipment
and other long-lived assets are reviewed in order to assess recoverability
based on expected future undiscounted cash flows whenever events or
circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. If the
sum of the expected future net cash flows is less than the carrying value, an
impairment loss is recognized. The impairment loss is measured as the amount by
which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset.

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the
excess of the purchase price of an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to
the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is no longer amortized
but is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if certain
impairment conditions arise. After analysis, goodwill that is deemed impaired
is written down to fair value. See Note 6—Other Operating—Net for further
information regarding goodwill impairments.

Leases

Leases are classified as
either operating leases or capital leases in accordance with SFAS No. 13—

Accounting for Leases

, as amended by
subsequent standards. Assets acquired under capital leases are depreciated on
the same basis as property, plant and equipment. Rental payments, including
rent holidays, leasehold incentives, and scheduled rent increases, under
operating leases are expensed on a straight-line basis. We do not currently
have any capital leases. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter
of the depreciable lives of the corresponding fixed assets or the lease term
including any applicable renewals.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted
for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the
years in which those differences are projected to be recovered or settled.
Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the ability of the Company
to generate sufficient taxable income, of an appropriate character, in future
periods. A valuation allowance is established if it is determined to be more
likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized.

Derivative Financial Instruments

Natural gas is a principal
raw material used to produce nitrogen fertilizers. We use natural gas both as a
chemical feedstock and as a fuel to produce ammonia, urea and UAN. In
accordance with our Natural Gas Acquisition Policy, we manage the risk of
changes in natural gas prices through the use of physical gas supply contracts
and derivative financial instruments covering periods not exceeding 3 years. The
derivative instruments that we currently use are swaps. These contracts
reference primarily NYMEX futures contract prices, which represent fair value
at any given time. The contracts are traded in months forward and settlements
are scheduled to coincide with anticipated gas purchases during those future
periods.

We account for derivatives
in accordance with SFAS No. 133—

Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,

as amended by
subsequent standards. Under these standards, derivatives are recognized in the
consolidated balance sheets at fair value and changes in their fair value are
recognized in earnings immediately in cost of sales, unless hedge accounting is
elected or the normal purchase and sale exemption applies. We do not apply hedge
accounting currently.


CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

Stock-based Compensation

We account for stock-based
compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123R—

Share-Based Payment

, which requires entities to
measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of
equity instruments based upon the fair value of the award on the grant date.
The cost is recognized over the period during which the employee is required to
provide services in exchange for the award and is accrued based on the
straight-line method. See Note 26 for additional information on stock-based
compensation.

Litigation

From time to time, we are
subject to ordinary, routine legal proceedings related to the usual conduct of
our business. We are also involved in proceedings regarding public utility and
transportation rates, environmental matters, taxes and permits relating to the
operations of our various plants and facilities. In accordance with SFAS No. 5—

Accounting for Contingencies,

accruals for
such contingencies are recorded to the extent that we conclude their occurrence
is probable and the financial impact, should an adverse outcome occur, is
reasonably estimable. Disclosure for specific legal contingencies is provided
if the likelihood of occurrence is at least reasonably possible and the
exposure is considered material to the consolidated financial statements. In
making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters, we consider
many factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, past history,
scientific and other evidence, and the specifics and status of each matter. If
the assessment of various factors changes, the estimates may change. Predicting
the outcome of claims and litigation, and estimating related costs and exposure
involves substantial uncertainties that could cause actual costs to vary
materially from estimates and accruals.

Environmental

Environmental expenditures
that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate.
Expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations and
that do not provide current or future economic benefits are expensed.
Expenditures that provide future economic benefits are capitalized. Liabilities
are recorded when environmental assessments and/or remedial efforts are
required and the costs can be reasonably estimated.

Use of Estimates

The consolidated financial
statements and accompanying notes, which are prepared in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America,
include amounts which are based on management’s best judgments and estimates.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

3.

New
Accounting Standards

Following
are summaries of recently issued accounting pronouncements that are either
currently applicable or may become applicable to the preparation of our
consolidated financial statements in the future.

·

Emerging
Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 06-03—

How Sales
Tax Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should be
Presented in the Income Statement (That is, Gross versus Net Presentation)

.   This
EITF Issue clarifies that the presentation of taxes collected from customers
and remitted to governmental authorities on a gross (included in revenues and
costs) or net (excluded from revenues) basis is an accounting policy decision
that should be disclosed pursuant to Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 22—

Disclosure of Accounting Policies

. The EITF Issue is
effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2007. We collect an
immaterial


CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

amount of such
taxes from our customers which we account for on a net basis.

The adoption of EITF Issue No. 06-03
will not impact our consolidated financial statements or disclosures.

·

Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation (FIN) No. 48—

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes.

This
Interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes
recognized in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS
or Statement) No. 109—

Accounting for Income
Taxes

. The Interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and
measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement
of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. It also
provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties,
accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The Interpretation is
effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2007. We are performing a
review and analysis to determine the impact of the adoption of the
Interpretation on our consolidated financial statements.

·

FASB
Staff Position (FSP) No. AUG AIR-1—

Accounting
for Planned Major Maintenance Activities.

This FSP prohibits the use
of accrue-in-advance method of accounting for planned major maintenance
activities in annual and interim financial reporting periods. This FSP is
effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2007 and must be applied
retrospectively for all financial statements presented. We do not expect the
adoption of FSP AUG AIR-1 to have a material impact on our consolidated
financial statements.

·

SFAS
No. 155—

Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial
Instruments

.   This standard amends the guidance in SFAS No. 133—

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

,
and SFAS No. 140—

Accounting for Transfers
and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities

.   This
Statement allows financial instruments that have embedded derivatives to be
accounted for as a whole (eliminating the need to bifurcate the derivative from
its host) as long as the entire instrument is valued on a fair value basis.
This Statement also clarifies other specific SFAS No. 133—and SFAS No. 140—related
issues. This Statement will be effective for the Company in accounting for all
financial instruments acquired or issued on or after January 1, 2007. The
adoption of SFAS No. 155 will not impact our consolidated financial
statements.

·

SFAS
No. 156—

Accounting for Servicing of
Financial Assets—An Amendment of FASB Statement No. 140

—Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of
Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities

. This Statement
requires an entity to recognize a servicing asset or servicing liability each
time it undertakes an obligation to service a financial asset by entering into
a servicing contract in certain situations. This Statement also provides
guidance on subsequent measurement methods for each class of servicing assets
and liabilities and specifies financial statement presentation and disclosure
requirements. This Statement is effective for the Company beginning January 1,
2007. The adoption of SFAS No. 156 will not impact our consolidated
financial statements.

·

SFAS
No. 157—

Fair Value Measurements.

This
Statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value
in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and expands disclosures
about fair value measurements. This Statement does not require any new fair
value measurements; however, for some entities, the application of this
statement may change current practice. This Statement is effective for the
Company beginning January 1, 2008. We have not yet determined the impact
of this Statement on our consolidated financial statements.

·

SFAS
No. 158—

Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit
Pension and Other Postretirement Plans—an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87,
88, 106, and 132(R)

. This Statement requires an entity to recognize
the funded status of benefit plans as assets and/or liabilities on the balance
sheet, recognize gains and losses, prior service costs or credits, and
transition assets or obligations in other comprehensive income, measure the
defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of the


CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

employer’s fiscal
year-end balance sheet and provide disclosure in the notes of the effects of
the amortization of amounts included in other comprehensive income on the next
fiscal year’s periodic benefit cost. The measurement provisions of the
Statement had no impact on our consolidated financial statements, as our plan
assets and benefit obligations were already measured as of year-end. We adopted
SFAS No. 158 as of December 31, 2006. T

he impact of adopting SFAS No. 158
was an increase in liabilities for defined benefit plans of $47.9 million,
a decrease in other noncurrent assets of $0.3 million, a net increase in
deferred income tax assets of $18.1 million and an increase in accumulated
other comprehensive loss of $30.1 million. See Note 5

—Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

for additional information.

·

SEC Staff Accounting
Bulletin (SAB) 108, Section N to Topic 1—

Considering
the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in
Current Year Financial Statements

. This SAB requires the evaluation
of prior year misstatements using both the balance sheet approach and the
income statement approach. In the year of initial adoption, should either
approach result in quantifying an error that is material in light of
quantitative and qualitative factors, SAB 108 guidance allows for a
one-time cumulative-effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings. In years
subsequent to adoption, previously undetected misstatements deemed material
shall result in the restatement of previously issued financial statements in
accordance with SFAS No. 154

Accounting Changes and
Error Corrections.

The guidance in this SAB is effective for the
Company’s December 31, 2006 fiscal year-end. The adoption of SAB 108
did not impact our consolidated financial statements.

Net
Earnings (Loss) Per Share

Prior to the consummation
of our August 2005 IPO, CF Holdings did not have any activities or
operations. Therefore, with the exception of stockholders’ equity and per share
amounts, management believes that the current financial statements of CF
Holdings are comparable to the historical financial statements of CF Industries, Inc.
The table below presents the weighted average shares outstanding and net
earnings (loss) per share information on an actual basis for periods subsequent
to our IPO, and on a pro forma basis giving effect to the IPO and related
reorganization transaction assuming that they had occurred as of the beginning
of the earliest period presented.

the effect of their inclusion would be antidilutive. The antidilution occurs
because the application of dilutive potential common shares to a net loss
results in a smaller loss per share.

Pension
and Other Postretirement Benefits

CF Industries, Inc. and its Canadian subsidiary
both maintain noncontributory, defined-benefit pension plans. The U.S. pension
plan is a closed plan. We also provide group insurance to our retirees. Until
age 65, retirees are eligible to continue to receive the same
Company-subsidized medical coverage provided to active employees. When a
retiree reaches age 65, medical coverage ceases.

The accumulated other comprehensive loss related to
the minimum pension liability adjustment in 2005 was reduced by an income tax
benefit of $6.2 million, resulting in a net charge to accumulated other comprehensive
loss of $9.3 million at December 31, 2005. See Note 25

—Stockholders’ Equity

for additional
information.

Our estimated pension funding contribution in 2007 is
$5.6 million. Expected future pension benefit payments are
$8.9 million in 2007, $9.5 million in 2008, $10.3 million in
2009, $10.9 million in 2010, $11.6 million in 2011, and
$69.1 million during the five years thereafter. Expected future retiree
medical benefit payments are $1.5 million in 2007, $1.7 million in
2008, $1.9 million in 2009, $2.1 million in 2010, $2.3 million
in 2011 and $13.5 million during the five years thereafter.

The
following assumptions were used in determining the benefit obligations and
expense for the primary (U.S.) plans. The assumptions used for the Canadian
plans are substantially similar to those used for the primary plans.

The discount rate is based on yields on high quality
fixed income debt securities such as the Moody’s Aa bond index as of the
measurement date of December 31. We also considered changes in interest
rates from the prior measurement date and factors such as the duration of the
plan’s liabilities and pattern of expected cash flows in comparison to the
duration and expected cash flows of the relevant bond indices, and the shape of
the fixed income yield curve as of the measurement date.

The expected long-term rate of return on assets is
based on studies of actual rates of return achieved by equity and non-equity
investments both separately and in combination over historical holding periods.
For 2007, our expected long-term rate of return on assets is 7.2%.

The objectives of the investment policy with respect
to the primary pension plan are to administer the assets of the plan for the
benefit of the participants in compliance with all laws and regulations, and to
establish an asset mix that provides for diversification of assets and
generation of returns at an acceptable level of risk. The policy considers
circumstances such as participant demographics, time horizon to retirement and
liquidity needs, and provides guidelines for asset allocation, planning
horizon, general portfolio issues and investment manager evaluation criteria as
well as monitoring and control procedures. The current target asset allocation
for the primary (U.S.) plan is 55% equity and 45% non-equity, which has been
determined based on studies of actual historical rates of return and plan needs
and circumstances.

allocation of pension assets by major asset category based on fair value for
the primary plan is as follows:

The estimated net actuarial loss and prior service
cost for the defined benefit pension plans that will be amortized from accumulated
other comprehensive loss into net periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal
year are $1.8 million and $0.1 million, respectively. The estimated
net actuarial loss and transition obligation for the retiree medical plans that
will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic
benefit cost over the next fiscal year are $0.3 million and
$0.3 million, respectively.

We also have a defined contribution plan covering
substantially all employees. Under the plan, we contribute a fixed percentage
of base salary to employees’ accounts and match employee contributions up to a
specified limit. We contributed $6.0 million, $5.7 million, and
$5.6 million to the plan in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.

We also have an Annual Incentive Plan. The aggregate
award under the plan is based on pre-determined targets for cash flow return on
average gross capital employed. Awards are accrued during the year and paid in
the first quarter of the subsequent year. We recognized expense of $6.1 million,
$6.4 million, and $6.7 million for this plan in 2006, 2005, and 2004,
respectively.

In addition to our qualified defined benefit pension
plans, we also maintain nonqualified supplemental pension plans for highly
compensated employees as defined under federal law. We also maintain a closed
plan in which no current employees are eligible to participate. As part of our
application of SFAS No. 158 for these plans, we recognized a net of tax
charge to accumulated other comprehensive loss of $1.9 million at December 31,
2006. The amounts recognized in other current liabilities and other noncurrent
liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets for these plans were
$0.6 million and $7.9 million in 2006 and $0.2 million and
$2.8 million in 2005, respectively. We recognized expense for these plans
of $1.4 million, $1.0 million, and $0.4 million in 2006, 2005,
and 2004, respectively.

In the third quarter of
2005, we paid $3.8 million to officers and certain members of senior
management upon termination of a long term incentive plan and recorded expense
in 2005 of $3.5 million for this plan. Under the plan, participants were
to receive a specified percentage of aggregate value created upon completion of
a three-year performance measurement period as defined in the plan. Value
created

based on specified return on equity targets. In 2004, we recognized expense
under this plan of $0.3 million.

Bartow costs are primarily provisions for asset
retirement obligations which include closure and post-closure monitoring costs
for the phosphogypsum stack and cooling pond, and water treatment costs which
increased during 2006. See Note 9—Asset Retirement Obligations for additional
information. Bartow costs also include provisions for facility demolition which
increased during 2006 as a result of actual experience gained and plans for
additional plant demolition work as a cost effective means of removing residual
materials from the site.

Fixed asset disposals in 2005 include gains on the
sales of a previously idled distribution terminal and excess land at our Bartow
complex.

Other environmental costs in 2004 include a provision
for an ongoing groundwater recovery and land application program at the site of
a former nitrogen manufacturing facility. Also included is a provision, based
on an assessment that identified certain measures, which if completed in the
near-term, would allow us to reduce the long-term costs related to the
demolition, removal and disposal of certain environmental materials and
equipment at the Bartow phosphate complex.

Litigation costs represent costs associated with legal
actions to which we are a party. Such costs are recorded when they are
considered probable and can be reasonably estimated. Recoveries are recorded
when realized.

In the fourth quarter of
2005, we recorded an impairment charge of $0.4 million for the portion of
goodwill related to our interest in an ammonia pipeline in Florida. The impairment
was the result of our last remaining pipeline customer ceasing operations.

Asset
Retirement Obligations

Asset retirement obligations (AROs) are legal
obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result
from the acquisition, construction, development or normal operation of such
assets. We account for AROs in accordance with SFAS No. 143—

Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations

and FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 47—

Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement
Obligations

(conditional AROs).

FIN No. 47 provides guidance regarding when an
entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value
of an ARO. In the fourth quarter of 2005, we adopted FIN No. 47 and
recorded a $4.6 million ($2.8 million, after taxes) cumulative effect
of a change in accounting principle. If the change in accounting had been
applied retroactively as of the beginning of 2004, our pro forma results would
have been a net loss of $36.4 million in 2005 and net earnings of
$67.6 million in 2004.


CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

The
balances of AROs and changes thereto are summarized below. AROs are reported in

In the table above, other AROs are those resulting
from FIN No. 47 that have been recognized in our financial statements. If
we had applied the provisions of FIN No. 47 as of the beginning of the
earliest period presented, other AROs would have increased by $6.2 million
and $6.5 million as of January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2004,
respectively.

Our phosphate operations in Florida are subject to
regulations governing the construction, operation, closure and long-term
maintenance of phosphogypsum stack systems and regulations concerning site
reclamation for phosphate rock mines. The liability for phosphogypsum stack
costs includes closure and post-closure monitoring for the active stack at
Plant City, the Bartow stack that is in the process of closure, cooling ponds
at Bartow and Plant City and water treatment at Bartow and Plant City, as
described below. The actual amounts to be spent will depend on factors such as
the timing of activities, refinements in scope, technological developments,
cost inflation and changes in regulations. It is possible that these factors
could change at any time and impact the estimates. Closure expenditures for the
Bartow stack are currently expected to continue through the year 2008 and
closure of the Bartow cooling pond and channels are estimated to occur in the
years 2016 to 2023. Closure expenditures for the Plant City stack expansion are
estimated to occur in the 2023 to 2037 timeframe and closure of the Plant City
cooling pond is assumed to occur in the year 2087. Additional asset retirement
obligations may be incurred in the future upon expansion of the Plant City
phosphogypsum stack.

We incur expenditures to treat water stored in the
phosphogypsum stack and cooling pond systems during the process of closure.
Until 2004, we believed that it was not reasonably possible to estimate the
quantity or timing of such water treatment, if any, because the need to treat
water at any particular time may arise from factors other than the process of
stack closure and, therefore, a reasonable estimate of


CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

future water treatment
costs associated solely with closure could not be made. In late 2004, the
Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) published revisions to the
regulations governing closure and long-term maintenance of phosphogypsum stack
systems that became effective in July 2005. The revised regulations added
specific requirements for inclusion of water management plans and estimated
costs based on assumed end-of-life closure of the entire stack system. As a
result of evaluating the new DEP requirements, we determined in 2004 that,
based on experience with closure activities and development of refined
assumptions, amounts for water treatment directly associated with ultimate
closure of the Plant City stack system and the Bartow stack system could be
reasonably estimated.

The $15.4 million identified as liabilities
incurred in 2004 was our estimate of water treatment obligations. This amount
consists of $7.1 million for Bartow, which was charged to other operating
expenses in 2004 rather than capitalized because Bartow is a closed facility,
and $8.3 million for Plant City, which was capitalized as property, plant
and equipment and is being depreciated over a twenty-year period beginning in
2005. Water treatment expenditures at Bartow are currently estimated to extend
through 2056, and such expenditures at Plant City are estimated to occur
primarily in the 2033 to 2087 time frame. The estimates are subject to change
at any time in the future.

The $20.3 million change in estimate in
phosphogypsum stack closure costs in 2005 was primarily the result of a revised
closure plan for the Plant City phosphogypsum stack and cooling pond systems
that was prepared and filed with the DEP in December 2005 in accordance
with the July 2005 revision of DEP regulations, and similarly updated
estimates for the Bartow stack and cooling pond. Previous estimates were based
on a closure plan developed in 2001 that incorporated certain assumptions
regarding the scope of closure work and preliminary engineering estimates of
costs. The 2005 Plant City closure plan includes an expanded scope of closure
work, and additional costs for water treatment and post-closure monitoring
based on actual experience gained from the recently completed closure of the
original Plant City stack and similar sites. The estimates for Bartow included
similar updates of water treatment and post-closure monitoring costs.

The $6.9 million change in estimate in
phosphogypsum stack closure costs in 2006 was primarily the result of revised
cost estimates for water treatment and stack closure at Bartow. The estimated
volume of water to be treated over the next two years was increased based on
experience obtained in 2006, the need to reduce water levels to accommodate
cooling pond closure, and higher estimates of seepage. The need for additional
cooling channel closure work was also identified, as well as higher costs for
previously planned channel closure work, largely due to increases in earthwork
costs. The $3.3 million change in estimate in mine reclamation costs in
2006 was a combination of higher earthwork costs and additional required
restoration work. The $8.2 million change in estimate in other ARO costs
in 2006 was primarily the result of revised cost estimates to close the Bartow
plant site and wastewater treatment systems, and a revised plan for storm water
management. Bartow AROs are reported in other operating—net in our consolidated
statements of operations. See Note 6

information.

We have unrecorded AROs at our Donaldsonville,
Louisiana nitrogen complex; at Canadian Fertilizer’s Medicine Hat, Alberta
nitrogen complex; and at our distribution and storage facilities, that are
conditional upon cessation of operations. These AROs include certain
decommissioning activities as well the removal and disposition of certain
chemicals, waste materials, structures, equipment, vessels, piping and storage
tanks. Also included is reclamation of land and, in the case of Donaldsonville,
reclamation of two effluent ponds. The most recent estimate of the aggregate
cost of these AROs expressed in 2006 dollars is between $12 million and
$15 million. We have not recorded a liability for these conditional AROs
at December 31, 2006, because we do not currently believe there is a
reasonable basis for estimating a date or range of dates of cessation of
operations at these facilities. In reaching this conclusion, we considered the
historical performance of each facility and have taken into account factors
such as planned maintenance, asset replacements and upgrades of plant and
equipment, which if conducted as in the past,


CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

can extend the physical
lives of our Donaldsonville and Medicine Hat facilities indefinitely. We also
considered the possibility of changes in technology, risk of obsolescence, and
availability of raw materials in arriving at our conclusion.

In March 2006, we made an initial contribution of
$11.1 million to an escrow account established for the benefit of the
Florida Department of Environmental Protection in order to comply with

Florida’s regulations governing financial
assurance related to the closure of phosphogypsum stacks.

We expect to
contribute another $9.4 million in the first quarter of 2007. Then, o

ver the next nine years, we expect to contribute
between $4 million and $7 million annually based upon the required
funding formula as defined in the regulations and an assumed rate of return of
4% on invested funds. The amount of funds that will have accumulated in the
account by the year 2016, including interest earned on invested funds, is
currently estimated to be approximately $85 million. After 2016,
contributions to the fund are estimated to average less than $1 million
annually for the following 17 years. The balance in the account is
estimated to be approximately $170 million by 2033. The required balance
in the account is based on predetermined funding requirements as prescribed by
the state of Florida; therefore, contributions to the account will differ from
amounts recognized as expense in our financial statements. Ultimately, the cash
in the account will be used to complete settlement of the AROs.

The
balance in this account is reported as an asset at fair value on our
consolidated balance sheet.

Additionally, Florida
regulations require mining companies to demonstrate financial assurance for wetland
and other surface water mitigation measures in advance of any mining
activities. We will be required to demonstrate financial assurance for wetland
and other surface water mitigation measures in advance of any mining activities
if and when we are able to expand our Hardee mining activities into areas not
currently permitted.

CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

Upon the completion of our IPO, CF Industries, Inc.
ceased to be a nonexempt cooperative for federal income tax purposes. On the
date of our IPO, CF Industries, Inc. had a deferred tax asset related to
net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs) generated from business conducted with
CF Industries, Inc.’s pre-IPO owners. These net operating loss
carryforwards totaled $250 million, with expirations ranging from 2021
through 2023. The income tax provision for the year ended December 31,
2005 includes a charge of $99.9 million to establish a 100% valuation
allowance for the deferred tax asset related to these NOLs. The valuation
allowance is required because there is substantial uncertainty under existing
tax law whether any tax benefits from this deferred tax asset will be realized
since CF Industries, Inc. is no longer a cooperative for federal income
tax purposes.

In connection with the IPO, we entered into a net
operating loss agreement with CF Industries, Inc.’s pre-IPO owners (NOL
Agreement) relating to the future treatment of the pre-IPO NOLs. Under the NOL
Agreement, if it is finally determined that CF Industries, Inc.’s net
operating loss carryforwards can be utilized subsequent to the IPO, we will pay
to CF Industries, Inc.’s pre-IPO owners an amount equal to the resulting
federal and state income taxes actually saved.

CFL operates as a cooperative for Canadian income tax
purposes and distributes all of its earnings as patronage dividends to its
customers, including CF Industries, Inc. For Canadian income tax purposes,
CFL is permitted to deduct an amount equal to the patronage dividends it
distributes to its customers, provided that certain requirements are met. As a
result, CFL records no income tax provision.

On May 13, 2005, the Canadian Income Tax Act was
amended to disallow the deduction of certain patronage distributions paid after
March 22, 2004 to non-arms-length persons. In the settlement of CFL’s
audit for the tax years 1997 through 2000, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA)
agreed that CFL has operated at arms-length with CF Industries with respect to
the deductibility of patronage payments to CF Industries for the 2004
taxation year, and the Company believes it has continued to operate on an
arms-length basis.

Although CFL is not
currently under audit by the Canadian tax authorities, CFL received a
preliminary inquiry from the CRA in 2005, which questioned whether CFL’s past
patronage distributions had met the requirements for full deductibility under
Canadian income tax law. While CFL believes its distributions complied with
applicable law, CFL could be subject to material Canadian income tax
liabilities if its distributions were determined to fail to meet the
requirements for deductibility under Canadian tax law.

Investments
in Unconsolidated Subsidiaries

In 2005, we sold our interest in CF Martin Sulphur,
L.P. (CFMS), a molten sulfur supplier to the central Florida phosphate
industry, to our joint venture partner, an affiliate of Martin Resource
Management, for $18.6 million. The transaction did not have a material
impact on our consolidated statement of operations, as the selling price
approximated the carrying value of our investment in CFMS. Concurrent with the
sale, we entered into a multi-year sulfur supply contract with CFMS with terms
commensurate with prevailing market rates.

We also have a one-third ownership interest in Big
Bend Transfer Co., L.L.C., a joint venture that had plans to develop a
facility to convert imported dry sulfur into liquid. As a result of a
fundamental shift in the economics of converting dry sulfur to liquid,
management determined in 2004 that that the carrying value of the investment
could no longer be recovered. Accordingly, an impairment loss of
$1.1 million was recognized in 2004. The carrying value of this investment
is zero at December 31, 2006 and 2005.

by the time the product is shipped, thereby reducing or eliminating accounts
receivable from customers upon shipment. Revenue is recognized when title
transfers upon shipment or

of the product to customers. As of December 31, 2006, we had approximately
1.7 million tons of product committed to be sold under the FPP in 2007.

Long-Term
Debt, Credit Agreement and Notes Payable

Long-Term Debt

On August 17, 2005,
we prepaid our outstanding long-term debt balance of $235.6 million and
recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $28.3 million. The loss
consisted of prepayment penalties of $26.4 million and the write-off of
deferred financing fees of $1.9 million.

Credit Agreement

On August 16, 2005, we replaced our previous
$140 million, senior secured revolving credit facility with a
$250 million, senior secured revolving credit facility (the credit
facility) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., acting as administrative agent
(JPMorgan Chase), which is scheduled to be available until August 16,
2010. The credit facility provides up to $250 million, subject to a
borrowing base, for working capital and general corporate purposes, including
up to $50 million for the issuance of letters of credit.

Availability under the credit facility is limited by a
borrowing base equal to the value of a specified percentage of eligible
receivables, plus the value of a specified percentage of eligible inventory,
plus a property, plant and equipment component (capped at $75 million in
the aggregate) determined based on specified percentages of eligible fixed
assets (including the real property) located at the Donaldsonville, Louisiana
facility and other eligible real property, if any (each subject to caps), less
the amount of any reserves JPMorgan Chase deems necessary, as determined in
good faith and in the exercise of reasonable business judgment.

CF Industries, Inc. is entitled to borrow at
interest rates based on (1) the Base Rate (which is the higher of (i) the
rate most recently announced by JPMorgan Chase as its “prime” rate and (ii) the
federal funds rate plus


¤


of 1% per annum) plus a margin applied to either rate ranging from 0.00 percent
to 0.375 percent, and (2) the applicable Eurodollar Rate (which is the
London Interbank Eurodollar Rate adjusted for reserves) plus an applicable
margin that ranges from 1.375 percent to 1.625 percent. Letters of credit
issued under the credit facility accrue fees at the applicable Eurodollar Rate
borrowing margin. The applicable margins vary depending on the average daily
availability for borrowing under the credit facility during CF Industries, Inc.’s
most recent calendar quarter. CF Industries, Inc. is also required to pay
certain fees, including fees based on the unused portion of the credit facility
and fronting fees on undrawn amounts under outstanding letters of credit, and
expenses in connection with the credit facility.

The credit facility is guaranteed by CF Holdings and
certain of the domestic subsidiaries of CF Industries, Inc. (collectively,
the Guarantors and, together with CF Industries, Inc., the Loan Parties)
and secured by (i) perfected, first-priority liens (subject to
permitted liens) on substantially all of the personal property and assets, both
tangible and intangible, of the Loan Parties, (ii) perfected, first-priority
liens or pledges (subject to permitted liens) on 100% of the equity interests
of each Loan Party’s direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries other than
immaterial subsidiaries and on 65% of the equity interests of each Loan Party’s
first-tier foreign subsidiaries and (iii) a first-priority lien
(subject to permitted liens) on the real property located in Donaldsonville,
Louisiana.

Optional prepayments and optional reductions of the
unutilized portion of the secured credit facility are permitted at any time,
subject to, among other things, reimbursement of the lenders’ redeployment
costs in the case of a prepayment of Eurodollar Rate borrowings. Mandatory
prepayments are required, subject to certain exceptions, in certain instances
(such as upon certain asset sales, receipt of proceeds of insurance and
condemnation events in excess of $5 million and issuances of debt or
equity) at any time


CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

after CF Industries, Inc.’s
average daily cash availability amount is less than $75 million for any 10
business day period and until such time as CF Industries, Inc.’s
average daily cash availability amount is equal to or exceeds $75 million
for a period of 60 consecutive days.

Under the terms of the credit facility, the Loan
Parties agree to covenants that apply to each of them and their respective
subsidiaries and which, among other things, limit the incurrence of additional
indebtedness, liens, loans and investments; limit the ability to pay dividends,
and to redeem and repurchase capital stock; place limitations on prepayments,
redemptions and repurchases of debt; limit entry into mergers, consolidations,
acquisitions, asset dispositions and sale/leaseback transactions, transactions
with affiliates and certain swap agreements; restrict changes in business and
amendment of debt agreements; and place restrictions on distributions from
subsidiaries, the issuance and sale of capital stock of subsidiaries, and other
matters customarily restricted in secured loan agreements.

Additionally, we are required to meet a financial test
on a consolidated basis consisting of a minimum ratio of earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), calculated as set
forth in the credit facility, minus the unfinanced portion of Capital
Expenditures to Fixed Charges (each as defined in the credit facility) if
average daily cash availability under the credit facility in any calendar month
is less than $50 million. The Loan Parties are further restricted from
making capital expenditures in excess of $100 million during any 12-month
period following any month in which average daily cash availability falls below
$135 million (until such time as average daily cash availability for three
consecutive months thereafter is greater than or equal to $135 million).

The credit facility contains customary representations
and warranties and affirmative covenants, as well as customary events of
default, including payment defaults, breach of representations and warranties,
covenant defaults, cross-defaults and cross-accelerations, certain
bankruptcy or insolvency events, judgment defaults, certain ERISA-related
events, changes in control, and invalidity of any credit facility collateral
document or guarantee.

As of December 31,
2006, there was approximately $176.4 million of available credit (based on
the borrowing base) and there were no loans or letters of credit outstanding
under the credit facility.

Notes Payable

From time to time, CFL
receives advances from us and from CFL’s minority interest holder to finance
major capital expenditures. The advances outstanding are evidenced by an
unsecured promissory note due December 31, 2009 and bear interest at
market rates. The amount shown as notes payable represents the advances payable
to CFL’s minority interest holder. The carrying value of notes payable
approximates fair value.

22.

Leases

We have operating leases for certain property and
equipment under various noncancelable agreements, the most significant of which
are rail car leases and barge tow charters for the distribution of fertilizer,
and a corporate office lease. The rail car leases currently have minimum terms
ranging from one to five years and the barge charter commitments currently have
terms of one year. We also have terminal and warehouse storage agreements for
our distribution system, some of which contain minimum throughput requirements.
The storage agreements contain minimum terms ranging from one to three years
and commonly contain automatic annual renewal provisions thereafter unless
canceled by either party.

In 2006, we entered into a
ten-year operating lease agreement for a new corporate headquarters located in
Deerfield, IL. The corporate office lease agreement includes leasehold
incentives, rent holidays


CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

and
scheduled rent increases that are expensed on a straight-line basis in
accordance with SFAS No. 13—

Accounting for Leases.

Our
other operating lease agreements do not contain significant contingent rents,
leasehold incentives, rent holidays, scheduled rent increases, concessions or
unusual provisions.

minimum payments under noncancelable operating leases, barge charters and
storage agreements at December 31, 2006 are shown below.

24.

Derivative
Financial Instruments

We
use natural gas in the manufacture of nitrogen fertilizer products. Because
natural gas prices are volatile, our Natural Gas Acquisition Policy includes
the objective of providing protection against significant adverse natural gas
price movements. We manage the risk of changes in gas prices through the use of
physical gas supply contracts and derivative financial instruments covering
periods not exceeding three years. The derivative instruments that we currently
use are swaps. These contracts reference primarily NYMEX futures contract
prices, which represent fair value at any given time. The contracts are traded
in months forward and settlements are scheduled to coincide with anticipated
gas purchases during those future periods. We use derivative instruments
primarily to lock in a substantial portion of our margin on sales under the
forward pricing program. We also establish natural gas derivative positions
that are associated with anticipated natural gas requirements unrelated to our
forward pricing program.


CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

Until the fourth quarter of 2005, we designated our
gas derivatives as cash flow hedges, whereby the derivatives were recorded at
fair value on the balance sheet as assets and liabilities with any changes in
fair value recorded initially in other comprehensive income (OCI). Unrealized
gains or losses on effective cash flow hedges were deferred in OCI until the
inventory manufactured with the hedged natural gas was sold and released to
cost of sales.

During the second half of 2005, volatility in the
natural gas environment increased our uncertainty regarding future operating
rates and required that we increase our flexibility in product sourcing
decisions. This increased flexibility in sourcing reduced our ability to
predict future natural gas requirements with a high degree of certainty and led
us to discontinue hedge accounting beginning in the fourth quarter of 2005.
Changes in the fair value of the derivatives not designated as hedges are
recorded in cost of sales as the changes occur. We continue to use natural gas
derivatives, primarily as an economic hedge of gas price risk, but without the
application of hedge accounting for financial reporting purposes. Cash flows
related to natural gas derivatives are reported as operating activities.

For the year 2006, we recorded directly to cost of
sales derivative losses of $93.7 million, consisting of $63.0 million
in realized losses and $30.7 million of unrealized mark-to-market losses.

In 2005, we recorded directly to cost of sales net
gains of approximately $14.0 million, primarily for hedge positions
terminated in the third quarter, offset by unrealized mark-to-market losses of
$9.3 million in the fourth quarter on derivatives not designated as
hedges. Ineffective gains and losses in 2005 and 2004 when hedge accounting was
being applied were insignificant.

At December 31, 2006,
we had unrealized losses of $37.8 million on 30.6 million MMBtus of
gas swap contracts. At December 31, 2005, we had unrealized losses of
$0.5 million on 14.1 million MMBtus of gas swap contracts.

Stockholder Rights
Plan

We have adopted a stockholder rights plan (the plan).
The existence of the rights and the rights plan is intended to deter coercive
or partial offers which may not provide fair value to all stockholders and to
enhance our ability to represent all of our stockholders and thereby maximize
stockholder value.

Under the plan, each share of common stock has
attached to it one right. Each right entitles the holder to purchase one
one-thousandth of a share of a series of our preferred stock designated as Series A
junior participating preferred stock at an exercise price of $90, subject to
adjustment. Rights will only be exercisable under limited circumstances
specified in the rights agreement when there has been a distribution of the
rights and such rights are no longer redeemable by us. A distribution of the
rights would occur upon the earlier of (i) 10 business days following a
public announcement that any person or group has acquired beneficial ownership
of 15% or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock, other than as a
result of repurchases of stock by us or inadvertence by certain stockholders as
set forth in the rights agreement; or (ii) 10 business days, or such later
date as our board of directors may determine, after the date of the
commencement of a tender offer or exchange offer that would result in any
person, group or related persons acquiring beneficial ownership of 15% or more
of the outstanding shares of our common stock. The rights will expire at 5:00 P.M.
(New York City time) on July 21, 2015, unless such date is extended or the
rights are earlier redeemed or exchanged by us.

If any person or group acquires shares representing
15% or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock, the rights will
entitle a holder, other than such person, any member of such group or related
person, all of whose rights will be null and void, to acquire a number of
additional shares of our common stock having a market value of twice the exercise
price of each right. If we are involved in a merger or other business
combination transaction, each right will entitle its holder to purchase, at the
right’s then-current exercise price, a number of shares of the acquiring or
surviving company’s common stock having a market value at that time of twice
the right’s exercise price.

The description and terms
of the rights are set forth in a Rights Agreement dated as of July 21,
2005, between us and The Bank of New York, as Rights Agent.

Preferred Stock

We are authorized to issue 50 million shares of
$0.01 par value preferred stock. Our amended and restated certificate of
incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors, without any further
stockholder action or approval, to issue these shares in one or more classes or
series, and to fix the rights, preferences and privileges of the shares of each
wholly unissued class or series and any of its qualifications, limitations or
restrictions. In connection with our Stockholder Rights Plan, 500,000 shares
of preferred stock have been designated as Series A junior participating
preferred stock. No shares of preferred stock have been issued.

Prior to our IPO in August 2005,
patronage preferred stock was held by our pre-IPO owners.

The unrealized gain (loss) on derivatives was from
natural gas derivatives that were designated as cash flow hedges. In the fourth
quarter of 2005, we discontinued hedge accounting, thereby no longer deferring
such unrealized gains and losses into OCI. The balances at December 31,
2005 and December 31, 2004 were reclassified into earnings in 2006 and
2005, respectively. See Note 24 for additional information on derivatives.

In 2006 we adopted SFAS No. 158

—

Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other
Postretirement Plans—an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and
132R

.

The $30.9 million defined benefit pension
plan adjustment at December 31, 2006, is net of a deferred tax benefit of
$18.7 million. This adjustment represents the impact of recognizing the
funded status of pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities on the
consolidated balance sheet. The $9.3 million minimum pension liability
adjustment at December 31, 2005 is net of a deferred tax benefit of
$6.2 million. The $6.5 million minimum pension liability adjustment
at December 31, 2004 is net of a deferred tax benefit of
$4.4 million. See Note 5 for additional information on pension and
other postretirement benefits.

The unrealized gain on
securities of $0.3 million in 2006 is net of deferred taxes of
$0.2 million. The unrealized gain on securities of $0.1 million in
2005 is net of deferred taxes of $0.1 million. The unrealized gain relates
to securities in our nonqualified employee benefit plan trust.

Stock-Based
Compensation

2005 Equity and
Incentive Plan

In connection with our
IPO, our board of directors adopted the CF Industries Holdings, Inc. 2005
Equity and Incentive Plan (the plan). Under the plan, we may grant incentive
stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights,
restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance awards (payable in cash
or stock), and other stock-based awards to our officers, employees,
consultants and independent contractors (including non-employee directors). The
purpose of the plan is to provide an incentive for our employees, officers,
consultants and non-employee directors that is aligned with the interests of
our stockholders.


CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

Share Reserve

We have reserved a total
8,250,000 shares of our common stock and at December 31, 2006, we had
4,842,798 shares currently available for future awards under the plan, but
no more than 2,725,398 shares of our common stock are available for issuance
under the plan for any awards other than stock options and stock appreciation
rights. If any outstanding award expires for any reason or is settled in cash,
any unissued shares subject to the award will again be available for issuance
under the plan. If a participant pays the exercise price of an option by
delivering to us previously owned shares, only the number of shares we issue in
excess of the surrendered shares will count against the plan’s share limit.
Also, if the full number of shares subject to an option is not issued upon
exercise for any reason (including to satisfy a minimum tax withholding
obligation), only the net number of shares actually issued upon exercise will
count against the plan’s share limit. Our current source of shares for restricted
stock grants and stock option exercises is newly issued shares.

Individual Award
Limits

The plan provides that no
more than 1,237,500 underlying shares may be granted to a participant in any
one calendar year in the form of stock options and stock appreciation rights.
The plan also provides that no more than 618,750 shares underlying any
other type of equity award may be granted to a participant in any one calendar
year. The maximum value of the aggregate cash payment that any participant may
receive with respect to cash-based awards under the plan is $3 million
with respect to any annual performance period and $3 million per year for
any performance period exceeding one year in length.

Stock Options

Under the 2005 Equity and Incentive Plan, we granted
to plan participants nonqualified options to purchase shares of our common
stock. The exercise price of these options is equal to the market price of our
common stock on the date of grant. The contractual life of the options is ten
years and one-third of the options vest on each of the first three
anniversaries of the date of grant. Accelerated vesting provisions exist for
participants eligible for retirement at specified ages.

The
fair value of each stock option award was estimated using the Black-Scholes
option valuation model that uses the assumptions shown in the following table.

In 2006, expected volatilities were based on
historical and implied volatilities from the stock of comparable companies and
one year of our historical stock prices. In 2005, expected volatilities were
based on implied volatilities from the stock of comparable companies and other
factors. The expected term of options granted was estimated based on the
contractual term of the instruments and participant’s expected exercise and
post-vesting employment termination behavior. The risk-free rate for the
expected life of the options was based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in
effect at the time of grant.

Cash received from stock option exercises for the year
ended December 31, 2006 was $160,000, and the actual tax benefit realized
was approximately $18,000. The pre-tax intrinsic value of stock options
exercised in 2006 was $51,000. No options were exercised in 2005.

options granted in 2005 was $7.12. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the
total grant date fair value of vested options, including options that would
vest upon retirement, was $7.8 million and $1.0 million,
respectively.

Restricted Stock

Under the 2005 Equity and Incentive Plan, we granted
certain key employees and non-management members of our Board of Directors
shares of restricted stock. The grant date fair value of the restricted stock
is equal to the market price of our common stock on the date of grant. The
restricted stock awarded to key employees vests three years from the date of
grant; however, accelerated vesting provisions exist for participants eligible
for retirement at specified ages. The restricted stock awarded to
non-management members of our Board of Directors vests the earlier of one year
from the date of grant or the date of the

meeting. During the vesting period, the holders of the restricted stock are
entitled to dividends and voting rights.

An excess tax benefit is
generated when the realized tax benefit from the vesting of restricted stock,
or a stock option exercise, exceeds the previously recognized deferred tax
asset. SFAS No. 123R requires excess tax benefits to be reported as a
financing cash inflow rather than a reduction of taxes paid. In 2006, excess
tax benefits were insignificant.

Contingencies

Litigation

From time to time, we are
subject to ordinary, routine legal proceedings related to the usual conduct of
our business, including proceedings regarding public utility and transportation
rates, environmental matters, taxes and permits relating to the operations of
our various plants and facilities. Based on the information available as of the
date of this filing, we believe that the ultimate outcome of these matters will
not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results
of operations.

Environmental

In December 2004 and January 2005, the
United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) inspected our Plant City,
Florida phosphate fertilizer complex to evaluate the facility’s compliance with
the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), the federal statute that
governs the generation, transportation, treatment, storage and disposal of
hazardous wastes. This inspection was undertaken as a part of a broad
enforcement initiative commenced by the EPA to evaluate whether mineral
processing and mining facilities, including, in particular, all wet process
phosphoric acid production facilities, are in compliance with RCRA, and the
extent to which such facilities’ waste management practices have impacted the
environment.

By letter dated September 27, 2005, EPA Region 4
issued to the Company a Notice of Violation (NOV) and Compliance Evaluation
Inspection Report. The NOV and Compliance Evaluation Inspection Report alleged
a number of violations of RCRA, including violations relating to recordkeeping,
the failure to properly make hazardous waste determinations as required by
RCRA, and alleged treatment of sulfuric acid waste without a permit. The most
significant allegation in the NOV is that the Plant City facility’s reuse of
phosphoric acid process water (which is otherwise exempt from regulation as a
hazardous waste) in the production of ammoniated phosphate fertilizer, and the
return of this process water to the facility’s process water recirculating
system, have resulted in the disposal of hazardous waste into the system
without a permit. The Compliance Evaluation Inspection Report indicates that as
a result, the entire process water system, including all pipes, ditches,
cooling ponds and gypsum stacks, could be regulated as hazardous waste
management units under RCRA.

Several of our competitors have received NOVs making
this same allegation. This particular recycling of process water is common in
the industry and, the Company believes, was authorized by the EPA in 1990. The
Company also believes that this allegation is inconsistent with recent case law
governing the scope of the EPA’s regulatory authority under RCRA. If the EPA’s
position is eventually upheld, the Company could incur material expenditures in
order to modify its practices, or it may be required to comply with regulations
applicable to hazardous waste treatment, storage or disposal facilities. If the
Company is required to comply with such obligations, it could incur material
capital and operating expenditures or may be required to cease operation of the
water recirculating system if it is determined that it does not meet RCRA
standards. This would cause a significant disruption of the operations of the
Plant City facility.

The NOV indicated that the Company is liable for
penalties up to the statutory maximum (for example, the statutory maximum per
day of noncompliance for each violation that occurred after March 15, 2004
is $32,500 per day). Although penalties of this magnitude are rarely, if ever,
imposed, the Company is at risk of incurring substantial civil penalties with
respect to these allegations. The EPA has referred this matter to the United
States Department of Justice (DOJ) for enforcement. The Company has entered
into discussions with the DOJ that have included not only the issues identified
in the NOV but other operational practices of the Company and its competitors.
The Company does not know if this matter will be resolved prior to the
commencement of litigation by the United States.


CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

In connection with the RCRA enforcement initiative,
the EPA collected samples of soil, groundwater and various waste streams at the
Plant City facility. The analysis of the split samples collected by the Company
during the EPA’s inspection did not identify hazardous waste disposal issues
impacting the site. The EPA’s sampling results appear to be consistent with the
Company’s results. Pursuant to a 1992 consent order with the State of Florida,
the Company captures and reuses groundwater that has been impacted as a result
of the former operation of an unlined gypsum stack at the site. Although the
Company believes that it has evaluated and is remediating the impacts resulting
from its historic activities, the DOJ and the EPA have indicated that they will
be seeking additional environmental investigation at the facilities subject to
the enforcement initiative, including Plant City. In addition, we understand
that the EPA may decide to inspect our Bartow, Florida property, where we
formerly manufactured phosphoric acid. The EPA has requested and the Company
has provided copies of existing monitoring data for this facility. Depending on
the conclusions that the EPA reaches after reviewing this data, the EPA may
require that an investigation of environmental conditions be undertaken at the
Bartow facility.

We are subject to a
variety of environmental laws and regulations in all jurisdictions in which we
operate. When it is probable that environmental liabilities exist and when
reasonable estimates of such liabilities can be made, we have established
associated reserves. These estimated liabilities are subject to change as
additional information becomes available regarding the magnitude and timing of
possible cleanup costs, the relative expense and effectiveness of alternative clean-up
methods, and other possible liabilities associated with such situations.
However, based on the information available as of the date of this filing, we
believe that any additional costs that may be incurred as more information
becomes available will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
financial position, although such costs could have a material effect on the
Company’s results of operations or cash flows in a particular period.

Related
Party Transactions

Initial Public
Offering

Prior to the completion of our initial public offering
in August 2005, the eight pre-IPO owners of our predecessor company, CF
Industries, Inc., each owned more than 5% of the common stock of CF Industries, Inc.,
and each nominated one person to serve on the board of directors of CF
Industries, Inc.

Pursuant to a reorganization effected in connection
with the initial public offering, the pre-IPO owners of CF Industries, Inc.
received shares of our common stock and cash in exchange for their outstanding
equity interests in CF Industries, Inc. In the aggregate, these pre-IPO
owners received 7,562,499 shares of our common stock and
$715.4 million in cash. The cash amount represented all of the proceeds to
us from the public offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions.

GROWMARK, Inc.
(GROWMARK) and CHS, Inc. (CHS), are significant holders of our common
stock. As of December 31, 2006, GROWMARK was the beneficial owner of
approximately 9% of our outstanding common stock, and CHS was the beneficial
owner of approximately 3% of our outstanding common stock. William Davisson,
the chief executive officer of GROWMARK, and John D. Johnson, the president and
chief executive officer of CHS, are members of our board of directors.

Registration Rights
Agreement

In connection with our
initial public offering and related reorganization, we entered into a
registration rights agreement with GROWMARK. Pursuant to this agreement,
GROWMARK has certain demand and piggyback registration rights with respect to
the 5,412,103 shares of our common stock that it received in the
reorganization, of which it still held 4,912,103 shares at December 31,
2006. These shares are referred to as the registrable securities. Under the
registration rights agreement, the holders of not less than 25% of the
outstanding registrable securities may request up to two demand registrations.
Pursuant to the registration rights agreement, we are required to pay all
registration expenses required to register the registrable securities, subject
to certain limitations. No securities have been registered pursuant to this
agreement and we have not incurred any expenses under this agreement.

Product Sales

Agriliance accounted for 25% of consolidated net sales
in 2006 and 29% of consolidated net sales in 2005 and 2004. GROWMARK accounted
for 12%, 14%, and 13% of our consolidated net sales in 2006, 2005, and 2004,
respectively. See Note 29 for additional information on sales to
Agriliance and GROWMARK.

In 2005 and 2004, sales to our pre-IPO owners,
including Agriliance and GROWMARK, accounted for $1,062.7 million or 56%
of our consolidated net sales and $881.6 million, or 53% of consolidated
net sales, respectively.

In addition to purchasing
fertilizer from us, Agriliance and GROWMARK also contracted with us to store
fertilizer products at certain of our warehouses. In connection with these
storage arrangements we received approximately $1.3 million,
$1.5 million, and $0.4 million from Agriliance in 2006, 2005, and
2004, respectively, and we received $0.7 million and $0.2 million
from GROWMARK in 2006 and 2005, respectively. We also received
$0.2 million and $0.1 million in 2005 and 2004 from other pre-IPO
owners.

Accounts Receivable

Accounts receivable at December 31,
2006 and December 31, 2005 includes $22.5 million and
$7.5 million due from Agriliance and $9.1 million and
$4.8 million due from GROWMARK.


CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

Supply Contracts

In connection with our initial public offering, we
entered into multi-year supply contracts with Agriliance and GROWMARK relating
to purchases of fertilizer products. The initial terms of the supply contracts
last until June 30, 2008 for the contract with GROWMARK and until June 30,
2010 for the contract with Agriliance. The terms will be automatically extended
for successive one-year periods unless a termination notice is given by either
party.

Each contract specifies a sales target volume and a
requirement volume for the first contract year. The requirement volume is a
percentage of the sales target volume and represents the volume of fertilizer
that we are obligated to sell, and the customer is obligated to purchase,
during the first contract year. Thereafter, the sales target volume is subject
to yearly adjustment by mutual agreement or, failing such agreement, to an
amount specified by us which is not less than 95% nor more than 100% of the
prior year’s sales target volume. The requirement volume is also subject to
yearly adjustment to an amount specified by the customer which is not less than
65% nor more than 100% of the then applicable sales target volume. The
contracts also contain reciprocal “meet or release” provisions pursuant to
which each party must provide the other party with notice and the opportunity
to match a transaction with a third party if such a transaction would impact
the party’s willingness or ability to supply or purchase, as the case may be,
the then applicable sales target volume. The “meet or release” provisions may
not, however, reduce the requirements volume.

The prices for product sold under the supply contracts
vary depending on the type of sale selected by the customer. The customer may
select (i) cash sales at prices that are published in our weekly cash
price list, (ii) index sales at a published index price, (iii) forward
pricing sales under our forward pricing program, or (iv) sales negotiated
between the parties. The supply contracts also provide for performance
incentives based on (i) the percentage of the sales target volume actually
purchased, (ii) the timing of purchases under our forward pricing program,
(iii) the amount of purchases under our forward pricing program, (iv) specifying
a requirement volume in excess of the then applicable minimum requirement
volume, and (v) quantity discounts for overall volume.

We have agreed with Agriliance and GROWMARK that the
prices charged for cash sales, index sales, and forward pricing sales will be
the same prices we charge all of our similarly situated customers, and that the
performance incentives offered to them will be equal to the highest comparable
incentives offered to other requirement contract customers. We believe the
performance incentives offered under these supply contracts are consistent with
the incentives offered to similarly situated customers in our industry in
transactions between unaffiliated parties.

Our supply contracts with
Agriliance and GROWMARK also provide them with a right of first offer for the
purchase of certain of our storage and terminal facilities. A portion of
GROWMARK’s requirement volume is also contingent on the purchase from GROWMARK
by one of its customers of specified amounts of certain fertilizer products.

Net Operating Loss
Carryforwards

Upon the completion of our IPO, CF Industries, Inc.
ceased to be a nonexempt cooperative for federal income tax purposes. On the
date of our IPO, CF Industries, Inc. had a deferred tax asset related to
net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs) generated from business conducted with
CF Industries, Inc.’s pre-IPO owners. These net operating loss
carryforwards totaled $250 million, with expirations ranging from 2021
through 2023. The income tax provision for the year ended December 31,
2005 includes a charge of $99.9 million to establish a 100% valuation
allowance for the deferred tax asset related to these NOLs. The valuation
allowance is required because there is substantial uncertainty under existing
tax law


CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

whether any tax benefits
from this deferred tax asset will be realized since CF Industries, Inc. is
no longer a cooperative for federal income tax purposes.

In connection with the IPO
and related reorganization, we entered into an NOL agreement with the pre-IPO
owners of CF Industries, Inc., including CHS and GROWMARK. Under the NOL
Agreement, if it is finally determined that CF Industries, Inc.’s net
operating loss carryforwards can be utilized subsequent to the IPO, we will pay
to CF Industries, Inc.’s pre-IPO owners an amount equal to the resulting
federal and state income taxes actually saved.

Hayes Terminal

During 2005, we sold
GROWMARK certain assets of our former terminal in Hayes, Illinois for a gross
purchase price of $200,000. We had not operated this terminal since 1987. The
board of directors of our predecessor company, CF Industries, Inc.,
approved this transaction in July 2004, and we believe the terms and
conditions of the transaction were no less favorable to us than could have been
obtained from an unaffiliated purchaser.

Canadian
Fertilizers Limited

GROWMARK owns 9% of the
outstanding common stock of CFL, our Canadian joint venture, and elects one
director to the CFL board.

Quarterly
Data—Unaudited

The following tables present the unaudited quarterly
results of operations for the eight quarters ended December 31, 2006. This
quarterly information has been prepared on the same basis as the audited
consolidated financial statements and, in the opinion of management, reflects
all adjustments necessary for the fair representation of the information for
the periods presented. This data should be read in conjunction with the audited
financial statements and related disclosures. Operating results for any quarter
apply to that quarter only and are not necessarily indicative of results for
any future period.


CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

Prior
to the consummation of the IPO, CF Holdings did not have any activities or
operations. Therefore, with the exception of stockholders’ equity and per share
amounts, management believes that the current financial statements of CF
Holdings are comparable to the historical financial statements of CF Industries, Inc.
The pro forma diluted net earnings (loss) per share information presented below
gives effect to the IPO and related reorganization transaction assuming that
they had occurred as of the beginning of the earliest period presented.

Controls and Procedures.

(a)

Disclosure Controls and
Procedures.

The Company’s management, with the participation of the
Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated
the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as such
term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) as of the end
of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, the Company’s
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of
the end of such period, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are
effective in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting, on a timely
basis, information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that
it files or submits under the Exchange Act and are effective in ensuring that
information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the
Company’s management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.

Management’s Report on Internal
Control over Financial Reporting

The Company’s

management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and
15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the
participation of our senior management, including our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, we assessed the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, using the
criteria set forth in the

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management has concluded that
our internal control over financial reporting is effective as of December 31,
2006.

KPMG LLP

,

our independent registered public
accounting firm, has issued an audit report on management’s assessment of our
internal control over financial reporting which is included herein.

(b)

Internal Control over Financial
Reporting.

There have not been any changes in the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended December 31,
2006 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.


CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.

Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm—Internal Control over Financial
Reporting

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

CF Industries Holdings, Inc.:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in
the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting,

that CF Industries
Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based
on criteria established in Internal
Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting
is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that CF
Industries Holdings, Inc. maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on criteria
established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also, in our
opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on

criteria established in
Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee

of

Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission

.
