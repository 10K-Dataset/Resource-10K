PART I

Item 1. Business

General

Amphenol Corporation (“Amphenol” or the “Company”) is
one of the world’s largest designers, manufacturers and marketers of
electrical, electronic and fiber optic connectors, interconnect systems and
coaxial and flat-ribbon cable. The primary end markets for the Company’s
products are:

•

communication systems for the converging
technologies of voice, video and data communications;

•

a broad range of industrial applications
including factory automation and motion control systems, medical and industrial
instrumentation, mass transportation and natural resource exploration, and
automotive applications; and

•

commercial and military aerospace
applications.

The Company’s strategy is to provide its customers
with comprehensive design capabilities, a broad selection of products and a
high level of service on a worldwide basis while maintaining continuing
programs of productivity improvement and cost control. For 2002, the Company
reported net sales, operating income and net income of $1,062.0 million, $173.9
million and $80.3 million, respectively. The table below summarizes information
regarding the Company’s primary markets and end applications for the Company’s
products:


The Company designs and manufactures connectors and
interconnect systems which are used primarily to conduct electrical and optical
signals for a wide range of sophisticated electronic applications. The Company
believes, based primarily on published market research, that it is one of the
largest connector manufacturers in the world. The Company has developed a broad
range of connector and interconnect products for communications equipment
applications including the converging voice, video and data communications
markets. The Company is also one of the leaders in developing interconnect
products for factory automation, machine tools, instrumentation and medical
systems, mass transportation applications and automotive applications,
including airbags, pretensioner seatbelts and other on board automotive
electronics. In addition, the Company is the leading supplier of high
performance, military-specification, circular environmental connectors that
require superior performance and reliability under conditions of stress and in
hostile environments. These conditions are frequently encountered in commercial
and military aerospace applications and other demanding industrial applications
such as oil exploration, medical instrumentation and off-road construction.

Industry analysts estimate that the worldwide market
for interconnect products will grow approximately 6% in 2003. The Company
believes that the worldwide industry for interconnect products and systems is
highly fragmented with over 2,000 producers of connectors worldwide, of which
the 10 largest, including Amphenol, accounted for a combined market share of
approximately 47% in 2002. Industry analysts estimate that the total sales for
the industry were approximately $30 billion in 2002.

The Company’s Times Fiber subsidiary is the world’s
second largest producer of coaxial cable for the cable television market. The
Company believes that its Times Fiber unit is one of the lowest cost producers
of coaxial cable for cable television, and that it is one of the technological
leaders in increasing the bandwidth of coaxial cable products. The Company’s
coaxial cable and connector products are used in cable television systems
including full service cable television/telecommunication systems being
installed by cable operators and telecommunication companies offering video,
voice and data services. The Company is also a major supplier of coaxial cable
to the developing international cable television market.

The Company is a global manufacturer employing
advanced manufacturing processes. The Company manufactures and assembles its
products at facilities in the Americas, Europe, Asia and Australia. The Company
sells its connector products through its own global sales force and independent
manufacturers’ representatives to thousands of OEMs in approximately 60
countries throughout the world as well as through a global network of
electronics distributors. The Company sells its coaxial cable products
primarily to cable television operators and to telecommunication companies who
have entered the broadband communications market. For the year 2002,
approximately 50% of the Company’s net sales were in North America, 26% were in
Europe and 24% were in Asia and other countries.

The Company implements its product development
strategy through product design teams and collaboration arrangements with
customers which result in the Company obtaining approved vendor status for its
customers’ new products and programs. The Company seeks to have its products
become widely accepted within the industry for similar applications and
products manufactured by other potential customers, which the Company believes
will provide additional sources of future revenue. By developing application
specific products, the Company has decreased its exposure to standard products
which generally experience greater pricing pressure. In addition to product
design teams and customer collaboration arrangements, the Company uses key
account managers to manage customer relationships on a global basis such that
it can bring to bear its total resources to meet the worldwide needs of its
multinational customers. The Company is also focused on making strategic acquisitions
in certain markets to further broaden and enhance its product offerings and
expand its global capabilities.


Business Segments

The following table sets forth the dollar amounts of
the Company’s net trade sales for its business segments. For a discussion of
factors affecting changes in sales by business segment and additional segment
financial data, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 7 in the Company’s “Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.”

(1) Based on customer location to which product is shipped.

Interconnect
Products and Assemblies.

The Company produces a broad range
of interconnect products and assemblies primarily for voice, video and data
communication systems, commercial and military aerospace systems, automotive
and mass transportation applications, and industrial and factory automation
equipment. Interconnect products include connectors, which when attached to an
electronic or fiber optic cable, a printed circuit board or other device,
facilitate electronic or fiber optic transmission. Interconnect assemblies
generally consist of a system of cable and connectors for linking electronic
and fiber optic equipment. The Company designs and produces a broad range of
connector and cable assembly products used in communication applications, such
as: engineered cable assemblies used in base stations for wireless
communication systems and internet networking equipment; smart card acceptor
devices used in mobile GSM telephones, cable modems and other applications to
facilitate reading data from smart cards; fiber optic couplers and connectors
used in fiber optic signal transmission; input/output connectors and assemblies
used for servers and data storage devices and linking personal computers and
peripheral equipment; and sculptured flexible circuits used for integrating
printed circuit boards in communication applications. The Company also designs
and produces a broad range of radio frequency connector products used in
telecommunications, computer and office equipment, instrumentation equipment
and local area networks. The Company’s radio frequency interconnect products
and assemblies are also used in base stations, mobile communication devices and
other components of cellular and personal communications networks.

The Company believes that it is the largest supplier
of high performance, military-specification, circular environmental connectors.
Such connectors require superior performance and reliability under conditions
of stress and in hostile environments. High performance environmental
connectors are generally used to interconnect electronic and fiber optic
systems in sophisticated aerospace, military, commercial and industrial
equipment. These applications present demanding technological requirements in
that the connectors can be


subject to rapid and severe temperature changes, vibration, humidity
and nuclear radiation. Frequent applications of these connectors include
aircraft, guided missiles, radar, military vehicles, equipment for spacecraft,
energy, medical instrumentation, geophysical applications and off-road
construction equipment. The Company also designs and produces industrial
interconnect products used in a variety of applications such as factory
automation equipment, mass transportation applications including railroads and
marine transportation; and automotive safety products including interconnect
devices and systems used in automotive airbags, pretensioner seatbelts,
antilock braking systems and other on board automotive electronic systems. The
Company also designs and produces highly-engineered cable and backplane
assemblies. Such assemblies are specially designed by the Company in conjunction
with OEM customers for specific applications, primarily for computer, wired and
wireless communication systems, office equipment and aerospace applications.
The cable assemblies utilize the Company’s connector and cable products as well
as components purchased from others.

Cable
Products.

The Company designs, manufactures and markets
coaxial cable primarily for use in the cable television industry. The Company
manufactures two primary types of coaxial cable: semi-flexible, which has an
aluminum tubular shield, and flexible, which has one or more braided metallic
shields. Semi-flexible coaxial cable is used in the trunk and feeder
distribution portion of cable television systems, and flexible cable (also
known as drop cable) is used primarily for hookups from the feeder cable to the
cable television subscriber’s residence. Flexible cable is also used in other
communication applications. The Company has also developed a broad line of
radio frequency connectors for coaxial cable and fiber optic interconnect components
for full service cable television/telecommunication networks.

The rapid development in fiber optic technologies,
digital compression (which allows several channels to be transmitted within the
same bandwidth that a single analog channel currently requires) and other
communication technologies, including the Company’s development of higher
capacity coaxial cable, have resulted in technologies that enable cable
television systems to provide channel capacity in excess of 500 channels. Such
expanded channel capacity, along with other component additions, permit cable
operators to offer full service networks with a variety of capabilities
including near video-on-demand, pay-per-view special events, home shopping
networks, interactive entertainment and education services, telephone services
and high-speed access to data resources such as the Internet. With respect to
expanded channel capacity systems, cable operators have generally adopted, and
the Company believes that for the foreseeable future will continue to adopt, a
cable system using both fiber optic cable and coaxial cable. Such systems
combine the advantages of fiber optic cable in transmitting clear signals over
a long distance without amplification, with the advantages of coaxial cable in
ease of installation, low cost and compatibility with the receiving components
of the customer’s communication devices. The Company believes that while system
operators are likely to increase their use of fiber optic cable for the trunk
and feeder portions of the cable systems, there will be an ongoing need for
high capacity coaxial cable for the local distribution and street-to-the-home
portions of the cable system. In addition, U.S. cable system designs are
increasingly being employed in international markets where cable television
penetration is generally lower than in the U.S. The Company believes the
development of cable television systems in international markets presents a
significant opportunity to increase sales of its coaxial cable products.

The Company is also a leading producer of flat-ribbon
cable, a cable made of wires assembled side by side such that the finished
cable is flat. Flat-ribbon cable is used to connect internal components in
systems with space and component configuration limitations. The product is used
in computer and office equipment components as well as in a variety of
telecommunication applications.


International Operations

The Company believes that its global presence is an
important competitive advantage as it allows the Company to provide quality
products on a timely and worldwide basis to its multinational customers.
Approximately 53% of the Company’s sales for the year ended December 31, 2002
were outside the United States. Approximately 49% of such international sales
were in Europe. The Company has manufacturing and assembly facilities in the
United Kingdom, Germany, France, the Czech Republic, and Estonia and sales
offices in most European markets. The Company’s European operations generally
have strong positions in their respective local markets. The balance of the
Company’s international activities are located in Asia, Canada, Latin America
and Australia. Asian operations include manufacturing facilities in Japan,
Taiwan, China, Korea, India and Malaysia. The Company’s international
manufacturing and assembly facilities generally serve the respective local
markets and coordinate product design and manufacturing responsibility with the
Company’s other operations around the world. The Company has low cost
manufacturing and assembly facilities in Mexico, China, India and Eastern
Europe to serve regional and world markets.

Customers

The Company’s products are used in a wide variety of
applications by numerous customers, the largest of which accounted for
approximately 4% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2002. The Company
sells its products to over 10,000 customer locations worldwide. The Company’s
products are sold both directly to OEMs, cable system operators, telecommunication
companies and through manufacturers’ representatives and distributors. There
has been a trend on the part of OEM customers to consolidate their lists of
qualified suppliers to companies that have a global presence, can meet quality
and delivery standards, have a broad product portfolio and design capability,
and have competitive prices. The Company has focused its global resources to
position itself to compete effectively in this environment. The Company has
concentrated its efforts on service and productivity improvements including
advanced computer aided design and manufacturing systems, statistical process
controls and just-in-time inventory programs to increase product quality and
shorten product delivery schedules. The Company’s strategy is to provide
comprehensive design capabilities, a broad selection of products and a high
level of service in the areas in which it competes. The Company has achieved a
preferred supplier designation from many of its OEM customers.

The Company’s sales to distributors represented
approximately 20% of the Company’s 2002 sales. The Company’s recognized brand
names, including “Amphenol,” “Times Fiber,” “Tuchel,” “Socapex,” “Sine,”
“Spectra-Strip,” “Pyle-National,” “Matrix,” “Kai Jack” and others, together with
the Company’s strong connector design-in position (products that are specified
in customer drawings), enhance its ability to reach the secondary market
through its network of distributors.

Manufacturing

The Company employs advanced manufacturing processes
including molding, stamping, plating, turning, extruding, die casting and
assembly operations as well as proprietary process technology for flat-ribbon
and coaxial cable production. The Company’s manufacturing facilities are
generally vertically integrated operations from the initial design stage
through final design and manufacturing. Outsourcing of certain fabrication
processes is used when cost-effective. Substantially all of the Company’s
manufacturing facilities are certified to the ISO9000 series of quality
standards.


The Company employs a global manufacturing strategy to
lower its production costs and to improve service to customers. The Company
sources its products on a worldwide basis with manufacturing and assembly
operations in the Americas, Europe, Asia and Australia. To better serve high
volume OEM customers, the Company has established just-in-time facilities near
major customers.

The Company’s policy is to maintain strong cost
controls in its manufacturing and assembly operations. The Company has
undertaken programs to rationalize its production facilities, reduce expenses
and maximize the return on capital expenditures. The programs to improve
productivity are ongoing.

The Company purchases a wide variety of raw materials
for the manufacture of its products, including precious metals such as gold and
silver used in plating; aluminum, brass, steel, copper and bimetallic products
used for cable, contacts and connector shells; and plastic materials used for
cable and connector bodies and inserts. Such raw materials are generally
available throughout the world and are purchased locally from a variety of
suppliers. The Company is not dependent upon any one source for raw materials,
or if one source is used the Company attempts to protect itself through
long-term supply agreements.

Research and Development

The Company’s research and development expense for the
creation of new and improved products and processes were $24.2 million, $22.6
million and $23.5 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The Company’s
research and development activities focus on selected product areas and are
performed by individual operating divisions. Generally, the operating divisions
work closely with OEM customers to develop highly-engineered products and
systems that meet customer needs. The Company focuses its research and
development efforts primarily on those product areas that it believes have the
potential for broad market applications and significant sales within a
one-to-three year period.

Trademarks and Patents

The Company owns a number of active patents worldwide.
While the Company considers its patents to be valuable assets, the Company does
not believe that its competitive position is dependent on patent protection or
that its operations are dependent on any individual patent. The Company regards
its trademarks “Amphenol,” “Times Fiber,” “Tuchel,” “Socapex,” “Sine,”
“Spectra-Strip,” “Pyle-National,” “Matrix,” “Kai Jack” and others to be of
value in its businesses. The Company has exclusive rights in all its major
markets to use these registered trademarks.

Competition

The Company encounters competition in substantially
all areas of its business. The Company competes primarily on the basis of
engineering, product quality, price, customer service and delivery time.
Competitors include large, diversified companies, some of which have
substantially greater assets and financial resources than the Company, as well
as medium to small companies. In the area of coaxial cable for cable
television, the Company believes that it and CommScope are the primary world
providers of such cable; however, CommScope is larger than the Company in this
market. In addition, the Company faces competition from other companies that
have concentrated their efforts in one or more areas of the coaxial cable
market.


Backlog

The Company estimates that its backlog of unfilled
orders was $224.0 million and $229.0 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. Orders typically fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on
customer demands and general business conditions. Unfilled orders may be
cancelled prior to shipment of goods. It is expected that all or a substantial
portion of the backlog will be filled within the next 12 months. Significant
elements of the Company’s business, such as sales to the cable television
industry, distributors, the computer industry, and other commercial customers,
generally have short lead times. Therefore, backlog may not be indicative of
future demand.

Employees

As of December 31, 2002, the Company had approximately
11,100 full-time employees worldwide. Of these employees, approximately 8,300
were hourly employees and the remainder were salaried. The Company had a one
week strike in October 1995 at its Sidney, New York facility relating to the
renewal of the labor contract at that facility with the International
Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. The Company has not had any
other significant work stoppages in the past ten years. The Company believes
that it has a good relationship with its unionized and non-unionized employees.

Item 2. Properties

The Company’s fixed assets include certain plants and
warehouses and a substantial quantity of machinery and equipment, most of which
is general purpose machinery and equipment using tools and fixtures and in many
instances having automatic control features and special adaptations. The
Company’s plants, warehouses, machinery and equipment are in good operating
condition, are well maintained, and substantially all of its facilities are in
regular use. The Company considers the present level of fixed assets along with
planned capital expenditures as suitable and adequate for operations in the
current business environment. At December 31, 2002, the Company operated a
total of 76 plants and warehouses of which (a) the locations in the U.S. had
approximately 1.9 million square feet, of which .8 million square feet were
leased; and (b) the locations outside the U.S. had approximately 2.4 million
square feet, of which 1.3 million square feet were leased.

The Company believes that its facilities are suitable
and adequate for the business conducted therein and are being appropriately
utilized for their intended purposes. Utilization of the facilities varies
based on demand for the products. The Company continuously reviews its
anticipated requirements for facilities and, based on that review, may from
time to time acquire or lease additional facilities and/or dispose of existing
facilities.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

The Company and its subsidiaries have been named as
defendants in several legal actions in which various amounts are claimed
arising from normal business activities. Although the amount of any ultimate
liability with respect to such matters cannot be precisely determined, in the
opinion of management, such matters are not expected to have a material effect
on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations.

Certain operations of the Company are subject to
federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations which govern the
discharge of pollutants into the air and water, as well as the handling and
disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. The Company believes that its
operations are currently in substantial compliance with all applicable
environmental laws and regulations and that the costs of continuing compliance
will not have a material effect on the Company’s financial condition or results
of operations.

Subsequent to the acquisition of Amphenol from Allied
Signal Corporation in 1987 (Allied Signal merged with Honeywell International
Inc. in December 1999 (“Honeywell”)), Amphenol and Honeywell have been named
jointly and severally liable as potentially responsible parties in relation to
several environmental cleanup sites. Amphenol and Honeywell have jointly
consented to perform certain investigations and remedial and monitoring
activities at two sites and they have been jointly ordered to perform work at
another site. The responsibility for costs incurred relating to these three
sites is apportioned between Amphenol and Honeywell based on an agreement
entered into in connection with the acquisition in 1987. For sites covered by
this agreement, to the extent that conditions or circumstances occurred or
existed at the time of or prior to the acquisition, Honeywell is currently
obligated to pay 80% of the costs up to $30 million and 100% of the costs in
excess of $30 million. At December 31, 2002, approximately $29.1 million of
costs have been incurred applicable to this agreement. Honeywell
representatives work closely with the Company in addressing the most
significant environmental liabilities.

Owners and occupiers of sites containing hazardous
substances, as well as generators of hazardous substances, are subject to broad
liability under various federal and state environmental laws and regulations,
including expenditures for cleanup and monitoring costs and potential damages
arising out of past disposal activities. Such liability in many cases may be
imposed regardless of fault or the legality of the original disposal


activity. The Company is currently performing monitoring activities at
its manufacturing site in Sidney, New York. The Company is also performing
monitoring, investigation, design and cleanup activities at three off-site
disposal sites previously utilized by the Company’s Sidney facility and others,
the “Richardson Hill” landfill, the “Route 8” landfill and the “Sidney Center”
landfill. The Company and Honeywell have entered into an administrative consent
order with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”)

and
are presently determining necessary and appropriate remedial measures for
“Richardson Hill”, which has been designated a “Superfund” site on the National
Priorities List under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation
and Liability Act of 1980. With respect to the second site, the “Route 8”
landfill, the Company initiated a remediation program pursuant to a Consent
Order with the New York Department of Environmental Protection and is continuing
to monitor the results of those remediation efforts. In December 1995, the
Company and Honeywell received a letter from the EPA demanding that the Company
and Honeywell accept responsibility for the investigation and cleanup of the
third site, Sidney Center landfill, another Superfund Site. The Sidney Center
landfill was a municipal landfill site utilized by the Company’s Sidney
facility and other local towns and businesses. In 1996, the Company and
Honeywell received a unilateral order from the EPA directing the Company and
Honeywell to perform certain investigation, design and cleanup activities at
the Sidney Center landfill site. The Company and Honeywell responded to the
unilateral order by agreeing to undertake certain remedial design activities.
In 1997, the EPA filed a lawsuit against the Company and Honeywell seeking
reimbursement of past costs expended by the EPA in connection with activities
at the Sidney Center landfill site and seeking to affix liability upon the
Company and Honeywell for all additional costs to be incurred in connection
with all further investigations, design and cleanup activities at the Sidney
Center landfill site. The Company joined four local municipalities as
co-defendants in the lawsuit. In 2001 the Company and Honeywell were ordered by
the Court to pay the EPA approximately $3.5 million, net of contributions by
the municipalities who had been joined as co-defendants in the lawsuit.
Pursuant to that decision the Company and Honeywell will be responsible for
completing the remedial design work and for implementing any agreed remediation
plan at the Sidney Center landfill site. The municipalities who were joined in
the lawsuit have agreed to monitor and maintain any caps installed at the
Sidney Center landfill site as part of any remediation plan. The Company and
Honeywell will be responsible for continuing groundwater monitoring at the
site. The Company is also engaged in remediating or monitoring environmental
conditions at certain of its other manufacturing facilities and has been named
as a potentially responsible party for cleanup costs at other off-site disposal
sites. During 2002, the Company incurred costs of approximately $.7 million,
net of indemnification payments received from Honeywell, in connection with investigating,
remediating and monitoring environmental conditions at all of these facilities
and sites. In 2003 Amphenol expects such expenditures, net of expected
indemnification payments from Honeywell, to be less than $1.0 million.

Since 1987, the Company has not been identified nor
has it been named as a potentially responsible party with respect to any other
significant on-site or off-site hazardous waste matters. In addition, the
Company believes that all of its manufacturing activities and disposal practices
since 1987 have been in material compliance with all applicable environmental
laws and regulations. Nonetheless, it is possible that the Company will be
named as a potentially responsible party in the future with respect to
additional Superfund or other sites. Although the Company is unable to predict
with any reasonable certainty the extent of its ultimate liability with respect
to any pending or future environmental matters, the Company believes, based
upon all information currently known by management about the Company’s
manufacturing activities, disposal practices and estimates of liability with
respect to all known environmental matters, that any such liability will not be
material to its financial condition or results of operations.

PART II

Item
5. Market for the Registrant’s Common Stock and Related Stockholder Matters

The Company effected the initial public offering of
its Class A Common Stock in November 1991. The Company’s common stock has been
listed on the New York Stock Exchange since that time under the symbol “APH.”
The following table sets forth on a per share basis the high and low prices for
the common stock for both 2002 and 2001 as reported on the New York Stock
Exchange.

As of February 28, 2003 there were 71 holders of
record of the Company’s common stock. A significant number of outstanding
shares of common stock are registered in the name of only one holder, which is
a nominee of The Depository Trust Company, a securities depository for banks
and brokerage firms. The Company believes that there are a significant number
of beneficial owners of its common stock.

Since its initial public offering in 1991, the Company
has not paid any cash dividends on its common stock and it does not have any
present intention to commence payment of any cash dividends. The Company
intends to retain earnings to provide funds for the operation and expansion of
the Company’s business and to repay outstanding indebtedness.

Currently the Company is restricted from declaring and
paying any cash dividends on, or repurchasing the Company’s common stock under
certain covenants contained in the Company’s debt agreements.

Management’s Discussion and
  Analysis of Financial

Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion and analysis of the results
of operations for the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2002 has been
derived from and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial
statements contained herein.

Results of Operations

The following table sets forth the components of net
income as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated.

2002 Compared to 2001

Net sales were $1,062.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2002 compared to $1,103.8 million for 2001. Sales of interconnect
products and assemblies decreased 2% compared to 2001 ($892.3 million in 2002
versus $906.8 million in 2001). Such decrease is primarily attributable to decreased
sales (approx. $52.8 million) of products and interconnect systems for telecom
infrastructure, datacom and industrial markets. Such declines were partially
offset by increased sales (approx. $38.3 million) of products and interconnect
systems for military aerospace, automotive and wireless handset markets. Sales
of cable products decreased 14% compared to 2001 ($169.7 million in 2002 versus
$197.0 million in 2001). Such decrease is primarily attributable to a slowdown
in capital spending by U.S. and international cable television operators. The
lower levels of spending are not expected to change significantly in the near
term.

Geographically, sales in the U.S. in 2002 decreased
approximately 7% compared to 2001 ($501.1 million in 2002 versus $538.9 million
in 2001); international sales for 2002 decreased approximately 1% in U.S.
dollars ($560.9 million in 2002 versus $564.8 million in 2001) and decreased
approximately 3% in local currency compared to 2001. The comparatively weaker
U.S. dollar in 2002 had the currency effect of increasing net sales by
approximately $14.4 million when compared to foreign currency translation rates
in 2001.

The gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales
(including depreciation in cost of sales) was 31% for 2002 compared to 33% for
2001. The decrease in gross profit margin is generally attributable to a
difficult pricing environment, particularly in the communications markets, and
the adverse effect on production costs of the lower sales volume, partially
offset by cost reduction programs. The pricing environment in communication
related markets is expected to remain difficult in the near term.

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a
percentage of sales remained relatively constant at approximately 14% for both
2002 and 2001.

Goodwill amortization expense was nil in 2002, as a
result of adopting FAS No. 142; whereas goodwill amortization was $14.3 million
in 2001.

Interest expense was $45.9 million for 2002 compared
to $56.1 million for 2001. The decrease is


primarily attributable to lower average debt levels and lower interest
rates. At current interest rates, interest expense for 2003 is expected to be
approximately $35 million.

Other expenses, net for 2002 and 2001 was $5.4 million
and $5.6 million, respectively. See Note 8 to the Company’s Consolidated
Financial Statements for details of the components of other expenses, net.

The provision for income taxes for 2002 was at an
effective rate of 35% compared to 38% in 2001. For 2001, the effective tax
rate, excluding non-deductible goodwill amortization, was 35%.

2001 Compared to 2000

Net sales were $1,103.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2001 compared to $1,359.7 million for 2000. Sales of interconnect
products and assemblies decreased 10% compared to 2000 ($906.8 million in 2001
versus $1,009.2 million in 2000). Such decrease is primarily attributable to
decreased sales of products and interconnect systems for telecom
infrastructure, datacom and industrial markets. Such declines were partially
offset by increased sales of products and interconnect systems for military
aerospace and automotive markets. Sales of cable products decreased 44%
compared to 2000 ($197.0 million in 2001 versus $350.5 million in 2000). Such
decrease is primarily attributable to a slowdown in capital spending by certain
U.S. and international cable television operators.

Geographically, sales in the U.S. in 2001 decreased
approximately 25% compared to 2000 ($538.9 million in 2001 versus $714.8
million in 2000); international sales for 2001 decreased approximately 12% in
U.S. dollars ($564.8 million in 2001 versus $644.9 million in 2000) and
decreased approximately 9% in local currency compared to 2000. The
comparatively strong U.S. dollar in 2001 had the currency effect of decreasing
net sales by approximately $22.8 million when compared to foreign currency
translation rates in 2000.

The gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales
(including depreciation in cost of sales) remained relatively constant at
approximately 33% for both 2001 and 2000. Cost reduction activities in 2001
contributed to offsetting the adverse effect of lower sales volume.

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a
percentage of sales remained relatively constant at approximately 14% for both
2001 and 2000.

Interest expense was $56.1 million for 2001 compared
to $61.7 million for 2000. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower
average debt levels and lower interest rates.

Other expenses, net for 2001 and 2000 was $5.6 million
and $9.5 million, respectively. See Note 8 to the Company’s Consolidated
Financial Statements for details of the components of other expenses, net.

The provision for income taxes was at an effective
rate of 38% for both 2001 and 2000.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash provided by operating activities totaled $131.6
million, $118.9 million, and $154.2 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. The increase in cash from operating activities in 2002 compared
to 2001 is primarily attributable to a net decrease in non-cash components of
working capital offset in part by a decrease in net income. In 2001, the
decrease in cash from operating activities is primarily attributable to a
decrease in net income adjusted for depreciation and amortization charges and
to a net increase in non-cash components of working capital.

Cash from operating activities was used for capital
expenditures ($18.8 million, $38.6 million and $53.1 million in 2002, 2001 and
2000, respectively), and acquisitions ($33.8 million, $60.5 million, and $67.7
million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively).

The Company has a bank loan agreement (Bank Agreement)
which includes a Term Loan, consisting of a Tranche A and B, and a $150 million
revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2002, the Tranche A had a balance of
$179.5 million and matures over the period 2003 to 2004, and the Tranche B had
a balance of $284.5 million and matures over the period 2005 and 2006. The
revolving credit facility expires in 2004; and, availability under the facility
at December 31, 2002 was $142.8 million, after reduction of $7.2 million for
outstanding letters of credit. The Bank Agreement is secured by a first
priority pledge of 100% of the capital stock of the Company’s direct domestic
subsidiaries and 65% of the capital stock of direct material foreign
subsidiaries, as defined in the Bank Agreement. The Bank Agreement also
requires that the Company satisfy certain financial covenants including
interest coverage and leverage ratio tests, and


includes limitations with respect to, among other things, indebtedness
and restricted payments, including dividends on the Company’s common stock.

The Company is currently pursuing a refinancing of its
senior credit facilities. The new credit facilities would be used to replace
the Company’s existing credit facilities, and may be used to redeem all or a
portion of the Company’s outstanding senior subordinated notes.

A subsidiary of the Company has an agreement with a
financial institution whereby the subsidiary can sell an undivided interest of
up to $85.0 million in a designated pool of qualified accounts receivable. The
agreement expires in May 2004 with respect to $60.0 million of accounts
receivable and expires in July 2003 with respect to an additional $25.0 million
of accounts receivable. At December 31, 2002, approximately $63.2 million of
receivables were sold under the agreement and are therefore not reflected in
the accounts receivable balance in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet.

The Company’s primary ongoing cash requirements will
be for operating and capital expenditures, product development activities and
debt service. The Company’s debt service requirements consist primarily of
principal and interest on bank borrowings and interest on its 9 7/8% Senior
Subordinated Notes due 2007 (“Notes”). The Company’s primary sources of
liquidity are internally generated cash flow, the Company’s revolving credit
facility and the sale of receivables under the Company’s accounts receivable
agreement. The Company expects that ongoing requirements for operating and
capital expenditures, product development activities and debt service
requirements will be funded from these sources; however, the Company’s sources
of liquidity could be adversely affected by a decrease in demand for the
Company’s products, a deterioration in certain of the Company’s financial
ratios or a deterioration in the quality of the Company’s accounts receivable.

The Company has not paid, and does not have any
present intention to commence payment of, cash dividends on its common stock.
The Company expects that capital expenditures in 2003 will be approximately $28
million. The Company’s required debt and capital lease amortization in 2003 is
$78.4 million; the Company’s required cash interest payments for 2003, at
current interest rates, are estimated at approximately $33 million. The Company
may also use cash to fund part or all of the cost of future acquisitions.

Disclosures about contractual obligations
and commitments

The following table summarizes the Company’s known obligations to make
future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of December 31, 2002, as well
as an estimate of the timing in which these obligations are expected to be
satisfied:


Environmental Matters

Subsequent to the acquisition of Amphenol from Allied
Signal Corporation in 1987 (Allied Signal merged with Honeywell International
Inc. in December 1999 (“Honeywell”)), Amphenol and Honeywell have been named
jointly and severally liable as potentially responsible parties in relation to
several environmental cleanup sites. Amphenol and Honeywell have jointly
consented to perform certain investigations and remedial and monitoring
activities at two sites and they have been jointly ordered to perform work at
another site. The responsibility for costs incurred relating to these three
sites is apportioned between Amphenol and Honeywell based on an agreement
entered into in connection with the acquisition in 1987. For sites covered by
this agreement, to the extent that conditions or circumstances occurred or
existed at the time of or prior to the acquisition, Honeywell is currently
obligated to pay 80% of the costs up to $30 million and 100% of the costs in
excess of $30 million. At December 31, 2002, approximately $29.1 million of
costs have been incurred applicable to this agreement. Honeywell
representatives work closely with the Company in addressing the most
significant environmental liabilities. Management does not believe that the
costs associated with resolution of these or any other environmental matters
will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or results
of operations.

Inflation and Costs

The cost of the Company’s products is influenced by
the cost of a wide variety of raw materials, including precious metals such as
gold and silver used in plating; aluminum, copper, brass and steel used for
contacts, shells and cable; and plastic materials used in molding connector
bodies, inserts and cable. In general, increases in the cost of raw materials,
labor and services have been offset by price increases, productivity
improvements and cost saving programs.

Risk Management

The Company has to a significant degree mitigated its
exposure to currency risk in its business operations by manufacturing and
procuring its products in the same country or region in which the products are
sold so that costs reflect local economic conditions. In other cases involving
U.S. export sales, raw materials are a significant component of product costs
for the majority of such sales and raw material costs are generally dollar
based on a worldwide scale, such as basic metals and petroleum derived
materials.

Recent Accounting Changes

Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted FAS No.
143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations” and FAS No. 144 “Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets”. FAS No. 143 addresses the
recognition and remeasurement of obligations associated with the retirement of
tangible long-lived assets. FAS No. 144 addresses accounting and reporting for
the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets, including discontinued
operations. There was no effect to the Company’s Consolidated Financial
Statements as a result of such adoption.

In June 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 146 (FAS 146),
“Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities”. The
statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated
with exit or disposal activities and requires that a liability for such costs
be recognized and measured in the period in which a liability is incurred. The
statement is effective beginning January 1, 2003, and is not expected to have a
material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.

In November 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45), “Guarantor’s Accounting and
Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of
Indebtedness of Others”. The Interpretation addresses the disclosures to be
made by a guarantor in its financial statements about its obligations under
guarantee. In addition, it also clarifies the requirements related to the
recognition of a liability by a guarantor at the inception of a guarantee for
the obligations the guarantor has undertaken in issuing that guarantee. The
initial recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation are
applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after
December 31, 2002. The disclosure provisions became effective December 15, 2002
and had no material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.

In December 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148


(FAS 148), “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and
Disclosure”. FAS No. 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a
voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based
employee compensation. In addition, this statement amends the disclosure
requirements of FAS No. 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and
interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock-based
employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results.
The Company has elected to continue to apply APB Opinion 25, “Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees,” and related interpretations in accounting for stock
options, and the disclosures required by FAS 123 and 148 are included in Notes
1 and 4 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.

In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46), “Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities”. It requires that the assets, liabilities and results of the
activity of variable interest entities be consolidated into the financial
statements of the company that has controlling financial interest. It also
provides the framework for determining whether a variable interest entity
should be consolidated based on voting interest or significant financial
support provided to it. This Interpretation is effective July 1, 2003, and is
not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Pensions

The Company and its domestic subsidiaries have a
defined benefit pension plan (“Plan”) covering substantially all U.S.
employees. Plan benefits are generally based on years of service and
compensation and are generally noncontributory. Certain foreign subsidiaries
also have defined benefit plans covering their employees.

Our pension cost (credit) for all pension plans
approximated $.7 million, $(.3) million and $(.3) million in 2002, 2001, and
2000, respectively, and is calculated based upon a number of actuarial
assumptions established on January 1 of the applicable year, including an expected
long-term rate of return on Plan assets. In developing our expected long-term
rate of return assumption, we evaluated input from our actuaries and investment
consultants as well as long-term inflation assumptions. Projected returns by
such consultants are based on broad equity and bond indices. We also considered
our historical 13 year compounded return of 10.8%, which has been in excess of
these broad equity and bond benchmark indices. Our expected long-term rate of
return on Plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of 60% with
equity managers, with an expected long-term rate of return of 11%, 25% with
fixed income managers, with an expected long-term rate of return of 6.75% and
15% with high yield bond managers, with an expected rate of return of 8.5%.
Because of market fluctuation, our actual asset allocation as of December 31,
2002 was 50% with equity managers and 50% with fixed income managers, including
high yield managers. We believe, however, that our long-term asset allocation
on average will approximate 60% with equity managers and 40% with fixed income
managers. We regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically
rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when considered
appropriate. Based on this methodology the Company reduced the expected
long-term rate of return assumption by 100 basis points to 9.5% beginning in
2003. This will have the effect of increasing pension expense in 2003 by
approximately $2 million.

The discount rate used by the Company for valuing
pension liabilities is based on a review of high quality corporate bond yields
with maturities approximating the remaining life of the projected benefit
obligations. The discount rate on this basis has decreased from 7.25% at
December 31, 2001 to 6.5% at December 31, 2002. This will have the effect of
increasing pension expense in 2003 by approximately $2 million. Although future
changes to the discount rate are unknown, had the discount rate increased or
decreased 50 basis points, the pension liability would have decreased $9.5
million or increased $10.4 million, respectively.

The financial markets have declined significantly in
recent years, which has had an adverse effect on Plan assets. In 2002, this
resulted in a $42.5 million non-cash charge to the accumulated other
comprehensive loss account component of stockholders’ equity. Such charge
represents an increase in the accrued pension liabilities of $67.0 million, net
of deferred taxes. The Company estimates that, based on


current actuarial calculations, it will make a cash contribution to the
pension plans in 2003 of approximately $7.0 million. Cash contributions in
subsequent years will depend on a number of factors including the investment
performance of Plan assets.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The
Company’s significant accounting policies are set forth below.

Revenue Recognition - Sales and related cost of sales
are recognized upon shipment of products. Allowances for estimated
uncollectible accounts, discounts, returns and allowances are provided based
upon historical experience, current trends and specific information which
indicates that an allowance is appropriate.

Inventories - Inventories are stated at the lower of
standard cost, which approximates average cost, or market. Provisions for slow
moving and obsolete inventory are provided based on historical experience and
product demand.

Depreciable Assets - Property, plant and equipment are
carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. The appropriateness and the
recoverability of the carrying value of such assets is periodically reviewed
taking into consideration current and expected business conditions.

The significant accounting policies are more fully
described in Note 1 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

The Company, in the normal course of doing business,
is exposed to the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and
changes in interest rates.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

The Company conducts business in several international
currencies through its worldwide operations, and as a result is subject to
foreign exchange exposures due to changes in exchange rates of the various
currencies. Changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively effect the
Company’s sales, gross margins and retained earnings. The Company attempts to
minimize currency exposure risk by producing its products in the same country
or region in which the products are sold and thereby generating revenues and
incurring expenses in the same currency and by managing its working capital;
although there can be no assurance that this approach will be successful,
especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any
of the international currencies of the Company’s worldwide operations. The
Company does not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for
speculative purposes.

Interest Rate Risk

The Company is subject to market risk from exposure to
changes in interest rates based on its financing activities. The Company has
utilized interest rate swap agreements to manage and mitigate its exposure to
changes in interest rates. The Company had two fixed rate interest swap
agreements totaling $450 million that expired in 2002. At December 31, 2002,
the Company’s average LIBOR rate was 1.9%. A 10% change in the LIBOR interest
rate at December 31, 2002 would have the effect of increasing or decreasing
interest expense by approximately $.3 million. The Company does not expect
changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in
2003, although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not
significantly change.


Item 8

. Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data

Report of Management

Management is responsible for the integrity and
objectivity of the financial statements and other information appearing in this
annual report on Form 10-K. The financial statements have been prepared in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America and include amounts based on management’s best estimates and
judgments. The Company maintains a system of internal accounting controls and
procedures intended to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded
and transactions are properly recorded and accounted for in accordance with
management’s authorization.

Deloitte & Touche LLP has been engaged to audit
the financial statements in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. They obtain an understanding of the
Company’s accounting policies and controls, and conduct such tests and related
procedures as they consider necessary to arrive at their opinion. The Board of
Directors has appointed an Audit Committee composed of outside directors. The
Audit Committee meets periodically with representatives of management and
Deloitte & Touche LLP to discuss and review their activities with respect
to internal accounting controls and financial reporting and auditing.

Independent
Auditors’ Report

To the
Board of Directors and

Shareholders of Amphenol Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of Amphenol Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2002 and
2001, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in
shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2002. These financial statements are the responsibility of
the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing
standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Amphenol
Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2002 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.

As discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for goodwill and other
intangible assets to conform to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
142.

Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies

Operations

Amphenol Corporation (“Amphenol” or the “Company”) is
in two business segments which consist of manufacturing and selling
interconnect products and assemblies, and manufacturing and selling cable
products.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior
years’ financial statements to conform to the 2002 classifications.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions have
been eliminated in consolidation.

Cash and Short-Term Cash Investments

Cash and short-term cash investments consist of cash
and liquid investments with an original maturity of less than three months. The
carrying amount approximates fair value of those instruments.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost,
which approximates average cost, or market. The principal components of cost
included in inventories are materials, direct labor and manufacturing overhead.

Depreciable Assets

Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost.
Depreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment are provided on
a straight-line basis over the respective asset lives determined on a composite
basis by asset group or on a specific item basis using the estimated useful
lives of such assets which range from 3 to 12 years for machinery and equipment
and 20 to 40 years for buildings. It is the Company’s policy to periodically
review fixed asset lives.

Deferred Debt Issuance Costs

Deferred debt issuance costs are being amortized on
the interest method over the term of the related debt and such amortization is
included in interest expense.

Goodwill

Through December 31, 2001, for acquisitions completed
prior to July 1, 2001, the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets
acquired (goodwill) was being amortized on the straight-line basis over a
period of 40 years. Accumulated amortization is $148,779 at December 31, 2001.
Effective July 1, 2001, the Company adopted the provisions of Financial
Accounting Standards (“FAS”) No. 141, “Business Combinations” and No. 142,
“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” applicable to business combinations
completed after June 30, 2001. In accordance with these standards, goodwill
resulting from acquisitions after June 30, 2001 is not amortized and beginning
January 1, 2002, goodwill for acquisitions completed prior to July 1, 2001 is
not amortized. The Company adopted the additional provisions of FAS No. 142
effective January 1, 2002, which include provisions for annual evaluations for
impairment of goodwill. In 2002, goodwill increased by $26,399 primarily as a
result of five relatively minor acquisitions with a total acquisition price of
$26,970, less the fair value of net assets acquired of $4,951, and the
acquisition of additional minority interests in two subsidiaries with a
purchase price of $6,826 for such interests, less the proportional fair value
of net assets acquired of $2,446. The increase in goodwill by segment was
$21,322 and $5,077 for interconnect products and assemblies and cable products,
respectively. Pro forma information for 2001 and 2000 as if goodwill had not
been amortized is as follows:


Revenue Recognition

Sales and related cost of sales are recognized upon
shipment of products.

Retirement Pension Plans

Costs for retirement pension plans include current
service costs and amortization of prior service costs over periods of up to
thirty years. It is the Company’s policy to fund current pension costs taking
into consideration minimum funding requirements and maximum tax deductible
limitations. The expense of retiree medical benefit programs is recognized
during the employees’ service with the Company as well as amortization of a
transition obligation recognized on adoption of the accounting principle.

Stock Options

The Company applies APB Opinion 25, “Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees,” and related interpretations in accounting for stock
options. Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized for the Plans.
Had compensation cost for stock options been determined based on the fair value
of the option at date of grant consistent with the provisions of FAS No. 123,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” the Company’s net income and
earnings per share would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated
below:

The fair value of stock options has been estimated at the date of grant
using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following
weighted-average assumptions:

The weighted-average fair values of options granted
during 2002, 2001 and 2000 were $17.07, $20.98 and $27.04, respectively.

Income Taxes

Deferred income taxes are provided for revenue and
expenses which are recognized in different periods for income tax and financial
statement purposes. Deferred income taxes are not provided on undistributed
earnings of foreign affiliated companies which are considered to be permanently
invested.

Foreign Currency Translation

The financial position and results of operations of
all of the Company’s significant foreign subsidiaries are measured


using local currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities
of such subsidiaries have been translated at current exchange rates, and
related revenues and expenses have been translated at weighted average exchange
rates. The aggregate effect of translation adjustments so calculated is
included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within
shareholders equity. Transaction gains and losses are included in other
expense, net.

Research and Development

Research and development expense for the creation of
new and improved products and processes were $24,183, $22,604 and $23,505, for
the years 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Environmental Obligations

The Company recognizes the potential cost for
environmental remediation activities when assessments are made, remedial
efforts are probable and related amounts can be reasonably estimated; potential
insurance reimbursements are not recorded. The Company regularly assesses its
environmental liabilities through reviews of contractual commitments, site
assessments, feasibility studies and formal remedial design and action plans.

Net Income per Common Share

Basic income per common share is based on the net
income for the period divided by the weighted average common shares
outstanding. Diluted income per common share assumes the exercise of
outstanding, dilutive stock options using the treasury stock method. In April
2000, the Company effected a two-for-one split of its common stock; all share
and per-share amounts in the financial statements have been restated to reflect
the split.

Derivative Financial Instruments

Derivative financial instruments, which are
periodically used by the Company in the management of its interest rate and
foreign currency exposures, are accounted for on an accrual basis. Income and
expense are recorded in the same category as that arising from the related
asset or liability. For example, amounts to be paid or received under interest
rate swap agreements are recognized as an increase or decrease of interest
expense in the periods in which they accrue. The Company adopted FAS 133, as
amended by FAS 138, beginning January 1, 2001. Adoption of this new accounting
standard resulted in a cumulative after-tax gain of $291 in accumulated other
comprehensive income as of that date. Gains and losses on derivatives
designated as cash flow hedges resulting from changes in fair value are
recorded in other comprehensive income, and subsequently reflected in net
income in a manner that matches the timing of the actual income or expense of
such instruments with the hedged transaction. At December 31, 2002 the Company
had no derivative financial instruments.

Recent Accounting Changes

Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted FAS No.
143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations” and FAS No. 144 “Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets”. FAS No. 143 addresses the
recognition and remeasurement of obligations associated with the retirement of
tangible long-lived assets. FAS No. 144 addresses accounting and reporting for
the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets, including discontinued
operations. There was no effect to the Company’s Consolidated Financial
Statements as a result of such adoption.

In June 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 146 (FAS 146),
“Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities”. The statement
addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or
disposal activities and requires that a liability for such costs be recognized
and measured in the period in which a liability is incurred. The statement is
effective beginning January 1, 2003, and is not expected to have a material
impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.

In November 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45), “Guarantor’s Accounting and
Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of
Indebtedness of Others”. The Interpretation addresses the disclosures to be
made by a guarantor in its financial statements about its obligations under
guarantee. In addition, it also clarifies the requirements related to the
recognition of a liability by a guarantor at the inception of a guarantee for
the obligations the guarantor has undertaken in issuing that guarantee. The
initial recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation are
applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after
December 31, 2002. The disclosure provisions became effective December 15, 2002
and have no material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.

In December 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148 (FAS 148),
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure”. FAS No.
148 provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the
fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In
addition, this statement amends the disclosure requirements of FAS No. 123 to
require prominent disclosures in


both annual and interim financial statements about the method of
accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method
used on reported results. The Company has elected to continue to apply APB
Opinion 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and related
interpretations in accounting for stock options, and the disclosures required
by FAS 123 and 148 are included in Notes 1 and 4 to the Company's Consolidated
Financial Statements.

In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46), “Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities”. It requires that the assets, liabilities and results of the
activity of variable interest entities be consolidated into the financial
statements of the company that has controlling financial interest. It also
provides the framework for determining whether a variable interest entity
should be consolidated based on voting interest or significant financial
support provided to it. This Interpretation is effective July 1, 2003, and is
not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Note 2 - Long-Term Debt

Long-term debt consists of the following:

The Company has a bank loan agreement (Bank Agreement)
which includes a Term Loan, consisting of a Tranche A and B, and a $150,000
revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2002, the Tranche A had a balance of
$179,543 and matures over the period 2003 to 2004, and the Tranche B had a
balance of $284,500 and matures over the period 2005 and 2006. The revolving
credit facility expires in 2004; availability under the facility at December
31, 2002 was $142,800, after reduction of $7,200 for outstanding letters of
credit. At December 31, 2002, interest under the Bank Agreement generally
accrues at .75% to 1.50% over LIBOR. The Company also pays certain annual
agency and commitment fees. At December 31, 2001, the Company had interest rate
protection in the form of swap agreements that effectively fixed the Company’s
LIBOR interest rate on $450,000 of floating rate bank debt at 5.76%. Such
agreements expired in 2002. While it was not the Company’s intention to
terminate the interest rate swap agreements, the fair values of such agreements
was estimated by obtaining quotes from brokers which represented the amounts
that the Company would receive or pay if the agreements were terminated. The
fair values indicated that termination of the agreements at December 31, 2001
and 2000 would have resulted in a pre-tax loss of $14,631 and a pre-tax gain of
$448, respectively. At December 31, 2001 the derivatives loss, net of tax, of
$8,837 was recorded in other comprehensive income. The Bank Agreement is
secured by a first priority pledge of 100% of the capital stock of the
Company’s direct domestic subsidiaries and 65% of the capital stock of direct
material foreign subsidiaries, as defined in the Bank Agreement. The Bank
Agreement also requires that the Company satisfy certain financial covenants
including interest coverage and leverage ratio tests, and includes limitations
with respect to, among other things, (i) incurring debt, (ii) creating or
incurring liens, (iii) making other investments, (iv) acquiring or disposing of
assets, (v) capital expenditures, and (vi) restricted payments, including
dividends on the Company’s common stock.

The 9 7/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2007
(“Notes”) are general unsecured obligations of the Company. The Notes are
subject to redemption at the option of the Company, in whole or in part,
beginning in 2002 at 104.938% and declining to 100% by 2005.

The fair value of the Company’s long-term debt is
estimated based on the quoted market price for the same or similar issues or on
the current rates offered to the Company for debt of the same remaining
maturities. At December 31, 2002, based on market quotes for the same or
similar securities it is estimated that the Company’s Notes were trading at a
premium of approximately 4% over book value. The book value of the Company’s
other long-term debt approximates fair value.

The maturity of the Company’s long-term debt over each
of the next five years ending December 31, is as follows: 2003 - $78,363; 2004
- - $137,385; 2005 - $97,825; 2006 - $186,675; and 2007 - $144,000.


Note 3 - Income Taxes

The components of income before income taxes and the
provision for income taxes are as follows:

At December 31, 2002, the Company had $9,210 of
foreign tax loss carryforward, of which $1,809 expire at various dates through
2009 and the balance can be carried forward indefinitely. A valuation allowance
of $1,312 and $1,024 at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, has been
recorded which relates to foreign net operating loss carryforward. The net
change in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was an increase of
$288 and $465 in 2002 and 2001, respectively. In both 2002 and 2001 the net
change in the valuation allowance was related to foreign net operating loss
carryforward. Accrued income tax liabilities of $18,861 and $4,560 at December
31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, are included in other accrued expenses in the
Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Differences between the U.S. statutory federal tax
rate and the Company’s effective income tax rate are analyzed below:

The Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities,
excluding a valuation allowance, were comprised of the following:


The Company has not provided for U.S. deferred income
taxes or foreign withholding taxes on undistributed earnings of its non-U.S.
subsidiaries, since the Company intends to reinvest these earnings
indefinitely. The Company is subject to periodic audits of its various tax
returns by government agencies; management does not believe that amounts, if
any, which may be required to be paid by reason of such audits will have a
material effect on the Company’s financial position or results of operations.

Note 4 - Shareholders’ Equity

In May 1997, the Company adopted the 1997 Option Plan,
and in May 2000, adopted the 2000 Option Plan (“Plans”). The Plans authorize
the granting of stock options by a committee of the Board of Directors. At
December 31, 2002, the maximum number of shares of common stock available for
the granting of stock options under the Plans was 217,065. Options granted
under the Plans vest ratably over a period of five years and are exercisable
over a period of ten years from the date of grant. In addition, shares issued
in conjunction with the exercise of stock options are generally subject to
Management Stockholder Agreements which, among other things, place restrictions
on the sale or transfer of such shares.

Stock option activity for 2000, 2001, and 2002 was as
follows:

The following table summarizes information about stock
options outstanding at December 31, 2002:

At December 31, 2002, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Co.
L.P. (“KKR”) and its affiliates owned 49.1% of the Company’s outstanding common
stock. The Company pays KKR an annual fee of $1,000 for management consulting
and financial services.


Balances of related after-tax components comprising
accumulated other comprehensive loss, included in shareholders’ equity at
December 31, 2000, 2001 and 2002 are as follows:


Note 5 - Benefit Plans and Other
Postretirement Benefits

The Company and its domestic subsidiaries have a
defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all U.S. employees. Plan
benefits are generally based on years of service and compensation and are
generally noncontributory. Certain foreign subsidiaries have defined benefit
plans covering their employees. Certain U.S. employees not covered by the
defined benefit plan are covered by defined contribution plans. The following
is a summary of the Company’s defined benefit plans funded status as of the
most recent actuarial valuations (December 31, 2002 and 2001).


The weighted-average discount rate and rate of
increase in future compensation levels used in determining actuarial present
value of the projected benefit obligation was 6.5% (7.25% in 2001 and 7.5% in
2000) and 3.0% (3.25% in 2001 and 3.5% in 2000), respectively. The expected
long-term rate of return on assets was 10.5% (9.5% in 2003). Plan assets
consist primarily of U.S. equity and debt securities. The Company has also
adopted an unfunded Supplemental Employee Retirement Plan (“SERP”) which
provides for the payment of the portion of annual pension which cannot be paid
from the retirement plan as a result of regulatory limitations on average
compensation for purposes of the benefit computation. The largest non-U.S.
pension plan, in accordance with local custom, is unfunded and had an accumulated
benefit obligation of approximately $25,170 and $19,356 at December 31, 2002
and 2001, respectively. Such obligation is included in the Consolidated Balance
Sheet and the tables above.

In accordance with the provisions of FAS No. 87, the
Company has recognized a minimum pension liability at December 31, 2002 of
$103,830 ($36,862 at December 31, 2001) for circumstances in which a pension
plan’s accumulated benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of the plan’s
assets and accrued pension liability. Such liability was partially offset by an
intangible asset equal to the unrecognized prior service cost, with the balance
recorded as a reduction in shareholders’ equity, net of related deferred tax
benefits.

The Company maintains self insurance programs for that
portion of its health care and workers compensation costs not covered by
insurance. The Company also provides certain health care and life insurance
benefits to certain eligible retirees through postretirement benefit programs.
The Company’s share of the cost of such plans for most participants is fixed,
and any increase in the cost of such plans will be the responsibility of the
retirees. The Company funds the benefit costs for such plans on a pay-as-you-go
basis. Since the Company’s obligation for postretirement medical plans is fixed
and since the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (“APBO”) and the
net postretirement benefit expense are not material in relation to the
Company’s financial condition or results of operations, management believes any
change in medical costs from that estimated will not have a significant impact
on the Company. The discount rate used in determining the APBO at December 31,
2002 and 2001 was 6.5% and 7.25%, respectively.

Summary information on the Company’s postretirement
medical plans is as follows:


Note 6 - Leases

At December 31, 2002, the Company was committed under
operating leases which expire at various dates through 2008. Total rent expense
under operating leases for the years 2002, 2001, and 2000 was $16,007, $16,762
and $17,429, respectively.

Minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating
leases are as follows:

Note 7 - Reportable Business Segments and International
Operations

The Company has two reportable business segments:
interconnect products and assemblies and cable products. The interconnect
products and assemblies segment produces connectors and connector assemblies
primarily for the communications, aerospace, industrial and automotive markets.
The cable products segment produces coaxial and flat ribbon cable and related
products primarily for communication markets, including cable television. The
accounting policies of the segments are the same as those for the Company as a
whole and are described in Note 1 herein. The Company evaluates the performance
of business units on, among other things, profit or loss from operations before
interest expense, headquarters’ expense allocations, income taxes and
nonrecurring gains and losses. The Company’s reportable segments are an
aggregation of business units that have similar production processes and
products.

Reconciliation of segment
operating income to consolidated income before taxes:


Reconciliation of segment
assets to consolidated total assets:

Geographic information:

Revenues by geographic area are based on customer
location to which product is shipped.

Note 8 - Other Expenses, net

Other income (expense) is comprised as follows:

Note 9 - Commitments and Contingencies

In the course of pursuing its normal business
activities, the Company is involved in various legal proceedings and claims.
Management does not expect that amounts, if any, which may be required to be
paid by reason of such proceedings or claims will have a material effect on the
Company’s financial position or results of operations.

Subsequent to the acquisition of Amphenol from Allied
Signal Corporation in 1987 (Allied Signal merged with Honeywell International
Inc. in December 1999 (“Honeywell”)), Amphenol and Honeywell have been named
jointly and severally liable as potentially responsible parties in relation to
several environmental cleanup sites. Amphenol and Honeywell have jointly
consented to perform certain investigations and remedial and monitoring
activities at two sites and they have been jointly ordered to perform work at
another site. The responsibility for costs incurred relating to these three
sites is apportioned between Amphenol and Honeywell based on an agreement
entered into in connection with the acquisition in 1987. For sites covered by
this agreement, to the extent that conditions or circumstances occurred or
existed at the time of or prior to the acquisition, Honeywell is currently
obligated to pay 80% of the costs up to $30,000 and 100% of the costs in excess
of $30,000. At December 31, 2002, approximately $29,100 of costs have been
incurred applicable to this agreement. Honeywell representatives work closely
with the Company in addressing the most significant environmental liabilities.
Management does not believe that the costs associated with resolution of these
or any other environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s financial condition or results of operations.

A subsidiary of the Company has an agreement with a
financial institution whereby the subsidiary can sell an undivided


interest of up to $85,000 in a designated pool of qualified accounts
receivable. The agreement expires in May 2004 with respect to $60,000 of
accounts receivable and expires in July 2003 with respect to an additional
$25,000 of accounts receivable. Under the terms of the agreement, new
receivables are added to the pool as collections reduce previously sold
accounts receivable. The aggregate value of receivables transferred to the pool
for the year 2002, 2001 and 2000 were $541,834, $598,659, and $833,653,
respectively. At December 31, 2002, and 2001, respectively, $21,427 and $20,548
of accounts receivable were transferred to the subsidiary, but not purchased by
the financial institution and are therefore included in the accounts receivable
balance in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. Due to the short-term
nature of the accounts receivable, the fair value approximates the carrying
value. The Company services, administers and collects the receivables on behalf
of the purchaser. Program fees payable to the purchaser under this agreement
are equivalent to rates afforded high quality commercial paper issuers plus
certain administrative expenses and are included in other expenses, net, in the
accompanying Consolidated Statement of Income. The agreement contains certain
covenants and provides for various events of termination. In certain
circumstances the Company is contingently liable for the collection of the receivables
sold; management believes that its allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate
to absorb the expense of any such liability. At December 31, 2002 and 2001,
approximately $63,200 and $74,200, respectively, of receivables were sold under
the agreement and are therefore not reflected in the accounts receivable
balance in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet.
