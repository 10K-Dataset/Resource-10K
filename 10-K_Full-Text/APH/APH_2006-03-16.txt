INDEX


PART
I

Item
1. Business

General

Amphenol Corporation (“Amphenol” or the “Company”) is one of the world’s
largest designers, manufacturers and marketers of electrical, electronic and
fiber optic connectors, interconnect systems and coaxial and flat-ribbon cable.
The Company was incorporated in 1987. Certain predecessor businesses, which now
constitute part of the Company, have been in business since 1932. The primary
end markets for the Company’s products are:

•

communications
systems and information technology applications;

•

a
broad range of industrial applications including factory automation and motion
control systems, medical and industrial instrumentation, mass transportation
and natural resource exploration, and automotive applications; and

•

commercial
aerospace and military applications.

The Company’s strategy is to provide its customers with comprehensive
design capabilities, a broad selection of products and a high level of service
on a worldwide basis while maintaining continuing programs of productivity
improvement and cost control. For 2005, the Company reported net sales,
operating income and net income of $1,808.1 million, $343.3 million
and $206.3 million, respectively. The table below summarizes information
regarding the Company’s primary markets and end applications for the Company’s
products:


The Company designs and manufactures
connectors and interconnect systems which are used primarily to conduct
electrical and optical signals for a wide range of sophisticated electronic
applications. The Company believes, based primarily on published market research,
that it is one of the largest connector manufacturers in the world. The Company
has developed a broad range of connector and interconnect products for
communications equipment applications including the converging voice, video and
data communications markets. The Company is a leader in developing interconnect
products for factory automation, machine tools, instrumentation and medical
systems, mass transportation applications and automotive applications,
including airbags, pretensioner seatbelts and other on board automotive electronics.
In addition, the Company is the leading supplier of high performance interconnect
systems that require superior performance and reliability under conditions of
stress and in hostile environments. These conditions are frequently encountered
in military, commercial aircraft applications and other demanding industrial
applications.

The Company is a global manufacturer employing advanced manufacturing
processes. The Company manufactures and assembles its products at facilities in
the Americas, Europe, Africa and Asia. The Company sells its products through
its own global sales force and independent manufacturers’ representatives to
thousands of OEMs in approximately 60 countries throughout the world as
well as through a global network of electronics distributors. The Company also sells
certain products to electronic manufacturing services (EMS) and original design
manufacturing (ODM) companies, and to cable television operators. For the year 2005,
approximately 48% of the Company’s net sales were in North America, 25% were in
Europe and 27% were in Asia and other countries.

The Company implements its product development strategy through product
design teams and collaboration arrangements with customers which result in the
Company obtaining approved vendor status for its customers’ new products and
programs. The Company seeks to have its products become widely accepted within
the industry for similar applications and products manufactured by other
potential customers, which the Company believes will provide additional sources
of future revenue. By developing application specific products, the Company has
decreased its exposure to standard products which generally experience greater
pricing pressure. In addition to product design teams and customer
collaboration arrangements, the Company uses key account managers to manage
customer relationships on a global basis such that it can bring to bear its
total resources to meet the worldwide needs of its multinational customers.

Industry analysts estimate that the worldwide sales of interconnect
products were approximately $37 billion in 2005 and will grow
approximately 5.3% in 2006. The Company believes that the worldwide industry
for interconnect products and systems is highly fragmented with over 2,000
producers of connectors worldwide, of which the 10 largest, including Amphenol,
accounted for a combined market share of approximately 51% in 2005.

The Company’s acquisition strategy is focused on the consolidation of
this highly fragmented industry. The Company targets acquisitions on a global
basis in high growth segments that have complementary capabilities to the
Company from a product, customer or geographic standpoint. The Company looks to
add value to those smaller companies through its global capabilities and
expects acquisitions to be accretive to performance in the first year. In 2005,
the Company spent approximately $513 million on acquisitions. This included a
number of small acquisitions in target markets, including the military,
wireless communications, data communications and industrial markets, that
broadened and enhanced its product offering in these areas. In addition, in
December 2005 the Company purchased the backplane and connection systems
business (TCS) of Teredyne Corporation, Inc. for approximately $385 million. TCS
had sales of approximately $373 million in 2005 and, the Company believes, is
the leader in high speed, high density, printed circuit board interconnect
products. TCS sells its products primarily to the data communications, storage and
server markets and the wireless infrastructure markets. The TCS acquisition is
entirely complementary to Amphenol from a product standpoint and allows the
Company to offer a complete and integrated interconnect solution for customers
in the communications markets, significantly enhancing the Company’s position.

Interconnect Products and Assemblies.

The
Company produces a broad range of interconnect products and assemblies
primarily for voice, video and data communication systems, commercial aerospace
and military systems, automotive and mass transportation applications, and
industrial and factory automation equipment. Interconnect products include
connectors, which when attached to an electronic or fiber optic cable, a
printed circuit board or other device, facilitate electronic or fiber optic
transmission. Interconnect assemblies generally consist of a system of cable
and connectors for linking electronic and fiber optic equipment. The Company
designs and produces a broad range of connector and cable assembly products
used in communication applications, such as: engineered cable assemblies used
in base stations for wireless communication systems and internet networking
equipment; smart card acceptor devices used in mobile GSM telephones, cable
modems and other applications to facilitate reading data from smart cards;
fiber optic connectors used in fiber optic signal transmission; backplane and input/output
connectors and assemblies used for servers and data storage devices and linking
personal computers and peripheral equipment; sculptured flexible circuits used
for integrating printed circuit boards in communication applications and hinge
products used in mobile phone and other mobile communication devices. The
Company also designs and produces a broad range of radio frequency connector
products and antennas used in telecommunications, computer and office
equipment, instrumentation equipment, local area networks and automotive
electronics. The Company’s radio frequency interconnect products and assemblies
are also used in base stations, mobile communication devices and other
components of cellular and personal communications networks.

The Company believes that it is the largest supplier of high
performance, military-specification, circular environmental connectors. Such connectors
require superior performance and reliability under conditions of stress and in
hostile environments. High performance environmental connectors and
interconnect systems are generally used to interconnect electronic and fiber
optic systems in sophisticated aerospace, military, commercial and industrial
equipment. These applications present demanding technological requirements in
that the connectors are subject to rapid and severe temperature changes,
vibration, humidity and nuclear radiation. Frequent applications of these
connectors and interconnect systems include aircraft, guided missiles, radar,
military vehicles, equipment for spacecraft, energy, medical instrumentation,
geophysical applications and off-road construction equipment. The Company also
designs and produces industrial interconnect products used in a variety of
applications such as factory automation equipment, mass transportation
applications including railroads and marine transportation; and automotive
safety products including interconnect devices and systems used in automotive
airbags, pretensioner seatbelts, antilock braking systems and other on board
automotive electronic systems. The Company also designs and produces highly-engineered
cable and backplane assemblies. Such assemblies are specially designed by the
Company in conjunction with OEM customers for specific applications, primarily
for computer, wired and wireless communication systems, office equipment and
aerospace applications. The cable assemblies utilize the Company’s connector
and cable products as well as components purchased from others.


Cable Products.

The
Company designs, manufactures and markets coaxial cable primarily for use in
the cable television industry. The Company’s Times Fiber subsidiary is the
world’s second largest producer of coaxial cable for the cable television
market. The Company believes that its Times Fiber unit is one of the lowest
cost producers of coaxial cable for cable television. The Company’s coaxial
cable and connector products are used in cable television systems including
full service cable television/telecommunication systems being installed by
cable operators and telecommunication companies offering video, voice and data
services. The Company is also a major supplier of coaxial cable to the
developing international cable television market. The Company manufactures two
primary types of coaxial cable: semi-flexible, which has an aluminum tubular
shield, and flexible, which has one or more braided metallic shields.
Semi-flexible coaxial cable is used in the trunk and feeder distribution
portion of cable television systems, and flexible cable (also known as drop
cable) is used primarily for hookups from the feeder cable to the cable television
subscriber’s residence. Flexible cable is also used in other communication
applications. The Company has also developed a broad line of radio frequency
and fiber optic interconnect components for full service cable television/ telecommunication
networks.

The rapid development in fiber optic technologies, digital compression
(which allows multiple channels to be transmitted within the same bandwidth
that a single analog channel requires) and other communication technologies,
including the Company’s development of higher capacity coaxial cable, have
resulted in technologies that enable cable television systems to provide
channel capacity in excess of 500 channels. Such expanded channel capacity,
along with other component additions, permit cable operators to offer full
service networks with a variety of capabilities including video-on-demand,
pay-per-view special events, home shopping networks, interactive entertainment
and education services, telephone services and high-speed Internet access. With
respect to expanded channel capacity systems, cable operators have generally
adopted, and the Company believes that for the foreseeable future will continue
to adopt, network infrastructure using both fiber optic cable and coaxial cable.
Such systems combine the advantages of fiber optic cable in transmitting clear
signals over a long distance, with the advantages of coaxial cable in ease of
installation, low cost and compatibility with the receiving components of the
customer’s communication devices. The Company believes that while system
operators are likely to increase their use of fiber optic cable for the trunk
and feeder portions of the cable systems, there will be an ongoing need for
high capacity coaxial cable for the local distribution and street-to-the-home
portions of the cable system. In addition, U.S. cable system designs are
increasingly being employed in international markets where cable television
penetration is generally lower than in the U.S. The Company believes the
development of full service cable television systems for the converging
technologies of voice, video and data communications presents an opportunity to
increase sales of its coaxial cable and related products.

The Company is also a leading producer of specialty cables including
flat-ribbon cable, a cable made of wires assembled side by side such that the
finished cable is flat. Flat-ribbon cable is used to connect internal
components in systems with space and component configuration limitations. The
product is used in computer and office equipment applications as well as in a
variety of telecommunication applications.

International
Operations

The Company believes that its global presence is an important
competitive advantage as it allows the Company to provide quality products on a
timely and worldwide basis to its multinational customers. Approximately 56% of
the Company’s sales for the year ended December 31, 2005 were outside the
United States. Approximately 42% of such international sales were in Asia. The
Company has manufacturing and assembly facilities in China, Taiwan, Korea,
India, Japan and Malaysia. The balance of the Company’s international
activities are located in Europe, Canada, Latin America, Africa and Australia. European
operations include manufacturing and assembly facilities in the United Kingdom,
Germany, France, the Czech Republic, and Estonia and sales offices in most
European markets. The Company’s international manufacturing and assembly
facilities generally serve the respective local markets and coordinate product
design and manufacturing responsibility with the Company’s other operations
around the world. The Company has low cost manufacturing and assembly
facilities in China, Mexico, India, Eastern Europe and Africa to serve regional
and world markets.

Customers

The Company’s products are used in a wide variety of applications by
numerous customers, the largest of which was less than 4% of net sales for the
year ended December 31, 2005. The Company sells its products to over
10,000 customer locations worldwide. The Company’s products are sold both
directly to OEMs, contract manufacturers, cable system operators,
telecommunication companies and through manufacturers’ representatives and
distributors. There has been a trend on the part of OEM customers to consolidate
their lists of qualified suppliers to companies that have a global presence,
can meet quality and delivery standards, have a broad product portfolio and
design capability, and have competitive prices. The Company has focused its


global resources to position itself to compete effectively in this
environment. The Company has concentrated its efforts on service and
productivity improvements including advanced computer aided design and
manufacturing systems, statistical process controls and just-in-time inventory
programs to increase product quality and shorten product delivery schedules.
The Company’s strategy is to provide comprehensive design capabilities, a broad
selection of products and a high level of service in the areas in which it
competes. The Company has achieved a preferred supplier designation from many
of its OEM customers.

The Company’s sales to distributors represented approximately 19% of
the Company’s 2005 sales. The Company’s recognized brand names, including “Amphenol,”
“Times Fiber,” and others, together with the Company’s strong connector
design-in position (products that are specified in customer drawings), enhance
its ability to reach the secondary market through its network of distributors.

Manufacturing

The Company employs advanced manufacturing processes including molding,
stamping, plating, turning, extruding, die casting and assembly operations as
well as proprietary process technology for flat-ribbon and coaxial cable
production. The Company’s manufacturing facilities are generally vertically
integrated operations from the initial design stage through final design and
manufacturing. Outsourcing of certain fabrication processes is used when
cost-effective. Substantially all of the Company’s manufacturing facilities are
certified to the ISO9000 series of quality standards.

The Company employs a global manufacturing strategy to lower its
production costs and to improve service to customers. The Company sources its
products on a worldwide basis with manufacturing and assembly operations in the
Americas, Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia. To better serve high volume OEM
customers, the Company has established just-in-time facilities near major
customers.

The Company’s policy is to maintain strong cost controls in its
manufacturing and assembly operations. The Company is continually evaluating
and adjusting its expense levels and workforce to reflect current business
conditions and maximize the return on capital investments.

The Company purchases a wide variety of raw materials for the
manufacture of its products, including precious metals such as gold and silver
used in plating, aluminum, brass, steel, copper and bimetallic products used
for cable, contacts and connector shells; and plastic materials used for cable
and connector bodies and inserts. Such raw materials are generally available
throughout the world and are purchased locally from a variety of suppliers. The
Company is not dependent upon any one source for raw materials, or if one
source is used the Company attempts to protect itself through long-term supply
agreements.

Research
and Development

The Company’s research and development expense for the creation of new
and improved products and processes was $40.1 million, $32.5 million and $26.4 million
for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company’s research and development
activities focus on selected product areas and are performed by individual
operating divisions. Generally, the operating divisions work closely with OEM
customers to develop highly-engineered products and systems that meet customer
needs. The Company focuses its research and development efforts primarily on
those product areas that it believes have the potential for broad market
applications and significant sales within a one-to-three year period.

Trademarks
and Patents

The Company owns a number of active patents worldwide. The Company also
regards its trademarks “Amphenol,” “Times Fiber,” and others to be of value in
its businesses. The Company has exclusive rights in all its major markets to
use these registered trademarks. While the Company considers its patents and
trademarks to be valuable assets, the Company does not believe that its
competitive position is dependent on patent or trademark protection or that its
operations are dependent on any individual patent or trademark.


Competition

The Company encounters competition in substantially all areas of its
business. The Company competes primarily on the basis of engineering, product
quality, price, customer service and delivery time. Competitors include large,
diversified companies, some of which the Company believes have substantially
greater assets and financial resources than the Company, as well as medium to
small companies. In the area of coaxial cable for cable television, the Company
believes that it and CommScope are the primary world providers of such cable;
however, CommScope is larger than the Company in this market. In addition, the
Company faces competition from other companies that have concentrated their
efforts in one or more areas of the coaxial cable market.

Backlog

The Company estimates that its backlog of unfilled orders was $397 million
and $293 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Orders
typically fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on customer demands and
general business conditions. Unfilled orders may be cancelled prior to shipment
of goods. It is expected that all or a substantial portion of the backlog will
be filled within the next 12 months. Significant elements of the Company’s
business, such as sales to the cable television industry, distributors, the
computer industry, and other commercial customers, generally have short lead
times. Therefore, backlog may not be indicative of future demand.

Employees

As of December 31, 2005, the Company had approximately 22,700
full-time employees worldwide. Of these employees, approximately 15,000 were
hourly employees and the remainder were salaried. The Company had a one week
strike in October 1995 at its Sidney, New York facility relating to the
renewal of the labor contract at that facility with the International
Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. The Company has not had any
other significant work stoppages in the past ten years. The Company believes
that it has a good relationship with its unionized and non-unionized employees.

Cautionary Statements for Purposes of Forward
Looking Information

Statements made by the Company in written or oral form to various
persons, including statements made in filings with the SEC, that are not
strictly historical facts are “forward looking” statements. Such statements
should be considered as subject to uncertainties that exist in the Company’s
operations and business environment.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

Investors should carefully consider the risks
described below and all other information in this Form 10-K. The risks and
uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the Company. Additional
risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that it currently
deems immaterial may also impair the Company’s business and operations.

If any of the following risks actually occur,
the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially
adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of the Company’s common
stock could decline and investors may lose all or part of their investment.

The Company is dependent on the communications industry,
including telecommunication and data communication, wireless communications and
cable television.

Approximately 51% of the Company’s revenues for
the year ended December 31, 2005 came from sales to the communications industry,
including telecommunication and data communication, wireless communications and
cable television. Demand for these products is subject to rapid technological
change (see below—”The Company is dependent on the acceptance of new product
introductions for continued revenue growth”). These markets are dominated by
several large manufacturers and operators who regularly exert significant price
pressure on their suppliers, including the Company. While sales to the


Company’s
largest customer were less than 4% of consolidated sales, the loss of one or
more of the large communications manufacturers or operators could have a
material adverse effect on the Company’s business. There can be no assurance
that the Company will be able to continue to compete successfully in the
communications industry, and the Company’s failure to do so could impair the
Company’s results of operations.

Approximately 12% of the Company’s revenues for
the year ended December 31, 2005 came from sales to the cable television industry.
Demand for the Company’s cable television products depends primarily on capital
spending by cable television operators for constructing, rebuilding or
upgrading their systems. The amount of this capital spending, and, therefore,
the Company’s sales and profitability will be affected by a variety of factors,
including general economic conditions, acquisitions of cable television
operators by non-cable television operators, cable system consolidation within
the industry, the financial condition of domestic cable television operators
and their access to financing, competition from satellite and wireless
television providers and telephone companies, technological developments and
new legislation and regulation of cable television operators. There can be no
assurance that existing levels of cable television capital spending will
continue or that cable television spending will not decrease.

Changes in defense expenditures may reduce

the Company’s

sales.

Approximately 24% of the Company’s revenues for
the year ended December 31, 2005 came from sales to the commercial aerospace
and military market. The Company participates in a broad spectrum of defense
programs and believes that no one program accounted for more than 2% of its
revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005. The substantial majority of
these sales are related to both U.S. and foreign military and defense programs.
However, the Company’s sales are generally to contractors and subcontractors of
the U.S. or foreign governments or to distributors that in turn sell to the
contractors and subcontractors. Nevertheless, the Company’s sales are affected
by changes in the defense budgets of the U.S. and foreign governments. The U.S.
defense budget declined in real terms from 1986 to 1998. Beginning in 1999, the
U.S. defense budget has been increasing and increased again in 2005. Nevertheless,
a decline in U.S. defense expenditures and defense expenditures generally could
adversely affect the Company’s business.

The Company

encounters competition in substantially all areas of its business.

The Company competes primarily on the basis of
engineering, product quality, price, customer service and delivery time. Competitors
include large, diversified companies, some of which have substantially greater
assets and financial resources than the Company, as well as medium to small
companies. There can be no assurance that additional competitors will not enter
the Company’s existing markets, nor can there be any assurance that the Company
will be able to compete successfully against existing or new competition.

The Company is

dependent on the acceptance of new product
introductions for continued revenue growth.

The Company estimates that products introduced
in the last two years accounted for approximately 20% of net sales for the year
ended December 31, 2005. The Company’s long-term results of operations depend
substantially upon its ability to continue to conceive, design, source and
market new products and upon continuing market acceptance of its existing and
future product lines. In the ordinary course of business, the Company
continually develop or create new product line concepts. If the Company fails
or is significantly delayed in introducing new product line concepts or if the
Company’s new products do not meet with market acceptance, our results of
operations may be impaired.

Covenants in the Company’s credit agreements may
adversely affect the Company.

The Company’s bank credit agreements contain
financial and other covenants, such as a limit on the ratio of debt to earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, minimum levels of net worth,
and limits on incurrence of liens. Although the Company believes none of these
covenants are presently restrictive to the Company’s operations, the ability to
meet the financial covenants can be affected by events beyond the Company’s
control, and the Company cannot provide assurance that the Company will meet
those tests. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under
the Company’s credit agreements. Upon the occurrence of an event of default
under any of the Company’s credit facilities, the lenders could elect to
declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable
and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If the lenders accelerate
the repayment of borrowings, the Company cannot provide assurance that it will
have sufficient assets to repay the Company’s credit facilities and other
indebtedness. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources”.


Downgrades of the Company’s debt rating could
adversely affect the Company.

If the credit rating agencies that rate the Company’s debt were to
downgrade the Company’s credit rating in conjunction with a deterioration of
the Company’s performance it may increase the Company’s cost of capital and
make it more difficult for the Company to obtain new financing.

The Company’s

results may be negatively affected by changing interest
rates.

The
Company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates
based on the Company’s financing activities. The Company utilizes interest rate
swap agreements to manage and mitigate its exposure to changes in interest
rates. At December 31, 2005, the Company had interest rate protection in the
form of swaps that effectively fixed the Company’s LIBOR interest rate on $150.0
million, $250.0 million and $250.0 million of floating rate debt at 4.82%,
4.24% and 4.85%, expiring in December 2007, July 2008 and December 2008,
respectively. At December 31, 2005, the Company’s average LIBOR rate was 4.6%. A
10% change in the LIBOR interest rate at December 31, 2005 would have had the
effect of increasing or decreasing interest expense by approximately $0.3

million. The Company does not expect
changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in
2006, although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not
significantly change.

The Company’s

results may be negatively affected by foreign currency exchange
rates.

The Company conducts business in several international currencies
through its worldwide operations, and as a result is subject to foreign
exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies.
Changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the Company’s
sales, gross margins and retained earnings. The Company attempts to minimize
currency exposure risk by producing its products in the same country or region
in which the products are sold, thereby generating revenues and incurring
expenses in the same currency and by managing its working capital although
there can be no assurance that this approach will be successful, especially in
the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the
international currencies of the Company’s worldwide operations. The Company
does not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative
purposes.

The Company’s

operating results may be adversely affected by foreign operations.

International manufacturing and sales are
subject to inherent risks, including changes in local economic or political
conditions, the imposition of currency exchange restrictions, unexpected
changes in regulatory environments, potentially adverse tax consequences and
the exchange rate risk discussed above. There can be no assurance that these
factors will not have a material adverse impact on the Company’s production
capabilities or otherwise adversely affect the Company’s

business and operating results.

The Company may experience difficulties and unanticipated
expense, including the potential for the impairment of goodwill, of
assimilating newly acquired businesses.

The Company has completed a number of
acquisitions in the past few years. It is possible the Company may experience
difficulty integrating such acquisitions and further that the acquisitions may
not perform as expected. At December 31, 2005, the total assets on the Company’s
balance sheet were $1,932.5 million, which included $886.7 million of
goodwill. The goodwill arose as the excess of the purchase price over the fair
value of net assets of businesses acquired dating over the period 1987-2005. The
Company performs annual evaluations for the potential impairment of the
carrying value of goodwill in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 142. Such evaluations have not resulted in the need to
recognize an impairment. However, if the financial performance of the Company’s
businesses were to decline significantly, the Company could incur a non-cash
charge to its income statement for the impairment of goodwill.

The Company may experience difficulties in
obtaining a consistent supply of materials at stable pricing levels.

The Company uses basic materials like steel,
aluminum, copper, bi-metallic products, gold and plastic resins in its
manufacturing process. Volatility in the prices of such material and
availability of supply may have a substantial impact on the price the Company
pays for such products. In addition, to the extent such cost increases cannot
be recovered through sales price increases or productivity improvements, the
Company’s margin may decline.


The Company may not be able to attract and retain
key employees.

The Company’s continued success depends upon its
continued ability to hire and retain key employees at its operations around the
world. Any difficulties in obtaining or retaining the management and other
human resource competencies that the Company needs to achieve its business

2. Properties

The Company’s fixed assets include certain plants and warehouses and a
substantial quantity of machinery and equipment, most of which is general
purpose machinery and equipment using tools and fixtures and in many instances
having automatic control features and special adaptations. The Company’s
plants, warehouses, machinery and equipment are in good operating condition,
are well maintained, and substantially all of its facilities are in regular
use. The Company considers the present level of fixed assets along with planned
capital expenditures as suitable and adequate for operations in the current
business environment. At December 31, 2005, the Company operated a total
of 128

plants and warehouses of which (a) the
locations in the U.S. had approximately 2.4

million square
feet, of which 1.2 million square feet were leased; (b) the locations outside
the U.S. had approximately 3.8 million square feet, of which 2.5

million square feet were leased; and (c) the square footage
by segment was approximately 5.2 million square feet and 1.0 million square
feet for interconnect products segment and cable products segment,
respectively.

The Company believes that its facilities are suitable and adequate for
the business conducted therein and are being appropriately utilized for their
intended purposes. Utilization of the facilities varies based on demand for the
products. The Company continuously reviews its anticipated requirements for
facilities and, based on that review, may from time to time acquire or lease
additional facilities and/or dispose of existing facilities.

Item
3. Legal Proceedings

The Company and its subsidiaries have been named as defendants in
several legal actions in which various amounts are claimed arising from normal
business activities. Although the amount of any ultimate liability with respect
to such matters cannot be precisely determined, in the opinion of management,
such matters are not expected to have a material effect on the Company’s
financial condition or results of operations.


Certain operations of the Company are subject to federal, state and
local environmental laws and regulations which govern the discharge of
pollutants into the air and water, as well as the handling and disposal of
solid and hazardous wastes. The Company believes that its operations are
currently in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental laws and
regulations and that the costs of continuing compliance will not have a
material effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations.

Subsequent to the acquisition of Amphenol from Allied Signal
Corporation (“Allied Signal”) in 1987 (Allied Signal merged with Honeywell
International Inc. in December 1999 (“Honeywell”)), Amphenol and
Honeywell have been named jointly and severally liable as potentially
responsible parties in relation to several environmental cleanup sites.
Amphenol and Honeywell have jointly consented to perform certain investigations
and remedial and monitoring activities at two sites and they have been jointly
ordered to perform work at another site. The costs incurred relating to these
three sites are currently reimbursed by Honeywell based on an agreement (the “Honeywell
Agreement”) entered into in connection with the acquisition in 1987. For sites
covered by the Honeywell Agreement, to the extent that conditions or
circumstances occurred or existed at the time of or prior to the acquisition,
Honeywell is obligated to reimburse Amphenol 100% of such costs. Honeywell
representatives continue to work closely with the Company in addressing the
most significant environmental liabilities covered by the Honeywell Agreement. Management
does not believe that the costs associated with resolution of these or any
other environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
financial condition or results of operations. The environmental investigation,
remedial and monitoring activities identified by the Company, including those
referred to above, are covered under the Honeywell Agreement.

Owners and occupiers of sites containing hazardous substances, as well
as generators of hazardous substances, are subject to broad liability under
various federal and state environmental laws and regulations, including
expenditures for cleanup and monitoring costs and potential damages arising out
of past disposal activities. Such liability in many cases may be imposed
regardless of fault or the legality of the original disposal activity. The
Company is currently performing monitoring activities at its manufacturing site
in Sidney, New York. The Company is also performing design, cleanup, operations
and maintenance and monitoring activities at three off-site disposal sites
previously utilized by the Company’s Sidney facility and others, the “Richardson
Hill” landfill, the “Route 8” landfill and the “Sidney Center” landfill. The
Company and Honeywell have entered into an administrative consent order with
the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) and are presently
performing remedial measures for “Richardson Hill”, which has been designated a
“Superfund” site on the National Priorities List under the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980. The
administrative consent order requires the Company to complete the approved
remedial measures and to continue to monitor the site. With respect to the
second site, the “Route 8” landfill, the Company initiated a remediation
program pursuant to a Consent Order with the New York Department of Environmental
Protection and is continuing to monitor the results of those remediation
efforts. In December 1995, the Company and Honeywell received a letter
from the EPA demanding that the Company and Honeywell accept responsibility for
the investigation and cleanup of the third site, Sidney Center landfill,
another Superfund site. The Sidney Center landfill was a municipal landfill
site utilized by the Company’s Sidney facility and other local towns and
businesses. In 1996, the Company and Honeywell received a unilateral order from
the EPA directing the Company and Honeywell to perform certain investigation,
design and cleanup activities at the Sidney Center landfill site. The Company
and Honeywell responded to the unilateral order by agreeing to undertake
certain remedial design activities. The Company and Honeywell have
substantially completed implementing the approved remedial measures for the
Sidney Center landfill site and will be responsible for continuing groundwater
monitoring at the site. The Company is also engaged in remediating or
monitoring environmental conditions at certain of its other manufacturing
facilities and has been named as a potentially responsible party for cleanup
costs at other off-site disposal sites. All such environmental matters referred
to in this paragraph are covered by the Honeywell Agreement.

Since 1987, the Company has not been identified nor has it been named
as a potentially responsible party with respect to any other significant
on-site or off-site hazardous waste matters. In addition, the Company believes
that all of its manufacturing activities and disposal practices since 1987 have
been in material compliance with all applicable environmental laws and
regulations. Nonetheless, it is possible that the Company will be named as a
potentially responsible party in the future with respect to additional
Superfund or other sites. Although the Company is unable to predict with any
reasonable certainty the extent of its ultimate liability with respect to any
pending or future environmental matters, the Company believes, based upon
information currently known by management about the Company’s manufacturing
activities, disposal practices and estimates of liability with respect to all
known environmental matters, that any such liability will not be material to
its financial condition or results of operations.

Item 5. Market for the Registrant’s Common Equity,
Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

On January 21, 2004, the Company announced a 2-for-1 stock split that
was effective for stockholders of record as of March 17, 2004. The additional
shares were distributed on March 29, 2004. The share information included
herein reflects the effect of such stock split.

The Company affected the initial public offering of its Class A Common
Stock in November 1991. The Company’s common stock has been listed on the
New York Stock Exchange since that time under the symbol “APH.” The following
table sets forth on a per share basis the high and low prices for the common
stock for both 2005 and 2004 as reported on the New York Stock Exchange.

As of January 31, 2006, there were 50 holders of record of the Company’s
common stock. A significant number of outstanding shares of common stock are
registered in the name of only one holder, which is a nominee of The Depository
Trust Company, a securities depository for banks and brokerage firms. The
Company believes that there are a significant number of beneficial owners of
its common stock.

On January 19, 2005, the Company announced that it would commence
payment of a quarterly dividend on its common stock of $.03 per share. Cumulative
dividends declared during 2005 were $10.8 million of which $8.0 million were
paid in 2005. The Company intends to continue payment of a quarterly dividend
on its common stock of $.03 per share and to retain the remainder of its
earnings to provide funds for the operation and expansion of the Company’s
business, repurchase shares of its common stock and to repay outstanding
indebtedness.

At December 31, 2003, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. (“KKR”)
owned 27.2% of the Company’s Class A Common Stock. During the third quarter of
2004, partnerships affiliated with KKR sold all their Class A common stock and,
as such, owned none of the Company’s Class A Common Stock as of
December 31, 2004. In 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company paid KKR fees of
$0.0, $0.5 million and $0.9 million, respectively for management and consulting
services.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
  Financial

Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion and analysis of the results of operations for
the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2005 has been derived from and
should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements
included elsewhere in this document.

Executive Overview

The Company is a global designer, manufacturer and marketer of
interconnect and cable products. In 2005, approximately 56% of the Company’s
sales were outside the U.S. The primary end markets for our products are:

•

communication
systems and information technology applications;

•

a
broad range of industrial applications including factory automation and motion
control systems, medical and industrial instrumentation, mass transportation
and natural resource exploration, and automotive applications; and

•

commercial
aerospace and military applications.

The Company’s products are used in a wide variety of applications by
numerous customers, the largest of which was less than 4% of net sales in 2005.
The Company encounters competition in all of its markets and competes primarily
on the basis of engineering, product quality, price, customer service and
delivery time. There has been a trend on the part of OEM customers to
consolidate their lists of qualified suppliers to companies that have a global
presence, can meet quality and delivery standards, have a broad product
portfolio and design capability, and have competitive prices. The Company has
focused its global resources to position itself to compete effectively in this
environment. The Company believes that its global presence is an important
competitive advantage as it allows the Company to provide quality products on a
timely and worldwide basis to its multinational customers.

The Company’s strategy is to provide comprehensive design capabilities,
a broad selection of products and a high level of service in the areas in which
it competes. The Company focuses its research and development efforts through
close collaboration with its OEM customers to develop highly-engineered
products that meet customer needs and have the potential for broad market
applications and significant sales within a one-to-three year period. The
Company is also focused on controlling costs. The Company does this by
investing in modern manufacturing technologies, controlling purchasing
processes and expanding into low cost labor areas.

The Company’s strategic objective is to further enhance its position in
its served markets by pursuing the following success factors:

•

Focus
on customer needs

•

Design
and develop application-specific interconnect solutions

•

Establish
a strong global presence in resources and capabilities

•

Preserve
and foster a collaborative, entrepreneurial management structure

•

Maintain
a culture of controlling costs

•

Pursue
strategic acquisitions

For the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company reported net sales,
operating income and net income of $1,808.1 million, $343.3 million and $206.3 million,
respectively; up 18%, 24% and 26%, respectively, from 2004. Sales of
interconnect products and assemblies and sales of cable products increased in
each of the Company’s related major markets and geographic regions. Sales and
profitability trends are discussed in detail in “Results of Operations” below. In
addition, one strength of the Company is its ability to consistently generate
cash. The Company uses cash generated from operations to fund capital expenditures
and acquisitions, repurchase shares of its common stock, pay dividends and
reduce indebtedness. In 2005, the Company generated operating cash flow of $229.6
million.


Results of Operations

The following table sets forth the components of net income as a
percentage of net sales for the periods indicated.


2005 Compared to 2004

Net sales were $1,808.1

million
for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to $1,530.4 million for
2004 an increase of 18% in both U.S. dollars and local currencies. The increase
in sales over 2004 excluding acquisitions was 8% in both U.S. dollars and local
currencies. Sales of interconnect products and assemblies increased 19% in U.S.
dollars and local currencies compared to 2004 ($1,592.4 million in 2005
versus $1,333.8 million in 2004). Sales increased in all major geographic
regions as a result of the continuing development of new application specific
and value added products, economic improvement in some of the Company’s major
end markets and the impact of acquisitions. Sales increased in the Company’s
major end markets including mobile communications, military/aerospace, industrial,
automotive, and computer/data communications markets. The increase in sales in
the mobile communications markets (approximately $92.7 million) is attributable
to increased demand for wireless infrastructure products for cell site installations
in North America, increased demand on mobile handset products in Asia and the
impact of acquisitions. The increase in sales in the industrial market
(approximately $24.1 million) reflects increased sales in North America and
Europe and the impact of acquisitions. Automotive sales increased approximately
$33.7 million primarily in Europe, reflecting the impact of an acquisition in late
2004. The increase in military/aerospace sales (approximately $57.8 million)
relates to increased demand on military programs, avionics applications in
North America and the impact of acquisitions. Sales to the computer and data
communications related markets increased approximately $45.8 million reflecting
the impact of acquisitions and increased sales in Asia for disk drive and
storage applications. Sales of cable products increased 10% compared to 2004 ($215.7
million in 2005 versus $196.6 million in 2004). Such increase is primarily
due to increased sales in broadband cable television markets and the impact of
price increases.

Geographically, sales in the U.S. in 2005 increased approximately 19%
compared to 2004 ($802.4 million in 2005 versus $674.3 million in 2004);
international sales for 2005 increased approximately 18% in U.S. dollars ($1,005.8
million in 2005 versus $856.1 million in 2004) and increased approximately
17% in local currency compared to 2004. The comparatively weak U.S. dollar in
2005 had the currency effect of increasing net sales by approximately $7.0 million
when compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2004.

The gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales (including
depreciation in cost of sales) increased to 33% in 2005 compared to 32% in 2004.
An increase in margins in the interconnect products and assemblies segment and was
partially offset by a decline in margins in the cable segment. The operating
margin for interconnect products and assemblies increased approximately 1%
compared to the prior year. The increase is generally attributable to the
continuing development of new higher margin application specific products,
excellent operating leverage on incremental volume and aggressive programs of
cost control. The decrease in cable margins was due to the impact of a
continued increase in material costs which was not fully offset by price
increases implemented during the year.

Selling, general and administrative expenses were $252.2 million and $215.0
million in 2005 and 2004, respectively, approximately 14.0% of sales. Research
and development expenditures increased approximately $7.6 million, commensurate
with sales, reflecting increases in expenditures for new product development
and represented approximately 2% of sales for both 2005 and 2004. Selling and
marketing expenses remained approximately 7% of sales. Shipping expense, which
relates primarily to sales of cable products to the broadband market, increased
commensurate with sales for those products. Administrative expenses increased
by approximately $8.4 million, due primarily to increases in costs relating to
insurance, pensions and medical benefits.

Interest expense was $24.1 million for 2005 compared to $22.5 million
for 2004. The increase is primarily attributable to higher interest rates partially
offset by the effect of the refinancing completed in the third quarter of 2005
(see Liquidity and Capital Resources) and higher average debt levels. At
current interest rates, interest expense for 2006 is expected to be
approximately $40 million.

Expenses for early extinguishment of debt totaling $2.4 million in 2005,
relate to the refinancing of the Company’s senior credit facilities. Such
one-time expenses include the write off of deferred debt issuance costs of $5.7
million partially offset by the settlement of interest rate swap agreements of
$3.2 million.

Other expenses, net, for 2005 and 2004 were $8.9 million and $6.7
million, respectively. Other expenses, net, are comprised primarily of foreign
currency transaction gains (losses) ($0.4 million in 2005 and $(0.6) million in
2004), reflecting the relative weakness of the U.S. dollar in 2004, program
fees on the sale of accounts receivable ($3.8 million in 2005 and $2.3 million
in 2004), reflecting higher receivable fee rates in 2005, minority interests ($4.1
million in 2005 and $3.0 million in 2004) and agency and commitment fees on the
Company’s credit facilities ($1.5 million in 2005 and $1.0 million in 2004)
primarily due to higher commitment fees. See Note 10 to the Company’s
Consolidated Financial Statements for details of the components of other
expenses, net.

The provision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 33.0% in 2005
and 34% in 2004. The reduction in the tax rate in 2005 relates primarily to
lower U.S. income taxes resulting from the impact of the provisions of the
American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.


2004 Compared to 2003

Net sales were $1,530.4

million
for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to $1,239.5 million for
2003 an increase of 23% in U.S. dollars and 20% in local currencies. Sales of
interconnect products and assemblies increased 24% in U.S. dollars and 20% in
local currencies compared to 2003 ($1,333.8 million in 2004 versus
$1,072.0 million in 2003). Sales increased in all major geographic regions as a
result of the continuing development of new application specific and value
added products, economic improvement in some of the Company’s major end markets
and the impact of acquisitions in 2004 and 2003 ($50.3 million). Sales
increased in the Company’s major end markets including mobile communications,
industrial, automotive, military/aerospace, and computer/data communications
markets. The increase in sales in the mobile communications markets
(approximately $105.7 million) is attributable primarily to increased demand on
wireless infrastructure products in all regions, increased demand on mobile
handset products in Asia and the impact of acquisitions during 2003 of
companies in North America and China serving the wireless installation market. The
increase in sales in the industrial market (approximately $49 million) reflects
increased sales in North America and Europe. Automotive sales increased
approximately $34 million primarily in Europe and to a lesser extent in North
America, reflecting the increased use of safety and telematic applications in
cars and as a result of acquisitions. The increase in military/aerospace sales
(approximately $63.9 million) relates primarily to increased demand on military
programs and avionics applications in North America and Europe. Sales to the
computer and data communications related markets increased approximately $11.1
million reflecting increased sales in North America, Europe and Asia and the
impact of acquisitions. Sales of cable products increased 17% compared to 2003
($196.6 million in 2004 versus $167.5 million in 2003). Such increase is
primarily due to increased sales in broadband cable television markets.

Geographically, sales in the U.S. in 2004 increased approximately 21%
compared to 2003 ($674.3 million in 2004 versus $555.9 million in 2003);
international sales for 2004 increased approximately 25% in U.S. dollars
($856.1 million in 2004 versus $683.6 million in 2003) and increased
approximately 19% in local currency compared to 2003. The comparatively weak
U.S. dollar in 2004 had the currency effect of increasing net sales by
approximately $46.6 million when compared to foreign currency translation
rates in 2003.

The gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales (including
depreciation in cost of sales) increased to 32% in 2004 compared to 31% in 2003.
An increase in margins was achieved in both the interconnect products and
assemblies segment and the cable segment although the cable segment increase
was partially offset by a continued increase in material costs. The operating
margin for interconnect products and assemblies increased approximately 2%
compared to the prior year. The increase is generally attributable to the continuing
development of new higher margin application specific products, excellent
operating leverage on incremental volume and aggressive programs of cost
controls.

Selling, general and administrative expenses were $215.0 million and
$177.4 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively, and remained approximately 14.0%
of sales in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Research and development expenditures
increased approximately $6.1 million, commensurate with sales, reflecting
increases in expenditures for new product development and represented
approximately 2% of sales for both 2004 and 2003. Selling and marketing
expenses remained approximately 7% of sales. Shipping expense, which relates
primarily to sales of cable products to the broadband market, increased commensurate
with sales for those products. Administrative expenses increased by
approximately $11.8 million, due primarily to increases in costs relating to
insurance, pensions, medical benefits and professional fees.

Interest expense was $22.5 million for 2004 compared to $29.5 million
for 2003. The decrease is primarily attributable to lower interest rates
including the effect of the refinancing completed in the second quarter of 2003
(see Liquidity and Capital Resources) and lower average debt levels. At current
interest rates, interest expense for 2005 is expected to be approximately $19
million.

Expenses for early extinguishment of debt totaling $10.4 million in
2003, relate to the refinancing of the Company’s senior credit facilities. Such
one-time expenses include the call premium related to the redemption of the
Company’s Senior Subordinated Notes of $4.7 million, write-off of unamortized
deferred debt issuance costs of $3.9 million and other related fees and
expenses of $1.8 million.

Other expenses, net, for 2004 and 2003 were $6.7 million and $7.0
million, respectively. Other expenses, net, are comprised primarily of foreign
currency transaction losses ($0.6 million in 2004 and $1.3 million in 2003),
reflecting the relative weakness of the U.S. dollar in 2004 and 2003, program
fees on sale of accounts receivable ($2.3 million in 2004 and $1.5 million in
2003), reflecting lower receivable fee rates in 2003, minority interests ($3.0
million in 2004 and $2.4 million in 2003) and agency and commitment fees on the
Company’s credit facilities ($1.0 million in 2004 and $0.8 million in 2003). In
addition, in 2003 the Company incurred $1.0 million in expenses relating to a
secondary stock offering (for which the Company did not receive any proceeds).
See Note 10 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for details of
the components of other expenses, net.

The provision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 34.0% in 2004
and 2003.


Liquidity and
Capital Resources

Cash provided by operating activities totaled $229.6 million, $208.3 million
and $170.0 million for 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Operating cash flow
includes $5.0 million, $6.2 million and $10.6 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively, resulting from an increase in sale of receivables under the
Company’s receivable securitization program. The increase in cash from
operating activities in 2005 compared to 2004 is primarily attributable to an
increase in net income and an increase in depreciation and amortization partially
offset by an increase in the non-cash components of working capital compared to
a decrease in 2004. The increase in cash from operating activities in 2004 compared
to 2003 is primarily attributable to an increase in net income in addition to a
larger reduction in the non-cash components of working capital compared to
2003.

The non-cash components of working capital increased $37.2 million in
2005 due primarily to an increase in accounts receivable of $45.2 million and
$21.1 million in inventory partially offset by a $25.8 million increase in
accounts payable, a decrease of $10.4 million in accrued liabilities, an
increase of $5.0 million of receivables sold, an increase in accrued interest
of $3.0 million, and a decrease of $5.6 million in prepaid expenses and other
assets.

The non-cash components of working capital decreased $14.1 million in
2004 due primarily to a $3.2 million increase in accounts payable, an increase
of $15.7 million in accrued liabilities, an increase of $6.2 million in
receivables sold and an increase of $28.5 million related to accrued income
taxes, partially offset by a $26.0 million increase in accounts receivable due
to higher sales levels and an operating addition of $14.5 million in inventory.

The non-cash components of working capital decreased $11.6 million in
2003 due primarily to a $20.8 million increase in accounts payable, an
operating reduction of $4.6 million in inventory, an increase of $10.6 million
in receivables sold, and an increase in accrued income taxes of $18.0 million,
partially offset by a $28.8 million increase in accounts receivable due to
higher sales levels and a decrease of $7.7 million in accrued liabilities.

In 2005, accounts receivable increased $88.7 million to $302.9 million,
due to an increase in sales levels and $71.7 million from acquired companies, offset
by $13.8 million due to translation and by a $5.0 million increase in sales of
receivables (further discussed below). Days sales outstanding, computed before
sales of receivables, increased to approximately 65 days from 64 days in 2004. Inventory
increased $78.6 million to $325.9 million, primarily due to an increase of $60.4
million in inventory from acquired companies coupled with an operating addition
of $27.5 million partially offset by $9.3 million of translation resulting from
the comparatively strong U.S. dollar at December 31, 2005 compared to December
31, 2004. Inventory turnover remained constant at 4.2x at December 31, 2005 and
December 31, 2004. Goodwill and acquired intangible assets increased $386.7
million to $934.1 million primarily as a result of acquisitions completed during
the year. Land and depreciable assets, net, increased $56.1 million to $253.9
million reflecting net capital expenditures of $57.1 million, assets from acquisitions
of approximately $57.7 million, partially offset by $9.0 million due to
translation resulting from the comparatively stronger U.S. dollar at December
31, 2005 compared to December 31, 2004 and depreciation of $49.7 million. Accounts
payable and accrued salaries, wages and employee benefits increased $42.4 million
and $4.2 million to $177.3 million and $42.7 million, respectively, due to an
increase in sales levels and liabilities assumed from acquired companies partially
offset by a $4.8 million and $1.9 million decrease, respectively, due to
translation resulting from the comparatively stronger U.S. dollar at December
31, 2005 compared to December 31, 2004. Other accrued liabilities increased $13.7
million to $50.8 million relating primarily to liabilities related to the
purchase of acquired companies and accruals relating to higher sales volume.

In 2005, cash from operating activities of $229.6 million (including additional
sales of receivables of $5.0 million) and proceeds from exercise of stock
options and related tax benefits of $36.4 million and net borrowings under the
Company’s bank agreements of $331.1 million were used primarily to fund capital
expenditures of $57.1 million, payment of dividends of $8.0 million,
acquisitions of $512.3 million, the purchase of treasury stock of $8.7 million,
and an increase in cash on hand of $8.5 million. For 2004, cash from operating
activities of $208.3 million (including additional sales of receivables of $6.2
million) and proceeds from exercise of stock options and related tax benefits
of $30.3 million were used primarily to fund capital expenditures of $44.3
million, acquisitions of $41.8 million, the purchase of treasury stock of $45.6
million, an increase in cash on hand of $6.6 million and for a net debt
reduction of $100.3 million.

On July 15, 2005, the Company completed a refinancing of its senior
secured credit facility. The new bank agreement (Revolving Credit Facility) is
comprised of a five-year $750 million unsecured revolving credit facility that
expires in July 2010, of which approximately $440 million was drawn at closing.
The net proceeds from the refinancing were used to repay all amounts
outstanding under the Company’s previous senior credit facility and for working
capital purposes. On November 15, 2005, the Company exercised its option to
increase its aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility by an
additional $250 million thereby increasing the revolving credit facility to $1
billion from $750 million.

At December 31, 2005, availability under the Revolving Credit Facility
was $267.6 million, after a reduction of $11.5 million for outstanding letters
of credit. In connection with the 2005 refinancing, the Company incurred
one-time expenses for the early extinguishment of debt of $2.4 million (less
tax effects of $0.8 million) or $.02 per share after tax. Such one-time
expenses include the write-off of unamortized deferred debt issuance costs less
the gain on the termination of related interest rate swap agreements. The
Company’s interest rate on borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility is
LIBOR plus 60 basis points. The Company also


pays certain annual agency and facility fees. At December 31, 2005, the
Company’s credit rating from Standard & Poor’s was BBB- and from Moody’s
was Ba1. The Revolving Credit Facility requires that the Company satisfy
certain financial covenants including an interest coverage ratio (EBITDA
divided by interest expense) of higher than 3X and a leverage ratio (Debt
divided by EBITDA) lower than 3.50X; at December 31, 2005, such ratios as
defined in the Revolving Credit Facility were 9.04X and 1.96X, respectively. The
Revolving Credit Facility also includes limitations with respect to, among
other things, (i) indebtedness in excess of $50.0 million for capital leases, $200.0
million for general indebtedness, $200.0 million for acquisition indebtedness,
(of which approximately $8.6 million, $0 and $0 were outstanding at December
31, 2005, respectively), (ii) restricted payments including dividends on the
Company’s Common Stock in excess of 50% of consolidated cumulative net income
subsequent to July 15, 2005 plus $250.0 million, or approximately $301.3
million at December 31, 2005, (iii) required consolidated net worth equal to
50% of cumulative consolidated net income commencing April 1, 2005 plus 100% of
net cash proceeds from equity issuances commencing April 1, 2005, plus $400.0
million, or approximately $512.4 million at December 31, 2005, (iv) creating or
incurring liens, (v) making other investments, and (vi) acquiring or disposing
of assets.

In conjunction with the Revolving Credit Facility, the Company entered
into interest rate swap agreements that fixed the Company’s LIBOR interest rate
on $150.0, $250.0 and $250.0 million of floating rate bank debt at 4.82%, 4.24%
and 4.85%, expiring in December 2007, July 2008 and December 2008, respectively.
While it is not the Company’s intention to terminate the interest rate swap
agreements, the fair value of such agreements was estimated by obtaining quotes
from brokers which represented the amounts that the Company would receive or
pay if the agreements were terminated. The fair value indicated that
termination of the agreements at December 31, 2005 would have resulted in a
pre-tax gain of $1.9 million; such gain, net of tax, of $0.8 was recorded in
other comprehensive income.

The Company’s primary ongoing cash requirements will be for operating
and capital expenditures, product development activities, repurchase of its
common stock, dividends and debt service. The Company may also use cash to fund
all or part of the cost of future acquisitions. The Company’s debt service
requirements consist primarily of principal and interest on bank borrowings.
The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flow,
the Company’s revolving credit facility and the sale of receivables under the
Company’s accounts receivable agreement. The Company expects that ongoing
requirements for operating and capital expenditures, product development
activities, repurchase of its common stock, dividends and debt service
requirements will be funded from these sources; however, the Company’s sources
of liquidity could be adversely affected by, among other things, a decrease in
demand for the Company’s products, a deterioration in certain of the Company’s
financial ratios or a deterioration in the quality of the Company’s accounts
receivable.

The Company expects that capital expenditures in 2006 will be approximately
$75 million. The Company’s required debt and capital lease amortization in 2006
is approximately $15.0 million. The Company’s required cash interest payments
for 2006, at current interest rates, are estimated at approximately $40 million.
The Company may also use cash to fund part or all of the cost of future
acquisitions. On January 19, 2005, the Company announced that it would
commence payment of quarterly dividends on its common stock of $.03 per share. The
Company paid its fourth quarterly dividend in the amount of $2.7 million or
$.03 per share on January 4, 2006 to shareholders of record as of December 14,
2005. Cumulative dividends declared during 2005 were $10.8 million of which $8.0
million were paid in 2005.

The Company intends to retain the remainder
of its earnings to provide funds for the operation and expansion of the Company’s
business, repurchase of its common stock and to repay outstanding indebtedness.
Management believes that the Company’s working capital position, ability to
generate strong cash flow from operations, availability under its Revolving
Credit Agreement and access to credit markets will allow it to meet its
obligations for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future.

Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangement - Accounts Receivable Securitization

A subsidiary of the Company has an agreement with a financial
institution whereby the subsidiary can sell an undivided interest of up to
$85.0 million in a designated pool of qualified accounts receivable. The
Company services, administers and collects the receivables on behalf of the
purchaser. The agreement includes certain covenants and provides for various
events of termination. The agreement expires in May 2007. At December 31, 2005,
approximately $85.0 million ($80.0 million at December 31, 2004) of receivables
were sold under the agreement and are therefore not reflected in the accounts
receivable balance in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.


TCS Acquisition

On December 1, 2005,
pursuant to an Asset and Stock Purchase Agreement dated October 10, 2005 (the “Asset
Purchase Agreement”) by and among the Company and Teradyne Corporation, Inc., a
Massachusetts Corporation (“Teradyne”). The Company purchased substantially all
of the assets and assumed certain of the liabilities of Teradyne’s backplane
and connection systems business segment (“TCS”), including the stock of certain
of its operating subsidiaries for a total purchase price of $384.7 million in
cash. In addition, Amphenol incurred approximately $8.8 million of transaction
related expenses. The accompanying Consolidated Statement of Income for the
year ended December 31, 2005, includes the results of TCS for the period
subsequent to the acquisition date; sales of approximately $34.0 million and
minimal net income resulting in no impact to 2005 consolidated net earnings per
share.

TCS is headquartered in
Nashua, New Hampshire and is a leading supplier of high-speed, high-density,
printed circuit board interconnect products. TCS sells its products primarily
to the data communications, storage and server markets, wireless infrastructure
markets and industrial markets. TCS had sales of $373.0 million for the year
ended December 31, 2005.

The acquisition was
accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with SFAS
No. 141, “Business Combinations”. Accordingly, the purchase price was allocated
first to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets and then to the
liabilities of TCS based upon their fair market values. The excess purchase
price over the fair market value of the underlying net assets acquired was allocated
to goodwill. The Company is in the process of completing its analysis of fair
value attributes of the assets acquired through the use of independent
appraisals and management’s estimates. It is anticipated that the final
assessment of values will not differ materially from the preliminary
assessment.

In connection with the
acquisition the Company recorded $239.3 million of goodwill and $45.5 million
of acquired intangible assets of which $30.4 million, $9.0 million and $6.1
million was assigned to proprietary technology, customer relationships and
license agreements, respectively, all of which are subject to amortization. The
acquired intangible assets have a total weighted-average useful life of approximately
12 years.  The license agreements, proprietary technology and customer
relationships have a weighted average useful life of 8 years, 15 years and 5
years, respectively. The entire amount of goodwill was assigned to the
interconnect segment all of which is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

The
following table summarizes the unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial
information assuming that the TCS acquisition actually occurred as of the
beginning of the period presented. On a pro forma basis for the year ended
December 31, 2005, TCS had sales and operating income of $373.0 million and
$6.7 million, respectively. Such amounts along with $22.2 million of additional
pro forma interest expense and related bank fees on borrowings to fund the acquisition
are reflected in the pro forma amounts shown below. The pro forma adjustments
are based upon available information and reflect a reasonable estimate of the
effects of the TCS acquisition for the periods presented on the basis set forth
herein. The unaudited pro forma financial information is presented for
informational purposes only and does not purport to represent what the Company’s
financial position or results of operations would have been had the TCS
acquisition in fact occurred on the dates assumed, nor is it necessarily
indicative of the results that may be expected in future periods.

To supplement the pro forma
combined financial information presented above, the Company uses certain
measures which are adjusted from the pro forma GAAP amounts based upon actions
taken either on the purchase date or known subsequent changes in cost
structure, the results of which are as shown below. These adjustments are
provided to enhance the user’s overall understanding of the Company’s current
and expected financial performance and are “forward looking”. The adjustments
are presented for informational purposes only and do not purport to represent
what our financial position or results of operations would have been had the
TCS acquisition in fact occurred on the dates assumed, nor are they necessarily
indicative of the results that may be expected in future periods. Such
information should be considered as subject to uncertainties that exist in the
Company’s operations and business environment. The following table sets forth
cash savings that are expected to be achieved as of or immediately following
the acquisition date as well as the reversal of non recurring restructuring
costs and non recurring gains on the sale of a business, which management does
not expect to reoccur in the future. This information is included to assist
investors and management in assessing the Company’s operating results in a
manner that is focused on the performance of the Company’s ongoing combined
operations.


(i)

In
conjunction with the acquisition, TCS’s historical management incentive plan
was terminated and replaced by an incentive plan which has higher profitability
targets. These targets would not have been achieved at TCS’s historic
profitability levels and, as such, the related expense would not have been incurred.

(ii)

Teradyne had
historically allocated corporate general and administrative costs to TCS which
are included in the pro forma amounts presented above. Such costs included
information technology, human resources, tax, legal, corporate treasury and
finance as well as executive administration related items. The acquisition
agreement included the hiring of certain Teradyne employees and assumption of
certain agreements that related to services historically performed by Teradyne
for TCS. In addition, Amphenol assumed the performance of certain tax and
treasury functions for TCS. This adjustment represents the excess of the amount
charged to TCS by Teradyne for those centralized services over the actual cost
incurred by TCS and Amphenol since the acquisition.

(iii)

Teradyne had
significant restructuring activities in 2004 and 2005 at TCS resulting in
related expenses which are included in the pro forma amounts presented above. No
significant restructuring activities are expected to take place in the future,
and as such, these costs are considered nonrecurring, and are therefore
included above as expected savings.

(iv)

TCS had
recognized gains on the sale of a business in 2004 and 2005 which are included
in the pro forma amounts presented above. These gains are not expected to occur
in the future.

Environmental
Matters

Subsequent to the acquisition of Amphenol from Allied Signal
Corporation in 1987 (Allied Signal merged with Honeywell International Inc.
(“Honeywell”) in December 1999, Amphenol and Honeywell have been named
jointly and severally liable as potentially responsible parties in relation to
several environmental cleanup sites. Amphenol and Honeywell have jointly
consented to perform certain investigations and remedial and monitoring
activities at two sites and they have been jointly ordered to perform work at
another site. The costs incurred relating to these three sites are currently
reimbursed by Honeywell based on an agreement entered into in connection with
the acquisition in 1987. For sites covered by this agreement, to the extent
that conditions or circumstances occurred or existed at the time of or prior to
the acquisition, Honeywell is obligated to reimburse Amphenol 100% of such costs.
Honeywell representatives work closely with the Company in addressing the most
significant environmental liabilities covered by the Agreement. Management does
not believe that the costs associated with resolution of these or any other
environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
financial condition or results of operations. The environmental investigation,
remedial and monitoring activities identified by the Company, including those
referred to above, are covered under the Honeywell Agreement.

Inflation and Costs

The cost of
the Company’s products is influenced by the cost of a wide variety of raw
materials, including precious metals such as gold and silver used in plating;
aluminum, copper, brass and steel used for contacts, shells and cable; and
plastic materials used in molding connector bodies, inserts and cable. In
general, increases in the cost of raw materials, labor and services have been
offset by price increases, productivity improvements and cost saving programs.

Risk Management

The Company
has to a significant degree mitigated its exposure to currency risk in its
business operations by manufacturing and procuring its products in the same
country or region in which the products are sold so that costs reflect local
economic conditions. In other cases involving U.S. export sales, raw materials
are a significant component of product costs for the majority of such sales and
raw material costs are generally dollar based on a worldwide scale, such as
basic metals and petroleum-derived materials.


Stock Split

On January 21,
2004, the Company announced a 2-for-1 stock split that was effective for
shareholders of record as of March 17, 2004. The additional shares were distributed
on March 29, 2004. The share information included herein reflects the effect of
such stock split.

Recent Accounting
Changes

In
December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. (“FAS”) 123R “Share-Based
Payment”. FAS 123R applies to all transactions involving the issuance, by a
company, of its own equity (stock, stock options, or other equity instruments)
in exchange for goods or services, including employee services. FAS 123R requires
entities to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for
the stock-based compensation using the fair value of those stocks on the grant
date (with limited exceptions). In April 2005, the effective date of this
statement was deferred and was effective as of the beginning of the first
fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company has adopted FAS 123R on
January 1, 2006 using the modified prospective method. The impact of adoption
of FAS 123R is expected to result in approximately $10.0 million of (pre-tax) expense
during 2006 although it will depend in part on the level of share-based
payments granted.

Pensions

The Company and its domestic subsidiaries have a defined benefit
pension plan (“Plan”) covering U.S. employees. Plan benefits are generally
based on years of service and compensation and are generally noncontributory.
Certain foreign subsidiaries also have defined benefit plans covering their
employees. The pension expense for all pension plans approximated $13.5 million,
$10.1 million and $6.5 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and is
calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions established on January
1 of the applicable year, including an expected long-term rate of return on
Plan assets. In developing the expected long-term rate of return assumption for
U.S. plans, we evaluated input from our actuaries and investment consultants as
well as long-term inflation assumptions. Projected returns by such consultants
are based on broad equity and bond indices. We also considered our historical sixteen-year
compounded return of 11.3%, which has been in excess of these broad equity and
bond benchmark indices. Our expected long-term rate of return on Plan assets is
based on an asset allocation assumption of 60% with equity managers, with an
expected long-term rate of return of 11%; 25% with fixed income managers, with
an expected

long-term
rate of return of 6.75% and 15% with high yield bond managers, with an expected
rate of return of 8.5%. As of December 31, 2005, our asset allocation was 66%
with equity managers and 34% with fixed income managers, including high yield
managers. We believe that our long-term asset allocation on average will
approximate 60% with equity managers and 40% with fixed income managers. We
regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance our
investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate. Based on
this methodology, the Company’s expected long-term rate of return assumption is
9.5% for both 2005 and 2004.

The discount rate used by the Company for valuing pension liabilities
is based on a review of high quality corporate bond yields with maturities
approximating the remaining life of the projected benefit obligations. The
discount rate on this basis has decreased from 5.75% at December 31, 2004 to 5.50%
at December 31, 2005. This will have the effect of increasing pension expense
in 2006 by approximately $.7 million. Although future changes to the discount
rate are unknown, had the discount rate increased or decreased 50 basis points,
the pension liability would have decreased $15.0 million or increased $15.5
million, respectively.

The Company made cash contributions to the U.S. pension plans of $10.0 million
and $20.0 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The liability for accrued
pension and post employment benefit obligations increased modestly in 2005 to $108.8
million from $102.1 million in 2004, due to the negative impact on accumulated
liabilities of the reduction in the discount rate and the foreign currency
translation effect for non-U.S. plans. The Company estimates that, based on
current actuarial calculations, it will make a voluntary cash contribution to
the pension plan in 2006 of approximately $10.0 to 15.0 million. Cash contributions
in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors including the investment
performance of Plan assets.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates. Estimates are adjusted as new
information becomes available. The Company’s significant accounting policies
are set forth below.


Revenue Recognition - Sales and related cost of sales are recognized
upon shipment of products. Allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts,
discounts, returns and allowances are provided based upon historical
experience, current trends and specific information which indicate that an
allowance is appropriate.

Inventories - Inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost,
which approximates average cost, or market. Provisions for slow moving and
obsolete inventory are made based on historical experience and product demand. Should
future product demand change, existing inventory could become slow moving or
obsolete and provisions would be increased accordingly.

Depreciable Assets - Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost
less accumulated depreciation. The appropriateness and the recoverability of
the carrying value of such assets are periodically reviewed taking into
consideration current and expected business conditions. Historically, the
Company has not had any significant impairments.

Goodwill - The Company performs its annual evaluation for the
impairment of goodwill for the Company’s reporting units, in accordance with
FAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”, as of each June 30.
Goodwill impairment for each reporting unit is evaluated using a two-step
approach requiring the Company to determine the fair value of the reporting
unit and to compare that to the carrying value including goodwill. If the
carrying value exceeds the fair value, the goodwill of the reporting unit would
be potentially impaired and a second step of additional testing would be
performed to measure the impairment loss. Historically, the Company has not had
any impairments.

The significant accounting policies are more fully described in
Note 1 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.

Disclosures about
contractual obligations and commitments

The following table summarizes the Company’s known obligations to make
future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of December 31, 2005, as
well as an estimate of the timing in which such obligations are expected to be
satisfied:


Item 7A. 
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

The Company, in the normal course of doing business, is exposed to the
risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest
rates.

Foreign
Currency Exchange Rate Risk

The Company conducts business in several international currencies
through its worldwide operations, and as a result is subject to foreign
exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies.
Changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the Company’s
sales, gross margins and retained earnings. The Company attempts to minimize
currency exposure risk by producing its products in the same country or region
in which the products are sold, thereby generating revenues and incurring
expenses in the same currency and by managing its working capital although
there can be no assurance that this approach will be successful, especially in
the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the
international currencies of the Company’s worldwide operations. The Company
does not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative
purposes.

Interest Rate Risk

Relative to interest rate risk, the Company completed a refinancing of
its senior credit facilities during the third quarter 2005 as discussed in Liquidity
and Capital Resources above. In conjunction with the 2005 refinancing and the
funds drawn in conjunction with the TCS acquisition (See Note 7 to the Company’s
Consolidated Financial Statements), the Company entered into interest rate swap
agreements that fixed the Company’s LIBOR interest rate on $150.0 million, $250.0
million and $250.0 million of floating rate debt at 4.82%, 4.24% and 4.85%,
expiring in December 2007, July 2008 and December 2008, respectively. At December
31, 2005, the Company’s average LIBOR rate was 4.6%. A 10% change in the LIBOR
interest rate at December 31, 2005 would have the effect of increasing or
decreasing interest expense by approximately $0.3

million. The Company does not expect changes in interest
rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2006, although there
can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly change.


Item 8. Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Amphenol Corporation

Wallingford, Connecticut

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Amphenol Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of
December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated statements of income,
shareholders’ equity and other comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005.  We also have
audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management Report
on Internal Control in Item 9a, that the Company maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria
established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  The Company’s
management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements, an
opinion on management’s assessment, and an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. As
described in Management Report on Internal Control, management excluded from
their assessment the internal control over financial reporting at Amphenol TCS
which was acquired on December 1, 2005 and whose financial statements constitute
7 percent, 2 percent and 0.2 percent of total assets, revenues and net income,
respectively, of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the
year ended December 31, 2005. Accordingly, our audit did not include the
internal control over financial reporting at Amphenol TCS.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting
was maintained in all material respects.  Our audit of financial
statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation.  Our audit of internal
control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment,
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s
principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing
similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors,
management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles.  A company’s internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of
internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of
collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements
due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal
control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that
the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2005, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.  Also in our opinion,
management’s assessment that the Company maintained effective internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on the criteria established in Internal
Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  Furthermore, in our opinion, the
Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on the criteria established
in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

Note 1-Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies

Operations

Amphenol Corporation (“Amphenol” or the “Company”) is in two business
segments which consist of manufacturing and selling interconnect products and
assemblies, and manufacturing and selling cable products. The Company sells its
products to customers locations worldwide.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.

Principles of
Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.

Cash and Short-Term
Cash Investments

Cash and short-term cash investments consist of cash and liquid
investments with an original maturity of less than three months. The carrying
amount approximates fair value of those instruments.

Sale of Receivables

A subsidiary of the Company has an agreement with a financial
institution whereby the subsidiary can sell an undivided interest of up to
$85,000 in a designated pool of qualified accounts receivable. The agreement
expires in May 2007. Under the terms of the agreement, new receivables are
added to the pool as collections reduce previously sold accounts receivable.
The aggregate value of receivables transferred to the pool for the years 2005, 2004
and 2003 were $761,129, $606,136, and $538,093, respectively. At
December 31, 2005 and 2004, $44,958 and $32,992, respectively, of accounts
receivable were transferred to the subsidiary, but not purchased by the
financial institution and are therefore included in the accounts receivable
balance in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Due to the short-term
nature of the accounts receivable, the fair value approximates the carrying
value. The Company services, administers and collects the receivables on behalf
of the purchaser. Program fees payable to the purchaser under this agreement
are equivalent to rates afforded high quality commercial paper issuers plus
certain administrative expenses and are included in other expenses, net, in the
accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. The agreement contains certain
covenants and provides for various events of termination. At December 31, 2005
and 2004, approximately $85,000 and $80,000, respectively, of receivables were
sold under the agreement and are therefore not reflected in the accounts
receivable balance in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost, which
approximates average cost, or market. The principal components of cost included
in inventories are materials, direct labor and manufacturing overhead.


Depreciable Assets

Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost. Depreciation and
amortization of property, plant and equipment are provided on a straight-line
basis over the respective asset lives determined on a composite basis by asset
group or on a specific item basis using the estimated useful lives of such
assets which range from 3 to 12 years for machinery and equipment and 20
to 40 years for buildings. It is the Company’s policy to periodically
review fixed asset lives.

Deferred Debt
Issuance Costs

Deferred debt issuance costs are being amortized on the interest method
over the term of the related debt and such amortization is included in interest
expense.

Goodwill

The Company performs its annual evaluation
for the impairment of goodwill for the Company’s reporting units, in accordance
with Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 142 (“FAS 142”) “Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets”, as of each June 30. The Company has defined
its reporting units as the operating segments within its two reportable
business segments “Interconnect Products and Assemblies” and “Cable Products”,
as the components of these operating segments have similar economic
characteristics. Goodwill impairment for each reporting unit is evaluated using
a two-step approach requiring the Company to determine the fair value of the
reporting unit and compare that to the carrying value including goodwill. If
the carrying value exceeded the fair value, the goodwill of the reporting unit
would be potentially impaired and a second step of additional testing would be
performed to measure the impairment loss. As of June 30, 2005, and for
each previous year in which the impairment test has been performed, the fair
market value of the Company’s reporting units exceeded the carrying value and
therefore no impairment was recognized.

Revenue Recognition

The Company’s primary source of revenues is from product sales to its
customers.

Revenue from sales of the Company’s products is recognized at the time
the goods are delivered and title passes, provided the earnings process is
complete and revenue is measurable. Delivery is determined by the Company’s
shipping terms, which are primarily FOB shipping point. Revenue is recorded at
the net amount to be received after deductions for estimated discounts,
allowances and returns. These estimates and reserves are determined and
adjusted as needed based upon historical experience, contract terms and other
related factors.

The shipping costs for the majority of the Company’s sales are paid
directly by the Company’s customers. In the broadband communication market
(approximately 12% of consolidated sales), the Company pays for shipping cost
to the majority of its customers. Amounts billed to customers related to
shipping costs are immaterial and are included in net sales. Shipping costs
incurred to transport products to the customer, which are not reimbursed are
included in selling, general and administrative expense.

Retirement Pension
Plans

Costs for retirement pension plans include current service costs and
amortization of prior service costs over periods of up to thirty years. It is
the Company’s policy to fund current pension costs taking into consideration
minimum funding requirements and maximum tax deductible limitations. The
expense of retiree medical benefit programs is recognized during the employees’
service with the Company as well as amortization of a transition obligation
recognized on adoption of the accounting principle.


Stock Options

The Company applies APB Opinion 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees,” and related interpretations in accounting for stock options.
Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized for the option plans. Had
compensation cost for stock options been determined based on the fair value of
the option at date of grant consistent with the provisions of FAS No. 123, “Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation,” the Company’s net income and earnings per share
would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below:

The fair value of stock options has been estimated at the date of grant
using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average
assumptions:

The weighted-average fair values of options granted during 2005, 2004 and
2003 were $10.69, $9.15 and $6.50, respectively.

As discussed below in “Recent Accounting Changes”, effective January 1,
2006, in accordance with the implementation of SFAS 123R, the Company will begin
to expense stock based compensation. Prior to January 1, 2006, such expense has
been disclosed in the Company’s financial statement footnotes as noted above,
and was not included as an expense in the Company’s statement of income.

Income Taxes

Deferred income taxes are provided for revenue and expenses which are
recognized in different periods for income tax and financial statement purposes.
Deferred income taxes are not provided on undistributed earnings of foreign
affiliated companies which are considered to be permanently invested. It is not
practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable. Deferred tax
assets are regularly assessed for recoverability based on both historical and
anticipated earnings levels and a valuation allowance is recorded when it is
more likely than not that these amounts will not be recovered.


Foreign Currency
Translation

The financial position and results of operations of the Company’s
significant foreign subsidiaries are measured using local currency as the
functional currency. Assets and liabilities of such subsidiaries have been
translated at current exchange rates and related revenues and expenses have
been translated at weighted average exchange rates. The aggregate effect of
translation adjustments so calculated is included as a component of accumulated
other comprehensive loss within shareholders’ equity. Transaction gains and
losses related to operating assets and liabilities are included in selling,
general and administrative expense and those related to non-operating assets
and liabilities are included in other expense, net.

Research and
Development

Research and development expenses for the creation of new and improved
products and processes were $37,510, $32,459, and $26,361, for the years 2005, 2004
and 2003, respectively.

Environmental
Obligations

The Company recognizes the potential cost for environmental remediation
activities when assessments are made, remedial efforts are probable and related
amounts can be reasonably estimated; potential insurance reimbursements are not
recorded. The Company regularly assesses its environmental liabilities through
reviews of contractual commitments, site assessments, feasibility studies and
formal remedial design and action plans.

Net Income per
Common Share

Basic income per common share is based on the net income for the period
divided by the weighted average common shares outstanding. Diluted income per
common share assumes the exercise of outstanding, dilutive stock options using
the treasury stock method. On January 21, 2004, the Company announced a 2-for-1
stock split that was effective for shareholders of record as of March 17, 2004.
The additional shares were distributed on March 29, 2004. The share information
included herein has been restated to reflect the effect of such stock split.

Derivative Financial
Instruments

Derivative financial instruments, which are periodically used by the
Company in the management of its interest rate and foreign currency exposures,
are accounted for on an accrual basis. Income and expense are recorded in the
same category as that arising from the related asset or liability. For example,
amounts to be paid or received under interest rate swap agreements are
recognized as an increase or decrease of interest expense in the periods in which
they accrue. The Company adopted FAS 133, as amended by FAS 138,
beginning January 1, 2001. Gains and losses on derivatives designated as
cash flow hedges resulting from changes in fair value are recorded in other
comprehensive income, and subsequently reflected in net income in a manner that
matches the timing of the actual income or expense of such instruments with the
hedged transaction. At December 31, 2005, the Company had interest rate
swap agreements that fix the Company’s LIBOR interest rate on $150,000, $250,000
and $250,000 of floating rate bank debt at 4.82%, 4.24% and 4.85%, expiring in December
2007, July 2008 and December 2008, respectively. These agreements are
designated as cash flow hedges and accounted for as described above.

Recent Accounting
Changes

In
December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. (“FAS”) 123R “Share-Based
Payment”. FAS 123R applies to all transactions involving the issuance, by a
company, of its own equity (stock, stock options, or other equity instruments)
in exchange for goods or services, including employee services. FAS 123R
requires entities to recognize the cost of employee services received in
exchange for the stock-based compensation using the fair value of those stocks
on the grant date (with limited exceptions). The Company has adopted FAS 123R
on January 1, 2006 using the modified prospective method. The impact of
adoption of FAS 123R is expected to result in approximately $10,000 of (pre-tax)
expense during 2006 although it will depend in part on the level of share-based
payments granted in the future.


Note 2—Long-Term
Debt

Long-term debt consists of the following:

On July 15, 2005, the Company completed a refinancing of its senior secured
credit facility. The new bank agreement (Revolving Credit Facility) is
comprised of a five-year $750,000 unsecured revolving credit facility that
expires in July 2010, of which approximately $440,000 was drawn at closing. The
net proceeds from the refinancing were used to repay all amounts outstanding
under the Company’s previous senior credit facility and for working capital
purposes. On November 15, 2005, the Company exercised its option to increase
its aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility by an additional
$250,000 thereby increasing the Revolving Credit Facility to $1,000,000 from
$750,000.

At December 31, 2005, availability under the Revolving Credit Facility
was $267,638, after a reduction of $11,462 for outstanding letters of credit. In
connection with the 2005 refinancing, the Company incurred one-time expenses
for the early extinguishment of debt of $2,398 (less tax effects of $791) or $.02
per share after tax. Such one-time expenses include the write-off of
unamortized deferred debt issuance costs less the gain on the termination of
related interest rate swap agreements. The Company’s interest rate on
borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility is LIBOR plus 60 basis points. The
Company also pays certain annual agency and facility fees. At December 31, 2005,
the Company’s credit rating from Standard & Poor’s was BBB- and from Moody’s
was Ba1. The Revolving Credit Facility requires that the Company satisfy
certain financial covenants including an interest coverage ratio (EBITDA
divided by interest expense) of higher than 3X and a leverage ratio (Debt
divided by EBITDA) lower than 3.50X; at December 31, 2005, such ratios as
defined in the Revolving Credit Facility were 9.04X and 1.96X, respectively. The
Revolving Credit Facility also includes limitations with respect to, among
other things, (i) indebtedness in excess of $50,000 for capital leases, $200,000
for general indebtedness, $200,000 for acquisition indebtedness, (of which
approximately $8,601, $0 and $0 were outstanding at December 31, 2005,
respectively), (ii) restricted payments including dividends on the Company’s
Common Stock in excess of 50% of consolidated cumulative net income subsequent
to July 15, 2005 plus $250 million, or approximately $301,272 at December 31, 2005,
(iii) required consolidated net worth equal to 50% of cumulative consolidated
net income commencing April 1, 2005 plus 100% of net cash proceeds from equity
issuances commencing April 1, 2005, plus $400,000, or approximately $512,400 at
December 31, 2005, (iv) creating or incurring liens, (v) making other
investments, and (vi) acquiring or disposing of assets.

In conjunction with borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, the
Company has entered into interest rate swap agreements that fixed the Company’s
LIBOR interest rate on $150,000, $250,000 and $250,000 of floating rate bank debt
at 4.82%, 4.24% and 4.85%, expiring in December 2007, July 2008 and December
2008, respectively. While it is not the Company’s intention to terminate the
interest rate swap agreements, the fair value of such agreements was estimated
by obtaining quotes from brokers which represented the amounts that the Company
would receive or pay if the agreements were terminated. The fair value
indicated that termination of the agreements at December 31, 2005 would have
resulted in a pre-tax gain of $1,901; such gain, net of tax of $753 was
recorded in other comprehensive income.

The maturity of the Company’s long-term debt over each of the next five
years ending December 31, is as follows: 
2006 - $15,030; 2007 - $6,755; 2008 - $653; 2009 - $259; 2010 - $757,256;
thereafter - $1,047.

The Company estimates that the fair value of its long-term debt
approximates book value.


Note 3—Income
Taxes

The components of income before income taxes and the provision for
income taxes are as follows:

At December 31, 2005, the Company had $11,551 and $783 of foreign
tax loss carryforwards, and state tax credit carryforwards net of Federal
benefit, respectively, of which $2,882

and $688, respectively,

expire or will be refunded at
various dates through 2019 and the balance can be carried forward indefinitely.

A valuation allowance of $3,466

and
$3,213 at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, has been recorded which
relates to the foreign net operating loss carryforwards and foreign and state tax
credits. The net change in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was
an increase of $253 and $1,150 in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The net change
in the valuation allowance in both 2005 and 2004 was related to foreign net
operating loss and foreign and state credit carryforwards.


Differences between the U.S. statutory federal tax rate and the Company’s
effective income tax rate are analyzed below:

The Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities, excluding a
valuation allowance, were comprised of the following:

The deferred tax asset relating to pension in the table above includes
$44,036 and $39,410 at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, relating
to the Company’s additional minimum pension liability (Note 5).

On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the “Act”)
was signed into law. Under Internal Revenue Code Section 965, the Act creates a
temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate income earned abroad by
providing an 85% dividends received deduction for certain dividends. The
Company has applied the provisions of the Act to a portion of its qualifying
2005 repatriations of current year earnings. The amount of earnings that the
Company repatriated under the provision is $32,134. The income tax incurred as
a result of this repatriation is $1,211. The Company has also applied a
provision of the Act that allows a deduction for income from qualified domestic
production activities, which will be phased in from 2005 through 2010 and a
two-year phase-out of the existing extra-territorial income exclusion (“ETI”)
for foreign sales.

The Company is subject to periodic audits of its various tax returns by
government agencies; management does not believe that amounts, if any, which
may be required to be paid by reason of such audits will have a material effect
on the Company’s financial position or results of operations. The Company has
recorded accruals for certain tax contingencies related to various tax matters
as of December 31, 2005.


Note 4—Shareholders’
Equity

In May 1997, the Company adopted the 1997 Option Plan, and in
May 2000, adopted the 2000 Option Plan (“Option Plans”). The Option Plans
authorize the granting of stock options by a committee of the Board of
Directors. At December 31, 2005, the maximum number of shares of common
stock available for the granting of stock options under the Option Plans was 730,110.
Options granted under the Option Plans vest ratably over a period of five years
and are exercisable over a period of ten years from the date of grant. In
addition, shares issued in conjunction with the exercise of stock options are
generally subject to Management Stockholder Agreements which, among other
things, place restrictions on the sale or transfer of such shares. In 2004, the
Company adopted the 2004 Stock Option Plan for Directors of Amphenol
Corporation (the “Directors Plan”). The Directors Plan is administered by the
Board of Directors. At December 31, 2005, the maximum number of shares of
common stock available for the granting of stock options under the Directors
Plan was 210,000. Options granted under the Directors Plan vest ratably over a
period of three years and are exercisable over a period of ten years from the
date of grant. In addition, shares issued in conjunction with the exercise of
stock options are generally subject to Stockholder Agreements which, among
other things, place restrictions on the sale or transfer of such shares.

Stock option activity for 2003, 2004 and 2005 was as follows:

The following table summarizes information about stock options outstanding
at December 31, 2005:

At December 31, 2003, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. (“KKR”)
owned 27.2% of the Company’s Class A common stock. During the third quarter of
2004, partnerships affiliated with KKR sold all their Class A common stock and,
as such owned none of the Company’s Class A Common Stock as of
December 31, 2004. In 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company paid KKR fees of $0.0,
$0.5 million and $0.9 million, respectively, for management and consulting
services.


On
January 19, 2005, the Company announced that it would commence payment of
quarterly dividend on its common stock of $.03 per share. The Company paid its
fourth quarterly dividend in the amount of $2,729 or $.03 per share on January
4, 2006 to shareholders of record as of December 14, 2005. Cumulative dividends
declared during 2005 were $10,763 of which $8,034 were paid in 2005.

Balances of related after-tax components comprising accumulated other
comprehensive loss included in shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2003, 2004
and 2005, are as follows:


Note 5—Benefit
Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits

The Company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries have a defined
benefit pension plan covering certain U.S. employees (the “Plan”). Plan
benefits are generally based on years of service and compensation and are generally
noncontributory. Certain foreign subsidiaries have defined benefit plans
covering their employees. Certain U.S. employees not covered by the defined
benefit plan are covered by defined contribution plans. The following is a
summary of the Company’s defined benefit plans funded status as of the most
recent actuarial valuations; for each year presented below accumulated benefits
exceed assets:


The pension expense for pension plans is calculated based upon a number
of actuarial assumptions established on January 1 of the applicable year,
detailed in the table above, including a weighted-average discount rate, rate
of increase in future compensation levels and an expected long-term rate of
return on Plan assets. The discount rate used by the Company for valuing
pension liabilities is based on a review of high quality corporate bond yields
with maturities approximating the remaining life of the projected benefit
obligations. The discount rate on this basis has decreased from 5.75% at
December 31, 2004 to 5.50% at December 31, 2005. This will have the effect of
increasing pension expense in 2006 by approximately $.7 million. Although
future changes to the discount rate are unknown, had the discount rate
increased or decreased 50 basis points, the pension liability would have
decreased $15.0 million or increased $15.5 million, respectively. In developing
the expected long-term rate of return assumption on plan assets which consist
mainly of U.S. equity and debt securities, the Company evaluated input from its
actuaries and investment consultants as well as long-term inflation assumptions.
Projected returns by such consultants are based on broad equity and bond
indices. The Company also considered its historical sixteen

-

year compound
return of 11.3%, which has been in excess of these broad equity and bond
benchmark indices. The expected long-term rate of return on Plan assets is
based on an asset allocation assumption of 60% with equity managers, with an
expected long-term rate of 11%, 25% with fixed income managers, with an
expected long-term rate of return of 6.75% and 15% with high yield bond
managers, with an expected rate of return of 8.5%. At December 31, 2005, the
asset allocation was 66% with equity managers and 34% with fixed income
managers, including high yield managers. The Company believes that its
long-term asset allocation on average will approximate 60% with equity managers
and 40% with fixed income managers. The Company regularly reviews its actual
asset allocation and periodically rebalance the Company’s investments to its
targeted allocation when considered appropriate. Based on this methodology the
Company’s expected long-term rate of return assumption is 9.5% in 2005 and 2004.
The Company has also adopted an unfunded Supplemental Employee Retirement Plan,
which provides for the payment of the portion of annual pension which cannot be
paid from the retirement plan as a result of regulatory limitations on average
compensation for purposes of the benefit computation. The largest non-U.S.
pension plan, in accordance with local custom, is unfunded and had an
accumulated benefit obligation of approximately $42,779 and $41,903 at December 31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. Such obligation is included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets
and the tables above.

In accordance with the provisions of FAS No. 87, the Company has
recognized a minimum pension liability at December 31, 2005 of $128,449 ($117,252 at
December 31, 2004) for circumstances in which a pension plan’s accumulated
benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of the plan’s assets and accrued
pension liability. Such liability was partially offset by an intangible asset
equal to the unrecognized prior service cost, with the net change of $10,411 ($4,154
at December 31, 2004), recorded as a reduction in shareholders’ equity, net of
related deferred tax benefits.

The Company made a $10,000 voluntary cash contribution to the U.S.
Pension Plan in 2005 and paid benefit payments of $14,200

.

The Company
estimates that based on current actuarial calculations it will make a voluntary
cash contribution to the U.S. Pension Plan in 2006 between $10,000 and $15,000.
Cash contributions in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors
including performance of plan assets.


The Company maintains self-insurance programs for that portion of its
health care and workers compensation costs not covered by insurance. The
Company also provides certain health care and life insurance benefits to
certain eligible retirees through postretirement benefit programs. The Company’s
share of the cost of such plans for most participants is fixed, and any
increase in the cost of such plans will be the responsibility of the retirees.
The Company funds the benefit costs for such plans on a pay-as-you-go basis.
Since the Company’s obligation for postretirement medical plans is fixed and
since the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (“APBO”) and the net
postretirement benefit expense are not material in relation to the Company’s
financial condition or results of operations, we believe any change in medical
costs from that estimated will not have a significant impact on the Company.
The discount rate used in determining the APBO at December 31, 2005 and 2004
was 5.50% and 5.75%, respectively. Summary information on the Company’s
postretirement medical plans is as follows:

Note 6—Leases

At
December 31, 2005, the Company was committed under operating leases which
expire at various dates. Total rent expense under operating leases for the
years 2005, 2004, and 2003 were $19,257, $17,664 and $18,650, respectively.

Minimum
lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases are as follows:


Note 7—TCS
Acquisition

On December 1, 2005,
pursuant to an Asset and Stock Purchase Agreement dated October 10, 2005 (the “Asset
Purchase Agreement”) by and among the Company and Teradyne Corporation, Inc., a
Massachusetts Corporation (“Teradyne”). The Company purchased substantially all
of the assets and assumed certain of the liabilities of Teradyne’s backplane
and connection systems business segment (“TCS”), including the stock of certain
of its operating subsidiaries for a total purchase price of approximately $384,700
in cash including purchase price adjustments of approximately $5,300. In
addition, the Company incurred approximately $8,800 of transaction related
expenses. The accompanying Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended
December 31, 2005, includes the results of TCS for the period subsequent to the
acquisition date; sales of approximately $34,000 and minimal net income
resulting in no impact to 2005 consolidated net earnings per share.

TCS is headquartered in
Nashua, New Hampshire and is a leading supplier of high-speed, high-density,
printed circuit board interconnect products. TCS sells its products primarily
to the data communications, storage and server markets, wireless infrastructure
markets and industrial markets. TCS had total sales of approximately $373,000
for the year ended December 31, 2005.

The acquisition was accounted
for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with SFAS No. 141, “Business
Combinations”. Accordingly, the purchase price was allocated first to the
tangible and identifiable intangible assets and then to the liabilities of TCS
based upon their fair market values. The excess purchase price over the fair
market value of the underlying net assets acquired was allocated to goodwill. The
Company is in the process of completing its analysis of fair value attributes
of the assets acquired through the use of independent appraisals and management’s
estimates. It is anticipated that the final assessment of values will not
differ materially from the preliminary assessment. The following table
summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed at the date of acquisition.

Of the $45,500 of acquired intangible assets, $30,400,
$9,000 and $6,100 was assigned to proprietary technology, customer relationships
and license agreements, respectively, all of which are subject to amortization.
The acquired intangible assets have a total weighted-average useful life of
approximately 12 years.  The license agreements, proprietary technology
and customer relationships have a weighted average useful life of 8 years, 15
years and 5 years, respectively. The entire amount of goodwill was assigned to
the interconnect segment all of which is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

The
following table summarizes the unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial
information assuming that the TCS acquisition actually occurred as of the
beginning of the period presented. On a pro forma basis for the year ended December
31, 2005, TCS had sales and operating income of approximately $373,000 and $6,700,
respectively. Such amounts along with approximately $22,200 of additional pro
forma interest expense and related bank fees on borrowings to fund the
acquisition are reflected in the pro forma amounts shown below. The pro forma
adjustments are based upon available information and reflect a reasonable estimate
of the effects of the TCS acquisition for the periods presented on the basis
set forth herein. The unaudited pro forma financial information is presented
for informational purposes only and does not purport to represent what the
Company’s financial position or results of operations would have been had the
TCS acquisition in fact occurred on the dates assumed, nor is it necessarily indicative
of the results that may be expected in future periods.


Note 8—Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets

As
of December 31, 2005, the Company has goodwill totaling $886,720 of which $813,171
related to the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment with the remainder
related to the Cable Products segment. In 2005, goodwill increased by $341,309
primarily as a result of nine acquisitions with an aggregate acquisition price
of $530,022, less the fair value of assets acquired of $188,625, less purchase
accounting adjustments related to prior year acquisitions on $270, plus foreign
exchange impact of $182. The increase in goodwill was related to the
interconnect products and assemblies segment. The Company is in the process of
completing its analysis of fair value attributes of the assets acquired related
to 2005 acquisitions and it is anticipated that the final assessment of values
will not differ materially from the preliminary assessment.

The
Company does not have any intangible assets not subject to amortization other
than goodwill. As of December 31, 2005, the Company has acquired amortizable
intangible assets with a total gross carrying amount of $51,391 of which
$30,400, $9,000 and $6,100 relate to proprietary technology, customer
relationships and license agreements, respectively, with the remainder relating
to other amortizable intangible assets. The accumulated amortization related to
these intangibles as of December 31, 2005 totaled $4,044 of which $122, $110
and $51 relate to proprietary technology, customer relationships and license agreements,
respectively, with the remainder relating to other amortizable intangible
assets. Intangible assets are included in other assets in the accompanying
balance sheets. The acquired intangible assets have a total weighted-average
useful life of approximately 12 years. The license agreements, proprietary
technology and customer relationships have a weighted-average useful life of 8
years, 15 years and 5 years, respectively. The aggregate amortization expense
for the year ended December 31, 2005 was approximately $750 and amortization
expense estimated for each of the next five fiscal years is approximately
$5,000.

Note 9—Reportable
Business Segments and International Operations

The Company has two reportable business segments: interconnect products
and assemblies and cable products. The interconnect products and assemblies
segment produces connectors and connector assemblies primarily for the
communications, aerospace, industrial and automotive markets. The cable
products segment produces coaxial and flat ribbon cable and related products
primarily for communication markets, including cable television. The accounting
policies of the segments are the same as those for the Company as a whole and
are described in Note 1 herein. The Company evaluates the performance of
business units on, among other things, profit or loss from operations before
interest expense, headquarters’ expense allocations, income taxes and
nonrecurring gains and losses. The Company’s operating segments are an
aggregation of business units that have similar production processes and
products.

Note 11—Commitments
and Contingencies

In the course of
pursuing its normal business activities, the Company is involved in various
legal proceedings and claims. Management does not expect that amounts, if any,
which may be required to be paid by reason of such proceedings or claims will
have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position or
results of operations.

Certain operations
of the Company are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and
regulations that govern the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, as
well as the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. The Company
believes that its operations are currently in substantial compliance with all
applicable environmental laws and regulations and that the costs of continuing
compliance will not have a material effect on the Company’s financial position
or results of operations.

The Company is
currently involved in the environmental cleanup of several sites for conditions
that existed at the time Amphenol was acquired from Allied Signal Corporation
in 1987 (Allied Signal merged with Honeywell International Inc. (“Honeywell”)
in December 1999). Amphenol and Honeywell were named jointly and severally
liable as potentially responsible parties in relation to such sites. Amphenol
and Honeywell have jointly consented to perform certain investigations and
remedial and monitoring activities at two sites and they have been jointly
ordered to perform work at another site. The costs incurred relating to these
three sites are reimbursed by Honeywell based on an agreement (the “Honeywell
Agreement”) entered into in connection with the acquisition in 1987. For sites
covered by the Honeywell Agreement, to the extent that conditions or
circumstances occurred or existed at the time of or prior to the acquisition,
Honeywell is obligated to reimburse Amphenol 100% of such costs. Honeywell
representatives continue to work closely with the Company in addressing the
most significant environmental liabilities covered by the Honeywell Agreement. Management
does not believe that the costs associated with resolution of these or any
other environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
financial position or results of operations. The environmental cleanup matters
identified by the Company, including those referred to above, are covered under
the Honeywell Agreement.

None.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures

Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s
management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, the Company has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and
operation of its disclosure controls and procedures within the 90 day
period prior to the filing of this annual report, and based on their
evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have
concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective. There
were no significant changes in our internal controls or in other factors that
could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of their
evaluation.


Management
Report on Internal Control

Management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting. Under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the
internal control over financial reporting based on the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) Framework. Based on that
evaluation, management concluded that internal control over financial reporting
was effective as of December 31, 2005.

As
discussed in Note 7 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, the
Company acquired the Teradyne backplane and connector systems business segment
(“TCS”) on December 1, 2005. As a result of the timing of the acquisition and as
permitted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, management has excluded
certain internal controls at TCS from its assessment of the internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005. The areas excluded constitute
approximately 7 percent, 2 percent and 0.2 percent of total assets, revenues
and net income, respectively, of the consolidated financial statement amounts
as of and for the year ended December 31, 2005.

Deloitte
and Touche LLP has audited the Company’s evaluation of the internal control
environment in accordance with the standards of the Public Accounting Oversight
Board. Those standards require that Deloitte and Touche LLP plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Deloitte and
Touche LLP has issued an unqualified report stating the Company has maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005.

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Amphenol Corporation

Wallingford, Connecticut

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Amphenol Corporation and subsidiaries
(the “Company”) as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2005, management’s assessment of the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2005, and the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, and have issued our report thereon
dated March 14, 2006; such consolidated financial statements and report are
included elsewhere in the Form 10-K. Our audits also included the consolidated
financial statement schedules of the Company listed in Item 15.  These
consolidated financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the
