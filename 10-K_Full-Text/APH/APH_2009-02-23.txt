PART I

Item 1. Business

General

Amphenol Corporation (“Amphenol” or the “Company”)
is one of the world’s largest designers, manufacturers and marketers of
electrical, electronic and fiber optic connectors, interconnect systems and
coaxial and flat-ribbon cable. The Company was incorporated in 1987. Certain
predecessor businesses, which now constitute part of the Company, have been in
business since 1932. The primary end markets for the Company’s products are:

·

communication
systems for the converging technologies of voice, video and data
communications;

·

a
broad range of industrial applications including factory automation and motion
control systems, medical and industrial instrumentation, mass transportation,
alternative energy, natural resource exploration and traditional and hybrid-
electrical automotive applications; and

·

commercial
aerospace and military applications.

The Company’s strategy is to provide its
customers with comprehensive design capabilities, a broad selection of products
and a high level of service on a worldwide basis while maintaining continuing
programs of productivity improvement and cost control. For 2008, the Company
reported net sales, operating income and net income of $3,236.5 million, $632.2
million and $419.2 million, respectively. The table below summarizes
information regarding the Company’s primary markets and end applications for
the Company’s products:



The Company designs and manufactures
connectors and interconnect systems, which are used primarily to conduct
electrical and optical signals for a wide range of sophisticated electronic
applications. The Company believes, based primarily on published market
research, that it is the second largest connector and interconnect product
manufacturer in the world. The Company has developed a broad range of connector
and interconnect products for the information technology and communications
equipment applications including the converging voice, video and data
communications markets. The Company offers a broad range of interconnect
products for factory automation and motion control systems, machine tools,
instrumentation and medical systems, mass transportation applications and
automotive applications, including airbags, pretensioner seatbelts and other
on-board automotive electronics. In addition, the Company is the leading
supplier of high performance, military-specification, circular environmental
connectors that require superior reliability and performance under conditions
of stress and in hostile environments. These conditions are frequently
encountered in commercial and military aerospace applications and other
demanding industrial applications such as solar and wind power generation, oil
exploration, medical equipment, hybrid-electrical vehicles and off-road
construction.

The Company is a global manufacturer
employing advanced manufacturing processes. The Company designs, manufactures
and assembles its products at facilities in the Americas, Europe, Africa and
Asia. The Company sells its products through its own global sales force,
independent manufacturers’ representatives and a global network of electronics
distributors to thousands of OEMs in approximately 60 countries throughout
the world. The Company also sells certain products to electronic manufacturing
services (“EMS”), to original design manufacturing (“ODM”) companies and to
communication network operators.  For
2008, approximately 40% of the Company’s net sales were in North America, 21%
were in Europe and 39% were in Asia and other countries.

The Company generally implements its product
development strategy through product design teams and collaboration
arrangements with customers which result in the Company obtaining approved
vendor status for its customers’ new products and programs. The Company seeks
to have its products become widely accepted within the industry for similar
applications and products manufactured by other potential customers, which the
Company believes will provide additional sources of future revenue. By
developing application specific products, the Company has decreased its
exposure to standard products which generally experience greater pricing
pressure. In addition to product design teams and customer collaboration
arrangements, the Company uses key account managers to manage customer
relationships on a global basis such that it can bring to bear its total
resources to meet the worldwide needs of its multinational customers.

The Company and industry analysts estimate that the worldwide sales of
interconnect products were approximately $45 billion in 2008. The Company
believes that the worldwide industry for interconnect products and systems is
highly fragmented with over 2,000 producers of connectors and interconnect
systems worldwide, of which the 10 largest, including Amphenol, accounted for a
combined market share of approximately 44% in 2008.

The Company’s acquisition strategy is focused
on the consolidation of this highly fragmented industry.  The Company targets acquisitions on a global
basis in high growth segments that have complementary capabilities to the
Company from a product, customer or geographic standpoint.  The Company looks to add value to smaller
companies through its global capabilities and generally expects acquisitions to
be accretive to performance in the first year. 
In 2008, the Company spent approximately $136 million on acquisitions,
including payments for performance-based additional cash consideration. A
significant portion of this spending was made on three acquisitions in target
markets, including the wireless infrastructure, military/aerospace and internet
markets, which broadened and enhanced its product offering in these areas.



Business Segments

The following table sets forth the dollar
amounts of the Company’s net trade sales for its business segments. For a
discussion of factors affecting changes in sales by business segment and
additional segment financial data, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

on customer location to which product is shipped.

Interconnect Products and Assemblies.

The Company produces
a broad range of interconnect products and assemblies primarily for voice,
video and data communication systems, commercial aerospace and military
systems, automotive and mass transportation applications, and industrial and
factory automation equipment. 
Interconnect products include connectors, which when attached to an
electronic or fiber optic cable, a printed circuit board or other device,
facilitate electronic or fiber optic transmission.  Interconnect assemblies generally consist of
a system of cable and connectors for linking electronic and fiber optic
equipment.  The Company designs and
produces a broad range of connector and cable assembly products used in
communication applications, such as: engineered cable assemblies used in base
stations for wireless communication systems and internet networking equipment;
smart card acceptor and other interconnect devices used in mobile telephones;
set top boxes and other applications to facilitate reading data from smart
cards; fiber optic connectors used in fiber optic signal transmission;
backplane and input/output connectors and assemblies used for servers and data
storage devices and linking personal computers and peripheral equipment;
sculptured flexible circuits used for integrating printed circuit boards in
communication applications and hinge products used in mobile phone and other
mobile communication devices.  The
Company also designs and produces a broad range of radio frequency connector
products and antennas used in telecommunications, computer and office
equipment, instrumentation equipment, local area networks and automotive
electronics.  The Company’s radio
frequency interconnect products and assemblies are also used in base stations,
mobile communication devices and other components of cellular and personal
communications networks.

The Company believes that it is the largest
supplier of high performance, military-specification, circular environmental
connectors. Such connectors require superior performance and reliability under
conditions of stress and in hostile environments. High performance
environmental connectors and interconnect systems are generally used to interconnect
electronic and fiber optic systems in sophisticated aerospace, military,
commercial and industrial equipment. These applications present demanding
technological requirements in that the connectors are subject to rapid and
severe temperature changes, vibration, humidity and nuclear radiation. Frequent
applications of these connectors and interconnect systems include aircraft,
guided missiles, radar, military vehicles, equipment for spacecraft, energy,
medical instrumentation, geophysical applications and off-road construction
equipment. The Company also designs and produces industrial interconnect
products used in a variety of applications such as factory automation
equipment, mass transportation applications including railroads and marine
transportation; and automotive safety products including interconnect devices
and systems used in automotive airbags, pretensioner seatbelts, antilock
braking systems and other on-board automotive electronic systems. The Company
also designs and produces highly-engineered cable and backplane assemblies.
Such assemblies are specially designed by the Company in conjunction with OEM
customers for specific applications, primarily for computer, wired and wireless
communication systems, office equipment, industrial and aerospace applications.
The cable assemblies utilize the Company’s connector and cable products as well
as components purchased from others.



Cable Products.

The Company designs,
manufactures and markets coaxial cable primarily for use in the cable
television industry.  The Company’s Times
Fiber Communications subsidiary is the world’s second largest producer of
coaxial cable for the cable television market. The Company believes that its
Times Fiber Communications unit is one of the lowest cost producers of coaxial
cable for cable television.  The Company’s
coaxial cable and connector products are used in cable television systems
including full service cable television/telecommunication systems being
installed by cable operators and telecommunication companies offering video,
voice and data services.  The Company is
also a major supplier of coaxial cable to the international cable television
market.  The Company manufactures two
primary types of coaxial cable: semi-flexible, which has an aluminum tubular
shield, and flexible, which has one or more braided metallic shields. Semi-flexible
coaxial cable is used in the trunk and feeder distribution portion of cable
television systems, and flexible cable (also known as drop cable) is used
primarily for hookups from the feeder cable to the cable television subscriber’s
residence.  Flexible cable is also used
in other communication applications.  The
Company has also developed a broad line of radio frequency and fiber optic
interconnect components for full service cable television/ telecommunication
networks.

The Company is also a leading producer of
high speed data cables and specialty cables, which are used to connect internal
components in systems with space and component configuration limitations.  Such products are used in computer and office
equipment applications as well as in a variety of telecommunication
applications.

International
Operations

The Company believes that its global presence
is an important competitive advantage, as it allows the Company to provide
quality products on a timely and worldwide basis to its multinational
customers.  Approximately 64% of the Company’s
sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 were outside the United States.
Approximately 17%  of the Company’s sales
were sold to customers in China, and the Company has international
manufacturing and assembly facilities in China, Taiwan, Korea, India, Japan,
Malaysia, Europe, Canada, Latin America, Africa and Australia.  European operations include manufacturing and
assembly facilities in the United Kingdom, Germany, France, the Czech Republic,
Slovakia and Estonia and sales offices in most European markets. The Company’s
international manufacturing and assembly facilities generally serve the
respective local markets and coordinate product design and manufacturing
responsibility with the Company’s other operations around the world.  The Company has low cost manufacturing and
assembly facilities in China, Mexico, India, Eastern Europe and Africa to serve
regional and world markets.

Customers

The Company’s products are used in a wide
variety of applications by numerous customers, the largest of which accounted
for approximately 7% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2008.
The Company sells its products to over 10,000 customer locations worldwide. The
Company’s products are sold directly to OEMs, contract manufacturers, cable
system operators, telecommunication companies and through manufacturers’
representatives and distributors. There has been a trend on the part of OEM
customers to consolidate their lists of qualified suppliers to companies that
have a global presence, can meet quality and delivery standards, have a broad
product portfolio and design capability and have competitive prices.

The Company has focused its global resources
to position itself to compete effectively in this environment. The Company has
concentrated its efforts on service and productivity improvements including
advanced computer aided design and manufacturing systems, statistical process
controls and just-in-time inventory programs to increase product quality and
shorten product delivery schedules. The Company’s strategy is to provide
comprehensive design capabilities, a broad selection of products and a high
level of service in the areas in which it competes. The Company has achieved a
preferred supplier designation from many of its customers.

The Company’s sales to distributors represented approximately 15% of
the Company’s 2008 sales. The Company’s recognized

brand names, including “Amphenol,” “Times Fiber,” “Tuchel,” “Socapex,” “Sine,”
“Spectra-Strip,” “Pyle-National,” “Matrix,” “Kai Jack” and others, together
with the Company’s strong connector design-in position (products that are
specified in customer drawings), enhance its ability to reach the secondary
market through its network of distributors.

Manufacturing

The Company employs advanced manufacturing processes including molding,
stamping, plating, turning, extruding, die casting and assembly operations as
well as proprietary process technology for specialty and coaxial cable
production. The Company’s manufacturing facilities are generally vertically
integrated operations from the initial design stage through final design and
manufacturing. Outsourcing of certain fabrication processes is used when
cost-effective. Substantially all of the Company’s manufacturing facilities are
certified to the ISO9000 series of quality standards, and many of the Company’s
manufacturing facilities are certified



to other quality standards, including QS9000, ISO14000 and TS16469.

The Company employs a global manufacturing
strategy to lower its production costs and to improve service to customers. The
Company sources its products on a worldwide basis with manufacturing and
assembly operations in the Americas, Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia. To
better serve certain high volume customers, the Company has established
just-in-time facilities near these major customers.

The Company’s policy is to maintain strong
cost controls in its manufacturing and assembly operations. The Company is
continually evaluating and adjusting its expense levels and workforce to
reflect current business conditions and maximize the return on capital
investments.

The Company purchases a wide variety of raw
materials for the manufacture of its products, including precious metals such
as gold and silver used in plating; aluminum, brass, steel, copper and
bimetallic products used for cable, contacts and connector shells, and plastic
materials used for cable and connector bodies and inserts. Such raw materials
are generally available throughout the world and are purchased locally from a
variety of suppliers. The Company is generally not dependent upon any one
source for raw materials, or if one source is used the Company attempts to
protect itself through long-term supply agreements.

Research and
Development

The Company’s research and development
expense for the creation of new and improved products and processes was $68.1
million, $62.4 million and $53.7 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively. The Company’s research and development activities focus on
selected product areas and are performed by individual operating divisions.
Generally, the operating divisions work closely with OEM customers to develop
highly-engineered products and systems that meet specific customer needs. The
Company focuses its research and development efforts primarily on those product
areas that it believes have the potential for broad market applications and
significant sales within a one-to-three year period.

Trademarks and
Patents

The Company owns a number of active patents
worldwide. The Company also regards its trademarks “Amphenol,” “Times Fiber,” “Tuchel,”
“Socapex” and “Spectra-Strip” to be of material value in its businesses. The Company
has exclusive rights in all its major markets to use these registered
trademarks. The Company has rights to other registered and unregistered
trademarks which it believes to be of value to its businesses. While the
Company considers its patents and trademarks to be valuable assets, the Company
does not believe that its competitive position is dependent on patent or
trademark protection or that its operations are dependent on any individual
patent or trademark.

Competition

The Company encounters competition in
substantially all areas of its business. The Company competes primarily on the
basis of technology innovation, product quality, price, customer service and
delivery time. Competitors include large, diversified companies, some of which
have substantially greater assets and financial resources than the Company, as
well as medium to small companies. In the area of coaxial cable for cable
television, the Company believes that it and CommScope are the primary world
providers of such cable; however, CommScope is larger than the Company in this
market. In addition, the Company faces competition from other companies that
have concentrated their efforts in one or more areas of the coaxial cable
market.

Backlog

The Company estimates that its backlog of unfilled
orders was $505 million and $523 million at December 31, 2008
and 2007, respectively. Orders typically fluctuate from quarter to quarter
based on customer demand and general business conditions. Unfilled orders may
be cancelled prior to shipment of goods. It is expected that all or a
substantial portion of the backlog will be filled within the next
12 months. Significant elements of the Company’s business, such as sales
to the communications related markets (including wireless communications,
telecom & data communications and broadband communications) and sales
to distributors, generally have short lead times. Therefore, backlog may not be
indicative of future demand.

Employees

As of December 31, 2008, the Company had
approximately 30,000 full-time employees worldwide of which approximately
21,100 were located in low cost regions. Of these employees, approximately
24,200 were hourly employees and the remainder were



salaried. The Company believes that it has a good relationship with its
unionized and non-unionized employees.

Environmental
Matters

Certain operations of the Company are subject
to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations which govern the
discharge of pollutants into the air and water, as well as the handling and
disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. The Company believes that its
operations are currently in substantial compliance with applicable
environmental laws and regulations and that the costs of continuing compliance
will not have a material effect on the Company’s financial condition or results
of operations.

Subsequent to the acquisition of Amphenol
from Allied Signal Corporation (“Allied Signal”) in 1987 (Allied Signal merged
with Honeywell International Inc. in December 1999 (“Honeywell”)),
Amphenol and Honeywell were named jointly and severally liable as potentially
responsible parties in relation to several environmental cleanup sites.
Amphenol and Honeywell jointly consented to perform certain investigations and
remedial and monitoring activities at two sites, the “Route 8” landfill and the
“Richardson Hill Road” landfill, and they were jointly ordered to perform work
at another site, the “Sidney” landfill. The costs incurred relating to these
three sites are currently reimbursed by Honeywell based on an agreement (the “Honeywell
Agreement”) entered into in connection with the acquisition in 1987. For sites
covered by the Honeywell Agreement, to the extent that conditions or
circumstances occurred or existed at the time of or prior to the acquisition,
Honeywell is obligated to reimburse Amphenol 100% of such costs.  Honeywell representatives continue to work
closely with the Company in addressing the most significant environmental
liabilities covered by the Honeywell Agreement. 
Management does not believe that the costs associated with resolution of
these or any other environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on
the Company’s financial condition or results of operations. The environmental
investigation, remedial and monitoring activities identified by the Company,
including those referred to above, are covered under the Honeywell Agreement.

Owners
and occupiers of sites containing hazardous substances, as well as generators
of hazardous substances, are subject to broad liability under various federal
and state environmental laws and regulations, including expenditures for
cleanup and monitoring costs and potential damages arising out of past disposal
activities. Such liability in many cases may be imposed regardless of fault or
the legality of the original disposal activity. The Company has performed
remediation activities and is currently performing operations and maintenance
and monitoring activities at three off-site disposal sites previously utilized
by the Company’s Sidney facility and others, to wit the Richardson Hill Road
landfill, the Route 8 landfill and the Sidney landfill.  Actions at the Richardson
Hill Road and Sidney landfills were undertaken subsequent to designation as “Superfund”
sites on the National Priorities List under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980. The Route 8 landfill was
designated as a New York State Inactive Hazardous Waste Disposal Site, with
remedial actions taken pursuant to Chapter 6, Section 375-1 of the New
York Code of Rules and Regulations. In addition, the Company is currently
performing monitoring activities at, and in proximity to, its manufacturing
site in Sidney, New York. The Company is also engaged in remediating or
monitoring environmental conditions at certain of its other manufacturing
facilities and has been named as a potentially responsible party for cleanup costs
at other off-site disposal sites. All such environmental matters referred to in
this paragraph are covered by the Honeywell Agreement.

Since 1987, the Company has not been
identified nor has it been named as a potentially responsible party with respect
to any other significant on-site or off-site hazardous waste matters. In
addition, the Company believes that its manufacturing activities and disposal
practices since 1987 have been in material compliance with applicable
environmental laws and regulations. Nonetheless, it is possible that the
Company will be named as a potentially responsible party in the future with
respect to additional Superfund or other sites. Although the Company is unable
to predict with any reasonable certainty the extent of its ultimate liability
with respect to any pending or future environmental matters, the Company
believes, based upon information currently known by management about the
Company’s manufacturing activities, disposal practices and estimates of
liability with respect to known environmental matters, that any such liability
will not be material to its financial condition or results of operations.

Cautionary
Information for Purposes of Forward Looking Statements

Statements made by the Company in written or
oral form to various persons, including statements made in this annual report
on Form 10-K and other filings with the SEC, that are not strictly
historical facts are “forward looking” statements. Such statements



should be considered as subject to
uncertainties that exist in the Company’s operations and business environment.
Certain of the risk factors, assumptions or uncertainties that could cause the
Company to fail to conform with expectations and predictions are described
below under the caption “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item IA and elsewhere in
this Form 10-K.  Should one or more
of these risks or uncertainties occur, or should our assumptions prove
incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those described in this Form 10-K
as anticipated, believed, estimated or expected.  We do not intend to update these forward
looking statements.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

Investors
should carefully consider the risks described below and all other information
in this Form 10-K. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the
only ones facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently
known to the Company or that it currently deems immaterial may also impair the
Company’s business and operations.

If any of the following risks actually occur, the Company’s business
and consolidated financial statements could be materially adversely affected.
In such case, the trading price of the Company’s common stock could decline and
investors may lose all or part of their investment.

The Company is dependent on the communications
industry, including telecommunication and data communication, wireless
communications and broadband communications.

Approximately 62% of the Company’s revenues for the year ended December 31,
2008 came from sales to the communications industry, including telecommunication
and data communication, wireless communications and broadband communications.
Demand for these products is subject to rapid technological change (see below—“The
Company is dependent on the acceptance of new product introductions for
continued revenue growth”). These markets are dominated by several large
manufacturers and operators who regularly exert significant price pressure on
their suppliers, including the Company. The loss of one or more of the large
communications customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
business. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue
to compete successfully in the communications industry, and the Company’s
failure to do so could have an adverse effect on the Company’s results of
operations.

Approximately 10% of the Company’s 2008 revenues came from sales to the
broadband communications industry. Demand for the Company’s broadband communications
products depends primarily on capital spending by cable television operators
for constructing, rebuilding or upgrading their systems. The amount of this
capital spending, and, therefore, the Company’s sales and profitability will be
affected by a variety of factors, including general economic conditions,
acquisitions of cable television operators by non-cable television operators,
cable system consolidation within the industry, the financial condition of
domestic cable television operators and their access to financing, competition
from satellite, telephone and television providers and telephone companies,
technological developments and new legislation and regulation of cable
television operators. There can be no assurance that existing levels of cable
television capital spending will continue or that cable television spending
will not decrease.

Changes in defense expenditures may reduce the Company’s
sales.

Approximately 15% of the Company’s 2008 revenues came from sales to the
military market. The Company participates in a broad spectrum of defense
programs and believes that no one program accounted for more than 1% of its
2008 revenues. The substantial majority of these sales are related to both U.S.
and foreign military and defense programs. However, the Company’s sales are
generally to contractors and subcontractors of the U.S. or foreign governments
or to distributors that in turn sell to the contractors and subcontractors.
Nevertheless, the Company’s sales are affected by changes in the defense
budgets of the U.S. and foreign governments. A decline in U.S. defense
expenditures and defense expenditures generally could adversely affect the
Company’s business.

The Company encounters competition in substantially all areas of its
business.

The Company competes primarily on the basis of technology innovation,
product quality, price, customer service and delivery time. Competitors include
large, diversified companies, some of which have substantially greater assets
and financial resources than the Company, as well as medium to small companies.
There can be no assurance that additional competitors will not enter the
Company’s existing markets, nor can there be any assurance that the Company
will be able to compete successfully against existing or new competition, and
the inability to do so could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business
and operations.

The Company is

dependent on the acceptance of new
product introductions for continued revenue growth.

The Company estimates that products introduced in the last two years
accounted for approximately 29% of 2008 net sales. The Company’s long-term
results of operations depend substantially upon its ability to continue to
conceive, design, source and market new products and upon continuing market
acceptance of its existing and future product lines. In the ordinary course of
business, the Company continually develops or creates new product line
concepts. If the Company fails to or is significantly delayed in introducing
new product line concepts or if the Company’s new products do not meet with
market acceptance, our results of operations may be adversely affected.

Covenants in the Company’s credit agreements may adversely
affect the Company.

The Company’s bank credit agreements contain financial and other
covenants, such as a limit on the ratio of debt to earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization, minimum levels of net worth and limits on
incurrence of liens. Although the Company believes none of these covenants are
presently restrictive to the Company’s operations, the ability to meet the financial
covenants can be affected by events beyond the Company’s control, and the
Company cannot provide assurance that the Company will meet those tests. A
breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the Company’s
credit agreements. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under any of the
Company’s credit facilities, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts
outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments
to extend further credit. If the lenders accelerate the repayment of
borrowings, the Company may not have sufficient assets to repay the Company’s
credit facilities and other indebtedness. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

Downgrades of the Company’s debt rating could adversely
affect the Company’s results of operations and financial position.

If the credit rating agencies that rate the Company’s debt were to
downgrade the Company’s credit rating in conjunction with a deterioration of
the Company’s performance, it may increase the Company’s cost of capital and
make it more difficult for the Company to obtain new financing, which could
adversely affect the Company’s business.

The Company’s results may be negatively affected by changing
interest rates

.

The Company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in
interest rates based on the Company’s financing activities. The Company
utilizes interest rate swap agreements to manage and mitigate its exposure to
changes in interest rates. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had
interest rate protection in the form of swaps that effectively fixed the
Company’s LIBOR interest rate on $150.0 million, $250.0 million and $250.0
million of floating rate bank debt at 4.40%, 4.65% and 4.73%, expiring in December 2009,
December 2009 and July 2010, respectively.

A 10% change in the LIBOR interest rate at December 31, 2008 would
have the effect of increasing or decreasing interest expense by approximately
$0.2 million. The Company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a
material effect on income or cash flows in 2009, although there can be no
assurances that interest rates will not significantly change.

The Company’s results may be negatively affected by foreign
currency exchange rates.

The Company conducts business in several international currencies
through its worldwide operations, and as a result is subject to foreign
exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies.
Changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the Company’s
sales, gross margins and retained earnings. The Company attempts to minimize currency
exposure risk by producing its products in the same country or region in which
the products are sold, thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in
the same currency and by managing its working capital. There can be no
assurance that this approach will be successful, especially in the event of a
significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international
currencies of the Company’s worldwide operations, which could have an adverse
effect on the results of the Company’s operations.

The
Company is subject to the risks of political, economic and military instability
in countries outside the United States.

Non-U.S. markets account for a substantial portion of the Company’s
business.  During 2008, non-U.S. markets
constituted approximately 64% of the Company’s net sales. The Company employs
more than 85% of its workforce outside the United States. The Company’s
customers are located throughout the world and it has many manufacturing,
administrative and sales facilities outside the United States. Because of the
Company’s extensive non-U.S. operations, it is exposed to risks that could negatively
affect sales or profitability, including:

·

tariffs, trade barriers and trade disputes;

·

regulations related to customs and
import/export matters;


Table

·

longer payment cycles;

·

tax issues, such as tax law changes,
examinations by taxing authorities, variations in tax laws from country to country
as compared to the United States, and difficulties in repatriating in a
tax-efficient manner cash generated or held abroad;

·

challenges in collecting accounts receivable;

·

employment regulations and local labor
conditions;

·

difficulties protecting intellectual
property;

·

instability in economic or political
conditions, including inflation, recession and actual or anticipated military
or political conflicts; and

·

the impact of each of the foregoing on our
outsourcing and procurement arrangements.

The Company may experience difficulties and unanticipated
expense of assimilating newly acquired businesses, including the potential for
the impairment of goodwill.

The Company has completed a number of acquisitions in the past few
years. It is possible the Company may experience difficulty integrating such
acquisitions and further that the acquisitions may not perform as expected. At December 31,
2008, the total assets of the Company were $2,994.2 million, which
included $1,232.3 million of goodwill. The goodwill arose as the excess of
the purchase price, inclusive of performance-based cash consideration, over the
fair value of net assets of businesses acquired. The Company performs annual
evaluations for the potential impairment of the carrying value of goodwill in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142. Such
evaluations have not resulted in the need to recognize an impairment. However,
if the financial performance of the Company’s businesses were to decline
significantly, the Company could incur a non-cash charge to its income
statement for the impairment of goodwill.

The Company may experience difficulties in obtaining a
consistent supply of materials at stable pricing levels, which could adversely
affect its results of operations.

The Company uses basic materials like steel, aluminum, copper,
bi-metallic products, gold and plastic resins in its manufacturing process.
Volatility in the prices of such material and availability of supply may have a
substantial impact on the price the Company pays for such products. In
addition, to the extent such cost increases cannot be recovered through sales
price increases or productivity improvements, the Company’s margin may decline.

The Company may not be able to attract and retain key
employees.

The Company’s continued success depends upon its continued ability to
hire and retain key employees at its operations around the world. Any
difficulties in obtaining or retaining the management and other human resource
competencies that the Company needs to achieve its business objectives may have
adverse effects on the Company’s performance.

Changes in general economic conditions and other factors
beyond the Company’s control may adversely impact its business.

The following factors could
adversely impact the Company’s business:

·

A global economic slowdown in any one, or
all, of the Company’s market segments.

·

The effects of significant changes in
monetary and fiscal policies in the U.S. and abroad including significant
income tax changes, currency fluctuations and unforeseen inflationary
pressures.

·

Rapid material escalation of the cost of
regulatory compliance and litigation.

·

Unexpected government policies and
regulations affecting the Company or its significant customers.

·

Unforeseen intergovernmental conflicts or
actions, including but not limited to armed conflict and trade wars.

·

Unforeseen interruptions to the Company’s
business with its largest customers, distributors and suppliers resulting from
but not limited to, strikes, financial instabilities, computer malfunctions,
inventory excesses or natural disasters.

Item
2. Properties

The Company’s fixed assets include certain
plants and warehouses and a substantial quantity of machinery and equipment,
most of which is general purpose machinery and equipment using tools and
fixtures and in many instances having automatic control features and special
adaptations. The Company’s plants, warehouses, machinery and equipment are in
good operating condition, are well maintained, and substantially all of its
facilities are in regular use. The Company considers the present level of fixed
assets along with planned capital expenditures as suitable and adequate for
operations in the current business environment. At December 31, 2008, the
Company operated a total of 208

plants and
warehouses of which (a) the locations in the U.S. had approximately 2.6

million square feet, of which 1.2 million square feet were
leased; (b) the locations outside the U.S. had approximately
5.2 million square feet, of which 3.9

million square
feet were leased; and (c) the square footage by segment was approximately
6.8 million square feet and 1.0 million square feet for the interconnect
products segment and the cable products segment, respectively.

The Company believes that its facilities are
suitable and adequate for the business conducted therein and are being
appropriately utilized for their intended purposes. Utilization of the
facilities varies based on demand for the products. The Company continuously
reviews its anticipated requirements for facilities and, based on that review,
may from time to time acquire or lease additional facilities and/or dispose of
existing facilities.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

The Company and its subsidiaries have been
named as defendants in several legal actions in which various amounts are
claimed arising from normal business activities. Although the amount of any
ultimate liability with respect to such matters cannot be precisely determined,
in the opinion of management, such matters are not expected to have a material
effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations.

Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial

Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion and analysis of the
results of operations for the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2008,
2007 and 2006  has been derived from and
should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements
included elsewhere in this document.

Executive Overview

The Company is a global designer, manufacturer
and marketer of interconnect and cable products.  In 2008, approximately 64% of the Company’s
sales were outside the U.S.  The primary
end markets for our products are:

·

communication
systems for the converging technologies of voice, video and data
communications;

·

a broad range of
industrial applications including factory automation and motion control
systems, medical and industrial instrumentation, mass transportation,
alternative energy, natural resource exploration, and traditional and hybrid-electrical
automotive applications; and

·

commercial
aerospace and military applications.

The Company’s products are used in a wide
variety of applications by numerous customers, the largest of which accounted
for approximately 7% of net sales in 2008. 
The Company encounters competition in all of its markets and competes
primarily on the basis of technology innovation, product quality, price,
customer service and delivery time. 
There has been a trend on the part of OEM customers to consolidate their
lists of qualified suppliers to companies that have a global presence, can meet
quality and delivery standards, have a broad product portfolio and design
capability and have competitive prices. 
The Company has focused its global resources to position itself to
compete effectively in this environment. 
The Company believes that its global presence is an important
competitive advantage as it allows the Company to provide quality products on a
timely and worldwide basis to its multinational customers.

The Company’s strategy is to provide
comprehensive design capabilities, a broad selection of products and a high
level of service in the areas in which it competes.  The Company focuses its research and
development efforts through close collaboration with its OEM customers to
develop highly-engineered products that meet customer needs and have the
potential for broad market applications and significant sales within a
one-to-three year period.  The Company is
also focused on controlling costs.  The
Company does this by investing in modern manufacturing technologies,
controlling purchasing processes and expanding into low cost areas.

The Company’s strategic objective is to
further enhance its position in its served markets by pursuing the following
success factors:

·

Focus on
customer needs

·

Design and
develop performance-enhancing interconnect solutions

·

Establish a
strong global presence in resources and capabilities

·

Preserve and
foster a collaborative, entrepreneurial management structure

·

Maintain a culture
of controlling costs

·

Pursue strategic
acquisitions

For the year ended December 31, 2008,
the Company reported net sales, operating income and net income of $3,236.5
million, $632.2 million and $419.2 million, respectively; up 14%, 14% and 19%,
respectively, from 2007.  Sales of
interconnect products and assemblies and sales of cable products increased in
predominantly all of the Company’s related major markets and geographic
regions.  Sales and profitability trends
are discussed in detail in “Results of Operations” below.  In addition, a strength of the Company is its
ability to consistently generate cash. 
The Company uses cash generated from operations to fund capital
expenditures and acquisitions, repurchase shares of its common stock, pay
dividends and reduce indebtedness.  In
2008, the Company generated operating cash flow of $481.5 million.

Results of Operations

The following table sets forth the components
of net income as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated.


Table
of Contents

2008 Compared to

Net sales were $3,236.5

million for the year ended December 31,
2008 compared to $2,851.0 million for 2007, an increase of 14% in U.S.
dollars and 12% in local currencies.  The
increase in sales in 2008 over 2007 excluding acquisitions was 10% in U.S.
dollars and 9% in local currencies. 
Sales of interconnect products and assemblies in 2008 (approximately 91%
of net sales) increased 15% in U.S. dollars and 13% in local currencies
compared to 2007 ($2,950.6 million in 2008 versus $2,569.3 million in
2007).  Sales increased in all of the
Company’s major end markets, except automotive, including the wireless
communications, military/aerospace, telecommunications and data communications
and industrial markets.  The increase in
sales in the wireless communications markets (approximately $205.2 million) is
attributable to increased sales to the mobile device market primarily relating
to new products for mobile phones, increased demand in the wireless
infrastructure market from base station/equipment manufacturers and to a lesser
extent increased sales to cell site installation customers. Sales to the
military/aerospace markets increased approximately $90.8 million, primarily due
to increased sales to military customers for various defense related programs,
including war related spending, an increase in sales to commercial aerospace
customers and the impact of acquisitions. 
The increase in sales to the telecommunications and data communications
related markets (approximately $53.9 million) reflects increased sales of high
speed interconnect products for servers and switching and network equipment for
data centers as well as the impact of acquisitions.  The increase in sales in the industrial
market (approximately $20.1 million) primarily reflects the impact of
acquisitions as well as increased sales to the natural resource exploration and
railway/mass transit markets.  The
automotive market was slightly down in 2008 (approximately $3.0 million) versus
2007 reflecting the general softness in the domestic and European automotive
markets. Sales of cable products in 2008 (approximately 9% of net sales)
increased 1% in U.S. dollars and 3% in local currencies compared to 2007
($285.9 million in 2008 versus $281.8 million in 2007).  Such increase is primarily due to the impact
of price increases.

Geographically, sales in the U.S. in 2008 and
2007 were relatively flat ($1,159.3 million in 2008 versus $1,155.8 million in
2007); international sales for 2008 increased approximately 23% in U.S. dollars
($2,077.2 million in 2008 versus $1,695.2 million in 2007) and increased
approximately 21% in local currency compared to 2007.  The comparatively weak U.S. dollar in 2008
had the effect of increasing net sales by approximately $34.3 million when
compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2007.

The gross profit margin as a percentage of
net sales was relatively flat at 32.4% in 2008 compared to 32.6% in 2007. The
operating margin for interconnect products and assemblies increased
approximately 0.3% compared to the prior year, mainly as a result of the
continuing development of new higher margin application specific products,
excellent operating leverage on incremental volume and aggressive programs of
cost control.  Cable operating margins
decreased 1.0% due primarily to the impact of higher material costs for the
majority of 2008 partially offset by the impact of price increases.

Selling, general and administrative expenses
were $416.9 million and $377.3 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively, or approximately
13% of net sales in both 2008 and 2007.  The
increase in expense in 2008 is attributable to increases in the major components
of selling, general and administrative expenses.

Research and
development expenditures increased approximately $5.7 million, reflecting
increases in expenditures for new product development and represented
approximately 2% of sales for both 2008 and 2007. Selling and marketing expense
remained approximately 6.5% of sales for both 2008 and 2007.  Administrative expense, which represented
approximately 4% of sales for both 2008 and 2007, increased by approximately
$16.1 million,

due primarily to
increases in stock-based compensation expense of $3.9 million as well as cost
increases relating to salaries and employee-related benefits.

Interest expense was $39.6 million for 2008
compared to $36.9 million for 2007. The increase is primarily attributable to
the higher average debt levels in 2008.

Other expenses, net for 2008 and 2007 were
$10.5 million and $15.0 million, respectively. 
Other expenses, net, are comprised primarily of minority interests
($10.4 million in 2008 and $10.5 million in 2007), program fees on the sale of
accounts receivable ($3.1 million in 2008 and $5.2 million in 2007), and agency
and commitment fees on the Company’s credit facilities ($1.8 million in both
2008 and 2007) offset by interest income ($4.7 million in 2008 and $2.7 million
in 2007).

The provision for income taxes was at an
effective rate of 28.0% in 2008 and 29.5% in 2007.  The lower effective tax rate results
primarily from an increase in income in lower tax jurisdictions and changes in
the Company’s income repatriation plans. The total effective rate reduction
lowered tax expense in 2008 by approximately $8.7 million or $.04 per share.

2007 Compared to

Net sales were $2,851.0

million for the year ended December 31,
2007 compared to $2,471.4 million for 2006, an increase of 15% in U.S.
dollars and 13% in local currencies.  The
increase in sales in 2007 over 2006 excluding acquisitions was 15% in U.S.
dollars and 12% in local currencies. 
Sales of interconnect products and assemblies in 2007 (approximately 90%
of net sales) increased 16% in U.S. dollars and 13% in local currencies
compared to 2006 ($2,569.3 million in 2007 versus $2,207.5 million in
2006).  Sales increased in all of the
Company’s major end markets including the military/aerospace, wireless communications,
industrial/automotive, and telecommunications and data communications
markets.  Sales to the military/aerospace
markets increased approximately $117.5 million primarily due to increased sales
to military customers for various defense related programs including war
related spending, as well as an increase in sales to commercial aerospace
customers.  The increase in sales in the
wireless communications markets (approximately $104.6 million) is attributable
to increased sales to the mobile device market relating to new products for
both mobile phones and laptop computers, and to a lesser extent, to increased
demand in the wireless infrastructure market from base station/equipment
manufacturers and cell site installation customers.  The increase in sales in the
industrial/automotive market (approximately $77.0 million) primarily reflects
increased new product sales to the European automotive market, increased sales
to the natural resource exploration and factory automation markets as well as
the impact of acquisitions.  The increase
in sales to the telecommunications and data communications related markets
(approximately $54.1 million) reflects increased sales of high speed
interconnect products for servers and switching and transmission equipment for
data centers.  Sales of cable products in
2007 (approximately 10% of net sales) increased 7% compared to 2006 ($281.8
million in 2007 versus $263.9 million in 2006). Such increase is primarily
due to increased sales in broadband cable television markets and the impact of
price increases.

Geographically, sales in the U.S. in 2007
increased approximately 9% compared to 2006 ($1,155.8 million in 2007 versus
$1,060.0 million in 2006); international sales for 2007 increased approximately
20% in U.S. dollars ($1,695.2 million in 2007 versus $1,411.5 million in
2006) and increased approximately 16% in local currency compared to 2006.  The comparatively weak U.S. dollar in 2007
had the effect of increasing net sales by approximately $66.3 million when
compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2006.

The gross profit margin as a percentage of
net sales increased to 33% in 2007 compared to 32% in 2006. The operating
margin for interconnect products and assemblies increased approximately 1.3%
compared to the prior year, mainly as a result of the continuing development of
new higher margin application specific products, excellent operating leverage
on incremental volume and aggressive programs of cost control.  In addition, cable operating margins
increased 0.7% due primarily to the impact of a higher mix of specialty
products, increased production levels in low cost facilities and price
increases partially offset by higher material costs.

Selling, general and administrative expenses
were $377.3 million and $342.8 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively, or approximately
13% and 14% of sales in 2007 and 2006, respectively.  The increase in expense in 2007 is
attributable to increases in the major components of selling, general and
administrative expenses as follows.

Research and development expenditures increased
approximately $8.7 million, reflecting increases in expenditures for new
product development and represented approximately 2% of sales for both 2007 and
2006. Selling and marketing expenses remained approximately 7% of sales for
both 2007 and 2006. Administrative expense, which represented approximately 4%
and 5% of sales in 2007 and 2006, respectively, increased by approximately $8.4
million, due primarily to increases in stock-based compensation expense of

$2.7 million, and cost increases relating
to professional fees as well as salaries and employee-related benefits.

The Company incurred damage at its Sidney, New York manufacturing
facility as a result of severe and sudden flooding during the second quarter of
2006.  In 2006, the Company recorded
charges of $20.7 million, or $.08 per share, for recovery and clean up expenses
and property related damage, net of insurance and grant recoveries.  The
Sidney facility had limited manufacturing and sales activity for the period
from June 28 to July 14, 2006.  Production activity was
substantially back to full production at the end of the third quarter of
2006.  As a result, sales in 2006 were reduced by approximately $25.0
million.

Interest expense was $36.9 million for 2007
compared to $38.8 million for 2006. The decrease is primarily attributable to
the lower average debt levels in 2007.

Other expenses, net, for 2007 and 2006 were
$15.0 million and $12.5 million, respectively. 
Other expenses, net, are comprised primarily of minority interests
($10.5 million in 2007 and $6.0 million in 2006), program fees on the sale of
accounts receivable ($5.2 million in 2007 and $5.0 million in 2006), and agency
and commitment fees on the Company’s credit facilities ($1.8 million in 2007
and $2.0 million in 2006) offset by interest income ($2.7 million in 2007 and
$0.7 million in 2006).



The provision for income taxes
was at an effective rate of 29.5% in 2007 and 31.5% in 2006.  The lower effective tax rate results
primarily from an increase in income in lower tax jurisdictions and changes in
the Company’s income repatriation plans. The total effective rate reduction
lowered tax expense in 2007 by approximately $10.0 million or $.05 per share.

Liquidity and
Capital Resources

Cash provided by operating
activities totaled $481.5 million, $387.9 million and $289.6 million for 2008,
2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in cash from operating activities in
2008 compared to 2007 is primarily attributable to an increase in net income,
an increase in depreciation and amortization and a lower increase in the
components of working capital compared to the increase in 2007. The increase in
cash from operating activities in 2007 compared to 2006 is primarily
attributable to an increase in net income, an increase in depreciation and
amortization and a lower increase in the components of working capital compared
to the increase in 2006.

The components of working
capital increased $40.0 million in 2008 due primarily to increases in inventory
of $47.6 million, $21.3 million in excess tax benefits from stock-based payment
arrangements and $7.5 million of other current assets partially offset by a
$32.2 million increase in accrued liabilities, a $2.7 million increase in
accounts payable and a $1.5 million decrease in accounts receivable.

The components of working
capital increased $63.0 million in 2007 due primarily to increases in accounts
receivable of $87.0 million, $23.7 million in excess tax benefits from
stock-based payment arrangements, $22.7 million in inventory and $7.2 million
of prepaid expenses and other assets partially offset by a $43.7 million
increase in accounts payable and an increase of $33.9 million in accrued
liabilities.

The components of working
capital increased $69.4 million in 2006 due primarily to increases in accounts
receivable of $60.6 million, $81.9 million in inventory, $10.0 million in
excess tax benefits from stock-based payment arrangements, $9.0 million in
prepaid expenses and other assets and a decrease in accrued interest of $1.1
million partially offset by a $46.4 million increase in accounts payable and an
increase of $46.8 million in accrued liabilities.

In 2008, accounts receivable
increased $5.6 million to $516.0 million, due primarily to acquisitions during
the period, partially offset by translation resulting from the comparatively
stronger U.S. dollar at December 31, 2008 compared to December 31,
2007 (“Translation”).  Days sales
outstanding increased to approximately 72 days from 69 days in 2007.  Inventory increased $55.6 million to $512.5
million, resulting from higher activity levels in 2008, an increase in
inventory days, and inventory from acquired companies of $19.3 million,
partially offset by $9.7 million of Translation. Inventory days at December 31,
2008 and 2007 were 88 and 80, respectively. The increase in inventory days
resulted primarily from a slowdown in sales activity in the fourth quarter of
2008 as a result of the well publicized global economic slowdown. The Company
will continue to focus on inventory reduction as adjustments to production
activity continue in response to lower demand levels. Other current assets
increased $19.5 million to $92.4 million primarily due to an increase in
deferred taxes. Land and depreciable assets, net, increased $28.3 million to
$344.5 million reflecting capital expenditures of $108.5 million, as well as
assets from acquisitions of approximately $9.5 million offset by depreciation
of $80.7 million, $7.5 million due to Translation and disposals of $1.5
million. Goodwill increased $140.5 million to $1,232.3 million primarily as a
result of three acquisitions completed during the year, the payment of and
recording of liabilities for performance-based additional cash consideration of
$131.7 million offset by adjustments made related to prior year acquisitions,
and by Translation of $25.2 million and $14.1 million in intangible assets
reclassified to other long-term assets representing the fair value assigned to
identifiable assets associated with the Company’s acquisitions in 2007. Other
long-term assets increased $37.5 million to $81.4 million primarily due to an
increase in identifiable intangible assets resulting from 2008 acquisitions as
well as the reclassification from goodwill discussed above related to 2007
acquisitions and an increase in long-term deferred tax assets primarily
associated with the increase in the accrued pension and post-employment
obligation, offset by amortization of the intangible asset balances. Accounts
payable and accrued salaries, wages and employee benefits increased $10.6
million and $4.7 million to $306.0 million and $59.6 million, respectively, due
primarily to liabilities assumed from acquired companies offset by
Translation.  The other accrued
liabilities including acquisition-related obligations and accrued income taxes
increased $99.7 million to $268.8 million relating primarily to an increase of
$65.1 million in liabilities associated with performance-based
additional

cash consideration on acquisitions and an increase in accrued
income taxes of $26.2 million due primarily to an increase in liabilities
related to foreign income taxes. Accrued pension and post employment benefit
obligations increased $59.9 million to $161.7 million primarily due to a
decrease in plan assets during the year resulting from equity market losses in
2008. Other long-term liabilities decreased $4.8 million to $62.2 million due
primarily to lower long-term deferred tax liabilities offset by a higher
minority interest liability at December 31, 2008.



In 2008, cash from operating
activities of $481.5 million, net borrowings of $61.9 million, proceeds
from the exercise of stock options including excess tax benefits from
stock-based payment arrangements of $48.4 million and proceeds from disposal of
fixed assets of $0.9 million were used to fund purchases of treasury stock of
$293.6 million, $135.8 million of acquisitions, including payments for
performance-based additional cash consideration, capital expenditures of $108.3
million, dividend payments of $10.6 million, purchases of short-term
investments of $2.9 million and resulted in an increase in cash and cash
equivalents on hand of $31.3 million.

For
2007, cash from operating activities of $387.9 million,

proceeds from the exercise of stock options including
excess tax benefits from stock-based payment arrangements of $58.2 million, net
borrowings of $41.6 million and proceeds from disposal of fixed assets of $5.3
million were used to fund $179.3 million of acquisitions including payments for
performance-based additional cash consideration, capital expenditures of $103.8
million, purchases of treasury stock of $93.6 million, dividend payments of
$10.7 million, purchases of short-term investments of $1.4 million and resulted
in an increase in cash and cash equivalents on hand of $109.5 million.

The Company’s senior unsecured
Revolving Credit Facility is comprised of a five-year $1,000.0 million
unsecured revolving credit facility that is scheduled to expire in August 2011,
of which $778.0 million was drawn at December 31, 2008. At December 31,
2008, availability under the Revolving Credit Facility was $207.2 million,
after a reduction of $14.8 million for outstanding letters of credit.  The Company’s interest rate on borrowings
under the Revolving Credit Facility is LIBOR plus 40 basis points.  The Company also pays certain annual agency
and facility fees.  The Revolving Credit
Facility requires that the Company satisfy certain financial covenants.  At December 31, 2008, the Company was in
compliance with all financial covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility,
and the Company’s credit rating from Standard & Poor’s was BBB- and
from Moody’s was Baa3.

As
of December 31, 2008, the Company had interest rate swap agreements of
$150.0 million, $250.0 million and $250.0 million that fix the Company’s LIBOR
interest rate at 4.40%, 4.65% and 4.73%, expiring in December 2009, December 2009
and July 2010, respectively.

The fair value of such agreements represents the amounts that
the Company would receive or pay if the agreements were terminated.  The fair value of swaps indicated that
termination of the agreements at December 31, 2008 would have resulted in
a pre-tax loss of $25.0 million; such loss, net of tax of $9.2 million, was
recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss.

The Company’s primary ongoing
cash requirements will be for operating and capital expenditures, product development
activities, repurchase of its common stock, funding of pension obligations,
dividends and debt service.  The Company
may also use cash to fund all or part of the cost of acquisitions.  The Company’s debt service requirements
consist primarily of principal and interest on bank borrowings. The Company’s
primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flow, the Company’s
Revolving Credit Facility and the sale of receivables under the Company’s
accounts receivable agreement described below.  In addition, the Company had cash and cash
equivalents of $215.0 million and $183.6 million at December 31, 2008 and
2007, respectively, the majority of which was in non-U.S. accounts as of December 31,
2008.  The Company expects that ongoing
requirements for operating and capital expenditures, product development
activities, repurchases of its common stock, dividends and debt service
requirements will be funded from these sources; however, the Company’s sources
of liquidity could be adversely affected by, among other things, a decrease in
demand for the Company’s products, a deterioration in certain of the Company’s
financial ratios or a deterioration in the quality of the Company’s accounts
receivable.

The Company expects that capital expenditures in 2009 will be
approximately $85 million. The Company may also use cash to fund part or all of
the cost of future acquisitions.  The
Company pays a quarterly dividend on its common stock of $.015 per share.  Cumulative dividends declared during 2008
were $10.5 million. Total dividends paid in 2008 were $10.6 million, including
those declared in 2007 and paid in 2008. 
The Company intends to retain the remainder of its earnings not used for
dividend payments to provide funds for the operation and expansion of the
Company’s business, to repurchase shares of its common stock and to repay
outstanding indebtedness. Management believes that the Company’s working
capital position, ability to generate strong cash flow from operations,
availability under its Revolving Credit Agreement and access to credit markets
will allow it to meet its obligations for the next twelve months and the
foreseeable future.

Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangement - Accounts Receivable Securitization

A subsidiary of the Company has
an agreement with a financial institution whereby the subsidiary can sell an
undivided interest of up to $100.0 million in a designated pool of qualified
accounts receivable (the “Agreement”). The Company services, administers and
collects the receivables on behalf of the purchaser. The Agreement
includes certain covenants and provides for various events of termination and
expires in July 2009. Upon expiration, the Company intends to replace the
Agreement with a similar program. Due to the short-term nature of the accounts
receivable, the fair value approximates carrying value.  At December 31, 2008 and 2007,
approximately $85.0 million of receivables were sold and are therefore not
reflected in the accounts receivable balance in the accompanying Consolidated
Balance Sheets.



Environmental
Matters

Subsequent to the acquisition of Amphenol from Allied Signal
Corporation (“Allied Signal”) in 1987 (Allied Signal merged with Honeywell
International Inc. in December 1999 (“Honeywell”)), Amphenol and
Honeywell were named jointly and severally liable as potentially responsible
parties in relation to several environmental cleanup sites. Amphenol and
Honeywell jointly consented to perform certain investigations and remedial and
monitoring activities at two sites, the “Route 8” landfill and the “Richardson
Hill Road” landfill, and they were jointly ordered to perform work at another
site, the “Sidney” landfill. The costs incurred relating to these three sites
are currently reimbursed by Honeywell based on an agreement (the “Honeywell
Agreement”) entered into in connection with the acquisition in 1987. For sites
covered by the Honeywell Agreement, to the extent that conditions or circumstances
occurred or existed at the time of or prior to the acquisition, Honeywell is
obligated to reimburse Amphenol 100% of such costs.  Honeywell representatives continue to work
closely with the Company in addressing the most significant environmental liabilities
covered by the Honeywell Agreement. 
Management does not believe that the costs associated with resolution of
these or any other environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on
the Company’s financial condition or results of operations. The environmental
investigations, remedial and monitoring activities identified by the Company,
including those referred to above, are covered under the Honeywell Agreement.

Inflation
and Costs

The cost of the Company’s products is influenced by the cost of a wide
variety of raw materials, including precious metals such as gold and silver
used in plating; aluminum, copper, brass and steel used for contacts, shells
and cable; and plastic materials used in molding connector bodies, inserts and
cable.  In general, increases in the cost
of raw materials, labor and services have been offset by price increases,
productivity improvements and cost saving programs.

Risk Management

The Company has, to a significant degree, mitigated its exposure to
currency risk in its business operations by manufacturing and procuring its
products in the same country or region in which the products are sold so that
costs generally reflect local economic conditions. In other cases involving
U.S. export sales, raw materials are a significant component of product costs
for the majority of such sales, and raw material costs are generally dollar
based on a worldwide scale, such as basic metals and petroleum-derived materials.

Stock Split

On January 17, 2007, the Company announced a 2-for-1 stock split
that was effective for stockholders of record as of March 16, 2007, and
these additional shares were distributed on March 30, 2007. The share
information included herein reflects the effect of such stock split.

Recent
Accounting Changes

In December 2007, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (“SFAS”) No. 141R, “Business Combinations” (“SFAS 141R”). The
objective of SFAS 141R is to improve the relevance and comparability of the
information that a reporting entity provides in its financial reports about a
business combination and its effects. To accomplish that, SFAS 141R establishes
principles and requirements for how the acquirer: (1) recognizes and measures
in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities
assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree; (2) recognizes
and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a
bargain purchase; and (3) determines what information to disclose to
enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial
effects of the business combination.  The
areas that are most applicable to the Company with regard to SFAS 141R are: (1) that
SFAS 141R requires companies to expense transaction costs as incurred; (2) that
any subsequent adjustments to a recorded performance-based liability after its
initial recognition will need to be adjusted through income as opposed to goodwill;
and (3) any noncontrolling interest will be recorded at fair value. 
SFAS 141R is effective for the Company for acquisitions completed on or after January 1,
2009.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,
“Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements” (“SFAS 160”).
The objective of SFAS 160 is to improve the relevance, comparability and
transparency of the financial information that a reporting entity provides in
its consolidated financial statements by establishing accounting and reporting
standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the
deconsolidation of a subsidiary. SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years, and
interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15,
2008. SFAS 160 shall be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal
year in which it is initially applied, except for the presentation and
disclosure requirements. The



presentation and disclosure requirements apply retrospectively for all
periods presented. The areas that are most applicable to the Company with
regard to SFAS 160 are: (1) SFAS 160 requires companies to classify
expense related to noncontrolling interests’ share in income below net income
(earnings per share will still be determined after the impact of noncontrolling
interests’ share in net income of the Company as is the current
practice).  During the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, the
Company included expense related to the noncontrolling interests’ share in
income of $10.4 million and $10.5 million, respectively, in other expenses, net
and (2) SFAS 160 requires the liability related to noncontrolling
interests to be presented as a separate caption within shareholders’ equity.
 As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the liability related to
noncontrolling interests was $19.1 million and $14.8 million, respectively, and
is included in other long-term liabilities.  The Company believes the
primary impacts of SFAS 160 will be as described above.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161,
“Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (“SFAS 161”).  SFAS 161 amends and expands the disclosure
requirements of SFAS No. 133 “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities” (“SFAS 133”) with the intent to provide users of financial
statements with an enhanced understanding of: (1) how and why an entity
uses derivative instruments; (2) how derivative instruments and related
hedged items are accounted for under SFAS 133 and its related interpretations;
and (3) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an
entity’s financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. To meet
those objectives, SFAS 161 requires qualitative disclosures about objectives
and strategies for using derivatives, quantitative disclosures about fair value
amounts of and gains and losses on derivative instruments and disclosures about
credit-risk-related contingent features in derivative agreements.  SFAS 161 is effective for fiscal years
beginning on or after December 15, 2008. 
The Company does not believe this pronouncement will significantly
impact its disclosure requirements.

Pensions

The Company and certain of its
domestic subsidiaries have a defined benefit pension plan (“U.S. Plan”)
covering certain of its U.S. employees. 
U.S. Plan benefits are generally based on years of service and
compensation and are generally noncontributory. Certain foreign subsidiaries
also have defined benefit plans covering employees. The pension expense for all
pension plans approximated $12.0 million, $16.0 million and $17.0 million in
2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and is calculated based upon a number of
actuarial assumptions established on January 1 of the applicable year,
including an expected long-term rate of return on the U.S. Plan assets. In
developing the expected long-term rate of return assumption for the U.S. Plan,
the Company evaluated input from its external actuaries and investment
consultants as well as long-term inflation assumptions. Projected returns by
such consultants are based on broad equity and bond indices.  The Company also considered its historical
nineteen-year compounded return of 8.5%, which has been in excess of these
broad equity and bond benchmark indices. The expected long-term rate of return
on the U.S. Plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of 60% with
equity managers, with an expected long-term rate of return of 9%; 25% with
fixed income managers, with an expected

long-term rate of return of 6.8% and 15%
with high yield bond managers, with an expected rate of return of 6%. As of December 31,
2008, the asset allocation was 45% with equity managers and 37% with fixed
income managers, including high yield managers and 18% in cash. The Company
believes that the long-term asset allocation on average will approximate 60%
with equity managers and 40% with fixed income managers. The Company regularly
reviews the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances investments to
its targeted allocation when considered appropriate. Based on this methodology
the Company’s expected long-term rate of return assumption to determine the
accrued benefit obligation of the U.S. Plan at December 31, 2008 and 2007
is 8.25% and 9.25%, respectively. This reduction in the long-term rate of
return will have the effect of increasing 2009 pension expense by approximately
$2.4 million.

The discount rate used by the
Company for valuing pension liabilities is based on a review of high quality
corporate bond yields with maturities approximating the remaining life of the
projected benefit obligations. The discount rate for the U.S. Plan on this
basis was 6.25% at both December 31, 2008 and 2007. Although future
changes to the discount rate are unknown, had the discount rate increased or
decreased 50 basis points, the accrued benefit obligation would have increased
or decreased by approximately $15.5 million.

Effective January 1, 2007, the Company
effected a curtailment related to the U.S. Plan, which resulted in no
additional benefits being credited to salaried employees who had less than 25
years service with the Company, or who had not attained age 50 and who had less
than 15 years of service with the Company. 
This change had the impact of decreasing pension expense during 2007 by
approximately $2.9 million. For affected employees, the curtailment in
additional U.S. Plan benefits was replaced with a Company match defined
contribution plan to which the Company contributed approximately $1.9 million
and $1.7 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively.

The Company made cash
contributions to the U.S. Plan of $20 million in both 2008 and 2007. The
liability for accrued pension and post-employment benefit obligations under all
the Company’s pension and post-retirement benefit plans (the “Plans”)  increased in 2008 to $165.9 million ($4.2
million of which is included in other accrued expenses representing required
contributions to be



made during 2009 for foreign plans) from
$101.8 million in 2007 primarily due to a reduction in plan assets in the U.S.
Plan offset by the cash contributions made to the Plans in 2008 and by the
foreign currency translation effect of the foreign pension plans. The Company
estimates that, based on current actuarial calculations, it will make a
voluntary cash contribution to the U.S. Plan in 2009 of approximately $15 million
to $20 million.  Cash contributions in
subsequent years will depend on a number of factors including the investment
performance of the U.S. Plan assets and the impact of the Pension Protection
Act of 2006 which was signed into law in August 2006. The Pension
Protection Act is effective for plan years beginning in 2008 and did not have a
material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial condition or results of
operations.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of consolidated
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period.  Actual results
could differ from those estimates.  Estimates
are adjusted as new information becomes available.  The Company’s significant accounting policies
are set forth below.

Revenue Recognition - The
Company’s primary source of revenues is from product sales to its
customers.  Revenue from sales of the
Company’s products is recognized at the time the goods are delivered and title
passes, provided the earning process is complete and revenue is
measurable.  Delivery is determined by
the Company’s shipping terms, which are primarily FOB shipping point.  Revenue is recorded at the net amount to be
received after deductions for estimated discounts, allowances and returns.  These estimates and reserves are determined
and adjusted as needed based upon historical experience, contract terms and
other related factors.  The shipping
costs for the majority of the Company’s sales are paid directly by the Company’s
customers.  In the broadband
communication market (approximately 10% of consolidated sales), the Company
pays for shipping cost to the majority of its customers.  Shipping costs are also paid by the Company
for certain customers in the interconnect products and assemblies market.  Amounts billed to customers related to
shipping costs are immaterial and are included in net sales.  Shipping costs incurred to transport products
to the customer which are not reimbursed are included in selling, general and
administrative expense.

Inventories - Inventories are
stated at the lower of standard cost, which approximates average cost, or
market. Provisions for slow-moving and obsolete inventory are made based on
historical experience and product demand. Should future product demand change,
existing inventory could become slow-moving or obsolete, and provisions would
be increased accordingly.

Depreciable Assets - Property,
plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. The
appropriateness and the recoverability of the carrying value of such assets are
periodically reviewed taking into consideration current and expected business
conditions.  Historically, the Company
has not had any significant impairments.

Goodwill - The Company performs
its annual evaluation for the impairment of goodwill for the Company’s
reporting units in accordance with SFAS No. 142, as of each June 30.
Goodwill impairment for each reporting unit is evaluated using a two-step
approach requiring the Company to determine the fair value of the reporting
unit and to compare that to the carrying value of the reporting unit including
goodwill. If the carrying value exceeded the fair value, the goodwill of the
reporting unit would be potentially impaired and a second step of additional
testing would be performed to measure the impairment loss. Historically, the
Company has not had any impairments.

Defined Benefit Plan Obligation
– The defined benefit plan obligation is based on significant assumptions such
as mortality rates, discount rates and plan asset rates of return as determined
by the Company in consultation with the respective benefit plan actuaries and
investment advisors.

The significant accounting
policies are more fully described in Note 1 to the Company’s Consolidated
Financial Statements.



Disclosures about
contractual obligations and commitments

The following table summarizes
the Company’s known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain
contracts as of December 31, 2008, as well as an estimate of the timing in
which such obligations are expected to be satisfied:

(1)   The Company has excluded expected
interest payments from the above table as this calculation is largely dependent
on average debt levels the Company expects to have at the end of each of the
years presented as well as the expected interest rates on the debt not covered
by interest rate swaps.  The actual interest payments made in 2008 were
$39,180. Expected debt levels, and therefore expected interest payments, are
difficult to predict as they are significantly impacted by such items as future
acquisitions, repurchases of treasury stock, dividend payments as well as payments
or additional borrowing made to reduce or increase the underlying revolver
balance.

(2)   Accrued
acquisition-related obligations consist of obligations for additional purchase
price and performance-based cash consideration.

(3)   Included
in this table are estimated benefit payments expected to be made under the
Company’s unfunded pension and post-retirement benefit plans.

The Company also maintains several funded pension
and post-retirement benefit plans the most significant of which covers its U.S.
employees. Over the past several years, there has been no minimum requirement
for Company contributions to the U.S. Plan due to prior contributions made in
excess of minimum requirements, but the Company has made contributions to the
U.S. Plan in the range of $15,000 to $20,000 in each of the last few years and
expects to make this same level of contribution in 2009. As a result, it is not
possible  to  reasonably estimate expected required contributions in
the above table since several assumptions are required to calculate the minimum
required contributions, such as the discount rate and expected asset returns.

(4)   As of
December 31, 2008, the Company has FASB Interpretation No. 48 liabilities of
$38,058.  Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential
future cash flows associated with the non-current FIN 48 liabilities it is very
difficult to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in
which these non-current liabilities might be paid.

Item 7A.

Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

The Company, in the normal
course of doing business, is exposed to the risks associated with foreign
currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

The Company conducts business
in several international currencies through its worldwide operations, and as a
result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates
of the various currencies. Changes in exchange rates can positively or
negatively affect the Company’s sales, gross margins and retained earnings. The
Company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk by producing its products
in the same country or region in which the products are sold, thereby
generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency and by managing
its working capital although there can be no assurance that this approach will
be successful, especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in
the value of any of the international currencies of the Company’s worldwide
operations. The Company does not engage in purchasing forward exchange
contracts for speculative purposes.

Interest Rate Risk

As of December 31, 2008, the Company had
interest rate swap agreements that fix the Company’s LIBOR interest rate on
$150.0 million, $250.0 million and $250.0 million of floating rate bank debt at
4.40%, 4.65% and 4.73%, expiring in December 2009, December 2009 and July 2010.
At December 31, 2008, the Company’s average LIBOR rate was 4.09%.  A 10% change in the LIBOR interest rate at December 31,
2008 would have the effect of increasing or decreasing interest expense by
approximately $0.2 million. The Company does not expect changes in interest
rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in 2009, although there
can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly change.



Item
8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the
Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Amphenol
Corporation

Wallingford,
Connecticut

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Amphenol
Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2008 and
2007, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in shareholders’ equity and other comprehensive
income, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2008.  We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an
opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects.  Our audits of the financial statements included
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  Our audit of internal control over financial
reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control based on the assessed risk.  Our audits also included performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.  We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process
designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and
principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and
effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial
reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management
override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be
prevented or detected on a timely basis.  Also, projections of any
evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial
reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Amphenol
Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2008, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Also, in
our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on the
criteria established in

Internal Control —
Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

Note 1-Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies

Operations

Amphenol Corporation (“Amphenol” or the “Company”)
operates two business segments which consist of manufacturing and selling
interconnect products and assemblies, and manufacturing and selling cable
products.  The Company sells its products
to customer locations worldwide.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Principles of
Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All material intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Cash and Cash
Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and
liquid investments with an original maturity of less than three months. The
carrying amount approximates fair value of those instruments.

Sale of Receivables

A subsidiary of the Company has an agreement
with a financial institution whereby the subsidiary can sell an undivided
interest of up to $100,000 in a designated pool of qualified accounts
receivable (the “Agreement”). The Company services, administers and collects
the receivables on behalf of the purchaser. The Agreement includes
certain covenants and provides for various events of termination and expires in
July 2009. Upon expiration, the Company intends to replace the Agreement
with a similar program. Due to the short-term nature of the accounts receivable,
the fair value approximates carrying value.

Program fees payable to the purchaser under this agreement are
equivalent to rates afforded high quality commercial paper issuers plus certain
fees and administrative expenses and are included in other expenses, net, in
the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. The aggregate value of
receivables transferred to the pool for the year 2008, 2007 and 2006 were
$1,068,229, $1,065,892 and $854,372, respectively. At December 31, 2008
and 2007, $104,388 and $119,932, respectively, of accounts receivable were
transferred to the subsidiary, but not purchased by the financial institution
and are therefore included in the accounts receivable balance in the
accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
At December 31, 2008 and 2007, approximately $85,000 of receivables
were sold and are therefore not reflected in the accounts receivable balance in
the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of
standard cost, which approximates average cost, or market. The principal
components of cost included in inventories are materials, direct labor and
manufacturing overhead.

Depreciable Assets

Property, plant and equipment are carried at
cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of property, plant and
equipment is recorded on a straight-line basis over the respective asset lives
determined on a composite basis by asset group or on a specific item basis
using the estimated useful lives of such assets which range from 3 to 12 years
for machinery and equipment and 20 to 40 years for buildings. Leasehold
building improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or
estimated useful life. It is the Company’s policy to periodically review fixed
asset lives.



Goodwill

The Company performs its annual evaluation
for the impairment of goodwill for the Company’s reporting units in accordance
with SFAS No. 142 (“SFAS 142”), as of each June 30. The Company has
defined its reporting units as the operating segments within its two reportable
business segments “Interconnect Products and Assemblies” and “Cable Products”,
as the components of these operating segments have similar economic
characteristics. Goodwill impairment for each reporting unit is evaluated using
a two-step approach requiring the Company to determine the fair value of the
reporting unit and to compare that to the carrying value including goodwill. If
the carrying value exceeded the fair value, the goodwill of the reporting unit
would be potentially impaired and a second step of additional testing would be
performed to measure the impairment loss. As of June 30, 2008, and for
each previous year in which the impairment test has been performed, the fair
market value of the Company’s reporting units exceeded their carrying values
and therefore no impairment was recognized.

Intangible

Assets

Intangible assets are included in other
long-term assets and consist primarily of proprietary technology, customer
relationships and license agreements and are amortized over the periods of
benefit.

Revenue Recognition

The Company’s primary source of revenues is
from product sales to its customers.

Revenue from sales of the Company’s products
is recognized at the time the goods are delivered and title passes, provided
the earning process is complete and revenue is measurable.  Delivery is determined by the Company’s
shipping terms, which are primarily FOB shipping point.  Revenue is recorded at the net amount to be
received after deductions for estimated discounts, allowances and returns.  These estimates and reserves are determined
and adjusted as needed based upon historical experience, contract terms and
other related factors.

The shipping costs for the majority of the
Company’s sales are paid directly by the Company’s customers.  In the broadband communication market
(approximately 10% of consolidated sales), the Company pays for shipping costs
to the majority of its customers. 
Shipping costs are also paid by the Company for certain customers in the
interconnect products and assemblies market. 
Amounts billed to customers related to shipping costs are immaterial and
are included in net sales.  Shipping
costs incurred to transport products to the customer which are not reimbursed
are included in selling, general and administrative expense.

Retirement Pension
Plans

Costs for retirement pension plans include
current service costs and amortization of prior service costs over periods of
up to thirty years. It is the Company’s policy to fund current pension costs
taking into consideration minimum funding requirements and maximum tax
deductible limitations. The expense of retiree medical benefit programs is
recognized during the employees’ service with the Company as well as
amortization of a transition obligation previously recognized.  The recognition of expense for retirement
pension plans and medical benefit programs is significantly impacted by
estimates made by management such as discount rates used to value certain
liabilities, expected return on assets and future health care costs.  The Company uses third-party specialists to
assist management in appropriately measuring the expense associated with
pension and other post-retirement plan benefits.

Stock Options

The Company accounts for its option awards
under the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123(R),
“Share Based Payment,” and recognizes compensation expense in the accompanying
Consolidated Statements of Income over the service period that the awards are
expected to vest.  The Company
recognizes expense for stock-based compensation with graded vesting on a
straight-line basis over the vesting period of the entire award.  Stock-based compensation expense includes the
estimated effects of forfeitures, and estimates of forfeitures will be adjusted
over the requisite service period to the extent actual forfeitures differ, or
are expected to differ from such estimates.  Changes in estimated
forfeitures will be recognized in the period of change and will also impact the
amount of expense to be recognized in future periods.  The Company’s income before income taxes was
reduced by $16,316, $12,444 and $9,718 for the years ended December 31,
2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The expense incurred for stock-based
compensation plans is classified in selling, general and administrative
expenses on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.



The fair value of stock options has been estimated at the date of grant
using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following
weighted-average assumptions:

Income Taxes

Deferred income taxes are provided for
revenue and expenses which are recognized in different periods for income tax
and financial statement purposes. 
Deferred income taxes are not provided on undistributed earnings of foreign
affiliated companies which are considered to be permanently invested.  It is not practicable to estimate the amount
of tax that might be payable.  Deferred
tax assets are regularly assessed for recoverability based on both historical
and anticipated earnings levels and a valuation allowance is recorded when it
is more likely than not that these amounts will not be recovered. The
Company includes estimated interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax
benefits in the provision for income taxes.

Foreign Currency
Translation

The financial position and results of
operations of the Company’s significant foreign subsidiaries are measured using
local currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities of such
subsidiaries have been translated at current exchange rates and related revenues
and expenses have been translated at weighted average exchange rates. The
aggregate effect of translation adjustments is included as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within shareholders’ equity.
Transaction gains and losses related to operating assets and liabilities are
included in selling, general and administrative expense, and those related to
non-operating assets and liabilities are included in other expenses, net.

Research and
Development

Costs incurred in connection with the
development of new products and applications are expensed as incurred.  Research and development expenses for the
creation of new and improved products and processes were $68,058, $62,397 and
$53,730, for the years 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Environmental
Obligations

The Company recognizes the potential cost for
environmental remediation activities when site assessments are made, remedial
efforts are probable and related amounts can be reasonably estimated; potential
insurance reimbursements are not recorded. The Company regularly assesses its
environmental liabilities through reviews of contractual commitments, site
assessments, feasibility studies and formal remedial design and action plans.

Net Income per
Common Share

Basic income per common share is based on the
net income for the year divided by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding. Diluted income per common share assumes the exercise of
outstanding, dilutive stock options using the treasury stock method.  On January 17, 2007, the Company
announced a 2-for-1 stock split that was effective for stockholders of record
as March 16, 2007 and these additional shares were distributed on March 30,
2007. The share information herein reflects the effect of such stock split.

Derivative Financial
Instruments

Derivative
financial instruments, which are periodically used by the Company in the
management of its interest rate and foreign currency exposures, are accounted
for on an accrual basis. Income and expense are recorded in the same financial
statement caption as that arising from the related asset or liability. For
example, amounts to be paid or received under interest rate swap agreements are
recognized as an increase or decrease of interest expense in the periods in which
they accrue. Gains and losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges
resulting from changes in fair value are recorded in other comprehensive
income, and subsequently reflected in net income in a manner that matches the
timing of the actual income or expense of such instruments with the hedged
transaction. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had interest rate
protection in the form of swaps that effectively fixed the



Company’s LIBOR interest rate on $150,000,
$250,000 and $250,000 of floating rate bank debt at 4.40%, 4.65% and 4.73%,
expiring in December 2009, December 2009 and July 2010,
respectively.

Recent Accounting
Changes

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R,
“Business Combinations” (“SFAS 141R”). The objective of SFAS 141R is to improve
the relevance and comparability of the information that a reporting entity
provides in its financial reports about a business combination and its effects.
To accomplish that, SFAS 141R establishes principles and requirements for how
the acquirer: (1) recognizes and measures in its financial statements the
identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling
interest in the acquiree; (2) recognizes and measures the goodwill
acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase; and (3) determines
what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate
the nature and financial effects of the business combination.  The areas that are most applicable to the
Company with regard to SFAS 141R are: (1) that SFAS 141R requires
companies to expense transaction costs as incurred; (2) that any subsequent
adjustments to a recorded performance-based liability after its initial
recognition will need to be adjusted through income as opposed to goodwill; and
(3) any noncontrolling interest will be recorded at fair value.  SFAS
141R is effective for the Company for acquisitions completed on or after January 1,
2009.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,
“Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements” (“SFAS 160”).
The objective of SFAS 160 is to improve the relevance, comparability and
transparency of the financial information that a reporting entity provides in
its consolidated financial statements by establishing accounting and reporting
standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the
deconsolidation of a subsidiary. SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years, and
interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15,
2008. SFAS 160 shall be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal
year in which it is initially applied, except for the presentation and
disclosure requirements. The presentation and disclosure requirements apply
retrospectively for all periods presented. The areas that are most applicable
to the Company with regard to SFAS 160 are: (1) SFAS 160 requires companies
to classify expense related to noncontrolling interests’ share in income below
net income (earnings per share will still be determined after the impact of
noncontrolling interests’ share in net income of the Company as is the current
practice.)  During the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, the
Company included expense related to the noncontrolling interests’ share in
income of $10,426 and $10,518, respectively, in other expenses, net and (2) SFAS
160 requires the liability related to noncontrolling interests to be presented
as a separate caption within shareholders’ equity.  As of December 31,
2008 and 2007, the liability related to noncontrolling interests was $19,144
and $14,834, respectively, and is included in other long-term
liabilities.  The Company believes the primary impacts of SFAS 160 will be
as described above.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161,
“Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (“SFAS 161”).  SFAS 161 amends and expands the disclosure
requirements of SFAS No. 133 “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities” (“SFAS 133”) with the intent to provide users of financial
statements with an enhanced understanding of: (1) how and why an entity
uses derivative instruments; (2) how derivative instruments and related
hedged items are accounted for under SFAS 133 and its related interpretations;
and (3) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an
entity’s financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. To meet those
objectives, SFAS 161 requires qualitative disclosures about objectives and
strategies for using derivatives, quantitative disclosures about fair value
amounts of and gains and losses on derivative instruments and disclosures about
credit-risk-related contingent features in derivative agreements.  SFAS 161 is effective for fiscal years
beginning on or after December 15, 2008. 
The Company does not believe this pronouncement will significantly
impact its disclosure requirements.



Note 2—Long-Term
Debt and Capital Lease Obligations

Long-term debt consists of the following:

The Company’s
senior unsecured Revolving Credit Facility is comprised of a five-year
$1,000,000 unsecured revolving credit facility that is scheduled to expire in August 2011,
of which $778,000 was drawn at December 31, 2008. At December 31,
2008, availability under the Revolving Credit Facility was $207,200, after a
reduction of $14,800 for outstanding letters of credit.  The Company’s interest rate on borrowings
under the Revolving Credit Facility is LIBOR plus 40 basis points.  The Company also pays certain annual agency
and facility fees.  The Revolving Credit
Facility requires that the Company satisfy certain financial covenants.  At December 31, 2008, the Company was in
compliance with all financial covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility,
and the Company’s credit rating from Standard & Poor’s was BBB- and
from Moody’s was Baa3.

As of December 31, 2008, The Company had interest rate swap
agreements of $150,000, $250,000 and $250,000 that fix the Company’s LIBOR
interest rate at 4.40%, 4.65% and 4.73%, expiring in December 2009, December 2009
and July 2010, respectively.

The fair value of such agreements represents the amounts that
the Company would receive or pay if the agreements were terminated.  The fair value of swaps indicated that
termination of the agreements at December 31, 2008 would have resulted in
a pre-tax loss of $24,957; such loss, net of tax of $9,234, was recorded
in  accumulated other comprehensive loss.

The maturity
of the Company’s long-term debt over each of the next five years ending December 31,
is as follows:

2009 - $439; 2010 - $1,450;
2011 - $778,373; 2012 - $269; 2013 - $5,570; thereafter $358.

The Company estimates
that the fair value of its long-term debt approximates book value.

Note 3–Fair Value Measurements

Effective
January 1, 2008, the Company adopted SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS 157”).
SFAS 157 establishes a new framework for measuring fair value of financial
and non-financial instruments and expands related disclosures. The Company does
not have any non-financial instruments accounted for at fair value on a
recurring basis. Broadly, the SFAS 157 framework requires fair value to be
determined based on the exchange price that would be received for an asset or
paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most
advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants. SFAS 157 establishes market or observable inputs
as the preferred source of values. Assumptions based on hypothetical
transactions are used in the absence of market inputs.

The
valuation techniques required by SFAS 157 are based upon observable and
unobservable inputs. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from
independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions.
These two types of inputs create the following fair value hierarchy:

The
Company maintains policies and procedures to value instruments using the best
and most relevant data available including independent price validation for certain
instruments.



The
Company’s only financial instruments subject to SFAS 157 with annual and
interim disclosure requirements are derivative instruments which represent
interest rate swaps that are independently valued using market observable Level
2 inputs including interest rate yield curves. At December 31, 2008, the
fair values of derivative instruments were a liability of $24,957.

The
Company does not have any other significant financial or non-financial assets
and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis.

Note 4—Income
Taxes

The components of income before income taxes
and the provision for income taxes are as follows:

At December 31,
2008, the Company had $23,873 and $4,025 of foreign tax loss and credit
carryforwards, and state tax credit carryforwards net of federal benefit,
respectively, of which $6,117

and $114, respectively,

expire or will be refunded at
various dates through 2022 and the balance can be carried forward indefinitely.

A valuation
allowance of $9,946 and $6,086 at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
respectively, has been recorded which relates to the foreign net operating loss
carryforwards and state tax credits.  The
net change in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was an increase
of $3,860 and $1,943 in 2008 and 2007, respectively.  The net change in the valuation allowance in
both 2008 and 2007 was related to foreign net operating loss and foreign and
state credit carryforwards.

Differences between the U.S. statutory federal tax rate and the Company’s
effective income tax rate are analyzed below:



The Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities, excluding a
valuation allowance, were comprised of the following:

On July 13, 2006, the FASB
issued FASB Interpretation No. 48 (“FIN 48”), “Accounting for Uncertainty
in Income Taxes.” FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income
taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance with
FASB Statement No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes” and provides
guidance on classification and disclosure requirements for tax contingencies.
FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the
financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or
expected to be taken in a tax return. The Company adopted the provisions of FIN
48 on January 1, 2007. The total amount of the liability accrued for
unrecognized tax benefits as of the adoption date was approximately $30,000,
which includes interest and penalties. As a result of the implementation in
2007, the Company recognized an increase in the liability for unrecognized tax
benefits and a reduction in retained earnings of approximately $200. At December 31,
2008, the amount of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, including
penalties and interest, which if recognized would impact the effective tax
rate, was approximately $35,666. As of December 31, 2008, the
Company does not have any tax positions for which management believes it is
reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized benefits will
significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months.

A
tabular reconciliation of the gross amounts of unrecognized tax benefits
excluding interest and penalties at the beginning and end of the year for both
2008 and 2007 is as follows:

The
Company includes estimated interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax
benefits in the provision for income taxes. During the year ended December 31,
2008, the provision for income taxes included $760 in estimated interest and
penalties. As of December 31, 2008, the liability for unrecognized tax
benefits included $6,652 for tax-related interest and penalties.

The
Company files income tax returns with the U.S., various states as well as
foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is subject to income
tax examinations by tax authorities for years on or after 2005.

Note 5—Shareholders’
Equity

The
Company has two option plans for employees (the “Option Plans”), the 1997
Option Plan and the 2000 Option Plan. The Option Plans authorize the granting
of additional stock options by a committee of the Board of Directors. At December 31,
2008, the maximum number of shares of common stock available for the granting
of additional stock options under the Option Plans was



3,829,560.
Options granted under the Option Plans vest ratably over a period of five years
and are exercisable over a period of ten years from the date of grant. In
addition, shares issued in conjunction with the exercise of stock options under
the Option Plans are subject to Management Stockholder Agreements.

In
2004, the Company adopted the 2004 Stock Option Plan for Directors of Amphenol
Corporation (the “Directors Option Plan”). The Directors Option Plan is
administered by the Board of Directors. At December 31, 2008, the maximum
number of shares of common stock available for the granting of additional stock
options under the Directors Option Plan was 260,000.   Options granted under the Directors Option Plan vest ratably over
a period of three years and are exercisable over a period of ten years from the
date of grant.

The
grant-date fair value of each option grant is estimated using the Black-Scholes
option pricing model. The fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis
over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally the
vesting period. Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain
assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. Expected share price
volatility was calculated based on the historical volatility of the stock of
the Company and implied volatility derived from related exchange traded
options. The average expected life was based on the contractual term of the
option and expected employee exercise and historical post-vesting employment
termination behavior. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury
zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at
the date of grant. The expected annual dividend per share was based on the
Company’s dividend rate.

Stock-based
compensation expense includes the estimated effects of forfeitures which are
adjusted over the requisite service period to the extent actual forfeitures
differ, or are expected to differ from such estimates.  Changes in
estimated forfeitures are recognized in the period of change and impact the
amount of expense to be recognized in future periods.

Stock option activity for 2006, 2007 and 2008 was as follows (on a post
stock split basis):

A summary of the status
of the Company’s non-vested options as of December 31, 2008 and changes
during the year then ended is as follows:



(1)

The weighted-average fair value at grant
date of options granted during 2007 and 2006 were $10.98 and $9.20,
respectively.

During the years ended December 31, 2008
and 2007, the following activity occurred under the Company’s plans:

On
December 31, 2008 the total compensation cost related to non-vested
options not yet recognized is approximately $47,462, with a weighted average
expected amortization period of 3.61 years.

The Company pays a quarterly dividend on its common stock of $.015 per
share. The Company paid its fourth quarterly dividend in the amount of
$2,567 or $.015 per share on January 7, 2009 to shareholders of record as
of December 17, 2008. Cumulative dividends declared during 2008 were
$10,461. Total dividends paid in 2008 were $10,617 including those declared in
2007 and paid in 2008.

Balances of related after-tax components comprising accumulated other
comprehensive loss included in shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2006,
2007 and 2008 are as follows:

Note 6—Earnings Per
Share

Basic
earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed by dividing net income by the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is computed
by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares and
dilutive common shares outstanding, which relates to stock options. A
reconciliation of the basic average common shares outstanding to diluted
average common shares outstanding as of December 31 is as follows (dollars
in thousands, except per share amounts):



Excluded
from the computations above were anti-dilutive shares of 5.9 million, nil and
2.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006,
respectively.

Note 7—Benefit
Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits

The Company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries have a defined
benefit pension plan (“U.S. Plan”), which, subject to the curtailment described
below, covers its U.S. employees. U.S. Plan benefits are generally based on
years of service and compensation and are generally noncontributory. Certain
foreign subsidiaries have defined benefit plans covering their employees.
Certain U.S. employees not covered by the U.S. Plan are covered by defined
contribution plans. The following is a summary of the Company’s defined benefit
plans funded status as of the most recent actuarial valuations; for each year
presented below, projected benefits exceed assets.



The pension expense for U.S.
and foreign plans (the “Plans”) is calculated based upon a number of actuarial
assumptions established on January 1 of the applicable year, detailed in
the table above, including a weighted-average discount rate, rate of increase
in future compensation levels and an expected long-term rate of return on the
Plans assets. The discount rate used by the Company for valuing pension
liabilities is based on a review of high quality corporate bond yields with
maturities approximating the remaining life of the projected benefit
obligations. The Company’s U.S. Plan comprised the majority of the accrued
benefit obligation, pension assets and pension expense. The discount rate for
the U.S. Plan was 6.25% at both December 31, 2008 and 2007. Although

future changes to the
discount rate are unknown, had the discount rate increased or decreased 50
basis points, the accrued benefit obligation would have increased or decreased
by approximately $15,500.

Effective January 1, 2007, the Company
effected a curtailment related to the U.S. Plan which resulted in no additional
benefits being credited to salaried employees who had less than 25 years
service with the Company, or who had not attained age 50 and who had less than
15 years of service with the Company. This change had the impact of decreasing
pension expense during 2007 by approximately $2,900. For affected employees,
the curtailment in additional U.S. Plan benefits was replaced with a Company
match defined contribution plan to which the Company contributed approximately
$1,900 and $1,700 in 2008 and 2007, respectively.

The pension expense is calculated
based upon a number of actuarial assumptions established on January 1 of
the applicable year, including an expected long-term rate of return on U.S.
Plan assets. In developing the expected long-term rate of return assumption for
the U.S. Plan, the Company evaluated input from our actuaries and investment
consultants as well as long-term inflation assumptions. Projected returns by
such consultants are based on broad equity and bond indices. The Company also
considered its historical nineteen-year compounded return of 8.5%, which has
been in excess of these broad equity and bond benchmark indices. The expected
long-term rate of return on the U.S. Plan assets is based on an asset
allocation assumption of 60% with equity managers, with an expected long-term
rate of return of 9%; 25% with fixed income managers, with an expected

long-term rate of
return of 6.8% and 15% with high yield bond managers, with an expected rate of
return of 6%. As of December 31, 2008, the asset allocation was 45% with
equity managers and 37% with fixed income managers, including high yield
managers and 18% in cash. The Company believes that the long-term asset
allocation on average will approximate 60% with equity managers and 40% with
fixed income managers. The Company regularly reviews the actual asset
allocation and periodically rebalances investments to its targeted allocation
when considered appropriate. Based on this methodology, the Company’s expected
long-term rate of return assumption to determine the accrued benefit obligation
of the U.S. Plan at December 31, 2008 and 2007 is 8.25% and 9.25%,
respectively. This reduction in the long-term rate of return will have
the effect of increasing pension expense in 2009 by approximately $2,400.

The
Company has also adopted an unfunded Supplemental Employee Retirement Plan (“SERP”),
which provides for the payment of the portion of annual pension which cannot be
paid from the retirement plan as a result of regulatory



limitations on average compensation for
purposes of the benefit computation. The largest non-U.S. pension plan, in
accordance with local custom, is unfunded and had a projected benefit
obligation of approximately $48,000 and
$51,000 at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Such obligation is
included in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and in the tables
above.

The Company made cash
contributions to the U.S. Plan of $20,000 in both 2008 and 2007, and the U.S.
Plan made benefit payments of $16,450 and $15,800 in 2008 and 2007,
respectively. The liability for accrued pension and post employment benefit
obligations under all the Company’s pension and post-retirement benefit plans
(the “Plans”) increased in 2008 to $165,889, ($4,220 of which is included in
other accrued expenses representing required contributions to be made during
2009 for foreign plans) from $101,804 in 2007 primarily due to a significant
reduction in plan assets in the U.S. Plan offset by the cash contributions made
to the Plans in 2008 and by the foreign currency translation effect of the
foreign pension plans. The Company estimates that, based on current actuarial
calculations, it will make a voluntary cash contribution to the U.S. Plan in
2009 of approximately $15,000 to $20,000. Cash contributions in subsequent
years will depend on a number of factors, including the investment performance
of the U.S. Plan assets and the impact of the Pension Protection Act of 2006,
which was signed into law in August 2006. The Pension Protection
Act is effective for plan years beginning in 2008 and did not have a material
impact on the Company’s consolidated financial condition or results of
operations.

The Company

offers various defined
contribution plans for U.S. and foreign employees. Participation in these plans
is based on certain eligibility requirements. Effective January 1, 2007,
in conjunction with the curtailment of certain additional U.S. Pension Plan benefits
for salaried employees described above, the Company began matching the majority
of employee contributions to the U.S. defined contribution plans with cash
contributions up to a maximum of 5% of eligible compensation. The Company
provided matching contributions of approximately $1,900 for the year ended December 31,
2008.

The Company maintains self-insurance programs for that portion of its
health care and workers compensation costs not covered by insurance. The
Company also provides certain health care and life insurance benefits to
certain eligible retirees through post-retirement benefit programs. The Company’s
share of the cost of such plans for most participants is fixed, and any
increase in the cost of such plans will be the responsibility of the retirees.
The Company funds the benefit costs for such plans on a pay-as-you-go basis.
Since the Company’s obligation for postretirement medical plans is fixed and
since the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (“APBO”) and the net
postretirement benefit expense are not material in relation to the Company’s
financial condition or results of operations, the Company believes any change
in medical costs from that estimated will not have a significant impact on the
Company. The discount rate used in determining the APBO was 6.25% at both December 31,
2008 and 2007. Summary information on the Company’s postretirement medical
plans is as follows:

Note 8—Leases

At
December 31, 2008, the Company was committed under operating leases which
expire at various dates. Total rent expense under operating leases for the
years 2008, 2007, and 2006 was $24,044, $25,176 and $23,441, respectively.

Minimum
lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases are as follows:

Note 9—Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets

As of December 31,
2008, the Company has goodwill totaling $1,232,335, of which $1,158,786 related
to the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment with the remainder related
to the Cable Products segment. In 2008, goodwill increased by $140,507
primarily as a result of recording liabilities for performance-based additional
cash consideration related to acquisitions of approximately $131,700, which was
related to the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment. In addition, the
Company made three acquisitions in the Interconnect and Product Assemblies
segment with an aggregate acquisition price of approximately $84,100 less the
fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired of
$35,000. These increases were offset by a reclassification of $14,100 from
goodwill to other long-term assets, which represents the fair value assigned to
identifiable intangible assets associated with the Company’s acquisitions in
2007, and a reduction due to currency translation of approximately $25,000. The
Company is in the process of completing its analysis of fair value attributes
of the assets acquired related to its 2008 acquisitions and anticipates that
the final assessment of values will not differ materially from the preliminary
assessment.

The Company does not have
any intangible assets not subject to amortization other than goodwill. As of December 31,
2008, the Company has acquired amortizable intangible assets with a total gross
carrying amount of approximately $81,600, of which $36,700, $31,400 and $6,000
relate to proprietary technology, customer relationships and license
agreements, respectively, with the remainder relating to other amortizable
intangible assets. The accumulated amortization related to these intangibles as
of December 31, 2008 totaled approximately $25,000 of which $6,600, $9,800
and $2,200 relate to proprietary technology, customer relationships and license
agreements, respectively, with the remainder relating to other amortizable
intangible assets. As of December 31, 2007, the Company had acquired
amortizable intangible assets with a total gross carrying amount of $53,500, of
which $30,700, $9,500 and $6,000 related to proprietary technology, customer
relationships and license agreements, respectively, with the remainder relating
to other amortizable intangible assets. The accumulated amortization related to
these intangibles as of December 31, 2007 totaled approximately $14,800,
of which $4,200, $4,000 and $1,600 related to proprietary technology, customer
relationships and license agreements, respectively, with the remainder relating
to other amortizable intangible assets. Intangible assets are included in other
long-term assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The acquired
intangible assets have a total weighted-average useful life of approximately 9
years. The license agreements, proprietary technology and customer
relationships have a weighted-average useful life of 8 years, 15 years and 4.5
years, respectively. The aggregate amortization expense for the year ended December 31,
2008 was approximately $9,800 and amortization expense estimated for each of
the next five fiscal years is approximately $11,000 in 2009, $10,000 in 2010,
$8,300 in 2011, $8,100 in 2012 and $4,800 in 2013.

Note 10—Reportable Business Segments and
International Operations

The Company has two
reportable business segments: (i) Interconnect Products and Assemblies and
(ii) Cable Products. The Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment
produces connectors and connector assemblies primarily for the communications,
aerospace, industrial and automotive markets. The Cable Products segment
produces coaxial and flat ribbon cable and related products primarily for
communication markets, including cable television. The accounting policies of
the segments are the same as those for the Company as a whole and are described
in Note 1 herein. The Company evaluates the performance of business units
on, among other things, profit or loss from operations before interest,
headquarters’ expense allocations, stock-based compensation expense, income
taxes, amortization related to certain intangible assets and nonrecurring gains
and losses.

Note 12—Casualty
loss related to flood

The Company
incurred damage at its Sidney, New York manufacturing facility as a result of
severe and sudden flooding during the period from June 28 through July 1,
2006. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company recorded charges
of $20,747 for recovery and clean up expenses and property related damage, net
of insurance and grant recoveries. The Sidney facility had limited
manufacturing and sales activity for the period from June 28 to July 14,
2006 but the plant was substantially back to full production at the end of the
third quarter of 2006.

Note 13—Commitments
and Contingencies

In the course of pursuing
its normal business activities, the Company is involved in various legal
proceedings and claims. Management does not expect that amounts, if any, which
may be required to be paid by reason of such proceedings or claims will have a
material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position or results of
operations.

Certain operations of the Company are subject to federal, state and
local environmental laws and regulations which govern the discharge of
pollutants into the air and water, as well as the handling and disposal of
solid and hazardous wastes. The Company believes that its operations are
currently in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental laws and
regulations and that the costs of continuing compliance will not have a
material effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations.

Subsequent to the acquisition of Amphenol from Allied Signal
Corporation (“Allied Signal”) in 1987 (Allied Signal merged with Honeywell
International Inc. in December 1999 (“Honeywell”)), Amphenol and
Honeywell were named jointly and severally liable as potentially responsible
parties in relation to several environmental cleanup sites. Amphenol and
Honeywell jointly consented to perform certain investigations and remedial and
monitoring activities at two sites, the “Route 8” landfill and the “Richardson
Hill Road” landfill, and they were jointly ordered to perform work at another
site, the “Sidney” landfill. The costs incurred relating to these three sites
are currently reimbursed by Honeywell based on an agreement (the “Honeywell
Agreement”) entered into in connection with the acquisition in 1987. For sites
covered by the Honeywell Agreement, to the extent that conditions or
circumstances occurred or existed at the time of or prior to the acquisition,
Honeywell is obligated to reimburse Amphenol 100% of such costs. Honeywell
representatives continue to work closely with the Company in addressing the
most significant environmental liabilities covered by the Honeywell Agreement.
Management does not believe that the costs associated with resolution of these
or any other environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s financial condition or results of operations. The environmental
investigation, remedial and monitoring activities identified by the Company,
including those referred to above, are covered under the Honeywell Agreement.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures

Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s
management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, the Company has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and
operation of its disclosure controls and procedures as of the period covered by
this report. Based on their evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures
are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the
Company in reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act

specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and such
information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the
Company’s principal executive and financial officers, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. There has been no change in the Company’s
internal controls over financial reporting during its most recent fiscal
quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, its internal control over financial reporting.
