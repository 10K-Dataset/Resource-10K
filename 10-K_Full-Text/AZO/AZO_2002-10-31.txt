PART I

Item 1. Business

Introduction

We are the nation’s leading specialty retailer of automotive parts and
accessories, with most of our sales to do-it-yourself (DIY) customers. We
began operations in 1979 and at August 31, 2002, operated 3,068 auto parts
stores in the United States and 39 in Mexico. We also sell parts and
accessories online at

autozone.com.

Each auto parts store carries an extensive
product line for cars, vans and light trucks, including new and remanufactured
automotive hard parts, maintenance items and accessories. We also have a
commercial sales program in the United States (AZ Commercial) that provides
commercial credit and prompt delivery of parts and other products to local,
regional and national repair garages, dealers and service stations. We do not
derive revenue from automotive repair or installation.

In addition, we sell automotive diagnostic and repair software through
ALLDATA and through

alldatadiy.com

.

At August 31, 2002, our stores were in the following locations:

Marketing and Merchandising Strategy

We are dedicated to providing customers with superior service, value and
quality automotive parts and products at conveniently located, well-designed
stores. Key elements of this strategy are:



Customer Service

We believe that our customers value customer service; therefore, customer
service is the most important element in our marketing and merchandising
strategy. We emphasize that our AutoZoners (employees) should always put
customers first by providing prompt, courteous service and trustworthy advice.
Our electronic parts catalogs assist in the selection of parts and we offer
lifetime warranties on many of the parts we sell. Our satellite system in our
domestic auto parts stores helps us to speed up credit card and check approval
processes and locate parts at neighboring AutoZone stores.

Our stores generally open at 8 a.m. and close between 8 and 10 p.m. (with
some open 24 hours) Monday through Saturday and typically open at 9 a.m. and
close between 6 and 8 p.m. on Sunday.

AutoZone also provides specialty tools in our Loan-A-Tool program.
Customers can borrow a specialty tool, such as a steering wheel puller, that a
DIY customer or a small repair shop would have little or no use for other than
for a single job. AutoZoners also provide other free services, including check
engine light readings; battery charging and installation; oil recycling; and
testing of starters, alternators, batteries, sensors, and actuators.

Merchandising

This table shows some of the types of products we sell in our stores:

Tools



We believe that the satisfaction of DIY and professional technician
customers often is impacted by our ability to provide specific automotive
products as requested. Our stores generally offer between 20,000 and 22,000
stock keeping units (“SKUs”) covering a broad range of vehicle types. Each
store carries the same basic product line, but we tailor our parts inventory to
the makes and models of the automobiles in each store’s trade area. Our hub
stores carry a larger assortment of products that can be delivered to local
satellite stores. Slower-selling products are also available through overnight
delivery.

We are constantly updating the products that we offer to assure that our
inventory matches to the products that our customers want, when they want them.

Pricing

We want to be perceived by our customers as the value leader in our
industry by consistently providing quality merchandise at a good price, with a
good warranty and backed by outstanding customer service. On many of our
products we will offer multiple value choices in a good/better/best assortment,
with value pricing offered and appropriate price and quality increases from the
“good” products to the “better” and “best” products. We believe that our prices
overall compare favorably to those of our competitors.

Marketing

We believe that targeted advertising and marketing play important roles in
succeeding in today’s environment. We are constantly working to understand our
customers’ changing wants and needs so that we can build long lasting, loyal
relationships. We utilize marketing and advertising primarily to educate
customers about the overall importance of vehicle maintenance. We also seek to
convey the message that AutoZone is THE brand that can provide “the most
exciting Zone for vehicle solutions!” Broadcast and print media are designed
to increase store traffic. In-store signage and creative product placement
help to educate customers about products they need as a means to increase
average sales dollars per transaction.

Store Design and Visual Merchandising

We design and build stores for a high visual impact. The typical AutoZone
store has an industrial “high tech” appearance by utilizing colorful exterior
and interior signage, exposed beams and ductwork and brightly lighted
interiors. Maintenance products, accessories and miscellaneous items are
attractively displayed for easy browsing by customers. In-store signage and
special displays promote products in floor displays, endcaps and on the shelf.
Store managers are able to customize areas of the store to prominently display
products that are in demand in the local community.

AZ Commercial

We believe we are the third largest aftermarket seller of automotive parts
and products to repair shops in the United States. AZ Commercial is the brand
of our program that sells parts and other products and services to local, regional and national repair garages,
dealers and service stations. As a part of the program we offer credit and
delivery to our commercial customers. The program operated out of 2,009 stores
as of August 31, 2002. We have opened hub stores that offer a greater range of
parts and products desired by commercial customers and that can be used as
additive inventory for local stores. In addition, some of our commercial
customers receive shipments directly from our distribution centers. AZ
Commercial has a national sales team focused on national and regional
commercial accounts, as well as an outside sales force for customers located
immediately around our commercial stores.



Store Operations

Store Formats

As of August 31, 2002, we had domestic auto parts stores in the following
square footage ranges:

Square Footage

Number of Stores

Less than 4,000


4,000 to 7,000

1,635

More than 7,000

1,155

Substantially all AutoZone stores are based on standard store formats
resulting in generally consistent appearance, merchandising and product mix.
Approximately 85% to 90% of each store’s square footage is selling space, of
which approximately 40% to 45% is dedicated to hard parts inventory. The hard
parts inventory area is generally fronted by a counter that runs the depth or
length of the store, dividing the hard parts area from the remainder of the
store. The remaining selling space contains displays of accessories and
maintenance items.

We have knowledgeable AutoZoners available to assist customers with their
parts needs utilizing our proprietary electronic parts catalog with a video
screen that is visible to both the AutoZoner and the customer. In addition to
helping ensure fast, accurate parts lookup, the parts catalog will suggest
additional items that a customer should purchase in order to properly install
the merchandise being purchased.

We believe that our stores are “destination stores,” generating their own
traffic rather than relying on traffic created by the presence of other stores
in the immediate vicinity. Therefore, we situate most stores on major
thoroughfares with easy access and good parking. Approximately 2,400 of our
auto parts stores are freestanding, with the balance principally located within
strip shopping centers. Freestanding large format stores typically have parking
for approximately 40 to 45 cars on a lot of approximately 3/4 to one acre. Our
smaller auto parts stores typically have parking for approximately 20 to 30
cars and are usually located on a lot of approximately 1/2 to 3/4 acre.



Store Personnel and Training

Each auto parts store typically employs from ten to 16 AutoZoners,
including a manager and, in some cases, an assistant manager. AutoZoners
typically have prior automotive experience. All AutoZoners are encouraged to
complete courses resulting in certification by the National Institute for
Automotive Service Excellence (ASE), which is broadly recognized for training
certification in the automotive industry. Although we do on-the-job training,
we also provide formal training programs, including regular store meetings on
specific sales and product issues, standardized training manuals and a
specialist program that trains AutoZoners in several areas of technical
expertise from both the company and from independent certification agencies.
Training is supplemented with frequent store visits by management.

Store managers get financial incentives through performance-based bonuses.
In addition, our growth has provided opportunities for the promotion of
qualified AutoZoners. We believe these opportunities are important to attract,
motivate and retain quality AutoZoners.

Our domestic auto parts stores are primarily supervised through district
managers who oversee approximately ten to 12 stores each and who report to
regional managers. Regional managers with approximately 80 to 90 stores each,
in turn, report to five Vice Presidents of Operations. All store support
functions are centralized in our store support center in Memphis, Tennessee. We
believe that this centralization enhances consistent execution of our
merchandising and marketing strategy at the store level, and reduces expenses
and cost of sales.

Store Automation

All of our stores have proprietary electronic parts catalogs that provide
parts information based on the make, model and year of an automobile. The
catalog display screens are placed on the hard parts counter where both
AutoZoners and customers can view the screen. In addition, our satellite
system enables the stores to speed up credit card and check approval processes,
immediately access national warranty data, implement real-time inventory
control and locate and hold parts at neighboring AutoZone stores.

Our domestic auto parts stores utilize our computerized Store Management
System, which includes bar code scanning and point-of-sale data collection
terminals. The Store Management System provides administrative assistance and
improved personnel scheduling at the store level, as well as enhanced
merchandising information and improved inventory control. We believe the Store
Management System also enhances customer service through faster processing of
transactions and simplified warranty and product return procedures.



Store Development

years:

Includes stores obtained in Chief and Auto Palace acquisitions in 1998,
and store real estate acquired from Pep Boys in fiscal year 1999.

We believe that expansion opportunities exist both in markets that we do
not currently serve, and in markets where we can achieve a larger presence. We
attempt to obtain high visibility sites in high traffic locations and undertake
substantial research prior to entering new markets. The most important criteria
for opening a new store are its projected future profitability and its ability
to achieve our required investment hurdle rate. Key factors in selecting new
site and market locations include population, demographics, vehicle profile,
number and strength of competitors’ stores and the cost of real estate. We also
consider the number of vehicles that are seven years old and older, “our kind
of vehicles” (OKVs), as these vehicles are no longer under the original
manufacturers’ warranty and will require more maintenance and repair than
younger vehicles. We generally seek to open new stores within or contiguous to
existing market areas and attempt to cluster development in new urban markets
in a relatively short period of time in order to achieve economies of scale in
distribution and marketing costs. In addition to continuing to lease or
develop our own stores, we occasionally evaluate potential acquisition
candidates in new as well as in existing markets.

Purchasing and Supply Chain

Merchandise is selected and purchased for all stores at our store support
center in Memphis. No one class of product accounts for as much as ten percent
of our total sales. In fiscal 2002, no single supplier accounted for more than
ten percent of our total purchases. We generally have few long-term contracts
for the purchase of merchandise. We believe that we have excellent
relationships with suppliers. We also believe that alternative sources of
supply exist, at similar cost, for substantially all types of product sold.

Our vendors ship substantially all of our merchandise to our distribution
centers. Stores typically place orders on a weekly basis with merchandise
shipped from the warehouse within 24 hours of receipt of the order.



Our hub stores have increased our ability to distribute products on a
timely basis to each store. A hub store is able to provide replenishment of
sold products and deliver special order products to a store in its coverage
area within 24 hours. Hub stores are replenished from distribution centers
multiple times per week.

Competition

The sale of automotive parts, accessories and maintenance items is highly
competitive in many areas, including name recognition, product availability,
customer service, store location and price, with many competitors. AutoZone
competes in both the DIY and commercial auto parts and accessories markets.

Competitors include national and regional auto parts chains, independently
owned parts stores, wholesalers and jobbers, car washes and auto dealers, in
addition to discount and mass merchandise stores, department stores, hardware
stores, supermarkets, drugstores and home stores that sell aftermarket vehicle
parts and supplies, chemicals, accessories, tools and maintenance parts.
AutoZone competes on the basis of customer service, including the knowledge and
expertise of our AutoZoners, merchandise selection and availability, price,
product, warranty, store layouts and location.

Trademarks and Patents

We have registered several service marks and trademarks in the United
States Patent and Trademark office, including our service mark “AutoZone” and
trademarks “AutoZone,” “Duralast” and “ALLDATA.” We believe that the
“AutoZone” service mark and trademarks are important components in our
merchandising and marketing strategy.

Employees

As of August 31, 2002, we employed 44,179 persons, approximately 27,000 of
whom were employed full-time. Approximately 91 percent of our AutoZoners were
employed in stores or in direct field supervision, approximately six percent in
distribution centers and approximately three percent in store support
functions.

We have never experienced any material labor disruption, and believe that
our labor relations are generally good.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

We are a defendant in a lawsuit entitled “Coalition for a Level Playing
Field, L.L.C.,

et al.,

v. AutoZone, Inc., Wal-mart Stores, Inc., Advance Auto
Parts, Inc., O’Reilly Automotive, Inc., and Keystone Automotive Operations,
Inc.,” filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York in
February 2000. The case was filed by over 100 plaintiffs, principally
automotive aftermarket warehouse distributors and jobbers. The plaintiffs claim
that the defendants have knowingly received volume discounts, rebates, slotting
and other allowances, fees, free inventory, sham advertising and promotional
payments, a share in the manufacturers’ profits, and excessive payments for
services purportedly performed for the manufacturers in violation of the
Robinson-Patman Act. Plaintiffs’ third amended and corrected complaint seeks
unspecified damages suffered by each plaintiff (prior to statutory trebling)
ranging from several million dollars to $35 million and a permanent injunction
prohibiting defendants from committing further violations of the
Robinson-Patman Act and from opening any further stores to compete with
plaintiffs as long as defendants continue to violate the Act. The litigation is
currently in the early stages of discovery. We do not know how the plaintiffs
have calculated their alleged damages. We intend to vigorously defend against
this action and believe that we have substantive defenses to all of the claims
in the complaint.

We are also involved in various other legal proceedings incidental to the
conduct of our business. Although the amount of liability that may result from
these other proceedings cannot be ascertained, we do not currently believe
that, in the aggregate, they will result in liabilities material to our
financial condition or results of operations.

Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

None.



PART II

Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Stock and Related Stockholder Matters

AutoZone’s common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the
symbol “AZO.” On October 15, 2002, there were 2,956 stockholders of record,
which does not include the number of beneficial owners whose shares were
represented by security position listings.

We do not pay a cash dividend on our common stock. Any payment of
dividends in the future is dependent upon our financial condition, capital
requirements, earnings, cash flow and other factors.

The following table sets forth the high and low sales prices per share of
common stock, as reported by the New York Stock Exchange, for the periods

Item 6. Selected Financial Data



Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations

Results of Operations

For an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our
performance during the past three fiscal years, this financial review should be
read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements presented in
this Form 10-K.

Disclosure and Internal Controls

As of August 31, 2002, an evaluation was performed under the supervision
and with the participation of AutoZone’s management, including the CEO and CFO,
of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and
procedures. Based on that evaluation, AutoZone’s management, including the CEO
and CFO, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective
as of August 31, 2002. No significant changes in AutoZone’s internal controls
or in other factors have occurred that could significantly affect controls
subsequent to August 31, 2002.

Critical Accounting Policies

Product Warranties

We provide our customers limited warranties on certain products that range
from 30 days to lifetime warranties. We provide a reserve for warranty
obligations at the time of sale based on each product’s historical return rate.
Certain product vendors pay all or a portion of our warranty expense. However,
at times, the vendors may not cover all of the warranty expense. If we
materially underestimate our warranty expense on products that are not fully
warranted to us by our vendors, we may experience a material adverse impact on
our reported financial position or results of operations. If we incorrectly
estimate our warranty expense, we will recognize any adjustment in income at
the time it is determined.

Litigation and Other Contingent Liabilities

We have received claims related to and been notified that we are a
defendant in a number of legal proceedings resulting from our business, such as
employment matters, product liability, general liability related to our store
premises and alleged violation of the Robinson-Patman Act (as specifically described in Note M to the Consolidated Financial Statements).
We calculate contingent loss accruals using our best estimate of our probable
and reasonably estimable contingent liabilities, such as lawsuits and our
retained liability for insured claims. We do not believe that any of these
contingent liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material
adverse effect upon our consolidated financial position or results of
operations. However, if our estimates related to these contingent liabilities
are incorrect, the future results of operations for any particular fiscal
quarter or year could be materially adversely affected. Some of our litigation
is being conducted before juries in states where past jury awards have been
significant, and we are unable to predict the results of any jury verdict. If
we incorrectly estimate our contingent liabilities, we will recognize any
adjustment in income at the time it is determined.



Vendor Allowances

We receive various payments and allowances from our vendors based on
volume of purchases and in payment of services that AutoZone provides to the
vendors. Monies received from vendors include rebates, allowances and
cooperative advertising funds. Typically these funds are determined
periodically and are, at times, dependent on projected purchase volumes and
advertising plans. Certain vendor allowances are used exclusively for
promotions and other direct expenses and are recognized as a reduction to
selling, general and administrative expenses when earned. Rebates and other
miscellaneous incentives are earned based on purchases and/or product sales.
These monies are treated as a reduction of inventories and are recognized as a
reduction to cost of sales as the inventories are sold. The amounts to be
received are subject to changes in market conditions, vendor marketing
strategies and changes in the profitability or sell-through of the related
merchandise for AutoZone.

Restructuring and Impairment Charges

In fiscal 2001, AutoZone recorded restructuring and impairment charges of
$156.8 million. The planned closure of 51 domestic auto parts stores and the
disposal of real estate projects in process and excess properties accounted for
the largest portion, or $56.1 million, of the charge. In fiscal 2002, these
stores were closed, and sales of certain excess properties resulted in gains of
approximately $2.6 million. Remaining excess properties are currently being
marketed for sale. During the third quarter of fiscal 2002, all remaining
excess properties were reevaluated. At that time, it was determined that
several properties could be developed. This resulted in the reversal of
accrued lease obligations totaling $6.4 million. It was also determined that
additional writedowns were needed to state remaining excess properties at fair
value. These writedowns totaled $9.0 million. Because fiscal 2002 adjustments
offset, there was no impact on net income.

Another portion of the charge, $32.0 million, related to other asset
writedowns and the accrual of lease obligations associated with the closure of
a supply depot and for the unoccupied ALLDATA office building. During the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, the ALLDATA office building was sold to a third
party. The reserve previously established was adequate to cover the loss
incurred on the sale. We continue to pursue the sale, sublease or early
termination of the leases associated with the remaining leased facilities.



We also reserved $30.1 million for inventory rationalization, including a
provision for inventory losses in closed stores. All of the scheduled recalls
and disposals of inventory took place during fiscal 2002. The reserve was
adequate to cover losses incurred.

Asset writedowns and contractual obligations aggregating $29.9 million
related to the planned sale of TruckPro, our heavy-duty truck parts subsidiary,
were recorded. In December 2001, TruckPro was sold to a group of investors for
cash proceeds of $25.7 million and a promissory note. We have deferred a gain
on the sale of $3.6 million due to uncertainties associated with the
realization of the gain. Refer to Note K in the Consolidated Financial
Statements for further discussion of this transaction.

The remainder of the restructuring and impairment charges, $8.7 million,
related to contractual obligations, severance and other charges. We did not
reverse any reserves into income.

Total remaining accrued obligations for restructuring charges were $18.1
million at August 31, 2002. The following table presents a summary of the
activity in accrued obligations for the restructuring charges:

Fiscal 2002 Compared with Fiscal 2001

Net sales for fiscal 2002 increased by $507.3 million or 10.5% over net
sales for fiscal 2001. Excluding TruckPro, which was sold during the year, net
sales increased 13%. The sales increases were attributable to a 9% increase in
comparable store sales, or sales for domestic auto parts stores opened at least
one year. New store sales in fiscal year 2002 contributed two percentage
points and net sales from the 53rd week contributed approximately two
percentage points of the increase. Comparable store sales increased as a
result of an increase in customer count and an increase in average dollars
spent per transaction over the amounts in the prior year.

At August 31, 2002, we operated 3,068 domestic auto parts stores and 39 in
Mexico, compared with 3,019 domestic auto parts stores, 21 in Mexico and 49
TruckPro stores at August 25, 2001.



Gross profit for fiscal 2002 was $2.4 billion, or 44.6% of net sales,
compared with $2.0 billion, or 42.4% of net sales (excluding nonrecurring
charges) for fiscal 2001. Gross margin
improvement reflected lower product costs, more efficient supply chain
costs, reduced inventory shrinkage, the benefits of more strategic and
disciplined pricing due to category management and the addition of more
value-added, high-margin merchandise than in the prior year.

Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2002
increased by $105.5 million over such expenses for fiscal 2001 but declined as
a percentage of net sales from 31.1% to 30.1% (excluding nonrecurring charges
in the prior year). The improved ratio reflects the fact that revenues rose
more rapidly than the growth of store-level expenses (a 1.1 percentage point
improvement), combined with operating savings resulting from the restructuring
in fiscal year 2001 related to controlling staffing, base salaries and
technology spending of 0.4 percentage points. Additionally, the prior year
included other expenses related to strategic initiatives not included in the
restructuring and impairment charges of 0.3 percentage points. The adoption of
new accounting rules for goodwill reduced operating expenses in fiscal 2002 by
approximately $8.6 million, or 0.2 percentage points. These improvements in
the expense ratio were partially offset by additional bonus, legal, pension and
insurance expenses incurred in the current year of 1.1 percentage points.

Net interest expense for fiscal year 2002 was $79.9 million compared with
$100.7 million during fiscal 2001. The decrease in interest expense was
primarily due to lower levels of debt compared with the prior fiscal year and
lower average interest rates on short term borrowings. Weighted average
borrowings for fiscal year 2002 were $1.33 billion, compared with $1.45 billion
for fiscal 2001. Additionally, weighted average borrowing rates were lower in
the current year compared with the prior year at 4.41% compared with 6.24%.

AutoZone’s effective income tax rate was 38.1% of pretax income for fiscal
2002 and 38.8% for fiscal 2001. The decrease in the tax rate is due primarily
to the change in goodwill accounting.

Fiscal 2001 Compared with Fiscal 2000

Net sales for fiscal 2001 increased by $335.5 million or 7.5% over net
sales for fiscal 2000. Same store sales, or sales for domestic auto parts
stores opened at least one year, increased 4%. Additionally, new store sales
in fiscal 2001 contributed 3% of the sales increase. The remaining sales
increase was due to increased sales in our Mexico stores, ALLDATA and TruckPro.
At August 25, 2001, we operated 3,019 domestic auto parts stores compared with
2,915 at August 26, 2000.

Gross profit for fiscal 2001 (excluding nonrecurring charges) was $2.0
billion, or 42.4% of net sales, compared with $1.9 billion, or 41.9% of net
sales, for fiscal 2000. The increase in the gross profit percentage was
primarily due to a shift in sales mix to higher gross margin products in the
current year and higher warranty expense in the prior year.



Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2001
increased by $130.6 million over such expenses for fiscal 2000 (excluding
nonrecurring charges) and increased as a percentage of net sales from 30.5% to
31.1%. The increase in the expense ratio was primarily
due to an increase in group insurance expenses of 0.1 percentage points,
an increase in risk management insurance expenses of 0.1 percentage points, an
increase in other expenses related to strategic initiatives not included in the
restructuring and impairment charges of 0.3 percentage points and higher levels
of payroll of 0.1 percentage points, primarily in the first half of the year.

Net interest expense for fiscal 2001 was $100.7 million compared with
$76.8 million for fiscal 2000. The increase in interest expense is due to
higher weighted average borrowings in fiscal 2001 compared with fiscal 2000.
Weighted average borrowings were $1.45 billion in fiscal 2001 compared with
$1.18 billion in fiscal 2000. Weighted average borrowing rates were slightly
lower in fiscal 2001 compared with fiscal 2000 at 6.24% compared with 6.37%.

AutoZone’s effective income tax rate was 38.8% of pretax income for fiscal
2001 and 38.5% for fiscal 2000.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Capital Requirements

AutoZone’s primary capital requirements have been the funding of its
continued new-store development program, inventory requirements and stock
repurchases. We opened or acquired 1,340 net new domestic auto parts stores
from the beginning of fiscal 1998 to August 31, 2002. Cash flow generated from
store operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity. Net cash
provided by operating activities was $739.1 million in fiscal 2002, $458.9
million in fiscal 2001 and $513.0 million in fiscal 2000. The increase in cash
flow from operations in the current year is due primarily to higher net income,
a larger increase in accounts payable and accruals and higher employee stock
option exercises.

We invested $117.2 million in capital assets in fiscal 2002 compared with
$169.3 million in fiscal year 2001 and $249.7 million in fiscal year 2000. In
fiscal 2002, we opened 102 new auto parts stores in the U.S. and 18 in Mexico,
replaced 15 U.S. stores and closed 53 U.S. stores. During the year we sold
TruckPro, our heavy-duty truck parts subsidiary, which operated 49 stores, for
cash proceeds of $25.7 million. Net cash flows used in investing activities
were $64.5 million in fiscal 2002, compared with $122.1 million in fiscal 2001
and $242.3 million in fiscal 2000.

Our new-store development program requires working capital, predominantly
for inventories. Historically, we have negotiated extended payment terms from
suppliers, reducing the working capital required by expansion. We believe that
we will be able to continue financing much of our inventory growth through
favorable payment terms from suppliers, but there can be no assurance that we
will be successful in obtaining such terms.



Depending on the timing and magnitude of our future investments (either in
the form of leased or purchased properties or acquisitions), we anticipate that
we will rely primarily on internally generated funds to support a majority of
our capital expenditures, working capital requirements and stock repurchases.
The balance will be funded through borrowings. We
anticipate that we will be able to obtain such financing in view of our
credit rating and favorable experiences in the debt market in the past.

Credit Ratings

At August 31, 2002, AutoZone had a senior unsecured debt credit rating
from Standard & Poor’s of BBB+ and a commercial paper rating of A-2. Moody’s
Investors Service had assigned us a senior unsecured debt credit rating of Baa2
and a commercial paper rating of P-2. Both rating agencies had AutoZone listed
as having a “negative outlook.” Subsequent to year end, Standard & Poor’s
changed its outlook for AutoZone to “positive” and Moody’s changed its outlook
to “stable.” If these credit ratings drop, AutoZone’s interest expense may
increase; similarly, we anticipate that our interest expense may decrease if
our investment ratings are raised. If our commercial paper ratings drop below
current levels, we may have difficulty continuing to utilize the commercial
paper market and our interest expense will increase, as we will then be
required to access more expensive bank lines of credit. If our senior unsecured
debt ratings drop below investment grade, our access to financing may become
more limited, and obligations under our equity forward agreements may be
accelerated, requiring the agreements to be settled prior to their planned
settlement date.

Debt Facilities

We maintain $950 million of revolving credit facilities with a group of
banks. Of the $950 million, $300 million expires in May 2003. The remaining
$650 million expires in May 2005. The 364-day facility expiring in May 2003
includes a renewal feature as well as an option to extend the maturity date of
the then-outstanding debt by one year. The credit facilities exist largely to
support commercial paper borrowings and other short term unsecured bank loans.
At August 31, 2002, outstanding commercial paper of $223.2 million is
classified as long term as we have the ability and intention to refinance it on
a long term basis. The rate of interest payable under the credit facilities is
a function of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), the lending bank’s
base rate (as defined in the agreement) or a competitive bid rate at our
option. We have agreed to observe certain covenants under the terms of our
credit agreements, including limitations on total indebtedness, restrictions on
liens and minimum fixed charge coverage.

During fiscal year 2001, we entered into $200 million and $115 million
unsecured bank term loans with a group of banks. During fiscal 2002, the $200
million two-year unsecured term loan was increased to $350 million and the
maturity was extended to November 2004. The rate of interest payable is a
function of LIBOR or the bank’s base rate (as defined in the agreement) at our
option.

After the fiscal year end, on October 1, 2002, we filed a shelf
registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This filing will
allow us to sell as much as $500 million in debt securities for general
corporate purposes, including repaying, redeeming or repurchasing existing
debt, and/or to fund working capital, capital expenditures, new store openings,
stock repurchases and acquisitions. On October 16, 2002, we issued $300
million of 5.875% Senior Notes under the registration statement. The Notes
mature in October 2012 and interest is payable semi-annually on April 15 and
October 15.



All of the repayment obligations under our bank lines of credit may be
accelerated and come due prior to the scheduled payment date if AutoZone
experiences a change in control (as defined in the agreements) of AutoZone or
its Board of Directors or if covenants are breached related to total
indebtedness and minimum fixed charge coverage. We expect to remain in
compliance with these covenants.

Stock Repurchases

As of August 31, 2002, our Board of Directors had authorized the
repurchase of up to $2.3 billion of common stock in the open market. From
January 1998 to August 31, 2002, approximately $2.1 billion of common stock had
been repurchased, including shares committed under outstanding forward purchase
contracts. During fiscal 2002, we repurchased $699.0 million of common stock.
The impact of the fiscal 2002 stock repurchases on earnings per share in fiscal
2002 was an increase of $0.16. Subsequent to year end, we repurchased 1.1
million shares in partial settlement of the forward purchase contract
outstanding at August 31, 2002, at an average cost of $69.91 per share.

At times, we utilize equity forward agreements to facilitate our
repurchase of common stock and to lock in current market prices for later
purchase. Our obligations under the equity forward agreements are not
reflected on our balance sheet. AutoZone, at its option, may settle the
forward purchase agreements in cash or in common stock.

In conjunction with our commercial sales program, we offer credit to some
of our commercial customers. The receivables related to the credit program are
sold to a third party at a discount for cash with limited recourse. AutoZone
has established a reserve for this recourse. At August 31, 2002, the
receivables facility had an outstanding balance of $23.5 million and the
balance of the recourse reserve was $1.9 million.

AutoZone has a synthetic lease facility of $30 million in total. The
facility expires in fiscal 2006. At August 31, 2002, $28.2 million in
synthetic lease obligations were outstanding, relating to a small number of our
domestic auto parts stores. The synthetic leases qualify as operating leases
for accounting purposes and are not reflected as an asset or a liability on our
balance sheet. The lease payments on the stores are reflected in the income
statement in operating expenses and we depreciate the underlying assets for tax
purposes.

We have subleased some of our leased real property to other entities,
including the purchaser of our former TruckPro business. If the purchaser of
the TruckPro business becomes unable to meet its obligations under the
subleases, we might incur liabilities in connection with the recovery and
subsequent sublease or lease termination of the properties.

Inflation

AutoZone does not believe its operations have been materially affected by
inflation. We have been successful, in many cases, in mitigating the effects
of merchandise cost increases principally through efficiencies gained through
economies of scale, selective forward buying and the use of alternative
suppliers.

Seasonality and Quarterly Periods

AutoZone’s business is somewhat seasonal in nature, with the highest sales
occurring in the summer months of June through August, in which average weekly
per store sales historically have been about 15% to 25% higher than in the
slower months of December through February. During short periods of time,
AutoZone’s business is also affected by weather conditions.



Extremely hot or
extremely cold weather tends to enhance sales by causing parts to fail and
spurring sales of seasonal products. Mild or rainy weather tends to soften
sales as parts failure rates are lower in mild weather and elective maintenance
is deferred during periods of rainy weather. Over the long run, the effects of
weather balance out, as we have stores throughout the United States.

Each of the first three quarters of AutoZone’s fiscal year consists of 12
weeks, and the fourth quarter consists of 16 weeks (17 weeks in fiscal 2002).
Because the fourth quarter contains the seasonally high sales volume and
consists of 16 weeks (17 weeks in fiscal 2002), compared to 12 weeks for each
of the first three quarters, our fourth quarter represents a disproportionate
share of the annual net sales and net income. The fourth quarter of fiscal
2002 represented 34.6% of annual net sales and 41.6% of net income; the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2001, excluding nonrecurring charges, represented 34.1% of
annual net sales and 43.9% of net income. Fiscal year 2002 consisted of 53
weeks, with the fiscal fourth quarter including 17 weeks.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In October 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” (SFAS
144). SFAS 144 supersedes Statement No. 121, “Accounting for the Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of,” but retains
many of its fundamental provisions. Additionally, SFAS 144 expands the scope
of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions. The
provisions of SFAS 144 are effective for AutoZone’s 2003 fiscal year. We do
not expect the adoption of SFAS 144 to have a significant financial impact on
our Consolidated Financial Statements.

In June 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities”
(SFAS 146). SFAS 146 nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 94-3,
“Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other
Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a
Restructuring)” and requires that a liability for the cost associated with an
exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred, as
opposed to the date of an entity’s commitment to an exit plan. The provisions
of SFAS 146 are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated
after December 31, 2002. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS 146 to have a
significant financial impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.



Risk Factors

We may not be able to increase sales by the same historic growth rates.

We have significantly increased our domestic store count in the past five
fiscal years, growing from 1,728 stores at August 30, 1997, to 3,068 stores at
August 31, 2002, an average store count increase per year of 14%. We do not
plan to continue our store count growth rate at the historic pace. In addition,
a portion of our total sales increases each year results from increases in
sales at existing stores. We cannot provide any assurance that we can continue
to increase same store sales.

Our business depends upon qualified employees.

At the end of fiscal year 2002, our consolidated employee count was
approximately 44,200. We do not know if we can continue to hire and retain
qualified employees at current wage rates. In the event of increasing wage
rates, if we do not increase our wages competitively, our customer service
could suffer by reason of a declining quality of our workforce or,
alternatively, our earnings would decrease if we increase our wage rates.

If demand for our products slows, then our business may be materially affected.

Demand for products sold by our stores depends on many factors. In the
short term, it may depend upon:

•

the number of miles vehicles are driven annually, as increased
vehicle mileage increases the need for maintenance and repair. Mileage
levels may be affected by gas prices and other factors.

•

the number of vehicles in current service that are seven years old
and older, as these vehicles are no longer under the original vehicle
manufacturers’ warranty and will need more maintenance and repair than
younger vehicles.

•

the weather, as vehicle maintenance may be deferred during periods
of severe weather impacting a wide geographic area.

•

the economy. In periods of rapidly declining economic conditions,
both do-it-yourself and do-it-for-me customers may defer vehicle
maintenance or repair. During periods of expansionary economic
conditions, more of our do-it-yourself customers may pay others to
repair and maintain their cars instead of working on their own vehicles
or they may purchase new vehicles.

For the long term, demand for our products may depend upon:

•

the quality of the vehicles manufactured by the original vehicle
manufacturers and the length of the warranty offered on new vehicles.



•

restrictions on access to diagnostic tools and repair information
imposed by the original vehicle manufacturers or by governmental
regulation.

If we are unable to compete successfully against other businesses that sell the
products that we sell, we could lose customers and our revenues and profits may
decline.

The sale of automotive parts, accessories and maintenance items is highly
competitive in many areas, including name recognition, product availability,
customer service, store location and price, with many competitors. AutoZone
competes in both the DIY and commercial auto parts and accessories markets.

Competitors include national and regional auto parts chains, independently
owned parts stores, wholesalers and jobbers, repair shops, car washes and auto
dealers, in addition to discount and mass merchandise stores, department
stores, hardware stores, supermarkets, drugstores and home stores that sell
aftermarket vehicle parts and supplies, chemicals, accessories, tools and
maintenance parts. Although we believe we compete effectively on the basis of
customer service, including the knowledge and expertise of our AutoZoners,
merchandise quality, selection and availability, product warranty, store
layout, location and convenience, and the strength of our AutoZone brand name,
some competitors may have competitive advantages, such as greater financial and
marketing resources, larger stores with more merchandise, longer operating
histories, more frequent customer visits and more effective advertising. If we
are unable to continue to develop successful competitive strategies or our
competitors develop more effective strategies, we could lose customers and our
revenues and profits may decline.

If we cannot profitably increase market share in the commercial auto parts
business, our sales growth may be limited.

Although we are one of the largest sellers of auto parts in the commercial
“do-it-for-me” market, to increase commercial sales we must compete against
automotive aftermarket jobbers and warehouse distributors, in addition to other
auto parts retailers that have recently entered the commercial business.
Although we believe we compete effectively on the basis of customer service,
merchandise quality, selection and availability, and distribution locations,
some automotive aftermarket jobbers and warehouse distributors have been in
business for substantially longer periods of time than we have, have developed
long-term customer relationships and have larger available inventories. We can
make no assurances that we can profitably develop new commercial customers or
make available inventories required by commercial customers.

If our vendors continue to consolidate, we may pay higher prices for our
merchandise.

Recently, several of our vendors have merged and others have announced
plans to merge. Further vendor consolidation could limit the number of vendors
from which we may purchase products and could materially affect the prices we
pay for these products.



Consolidation among our competitors may negatively impact our business.

Recently, several large auto parts chains have merged. We do not know what
impact these mergers will have upon competition in the retail automotive
aftermarket. If our merging competitors are able to achieve efficiencies in
their mergers, then there may be greater competitive pressures in the markets
in which they are strongest.

War, acts of terrorism, or the threat of either may negatively impact
availability of merchandise and adversely impact our sales.

In the event of war, acts of terrorism, or either are threatened, it may
have a negative impact on our ability to obtain merchandise available for sale
in our stores. Some of our merchandise is imported from other countries. If
imported goods become difficult or impossible to bring into the United States,
and if we cannot obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar costs,
our sales and profit margins may be negatively affected.

In the event that commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially
delayed, our business may be adversely impacted, as we may have difficulty
shipping merchandise to our distribution centers and stores.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

AutoZone is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange and
interest rates. To reduce such risks, we may periodically use various
financial instruments. To date, foreign exchange exposure has not been
material. All hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to
policies and procedures. Further, we do not buy or sell financial instruments
for trading purposes.

Derivatives and Hedging

Financial market risk relating to AutoZone’s operations results primarily
from changes in interest rates. We comply with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards Nos. 133, 137 and 138 (collectively “SFAS 133”) pertaining
to the accounting for derivatives and hedging activities. SFAS 133 requires us
to recognize all derivative instruments on the balance sheet at fair value.
AutoZone reduces its exposure to increases in interest rates by entering into
interest rate swap contracts and treasury lock agreements. All of our interest
rate swaps and treasury locks are designated as cash flow hedges.

AutoZone has utilized interest rate swaps to convert variable rate debt to
fixed rate debt. At August 31, 2002, and at August 25, 2001, we held interest
rate swap contracts related to $190 million of variable rate debt. Of the $190
million, $115 million of the swaps mature in December 2003 and are used to
hedge the variable rate debt associated with AutoZone’s $115 million term loan.
The remaining $75 million of swaps expire throughout fiscal years 2003 and
2004, and are used to hedge the variable rate debt associated with commercial
paper borrowings. Additionally, at August 31, 2002, we held treasury lock
agreements with notional amounts of $300 million that expire in October 2002
and are used to hedge the exposure to variability in future cash flows of
anticipated debt transactions. The agreements will be settled upon the
issuance of the debt. Upon settlement of the agreements, the realized gain or loss to be paid or
received by AutoZone will be amortized as interest expense over the life of the
underlying debt.



In accordance with SFAS 133, AutoZone reflects the current fair value of
interest rate swaps and treasury lock agreements on its balance sheet. The
related gains or losses on these transactions are deferred in stockholders’
equity as a component of comprehensive income. These deferred gains and losses
are recognized in income in the period in which the related interest rates
being hedged have been recognized in expense. However, to the extent that the
change in value of an interest rate swap contract or treasury lock agreement
does not perfectly offset the change in the value of the interest rate being
hedged, that ineffective portion is immediately recognized in income. For the
fiscal years ended August 31, 2002, and August 25, 2001, all of our interest
rate swap contracts and treasury lock agreements were determined to be highly
effective, and no ineffective portion was recognized in income.

The fair value of AutoZone’s debt was estimated at $1.22 billion as of
August 31, 2002, and $1.21 billion as of August 25, 2001, based on the market
values of the debt at those dates. Such fair value is greater than the
carrying value of debt at August 31, 2002, by $27.2 million and less than the
carrying value of debt at August 25, 2001, by $17.3 million. We had $699.8
million of variable rate debt outstanding at August 31, 2002, and $730.4
million outstanding at August 25, 2001. At these borrowing levels, a one
percentage point increase in interest rates would have had an unfavorable
impact on AutoZone’s pretax earnings and cash flows of $5.1 million in 2002 and
$6.6 million in 2001, which includes the effects of interest rate swaps. The
primary interest rate exposure on variable rate debt is based on LIBOR.

Report of Independent Auditors

Stockholders

AutoZone, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of AutoZone,
Inc. as of August 31, 2002 and August 25, 2001, and the related consolidated
statements of income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended August 31, 2002. Our audits also included the
financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a). These financial
statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on
a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of AutoZone, Inc.
at August 31, 2002 and August 25, 2001, and the consolidated results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
August 31, 2002, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement
schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken
as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth
therein.

As discussed in Note C to the consolidated financial statements, the
Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142,

Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets

, in fiscal year 2002.

Management’s Report

Management is responsible for the preparation, integrity, and fair
presentation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the
Company and its subsidiaries. The financial statements have been prepared in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
and include the best estimates and judgments of management. Management also
prepared the other information included in the annual report and is responsible
for its accuracy and consistency with the financial statements. The opinion of
the independent auditors, Ernst & Young LLP, based upon their audits of the
consolidated financial statements, is contained in this Annual Report.

Management is responsible for maintaining a system of internal control
over financial reporting that provides reasonable assurance, at an appropriate
cost-benefit relationship, about the reliability of financial reporting. The
system contains self-monitoring mechanisms, and is regularly tested by the
Company’s internal auditors. Actions are taken to correct deficiencies as they
are identified. Even an effective internal control system, no matter how well
designed, has inherent limitations – including the possibility of the
circumvention or overriding of controls – and therefore can provide only
reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Further,
because of changes in conditions, internal control system effectiveness may
vary over time.

The Audit Committee of our Company’s Board of Directors, composed solely
of independent Directors, regularly meets with the independent auditors,
management and internal auditors to discuss the system of internal control over
auditing and financial reporting matters. The Committee also meets
periodically with the independent auditors and the internal auditors without
management present to discuss any matters that may require attention.

Management assessed the Company’s system of internal control over
financial reporting as of August 31, 2002, in relation to criteria for
effective internal control over financial reporting described in “Internal
Control – Integrated Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management
believes that, as of August 31, 2002, the Company’s system of internal control
over financial reporting met those criteria.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note A – Significant Accounting Policies

Business:

The Company is principally a retailer of automotive and light
truck parts, chemicals and accessories. At the end of fiscal 2002, the Company
operated 3,068 domestic auto parts stores in 44 states and the District of
Columbia and 39 auto parts stores in Mexico. The Company also sells products
online at

autozone.com

. In addition, the Company sells automotive diagnostic
and repair software through ALLDATA and through

alldatadiy.com.

Fiscal Year:

The Company’s fiscal year consists of 52 or 53 weeks ending
on the last Saturday in August.

Basis of Presentation:

The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of AutoZone, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (the Company).
All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in
consolidation.

Merchandise Inventories:

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or
market using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method.

Property and Equipment:

Property and equipment is stated at cost.
Depreciation is computed principally by the straight-line method over the
following estimated useful lives: buildings and improvements, 5 to 50 years;
equipment, 3 to 10 years; and leasehold improvements and interests, 5 to 15
years. Leasehold improvements and interests are amortized over the terms of
the leases.

Intangible Assets:

The cost in excess of fair value of net assets of
businesses acquired is recorded as goodwill and, prior to the adoption of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets” (SFAS 142) in fiscal 2002, goodwill was amortized on a
straight-line basis over 40 years. Refer to Note C for the impact of the
adoption of SFAS 142 on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Preopening Expenses:

Preopening expenses, which consist primarily of
payroll and occupancy costs, are expensed as incurred.

Advertising Costs:

The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred.
Advertising expense, net of vendor funding, was approximately $17.5 million in
fiscal 2002, $20.7 million in fiscal 2001 and $14.4 million in fiscal 2000.

Shipping and Handling Costs

: The Company does not charge the customer
separately for shipping and handling. The cost the Company incurs to ship
products to the stores for delivery to the customer is included in cost of
sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Warranty Costs:

The Company provides its customers with a warranty on
certain products. Estimated warranty obligations are provided at the time of
sale of the product.



Financial Instruments:

The Company has certain financial instruments,
including cash, accounts receivable and accounts payable. The carrying amounts
of these financial instruments approximate fair value because of their short
maturities. A discussion of the carrying values and fair values of the
Company’s debt is included in Note G, while a discussion of the Company’s fair
values of its derivatives is included in the section entitled “Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities” in Note A.

Income Taxes:

The Company accounts for income taxes under the liability
method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on
differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities
and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect
when the differences are expected to reverse.

Cash Equivalents:

Cash equivalents consist of investments with maturities
of 90 days or less at the date of purchase.

Use of Estimates:

Management of the Company has made a number of estimates
and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the
disclosure of contingent liabilities to prepare these financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Earnings Per Share:

Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted
average outstanding common shares. Diluted earnings per share is based on the
weighted average outstanding shares adjusted for the effect of common stock
equivalents.

Revenue Recognition:

The Company recognizes sales revenue at the time the
sale is made and the product is delivered to the customer.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets:

The Company routinely reviews
performance at the store level to identify any stores with current period
operating losses that should be considered for impairment. As part of this
review, the Company compares the sum of the expected future cash flows with the
carrying amounts of the assets. If impairments are indicated, the amount by
which the carrying amount of the assets exceeded the fair value of the assets
is recognized as an impairment loss.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities:

The Company complies with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Nos. 133, 137 and 138 (collectively
“SFAS 133”) pertaining to the accounting for derivatives and hedging
activities. SFAS 133 requires the Company to recognize all derivative
instruments on the balance sheet at fair value. The adoption of SFAS 133
impacted the accounting for the Company’s interest rate hedging program. The
Company reduces its exposure to increases in interest rates by entering into
interest rate swap contracts and treasury lock agreements. All of the Company’s
interest rate swaps and treasury locks are designated as cash flow hedges. At
August 31, 2002, and August 25, 2001, the Company had interest rate swap
contracts with notional amounts totaling $190 million. Additionally, at August
31, 2002, the Company had treasury lock agreements with notional amounts
totaling $300 million. The fair values of the interest rate swaps and treasury
lock agreements were a liability of $10.4 million at August 31, 2002, and the
fair values of the interest rate swaps were a liability of $5.6 million at August 25, 2001. The interest
rate swap contracts mature in fiscal years 2003 and 2004 and the treasury lock
agreements mature in fiscal 2003.



The Company reflects the current fair value of interest rate swaps and
treasury lock agreements on its balance sheet. The related gains or losses on
these transactions are deferred in stockholders’ equity as a component of
comprehensive income. These deferred gains and losses are recognized in income
in the period in which the related interest rates being hedged have been
recognized in expense. However, to the extent that the change in value of an
interest rate swap contract or treasury lock agreement does not perfectly
offset the change in the value of the interest rate being hedged, that
ineffective portion is immediately recognized in income. For the fiscal years
ended August 31, 2002, and August 25, 2001, all of our interest rate swap
contracts and treasury lock agreements were determined to be highly effective,
and no ineffective portion was recognized in income.

The Company primarily executes derivative transactions with major
financial institutions. These counterparties expose the Company to credit risk
in the event of non-performance. The amount of such exposure is limited to the
unpaid portion of amounts due to the Company pursuant to the terms of the
derivative financial instruments, if any. Although there are no collateral
requirements, if a downgrade in the credit rating of these counterparties
occurs, management believes that this exposure is mitigated by provisions in
the derivative agreements which allow for the legal right of offset of any
amounts due to the Company from the counterparties with any amounts payable to
the counterparties by the Company. As a result, management considers the risk
of counterparty default to be minimal.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards:

In October 2001, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 144, “Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” (SFAS 144). SFAS 144 supersedes
Statement No. 121, “Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of,” but retains many of its fundamental
provisions. Additionally, SFAS 144 expands the scope of discontinued
operations to include more disposal transactions. The provisions of SFAS 144
are effective for the Company’s 2003 fiscal year. The Company does not expect
the adoption of SFAS 144 to have a significant financial impact on its
Consolidated Financial Statements.

In June 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities”
(SFAS 146). SFAS 146 nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 94-3,
“Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other
Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a
Restructuring)” and requires that a liability for the cost associated with an
exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred, as
opposed to the date of an entity’s commitment to an exit plan. The provisions
of SFAS 146 are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated
after December 31, 2002. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 146
to have a significant financial impact on its Consolidated Financial
Statements.



Reclassifications:

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to
conform with the fiscal 2002 presentation.

Note B – Restructuring and Impairment Charges

In fiscal 2001, the Company recorded restructuring and impairment charges
of $156.8 million. The planned closure of 51 domestic auto parts stores and
the disposal of real estate projects in process and excess properties accounted
for the largest portion, or $56.1 million, of the charge. In fiscal 2002,
these stores were closed, and sales of certain excess properties resulted in
gains of approximately $2.6 million. Remaining excess properties are currently
being marketed for sale. During the third quarter of fiscal 2002, all
remaining excess properties were reevaluated. At that time, it was determined
that several properties could be developed. This resulted in the reversal of
accrued lease obligations totaling $6.4 million. It was also determined that
additional writedowns were needed to state remaining excess properties at fair
value. These writedowns totaled $9.0 million. Because fiscal 2002 adjustments
offset, there was no impact on net income.

Another portion of the charge, $32.0 million, related to other asset
writedowns and the accrual of lease obligations associated with the closure of
a supply depot and for the unoccupied ALLDATA office building. During the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, the ALLDATA office building was sold to a third
party. The reserve previously established was adequate to cover the loss
incurred on the sale. The Company continues to pursue the sale, sublease or
early termination of the leases associated with the remaining leased
facilities.

The Company also reserved $30.1 million for inventory rationalization,
including a provision for inventory losses in closed stores. All of the
scheduled recalls and disposals of inventory took place during fiscal 2002 and
the reserve was adequate to cover all losses incurred.

The Company recorded asset writedowns and contractual obligations
aggregating $29.9 million related to the planned sale of TruckPro, its
heavy-duty truck parts subsidiary. In December 2001, TruckPro was sold to a
group of investors for cash proceeds of $25.7 million and a promissory note.
The Company has deferred a gain on the sale of $3.6 million due to
uncertainties associated with the realization of the gain. Refer to Note K for
further discussion of this transaction.

The remainder of the restructuring and impairment charges, $8.7 million,
related to contractual obligations, severance and other charges. The Company
did not reverse any reserves into income.

Total remaining accrued obligations for restructuring charges were $18.1
million at August 31, 2002. The following table presents a summary of the
activity in accrued obligations for the restructuring charges:

Note C — Amortization of Goodwill

On August 26, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS 142. Under SFAS 142,
goodwill amortization ceased upon adoption of the new standard. Had the
application of the non-amortization provisions of SFAS 142 not been adopted,
net income would have been reduced by $5.4 million ($0.05 per share) in the
fiscal year ended August 31, 2002. The new rules also require an initial
goodwill impairment assessment in the year of adoption and annual impairment
tests thereafter. During the second quarter of fiscal 2002, the Company
performed the first of the required impairment tests of goodwill. No
impairment loss resulted from the initial goodwill impairment test, or from the
annual impairment test that was performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal
2002. The pro forma effects of the adoption of SFAS 142 on the results of
operations for periods prior to fiscal year 2002 are as follows:

Note E – Income Taxes

At August 31, 2002, the Company had federal tax net operating loss
carryforwards (NOLs) of approximately $31.3 million that expire in years 2007
through 2017. These carryforwards resulted from the Company’s acquisition of
Chief Auto Parts Inc., and ADAP, Inc. (which had been doing business as “Auto
Palace”) in fiscal 1998. The use of the federal tax NOLs is limited to future
taxable earnings of these companies and is subject to annual limitations. A
valuation allowance of $8.7 million in fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 relates to
these carryforwards. In addition, some of the Company’s subsidiaries have state
tax NOLs that expire in years 2003 through 2022. The use of the NOLs is
limited to future taxable earnings of these subsidiaries and may be subject to
annual limitations. Valuation allowances of $5.7 million in fiscal 2002 and
$6.1 million in fiscal 2001 relate to these carryforwards.

The provision for income tax expense for each of the last three fiscal
years consisted of the following:

The Company maintains $950 million of revolving credit facilities with a
group of banks. Of the $950 million, $300 million expires in May 2003. The
remaining $650 million expires in May 2005. The 364-day facility expiring in
May 2003 includes a renewal feature as well as an option to extend the maturity
date of the then-outstanding debt by one year. The credit facilities exist
largely to support commercial paper borrowings and other short term unsecured
bank loans. At August 31, 2002, outstanding commercial paper of $223.2 million
is classified as long term as the Company has the ability and intention to
refinance it on a long term basis. The rate of interest payable under the
credit facilities is a function of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR),
the lending bank’s base rate (as defined in the agreement) or a competitive bid
rate at the option of the Company. The Company has agreed to observe certain
covenants under the terms of its credit agreements, including limitations on
total indebtedness, restrictions on liens and minimum fixed charge coverage.

During the fiscal year 2001, the Company entered into $200 million and
$115 million unsecured bank term loans with a group of banks. During fiscal
2002, the $200 million two-year unsecured term loan was increased to $350
million and the maturity was extended to November
2004. The rate of interest payable is a function of LIBOR or the bank’s
base rate (as defined in the agreement) at the option of the Company.



Subsequent to year end, on October 1, 2002, the Company filed a shelf
registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This filing will
allow the Company to sell as much as $500 million in debt securities to fund
general corporate purposes, including repaying, redeeming or repurchasing
existing debt, and/or to fund working capital, capital expenditures, new store
openings, stock repurchases and acquisitions. On October 16, 2002, the Company
issued $300 million of 5.875% Senior Notes under the registration statement.
The Notes mature in October 2012, and interest is payable semi-annually on
April 15 and October 15.

All of the Company’s debt is unsecured, except for $11.6 million, which is
collateralized by property. Maturities of long-term debt are $265.0 million
for fiscal 2004, $589.5 million for fiscal 2005, $150.0 million for fiscal 2006
and $190.0 million thereafter.

The fair value of the Company’s debt was estimated at $1.22 billion as of
August 31, 2002, and $1.21 billion as of August 25, 2001, based on the market
values of the debt at those dates. Such fair value is greater than the
carrying value of debt at August 31, 2002, by $27.2 million and less than the
carrying value of debt at August 25, 2001, by $17.3 million. The Company had
$699.8 million of variable rate debt outstanding at August 31, 2002, and $730.4
million outstanding at August 25, 2001.

Note H – Stock Repurchase Program

As of August 31, 2002, the Board of Directors had authorized the Company
to repurchase up to $2.3 billion of common stock in the open market. In fiscal
2002, the Company repurchased 12.6 million shares of its common stock at an
aggregate cost of $699.0 million. Since fiscal 1998, the Company has
repurchased a total of 59.8 million shares at an aggregate cost of $1.9
billion. At times, the Company utilizes equity forward agreements to
facilitate its repurchase of common stock. At August 31, 2002, the Company
held equity forward contracts that relate to the purchase of approximately 2.2
million shares of common stock at an average cost of $68.82 per share, all of
which mature in fiscal 2003. The Company, at its option, may settle the
forward contracts in cash or common stock. The Company has historically
settled all similar contracts in cash. In accordance with the provisions of
Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 00-19, “Accounting for Derivative Financial
Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company’s Own Stock,”
these contracts qualify as equity instruments and are not reflected in the
Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Due to fluctuations in the Company’s
stock price, when the Company settles these forward contracts, the settlement
price may be above or below the market price of the underlying common stock.

Subsequent to year end, the Company purchased 1.1 million shares in
partial settlement of the forward contract outstanding at August 31, 2002, at
an average cost of $69.91 per share.



Note I – Employee Stock Plans

The Company has granted options to purchase common stock to some of its
employees and directors under various plans at prices equal to the market value
of the stock on the dates the options were granted. Options are exercisable in
a one to seven year period, and expire ten years after the grant date. A
summary of outstanding stock options is as follows:

Options to purchase 2.1 million shares at August 31, 2002, 2.9 million
shares at August 25, 2001, and 3.5 million shares at August 26, 2000, were
exercisable. Shares reserved for future grants were 4.7 million at August 31,
2002.



Pro forma information is required by SFAS 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation.” In accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123, the Company
applies APB Opinion 25 and related interpretations in accounting for its stock
option plans and, accordingly, no compensation expense for stock options has
been recognized. If the Company had elected to recognize compensation cost
based on the fair value of the options granted at the grant date as prescribed
in SFAS 123, the Company’s net income and earnings per share would have been
reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated as follows:

The effects of applying SFAS 123 and the results obtained through the use
of the Black-Scholes option pricing model in this pro forma disclosure are not
necessarily indicative of future amounts. The weighted average fair value of
the stock options granted was $16.10 per share during fiscal 2002, $10.19 per
share during fiscal 2001 and $11.92 per share during fiscal 2000. The fair
value of each option granted is estimated on the date of the grant using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average
assumptions for grants in 2002, 2001 and 2000:

Stock options that could potentially dilute basic earnings per share in
the future, that were not included in the fully diluted computation because
they would have been antidilutive, were 0.1 million shares at August 31, 2002,
and 7.5 million shares at August 26, 2000.

The Company also has an employee stock purchase plan under which all
eligible employees may purchase common stock at 85% of fair market value
(determined quarterly) through payroll deductions. Maximum permitted annual
purchases are $15,000 per employee or ten percent of compensation, whichever is
less. Under the plan, 0.1 million shares were sold in fiscal 2002, 0.2 million
shares were sold in fiscal 2001 and 0.3 million shares were sold in fiscal
2000. The Company repurchased 0.3 million shares in fiscal year 2002 and
0.2 million shares in fiscal years 2001 and 2000 for sale to employees under
the plan. At August 31, 2002, 0.7 million shares of common stock were reserved
for future issuance under this plan.



The Amended and Restated Executive Stock Purchase Plan permits senior
Company executives to purchase common stock up to 25 percent of their annual
salary and bonus after the limits under the employee stock purchase plan have
been exceeded. The Company has reserved 0.3 million shares for issuance under
the plan.

Under the Fourth Amended and Restated Directors Stock Option Plan each
non-employee director will receive an option to purchase 1,500 shares of common
stock on January 1 of each year. In addition, as long as the non-employee
director owns common stock valued at least equal to five times the value of the
annual fee paid to such director, that director will receive an additional
option to purchase 1,500 shares as of January 1 of each year. New directors
receive options to purchase 3,000 shares plus a grant of an option to purchase
a number of shares equal to the annual option grant, prorated for the time in
service for the year.

Under the Second Amended and Restated Directors Compensation Plan a
director may receive no more than one-half of the annual and meeting fees
immediately in cash, and the remainder of the fees must be taken in either
common stock or the fees deferred in units with value equivalent to the value
of a share of common stock as of the grant date (“stock appreciation rights”).

Note J – Pension and Savings Plan

Substantially all full-time employees are covered by a defined benefit
pension plan. The benefits are based on years of service and the employee’s
highest consecutive five-year average compensation. In addition, the Company
has established a supplemental defined benefit pension plan for certain highly
compensated employees.

The Company makes annual contributions in amounts at least equal to the
minimum funding requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974. The following table sets forth the plans’ funded status and amounts
recognized in the Company’s financial statements:

The actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligation was
determined using weighted average discount rates of 7.0% at August 31, 2002,
7.5% at August 25, 2001, and 8% at August 26, 2000. The assumed increases in
future compensation levels were generally 5-10% based on age in fiscal 2002,
2001 and 2000. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets
was 8.0% at August 31, 2002, and 9.5% at August 25, 2001, and August 26, 2000.
Prior service cost is amortized over the estimated average remaining service
lives of the plan participants and the unrecognized actuarial loss is amortized
over the remaining service period of 8.37 years at August 31, 2002.



The Company has also established a defined contribution plan (“401(k)
plan”) pursuant to Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. The 401(k)
plan covers substantially all employees that meet the plan’s service
requirements. The Company makes matching contributions, on an annual basis, up
to a specified percentage of employees’ contributions as approved by the Board
of Directors. The Company made matching contributions to employee accounts in
connection with the 401(k) plan of $1.4 million in fiscal years 2002 and 2001
and $1.2 million in fiscal 2000.

Note K – Sale of TruckPro Business

In December 2001, the Company’s heavy-duty truck parts business was sold
to a group of investors in exchange for cash and a six-year note. The Company
has deferred a gain of $3.6 million related to the sale due to uncertainties
associated with the realization of the gain. The Company has subleased some of
the TruckPro properties to the purchaser of the TruckPro business for an
initial term of not less than twenty years.

Note L – Leases

A portion of the Company’s retail stores, distribution centers and certain
equipment is leased. Most of these leases include renewal options and some
include options to purchase and provisions for percentage rent based on sales.
In addition, some of the leases contain guaranteed residual values.

Rental expense was $99.0 million in fiscal 2002, $100.4 million in fiscal
2001 and $95.7 million for fiscal 2000. Percentage rentals were insignificant.

Minimum annual rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases

Note M – Commitments and Contingencies

Construction commitments, primarily for new stores, totaled approximately
$16 million at August 31, 2002.

AutoZone, Inc., and several of its subsidiaries are defendants in a
lawsuit entitled “Coalition for a Level Playing Field, L.L.C.,

et al.,

v.
AutoZone, Inc., Wal-mart Stores, Inc., Advance Auto Parts, Inc., O’Reilly
Automotive, Inc., and Keystone Automotive Operations, Inc.,” filed in the U.S.
District Court for the Eastern District of New York in February 2000. The case
was filed by over 100 plaintiffs, principally automotive aftermarket warehouse
distributors and jobbers. The plaintiffs claim that the defendants have
knowingly received volume discounts, rebates, slotting and other allowances,
fees, free inventory, sham advertising and promotional payments, a share in the
manufacturers’ profits and excessive payments for services purportedly
performed for the manufacturers in violation of the Robinson-Patman Act.
Plaintiffs’ third amended and corrected complaint seeks unspecified damages
suffered by each plaintiff (prior to statutory trebling) ranging from several
million dollars to $35 million and a permanent injunction prohibiting
defendants from committing further violations of the Robinson-Patman Act and
from opening any further stores to compete with plaintiffs as long as
defendants continue to violate the Act. The litigation is currently in the
early stages of discovery. The Company does not know how the plaintiffs have
calculated their alleged damages. The Company intends to vigorously defend
against this action and believes that it has substantive defenses to all of the
claims in the complaint.

The Company currently, and from time to time, is involved in various other
legal proceedings incidental to the conduct of its business. Although the
amount of liability that may result from these proceedings cannot be
ascertained, the Company does not currently believe that, in the aggregate,
these other matters will result in liabilities material to the Company’s
financial condition or results of operations.

The Company is self-insured for workers’ compensation, automobile, general
and product liability and property losses. The Company is also self-insured
for health care claims for eligible active employees. The Company maintains
certain levels for stop loss coverage for each self-insured plan.
Self-insurance costs are accrued based upon the aggregate of the liability for
reported claims and an estimated liability for claims incurred but not
reported.



Note N – Segment Reporting

The Company manages its business on the basis of one reportable segment.
See Note A for a brief description of the Company’s business. As of August 31,
2002, the majority of the Company’s operations were located within the United
States. The Company also has operations in Mexico, however, the Mexico
operations comprise less than three percent of consolidated revenues, profit
and assets. The following data is presented in accordance with SFAS 131,
“Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information.”
