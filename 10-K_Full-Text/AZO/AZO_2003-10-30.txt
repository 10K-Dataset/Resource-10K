PART I

Item 1. Business

Introduction

We are the nation’s leading specialty retailer of automotive parts and
accessories, with most of our sales to do-it-yourself (DIY) customers. We
began operations in 1979 and at August 30, 2003, operated 3,219 auto parts
stores in the United States and 49 in Mexico. We also sell parts and
accessories online at

autozone.com

. Each of our stores carries an extensive
product line for cars, sport utility vehicles, vans and light trucks, including
new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items and
accessories. We also have a commercial sales program in the United States (AZ
Commercial) that provides commercial credit and prompt delivery of parts and
other products to local, regional and national repair garages, dealers and
service stations. We do not derive revenue from automotive repair or
installation.

In addition, we sell the ALLDATA automotive diagnostic and repair software
which is also available through

alldatapro.com

and

alldatadiy.com

.

At August 30, 2003, our stores were in the following locations:

Marketing and Merchandising Strategy

We are dedicated to providing customers with superior service, value and
quality automotive parts and products at conveniently located, well-designed
stores. Key elements of this strategy are:

Customer Service

We believe that our customers value customer service; therefore, customer
service is the most important element in our marketing and merchandising
strategy. We emphasize that our AutoZoners (employees) should always put
customers first by providing prompt, courteous service and trustworthy advice.
Our electronic parts catalog assists in the selection of parts and lifetime
warranties are offered on many of the parts we sell. Our satellite system in
our domestic auto parts stores helps us to expedite credit or debit card and
check approval processes and locate parts at neighboring AutoZone stores.

Our stores generally open at 8 a.m. and close between 8 and 10 p.m. Monday
through Saturday and typically open at 9 a.m. and close between 6 and 8 p.m. on
Sunday. Some stores are open 24 hours, and some have extended hours of 7 a.m.
until midnight seven days a week.

We also provide specialty tools through our Loan-A-Tool program. Customers
can borrow a specialty tool, such as a steering wheel puller, for which a DIY
customer or a small repair shop would have little or no use other than for a
single job. AutoZoners also provide other free services, including check
engine light readings; battery charging and installation assistance; oil
recycling; and testing of starters, alternators, batteries, sensors and
actuators.

We believe that the satisfaction of DIY customers and professional
technicians often is impacted by our ability to provide specific automotive
products as requested. Our stores generally offer between 21,000 and 23,000
stock keeping units (“SKUs”), covering a broad range of vehicle types. Each
store carries the same basic product line, but we tailor our parts inventory to
the makes and models of the automobiles in each store’s trade area. Our hub
stores carry a larger assortment of products that can be delivered to AZ
Commercial customers or local satellite stores. Slower-selling products are
generally available through our vendor direct program (VDP) which offers
overnight delivery.

We are constantly updating the products that we offer to assure that our
inventory matches the products that our customers want, when they want them.

Pricing

We want to be perceived by our customers as the value leader in our
industry by consistently providing quality merchandise at a good price, backed
by a good warranty and outstanding customer service. On many of our products we
offer multiple value choices in a good/better/best assortment, with appropriate
price and quality increases from the “good” products to the “better” and “best”
products. We believe that our overall prices compare favorably to those of our
competitors.



Marketing

We believe that targeted advertising and marketing play important roles in
succeeding in today’s environment. We are constantly working to understand our
customers’ wants and needs so that we can build long-lasting, loyal
relationships. We utilize marketing and advertising primarily to educate
customers about the overall importance of vehicle maintenance. We also seek to
convey the message that AutoZone is THE brand that can provide “the most
exciting Zone for vehicle solutions!” Broadcast and print media are designed
primarily to increase store traffic. In-store signage and creative product
placement help to educate customers about products they need as a means to
increase average sales dollars per transaction.

Store Design and Visual Merchandising

We design and build stores for a high visual impact. The typical AutoZone
store has an industrial “high tech” appearance by utilizing colorful exterior
and interior signage, exposed beams and ductwork and brightly lighted
interiors. Maintenance products, accessories and miscellaneous items are
attractively displayed for easy browsing by customers. In-store signage and
special displays promote products in floor displays, endcaps and on the shelf.
Store managers are able to customize areas of the store to prominently display
products that are in demand in the local community.

AZ Commercial

We believe we are the third largest aftermarket seller of automotive parts
and products to repair shops in the United States. AZ Commercial is our program
that sells parts and other products to local, regional and national repair
garages, dealers and service stations. As a part of the program we offer
credit and delivery to some of our commercial customers. The program operated
out of 1,941 stores as of August 30, 2003. Through our hub stores, we offer a
greater range of parts and products desired by professional technicians and can
also be used as additional available inventory for local stores. In addition,
some of our commercial customers receive shipments directly from our
distribution centers. AZ Commercial has a national sales team focused on
national and regional commercial accounts, as well as an outside sales force
for customers located immediately around our commercial stores.



Store Operations

Store Formats

As of August 30, 2003, we had domestic auto parts stores in the following
square footage ranges:

Square Footage

Number of Stores

Less than 4,000


4,000 to 7,000

1,788

More than 7,000

1,154

Substantially all AutoZone stores are based on standard store formats
resulting in generally consistent appearance, merchandising and product mix.
Approximately 85% to 90% of each store’s square footage is selling space, of
which approximately 40% to 45% is dedicated to hard parts inventory. The hard
parts inventory area is generally fronted by a counter or pods that run the
depth or length of the store, dividing the hard parts area from the remainder
of the store. The remaining selling space contains displays of accessories and
maintenance items.

We have knowledgeable AutoZoners available to assist customers with their
parts needs utilizing our proprietary electronic parts catalog with a display
screen that is visible to both the AutoZoner and the customer. In addition to
helping ensure fast, accurate parts lookup, the parts catalog will suggest
additional items that a customer should purchase in order to properly install
the merchandise being purchased.

We believe that our stores are “destination stores,” generating their own
traffic rather than relying on traffic created by adjacent stores. Therefore,
we situate most stores on major thoroughfares with easy access and good
parking. Approximately 2,600 of our auto parts stores are freestanding, with
the balance principally located within strip shopping centers. Freestanding
large format stores typically have parking for approximately 40 to 45 cars on a
lot of approximately 3/4 to one acre. Our smaller stores typically have
parking for approximately 20 to 30 cars and are usually located on a lot of
approximately 1/2 to 3/4 acre.

Store Personnel and Training

Each auto parts store typically employs from 10 to 16 AutoZoners,
including a manager and, in some cases, an assistant manager. AutoZoners
typically have prior automotive experience. All AutoZoners are encouraged to
complete courses resulting in certification by the National Institute for
Automotive Service Excellence (ASE), which is broadly recognized for training
certification in the automotive industry. Although we do on-the-job training,
we also provide formal training programs, including regular store meetings on
specific sales and product issues, standardized training manuals and a
specialist program that trains AutoZoners in several areas of technical
expertise from both the Company and from independent certification agencies.
Training is supplemented with frequent store visits by management.



Store managers receive financial incentives through performance-based
bonuses. In addition, our growth has provided opportunities for the promotion
of qualified AutoZoners. We believe these opportunities are important to
attract, motivate and retain quality AutoZoners.

Our domestic auto parts stores are primarily supervised through district
managers who oversee approximately 10 to 12 stores each and who report to
regional managers. Regional managers with approximately 80 to 90 stores each,
in turn, report to five Vice Presidents of Operations.

All store support functions are centralized in our store support center in
Memphis, Tennessee. We believe that this centralization enhances consistent
execution of our merchandising and marketing strategies at the store level,
while reducing expenses and cost of sales.

Store Automation

All of our stores have a proprietary electronic parts catalog that
provides parts information based on the make, model and year of an automobile.
The catalog display screens are placed on the hard parts counter or pods where
both AutoZoners and customers can view the screen. In addition, our satellite
system enables the stores to expedite credit or debit card and check approval
processes, immediately access national warranty data, implement real-time
inventory controls and locate and hold parts at neighboring AutoZone stores.

Our domestic auto parts stores utilize our computerized Store Management
System, which includes bar code scanning and point-of-sale data collection
terminals. The Store Management System provides administrative assistance and
improved personnel scheduling at the store level, as well as enhanced
merchandising information and improved inventory control. We believe the Store
Management System also enhances customer service through faster processing of
transactions and simplified warranty and product return procedures.

Store Development

The following table reflects domestic auto parts store development during
the past five fiscal years:

We believe that expansion opportunities exist both in markets that we do
not currently serve, and in markets where we can achieve a larger presence. We
attempt to obtain high visibility sites in high traffic locations and undertake
substantial research prior to entering new markets. The most important criteria
for opening a new store are its projected future profitability and its ability
to achieve our required investment hurdle rate. Key factors in selecting new
site and market locations include population, demographics, vehicle profile,
number and strength of competitors’ stores and the cost of real estate. In
reviewing the vehicle profile, we also consider the number of vehicles that are
seven years old and older, “our kind of vehicles” (OKVs), as these are no
longer under the original manufacturers’ warranty and will require more
maintenance and repair than younger vehicles. We generally seek to open new
stores within or contiguous to existing market areas and attempt to cluster
development in new urban markets in a relatively short period of time to
achieve economies of scale in distribution and marketing costs. In addition to
continuing to lease or develop our own stores, we may occasionally evaluate
potential acquisition candidates.

Purchasing and Supply Chain

Merchandise is selected and purchased for all stores through our store
support center in Memphis, Tennessee. No one class of product accounts for as
much as 10 percent of our total sales. In fiscal 2003, no single supplier
accounted for more than 10 percent of our total purchases. We generally have
few long-term contracts for the purchase of merchandise. We believe that we
have excellent relationships with suppliers. We also believe that alternative
sources of supply exist, at similar cost, for substantially all types of
product sold.

Our vendors ship substantially all of our merchandise to our distribution
centers. Stores typically place orders on a weekly basis with merchandise
shipped from the warehouse generally within 24 hours of receipt of the order.

Our hub stores have increased our ability to distribute products on a
timely basis to each store. A hub store is able to provide replenishment of
sold products and deliver special order products to a store in its coverage
area generally within 24 hours. Hub stores are replenished from distribution
centers multiple times per week.

Competition

The sale of automotive parts, accessories and maintenance items is highly
competitive in many areas, including name recognition, product availability,
customer service, store location and price. AutoZone competes in both the
retail (DIY) and commercial (do it for me, “DIFM”) auto parts and accessories
markets.

Competitors include national and regional auto parts chains, independently
owned parts stores, wholesalers and jobbers, car washes and auto dealers, in
addition to discount and mass merchandise stores, department stores, hardware
stores,
supermarkets, drugstores and home



stores that sell aftermarket vehicle parts
and supplies, chemicals, accessories, tools and maintenance parts. AutoZone
competes on the basis of customer service, including the trustworthy advice of
our AutoZoners, merchandise selection and availability, price, product
warranty, store layouts and location.

Trademarks and Patents

We have registered several service marks and trademarks in the United
States Patent and Trademark office as well as in other countries, including our
service marks, “AutoZone” and “Get in the Zone,” and trademarks, “AutoZone,”
“Duralast,” “Duralast Gold,” “Valucraft,” and “ALLDATA.” We believe that the
“AutoZone” service marks and trademarks are important components of our
merchandising and marketing strategy.

Employees

As of August 30, 2003, we employed approximately 48,000 persons in the
U.S., approximately 60 percent of whom were employed full-time. About 90
percent of our AutoZoners were employed in stores or in direct field
supervision, approximately 7 percent in distribution centers and approximately
3 percent in store support functions. We employed approximately 700 persons in
our Mexico operations.

We have never experienced any material labor disruption and believe that
relations with our AutoZoners are generally good.

AutoZone Website

AutoZone’s primary website is at http://www.autozone.com. We make
available, free of charge, at our corporate website our annual report on Form
10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and
amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or
15(d) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as soon as
reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or
furnish it to, the SEC.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

AutoZone, Inc., was one of multiple defendants in a lawsuit entitled
“Coalition for a Level Playing Field, L.L.C.,

et al.,

v. AutoZone, Inc.,

et
al.

” filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York in
February 2000. The case was brought by approximately 225 plaintiffs, which are
principally automotive aftermarket warehouse distributors and jobbers. The
plaintiffs claimed that the defendants knowingly received volume discounts,
rebates, slotting and other allowances, fees, free inventory, sham advertising
and promotional payments, a share in the manufacturers’ profits, and excessive
payments for services purportedly performed for the manufacturers in violation
of the Robinson-Patman Act. Plaintiffs sought unspecified damages (prior to
statutory trebling), ranging from several million dollars to $35 million for
each plaintiff, and a permanent injunction prohibiting defendants from
committing further violations of the Robinson-Patman Act and from opening any
further stores to compete with plaintiffs as long as defendants continue to
violate the Act. The claims of 22 of the original plaintiffs were tried to a
jury verdict in favor of AutoZone in January 2003. On February 26, 2003, the
plaintiffs, involved in the trial, filed a notice to appeal. The U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit will hear oral argument on the appeal
on November 5, 2003. On July 22, 2003, approximately 200 plaintiffs in the
original lawsuit, whose cases had been dismissed without prejudice and with
leave to reinstate their claims, filed a notice to be reactivated as parties in
the lawsuit and for their claims against the defendants to be reinstated.
While the outcome of this matter cannot be predicted, AutoZone intends to
vigorously defend against it. On September 19, 2003, the previously dismissed
plaintiffs filed a “Motion for a Preliminary Injunction (and Related Temporary
Restraining Order) Against the AutoZone Defendants as to Payment On Scan
Transactions with the Auto Parts Manufacturers.” AutoZone is currently unable
to determine the merits of the motion or the claims of the plaintiffs.
However, AutoZone intends to vigorously defend against the motion.

AutoZone is also involved in various other legal proceedings incidental to
the conduct of our business. Although the amount of liability that may result
from these other proceedings cannot be ascertained, we do not currently believe
that, in the aggregate, they will result in liabilities material to our
financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

Item 4. Submission of Matters
to a Vote of Security Holders

None.



PART II

Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Stock and Related Stockholder Matters

AutoZone’s common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the
symbol “AZO.” On October 14, 2003, there were 3,212 stockholders of record,
which does not include the number of beneficial owners whose shares were
represented by security position listings.

We currently do not pay a cash dividend on our common stock. Any payment
of dividends in the future would be dependent upon our financial condition,
capital requirements, earnings, cash flow and other factors.

The following table sets forth the high and low sales prices per share of
common stock, as reported by the New York Stock Exchange, for the periods
indicated:

The third quarter of fiscal 2003 includes a $4.7 million pre-tax gain associated with the
settlement of certain liabilities and the repayment of a note associated with the sale of the
TruckPro business in December 2001. The third quarter of fiscal 2003 also includes a $3 million
pre-tax negative impact of the adoption of Emerging Task Force Issue No. 02-16 regarding vendor
funding that resulted in an increase to operating expenses by $16 million and an increase to gross
margin by $13 million.

(2)

The fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 includes a $4.6 million pre-tax gain as a result of the
disposition of properties associated with the fiscal 2001 restructure and impairment charges. The
fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 also includes a $7 million pre-tax negative impact of the adoption
of Emerging Task Force Issue No. 02-16 regarding vendor funding that resulted in an increase to
operating expenses by $37 million and an increase to gross
margin by $30 million.



Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations

Results of Operations

For an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our
performance during the past three fiscal years, this financial review should be
read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements presented in
this Form 10-K.

Fiscal 2003 Compared with Fiscal 2002

For the year ended August 30, 2003, AutoZone reported sales of $5.457
billion (52 weeks) compared with $5.326 billion (53 weeks) for the year ended
August 31, 2002, a 2.5% increase from fiscal 2002. At August 30, 2003, we
operated 3,219 domestic auto parts stores and 49 in Mexico, compared with 3,068
domestic auto parts stores and 39 in Mexico at August 31, 2002. Excluding
sales from the extra week included in the prior year, sales were up 4.6% (see
Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures). Same store sales, or sales for
domestic stores open at least one year, increased approximately 3% during the
year, including flat retail same store sales and an increase for commercial
sales in same stores by approximately 27%. The improvement in same store
sales was due more to an increase in average dollars spent per transaction over
the amounts in the same period of the prior year than an increase in customer
count. The balance, of the increase of 4.6%, was due to new store sales for
fiscal 2003 which contributed 1.9 percentage points of the increase; ALLDATA
and Mexico sales which contributed 0.5 percentage points of the increase, while
TruckPro sales in the prior year of $47.6 million reduced the increase by 0.9
percentage points.

Gross profit for fiscal 2003 was $2.515 billion, or 46.1% of net sales,
compared with $2.375 billion, or 44.6% of net sales for fiscal 2002.
Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2003
decreased to $1.597 billion, or 29.3% of net sales, from $1.604 billion, or
30.1% of sales for fiscal 2002. For fiscal 2003, gross profit, as a percentage
of sales, improved by 1.5 percentage points, while operating expenses, as a
percentage of sales, declined by 0.8 percentage points. Operating profit for
fiscal 2003 increased 19% over the prior year.

Gross profit, operating expenses and operating profit for fiscal years
2003 and 2002 were impacted by the following non-recurring or infrequent items:

•

For fiscal 2003, a $4.6 million pre-tax gain as a result of the
disposition of properties associated with the fiscal 2001 restructuring
and impairment charges

•

For fiscal 2003, a $10.0 million pre-tax negative impact and the
reclassification of certain vendor funding to increase operating
expenses by $53 million and decrease cost of goods sold by $43
million, both as a result of the adoption of Emerging Issues Task Force
Issue No. 02-16 regarding vendor funding

•

For fiscal 2003, a $4.7 million pre-tax gain associated with the
settlement of certain liabilities and the repayment of a note
associated with the fiscal 2002 sale of the TruckPro business



•

For fiscal 2002, the favorable impact of the additional week of the
53 week fiscal year

For fiscal 2003, excluding the above items, gross profit, as a percentage
of sales, improved by 0.7 percentage points while operating expenses, as a
percentage of sales, declined by 1.9 percentage points. Comparable operating
profit for fiscal 2003 increased by 23.9%, as operating margin improved 2.6
percentage points to 16.8% from 14.2% last year (see Reconciliation of Non-GAAP
Financial Measures). The improvements in gross profit and gross margin reflect
the additive impact of new merchandise, a reduction in our product warranty
expense, and the benefit of more strategic and disciplined pricing derived from
our category management system. Improvements, in operating profit and
operating margin, reflect our relentless expense discipline, in particular, the
leveraging of salaries and information technology spending during fiscal 2003.

Net interest expense for fiscal 2003 was $84.8 million compared with $79.9
million during fiscal 2002. The increase in interest expense for fiscal 2003
was primarily due to higher levels of debt compared with the 2002 fiscal year.
Weighted-average borrowings for fiscal 2003 were $1.51 billion, compared with
$1.33 billion for fiscal 2002; and, weighted-average borrowing rates, excluding
the impact of debt amortization and facility fees, remained relatively flat at
4.4% for both fiscal years.

AutoZone’s effective income tax rate declined slightly to 37.9% of pretax
income for fiscal 2003 as compared to 38.1% for fiscal 2002

.

Net income for fiscal 2003 increased by 20.9% to $517.6 million, and
diluted earnings per share increased by 33.5% to $5.34 from $4.00 reported for
the year-ago period. Excluding the non-recurring, infrequent items listed
above, comparable net income increased 26.4% and diluted earnings per share
increased 39.4% (see Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures). The
impact of the fiscal 2003 stock repurchases on diluted earnings per share in
fiscal 2003 was an increase of $0.19.

Fiscal 2002 Compared with Fiscal 2001

Net sales for fiscal 2002 increased by $507.3 million, or 10.5%, over net
sales for fiscal 2001. At August 31, 2002, we operated 3,068 domestic auto
parts stores and 39 in Mexico, compared with 3,019 domestic auto parts stores,
21 in Mexico and 49 TruckPro stores at August 25, 2001. Excluding sales from
the extra week in fiscal 2002, net sales increased 8.3% (see Reconciliation of
Non-GAAP Financial Measures). Same store sales, or sales for domestic stores
open at least one year, increased approximately 9% during fiscal 2002,
including an increase in retail same store sales of approximately 8% and an
increase for commercial sales in same stores by approximately 17%. Comparable
store sales increased in fiscal 2002 as a result of an increase in customer
count and an increase in average dollars spent per transaction over the
amounts in the 2001 fiscal year. New stores contributed approximately 2
percentage points to the increase during fiscal 2002; whereas, the overall
sales increase was somewhat offset by the decrease in sales associated with
TruckPro, which was sold in December 2001, of $47.6 million



in fiscal 2002 and $148.5 million in fiscal 2001. ALLDATA and Mexico sales composed the remainder
of the increase in sales during fiscal 2002.

Gross profit for fiscal 2002 was $2.375 billion, or 44.6 % of net sales,
compared with $2.013 billion, or 41.8% of net sales for fiscal 2001. Excluding
the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2002 and the nonrecurring charges in
fiscal 2001, gross profit for fiscal 2002 was $2.325 billion, or 44.6% of net
sales, compared with $2.043 billion, or 42.4% of net sales for fiscal 2001 (see
Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures). Gross margin improvement for
fiscal 2002 reflected lower product costs, more efficient supply chain costs,
reduced inventory shrinkage, the benefits of more strategic and disciplined
pricing due to category management and the addition of more value-added,
high-margin merchandise than in the 2001 fiscal year.

Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2002
increased by $105.5 million over such expenses for fiscal 2001 but declined as
a percentage of net sales from 31.1% to 30.1%. The improved ratio reflected
the fact that revenues rose more rapidly than the growth of store-level
expenses (a 1.1 percentage point improvement), combined with operating savings
resulting from the restructuring in fiscal 2001 related to controlling
staffing, base salaries and technology spending of 0.4 percentage points.
Additionally, the 2001 fiscal year included other expenses related to strategic
initiatives not included in the restructuring and impairment charges of 0.3
percentage points. The adoption of new accounting rules for goodwill reduced
operating expenses in fiscal 2002 by approximately $8.6 million, or 0.2
percentage points. These improvements in the expense ratio were partially
offset by additional bonus, legal, pension and insurance expenses incurred in
the 2002 fiscal year of 1.1 percentage points.

Net interest expense for fiscal 2002 was $79.9 million compared with
$100.7 million during fiscal 2001. The decrease in interest expense for fiscal
2002 was primarily due to lower levels of debt compared with the 2001 fiscal
year and lower average borrowing rates. Weighted average borrowings for fiscal
2002 were $1.33 billion, compared with $1.45 billion for fiscal 2001.
Additionally, weighted average borrowing rates, excluding the impact of debt
amortization and facility fees, were lower in the 2002 year compared with the
2001 fiscal year at 4.4% compared with 6.2%.

AutoZone’s effective income tax rate was 38.1% of pretax income for fiscal
2002 and 38.8% for fiscal 2001. The decrease in the tax rate is due primarily
to the change in goodwill accounting.

Net income for fiscal 2002 increased to $428.1 million from $175.5 and
diluted earnings per share increased to $4.00 from $1.54 reported for fiscal
2001. Excluding the positive impact of the extra week in fiscal 2002 and the
restructuring and impairment charges from fiscal 2001, comparable net income
for fiscal 2002 increased to $409.9 million from $271.3 million for fiscal
2001; and diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2002 increased to $3.83 from
$2.38 for fiscal 2001 (see Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures).
The impact of the
fiscal 2002 stock repurchases on diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2002 was
an increase of $0.16.



Inflation

AutoZone does not believe its operations have been materially affected by
inflation. We have been successful, in many cases, in mitigating the effects
of merchandise cost increases principally through efficiencies gained through
economies of scale, selective forward buying and the use of alternative
suppliers.

Seasonality and Quarterly Periods

AutoZone’s business is somewhat seasonal in nature, with the highest sales
occurring in the summer months of June through August, in which average weekly
per-store sales historically have been about 15% to 25% higher than in the
slower months of December through February. During short periods of time, a
store’s sales can be affected by weather conditions. Extremely hot or
extremely cold weather may enhance sales by causing parts to fail and spurring
sales of seasonal products. Mild or rainy weather tends to soften sales as
parts failure rates are lower in mild weather and elective maintenance is
deferred during periods of rainy weather. Over the longer term, the effects of
weather balance out, as we have stores throughout the United States.

Each of the first three quarters of AutoZone’s fiscal year consists of 12
weeks, and the fourth quarter consists of 16 weeks (17 weeks in fiscal 2002).
Because the fourth quarter contains the seasonally high sales volume and
consists of 16 weeks (17 weeks in fiscal 2002), compared with 12 weeks for each
of the first three quarters, our fourth quarter represents a disproportionate
share of the annual net sales and net income. The fourth quarter of fiscal
2003 represented 33.5% of annual net sales and 40.1% of net income; the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2002, represented 34.6% of annual net sales and 41.6% of net
income. Fiscal 2002 consisted of 53 weeks, with the fiscal fourth quarter
including 17 weeks. Accordingly, the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 included
the benefit of an additional week of net sales of $109.1 million and net income
of $18.3 million.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Net cash provided by operating activities was $698.3 million in fiscal
2003, $739.1 million in fiscal 2002 and $458.9 million in fiscal 2001. Cash
flow generated from store operations provides us with a significant source of
liquidity. Our new-store development program requires working capital,
predominantly for inventories. During the past three fiscal year periods, we
have improved our accounts payable to inventory ratio to 87% at August 30,
2003, from 83% at August 31, 2002, and 76% at August 25, 2001. In each of the
three year periods, the improvement in this ratio was a source of cash from
operations, particularly in fiscal 2002 when the ratio increased 7 percentage
points. The increase in merchandise inventories,
required to support new-store development and sales growth, has largely
been financed by our vendors, as evidenced by the higher accounts payable to
inventory ratio.



AutoZone’s primary capital requirement has been the funding of its
continued new store development program. From the beginning of fiscal 1999 to
August 30, 2003, we have opened 562 net new domestic auto parts stores. Net
cash flows used in investing activities were $167.8 million in fiscal 2003,
compared with $64.5 million in fiscal 2002 and $122.1 million in fiscal 2001.
The increase in cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2003 as
compared to fiscal 2002 is due primarily to increased store development
activities in the current year and proceeds from the sale of the TruckPro
business in the prior year. We invested $182.2 million in capital assets in
fiscal 2003 compared with $117.2 million in fiscal 2002 and $169.3 million in
fiscal 2001. New store openings in the U.S. were 160 for fiscal 2003, 102 for
fiscal 2002 and 107 for fiscal 2001. During fiscal 2002, we sold TruckPro, our
heavy-duty truck parts subsidiary, which operated 49 stores, for cash proceeds
of $25.7 million. Proceeds from capital asset disposals totaled $14.4 million
for fiscal 2003, $25.1 million for fiscal 2002 and $44.6 million for fiscal
2001.

Net cash used in financing activities was $530.2 million in fiscal 2003,
$675.4 million in fiscal 2002 and $336.5 million in fiscal 2001. The net cash
used in financing activities is primarily attributable to purchases of treasury
stock which totaled $891.1 million for fiscal 2003, $699.0 million for fiscal
2002 and $366.1 million for fiscal 2001. Fiscal 2003 net proceeds from the
issuance of debt securities, including repayments on other debt and the net
change in commercial paper borrowings, offset the increased level of treasury
stock purchases by approximately $322 million.

We expect to open approximately 195 new stores during fiscal 2004. Our
new-store development program requires working capital, predominantly for
inventories. Historically, we have negotiated extended payment terms from
suppliers, reducing the working capital required by expansion. We believe that
we will be able to continue to finance much of our inventory requirements
through favorable payment terms from suppliers.

Depending on the timing and magnitude of our future investments (either in
the form of leased or purchased properties or acquisitions), we anticipate that
we will rely primarily on internally generated funds to support a majority of
our capital expenditures, working capital requirements and stock repurchases.
The balance will be funded through borrowings. We anticipate that we will be
able to obtain such financing in view of our credit rating and favorable
experiences in the debt markets in the past.

Credit Ratings

At August 30, 2003, AutoZone had a senior unsecured debt credit rating
from Standard & Poor’s of BBB+ and a commercial paper rating of A-2. Moody’s
Investors Service had assigned us a senior unsecured debt credit rating of Baa2
and a commercial paper rating of P-2. As of August 30, 2003, both Moody’s and
Standard & Poor’s had AutoZone listed as having a “stable” outlook. Subsequent
to the 2003 fiscal year end, Moody’s changed our outlook to “negative,” while
confirming AutoZone’s existing credit ratings. If our credit ratings drop, our
interest expense may increase; similarly, we anticipate that our interest expense
may decrease if our investment ratings are raised. If our commercial paper
ratings drop below current levels, we may have difficulty continuing to utilize
the commercial paper market and our interest expense will



increase, as we will then be required to access more expensive bank lines of credit.
If our senior unsecured debt ratings drop below investment grade, our access to financing may
become more limited.

Debt Facilities

We maintain $950 million of revolving credit facilities with a group of
banks. Of the $950 million, $300 million expires in May 2004. The remaining
$650 million expires in May 2005. The portion expiring in May 2004 includes a
renewal feature as well as an option to extend the maturity date of the
then-outstanding debt by one year. The credit facilities exist largely to
support commercial paper borrowings and other short term unsecured bank loans.
At August 30, 2003, outstanding commercial paper of $268 million, the 6% Notes
due November 2003 of $150 million and other debt of $2.7 million are classified
as long term, as we have the ability and intention to refinance them on a long
term basis. The rate of interest payable under the credit facilities is a
function of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), the lending bank’s base
rate (as defined in the agreement) or a competitive bid rate at our option. We
have agreed to observe certain covenants under the terms of our credit
agreements, including limitations on total indebtedness, restrictions on liens
and minimum fixed charge coverage. As of August 30, 2003, we are in compliance
with all covenants.

On October 16, 2002, we issued $300 million of 5.875% Senior Notes. The
notes mature in October 2012, and interest is payable semi-annually on April 15
and October 15. A portion of the proceeds from these senior notes was used to
prepay a $115 million unsecured bank term loan due December 2003, to repay a
portion of our outstanding commercial paper borrowings, and to settle interest
rate hedges associated with the issuance and repayment of the related debt
securities. On June 3, 2003, we issued $200 million of 4.375% Senior Notes.
These senior notes mature in June 2013, and interest is payable semi-annually
on June 1 and December 1. The proceeds were used to repay a portion of our
outstanding commercial paper borrowings, to prepay $100 million of the $350
million unsecured bank loan due November 2004, and to settle interest rate
hedges associated with the issuance of the debt securities.

On August 8, 2003, we filed a shelf registration with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, which was declared effective on August 22, 2003. This
filing will allow us to sell up to $500 million in debt securities to fund
general corporate purposes, including repaying, redeeming or repurchasing
outstanding debt, and for working capital, capital expenditures, new store
openings, stock repurchases and acquisitions. No debt had been issued under
this registration statement as of August 30, 2003.

All of the repayment obligations under our bank lines of credit may be
accelerated and come due prior to the scheduled payment date if AutoZone
experiences a change in control (as defined in the agreements) of AutoZone or
its Board of Directors or if covenants are breached related to total
indebtedness and minimum fixed charge coverage. We expect to remain in
compliance with these covenants.



Stock Repurchases

As of August 30, 2003, our Board of Directors had authorized the
repurchase of up to $3.3 billion of common stock in the open market. From
January 1998 to August 30, 2003, approximately $2.8 billion of common stock had
been repurchased. During fiscal 2003, we repurchased $891.1 million of common
stock.

At times in the past, we utilized equity forward agreements to facilitate
our repurchase of common stock. There were no outstanding equity forward
agreements for share repurchases as of August 30, 2003. At August 31, 2002, we
held equity forward agreements, which were settled in cash during fiscal 2003,
for the purchase of approximately 2.2 million shares of common stock at an
average cost of $68.82 per share. Such obligations under equity forward
agreements at August 31, 2002, were not reflected on our balance sheet.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

The above table reflects the outstanding letters of credit and surety
bonds as of August 30, 2003. A substantial portion of the outstanding standby
letters of credit (which are primarily



renewed on an annual basis) and surety
bonds are used to cover reimbursement obligations to our workers’ compensation
carriers. There are no additional contingent liabilities associated with them
as the underlying liabilities are already reflected in our balance sheet. The
letters of credit and surety bonds arrangements have automatic renewal clauses.

In conjunction with our commercial sales program, we offer credit to some
of our commercial customers. The receivables related to the credit program are
sold to a third party at a discount for cash with limited recourse. AutoZone
has recorded a reserve for this recourse. At August 30, 2003, the receivables
facility had an outstanding balance of $42.1 million and the balance of the
recourse reserve was $2.6 million.

Guarantee and Indemnification Arrangements

During fiscal 2003, AutoZone adopted the provisions of Financial
Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 45, “Guarantor’s Accounting and
Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of
Indebtedness of Others” (FIN 45). Effective for interim and annual periods
ending after December 15, 2002, FIN 45 elaborates on the disclosures that must
be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its
obligations under certain guarantees and indemnities. It also clarifies that a
guarantor is required to recognize the fair value of guarantee and
indemnification arrangements issued or modified by AutoZone after December 31,
2002, if these arrangements are within the scope of FIN 45. The adoption of
FIN 45 did not have a significant impact on AutoZone’s Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Critical Accounting Policies

Product Warranties

Limited warranties on certain products that range from 30 days to lifetime
warranties are provided to our customers by AutoZone or the vendors supplying
its products. Warranty costs relating to merchandise sold under warranty not
covered by vendors are estimated and recorded as warranty obligations at the
time of sale based on each product’s historical return rate. We periodically
assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liability and adjust the amount as
necessary.

Litigation and Other Contingent Liabilities

We have received claims related to and been notified that we are a
defendant in a number of legal proceedings resulting from our business, such as
employment matters, product liability, general liability related to our store
premises and alleged violation of the Robinson-Patman Act (as specifically
described in Note M in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).
Generally, we calculate contingent loss accruals using our best estimate of our
probable and reasonably estimable contingent liabilities, such as lawsuits and
our retained liability for insured claims.



Vendor Allowances

AutoZone receives various payments and allowances from its vendors based
on the volume of purchases or for services that AutoZone provides to the
vendors. Monies received from vendors include rebates, allowances and
promotional funds. Typically these funds are dependent on purchase volumes and
advertising plans. The amounts to be received are subject to changes in market
conditions, vendor marketing strategies and changes in the profitability or
sell-through of the related merchandise for AutoZone.

Rebates and other miscellaneous incentives are earned based on purchases
or product sales. These monies are treated as a reduction of inventories and
are recognized as a reduction to cost of sales as the inventories are sold.

Certain vendor allowances are used exclusively for promotions and to
partially or fully offset certain other direct expenses. Such vendor funding
arrangements, that were entered into on or before December 31, 2002, were
recognized as a reduction to selling, general and administrative expenses when
earned. However, for such vendor funding arrangements entered into or modified
after December 31, 2002, AutoZone applied the new guidance pursuant to the
Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 02-16, “Accounting by a Customer
(including a Reseller) for Cash Consideration Received from a Vendor” (EITF
Issue No. 02-16). Accordingly, all such vendor funds are recognized as a
reduction to cost of sales as the inventories are sold.

The new accounting pronouncement for vendor funding does not impact the
way AutoZone runs its business or its relationships with vendors. It does,
however, require the deferral of certain vendor funding which is calculated
based upon vendor inventory turns. Based on the timing of the issuance of
the pronouncement and guidelines, we were precluded from adopting EITF Issue
No. 02-16 as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. Our
timing and accounting treatment of EITF Issue No. 02-16 was not discretionary.

Impairments

In accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets” (SFAS 144), we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amounts of
long lived assets, such as property and equipment, covered by this standard
whenever events or changes in circumstances dictate that the carrying value may
not be recoverable. As part of the evaluation, we review performance at the
store level to identify any stores with current period operating losses that
should be considered for impairment. We compare the sum of the undiscounted
expected future cash flows with the carrying amounts of the assets.

Under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” (SFAS 142), we perform an annual
test of goodwill to compare the estimated fair value of goodwill to the
carrying amount to determine if any impairment exists. We perform the annual
impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, unless
circumstances dictate more frequent assessments.

If impairments are indicated by either of the above evaluations, the
amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the
assets is recognized as an impairment



loss. Such evaluations require
management to make certain assumptions based upon information available at the
time the evaluation is performed, which could differ from actual results.

Restructuring and Impairment Charges

In fiscal 2001, AutoZone recorded restructuring and impairment charges of
$156.8 million, including restructuring accruals of $29.6 million. The accrued
obligations for restructuring charges totaled approximately $12.5 million at
August 30, 2003, and $18.1 million at August 31, 2002. The original charges
and activity in the restructuring accruals is described more fully in Note L in
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

During fiscal 2002, we reevaluated remaining excess properties related to
the fiscal 2001 impairment charges and determined that several properties could
be developed. This resulted in the reversal of accrued lease obligations
totaling $6.4 million. We also determined that additional writedowns of $9.0
million were needed to state remaining excess properties at fair value. In
addition, we recognized $2.6 million of gains in fiscal 2002 as a result of
closing certain stores associated with the restructuring and impairment charges
in fiscal 2001. During fiscal 2003, AutoZone recognized $4.6 million of gains
as a result of the disposition of properties associated with the restructuring
and impairment charges in fiscal 2001.

Included in the fiscal 2001 impairment and restructure charges were asset
writedowns and contractual obligations aggregating $29.9 million related to the
planned sale of TruckPro, our heavy-duty truck parts subsidiary. In December
2001, TruckPro was sold to a group of investors for cash proceeds of $25.7
million and a promissory note. A deferred gain of $3.6 million was recorded as
part of the sale due to uncertainties associated with the realization of the
gain. During fiscal 2003, the note was paid and certain liabilities were
settled. As a result, a total pre-tax gain of $4.7 million was recognized in
income during fiscal 2003 as part of operating, selling, general and
administrative expenses.

No other significant gains or charges are anticipated under the fiscal
2001 restructuring plan.

Value of Pension Assets

At August 30, 2003, the fair market value of AutoZone’s pension assets was
$86.7 million, and the related accumulated benefit obligation was $136.1
million. On January 1, 2003, our defined benefit pension plans were frozen.
Accordingly, plan participants earn no new benefits under the plan formulas,
and no new participants may join the plans. The material assumptions for
fiscal 2003 are an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 8% and a
discount rate of 6%. For additional information regarding AutoZone’s qualified
and non-qualified pension plans refer to Note J in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.



Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities” (FIN 46).
FIN 46 clarifies the application of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51,
“Consolidated Financial Statements,” to certain entities in which equity
investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest
or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its
activities without additional subordinated financial support from other
parties. FIN 46 requires the consolidation of certain types of entities in
which a company absorbs a majority of another entity’s expected losses or
residual returns, or both, as a result of ownership, contractual or other
financial interests in the other entity. These entities are called variable
interest entities. FIN 46 applies immediately to variable interest entities
created or acquired after January 31, 2003. For variable interest entities
created or acquired prior to February 1, 2003, the provisions of FIN 46 must be
applied at the end of periods ending after December 15, 2003. The Company is
currently evaluating the impact of FIN 46 and does not expect its adoption to
have a significant impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.

Risk Factors

We may not be able to increase sales by the same historic growth rates.

We have increased our domestic store count in the past five fiscal years,
growing from 2,657 stores at August 29, 1998, to 3,219 stores at August 30,
2003, an average store count increase per year of 4%. In addition, a portion of
our total sales increases each year resulted from increases in sales at
existing stores. We cannot provide any assurance that we can continue to open
stores at historical rates or increase same store sales.

Our business depends upon qualified employees.

At the end of fiscal 2003, our consolidated employee count was
approximately 49,000. We can not assure that we can continue to hire and retain
qualified employees at current wage rates. If we do not maintain competitive
wages, our customer service could suffer by reason of a declining quality of
our workforce or, alternatively, our earnings could decrease if we increase our
wage rates.

If demand for our products slows, then our business may be materially affected.

Demand for products sold by our stores depends on many factors. In the
short term, it may depend upon:

•

the number of miles vehicles are driven annually, as higher vehicle
mileage increases the need for maintenance and repair. Mileage levels
may be affected by gas prices and other factors.



If we are unable to compete successfully against other businesses that sell the
products that we sell, we could lose customers and our sales and profits may
decline.

The sale of automotive parts, accessories and maintenance items is highly
competitive in many areas, including name recognition, product availability,
customer service, store location and price. AutoZone competes in both the
retail (DIY) and commercial (DIFM) auto parts and accessories markets.

Competitors include national and regional auto parts chains, independently
owned parts stores, wholesalers and jobbers, repair shops, car washes and auto
dealers, in addition to discount and mass merchandise stores, department
stores, hardware stores, supermarkets, drugstores and home stores that sell
aftermarket vehicle parts and supplies, chemicals, accessories, tools and
maintenance parts. Although we believe we compete effectively on the basis of
customer service, including the knowledge and expertise of our AutoZoners,
merchandise quality, selection and availability, product warranty, store
layout, location and convenience, and the strength of our AutoZone brand name,
trademarks and service marks, some competitors may have competitive advantages,
such as greater financial and marketing resources, larger stores with more
merchandise, longer operating histories, more frequent customer visits and more
effective advertising. If we are unable to continue to develop successful
competitive strategies, or if our competitors develop more effective
strategies, we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline.

If we cannot profitably increase market share in the commercial auto parts
business, our sales growth may be limited.

Although we are one of the largest sellers of auto parts in the commercial
DIFM market, to increase commercial sales we must compete against automotive
aftermarket jobbers and



warehouse distributors, in addition to other auto parts
retailers that have entered the commercial business. Although we believe we
compete effectively on the basis of customer service, merchandise quality,
selection and availability, and distribution locations, some automotive
aftermarket jobbers and warehouse distributors have been in business for
substantially longer periods of time than we have, have developed long-term
customer relationships and have larger available inventories. We can make no
assurances that we can profitably develop new commercial customers or make
available inventories required by commercial customers.

If our vendors continue to consolidate, we may pay higher prices for our
merchandise.

Recently, several of our vendors have merged and others have announced
plans to merge. Further vendor consolidation could limit the number of vendors
from which we may purchase products and could materially affect the prices we
pay for these products.

Consolidation among our competitors may negatively impact our business.

Recently, several large auto parts chains have merged. We do not know the
impact these mergers will have upon competition in the retail automotive
aftermarket. If our competitors are able to achieve efficiencies in their
mergers, then there may be greater competitive pressures in the markets in
which they are stronger.

War or acts of terrorism or the threat of either may negatively impact
availability of merchandise and adversely impact our sales.

War, or acts of terrorism or the threat of either, may have a negative
impact on our ability to obtain merchandise available for sale in our stores.
Some of our merchandise is imported from other countries. If imported goods
become difficult or impossible to bring into the United States, and if we
cannot obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar costs, our sales
and profit margins may be negatively affected.

In the event that commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially
delayed, our business may be adversely impacted, as we may have difficulty
shipping merchandise to our distribution centers and stores.



Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

“Selected Financial Data” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations” include the following financial
measures not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles (“GAAP”). The following non-GAAP financial measures provide
additional information for determining our optimum capital structure and are
used to assist management in evaluating performance and in making appropriate
business decisions to maximize stockholders’ value.

•

After Tax Return on Invested Capital (“ROIC”)

•

Cash Flow Before Share Repurchases

In addition, the impact of certain non-recurring or infrequent items, that
we believe are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance, was
excluded in the determination of certain financial measures presented in
“Selected Financial Data” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” We believe that the resulting
non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because these
measures indicate more clearly
our comparative year-to-year operating results. The following non-recurring or
infrequent items were all identified as “adjustments” for comparative purposes:

Non-GAAP financial measures should not be used as a substitute for GAAP
financial measures, or considered in isolation, for the purpose of analyzing
our operating performance, financial position or cash flows. However, we have
presented the non-GAAP financial measures, as we believe they provide
additional information to analyze or compare our operations. Furthermore, our
management and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors use the
abovementioned non-GAAP financial measures to analyze and compare our
underlying operating results and to determine payments of performance-based
compensation. We have included a reconciliation of this information to the most
comparable GAAP measures in the accompanying reconciliation tables.



Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measure: After-Tax Return on Invested
Capital

The following table reconciles the percentages of after-tax return on
invested capital, or “ROIC,” both including and excluding the fiscal 2001
restructuring and impairment charges, to net income. After-tax return on
invested capital is calculated as after-tax operating profit (excluding rent)
divided by average invested capital (which includes a factor to capitalize
operating leases). The ROIC percentages are presented in the “Selected
Financial Data.”

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

AutoZone is exposed to market risk from, among other things, changes in
interest rates, foreign exchange rates and fuel prices. From time to time, we
use various financial instruments to reduce such risks. To date, based upon
our current level of foreign operations, hedging costs and past changes in the
associated foreign exchange rates, no instruments have been utilized to reduce
this market risk. All of our hedging activities are governed by guidelines
that are authorized by our Board of Directors. Further, we do not buy or sell
financial instruments for trading purposes.

Interest Rate Risk

AutoZone’s financial market risk results primarily from changes in
interest rates. At times, we reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates
by entering into various interest rate hedge instruments such as interest rate
swap contracts, treasury lock agreements and forward starting interest rate
swaps.

AutoZone has utilized interest rate swaps to convert variable rate debt to
fixed rate debt. At August 30, 2003, we held an interest rate swap contract,
with a September 2003 maturity date, to hedge $25 million of variable rate debt
associated with commercial paper borrowings.

At August 30, 2003, we also held treasury lock agreements with notional
amounts of $300 million and forward starting interest rate swaps with notional
amounts of $200 million. These agreements, which expire in November 2003, are
used to hedge the exposure to variability in future cash flows resulting from
changes in variable interest rates relating to anticipated debt transactions.
It is expected that upon settlement of the agreements, the realized gain or
loss will be deferred in other comprehensive income and reclassified to
interest expense over the life of the underlying debt. In addition, during
fiscal 2003, we entered into and settled a forward starting interest rate swap
with a notional amount of $200 million, used to hedge the variability in future
cash flows resulting from changes in variable interest rates related to
AutoZone’s issuance of $200 million 4.375% Senior Notes. The loss realized
upon settlement was deferred in other comprehensive income and is being
reclassified to interest expense over the life of the underlying senior notes,
resulting in an effective interest rate of 5.65%.

At August 31, 2002, we held interest rate swap contracts related to $190
million of variable rate debt. Of the $190 million, $115 million of the swaps,
due in December 2003, were used to hedge the variable rate debt associated with
AutoZone’s $115 million term loan. The remaining $75 million of swaps, with
expiration dates throughout fiscal years 2003 and 2004, were designated to
hedge the variable rate debt associated with commercial paper borrowings.
Additionally, at August 31, 2002, we held treasury lock agreements with
notional amounts of $300 million that expired in October 2002 and hedged the
exposure to variability in future cash flows resulting from changes in variable
interest rates related to AutoZone’s issuance of $300 million 5.875% Senior
Notes. The loss realized upon settlement was deferred in other comprehensive
income and is being reclassified to interest expense over the life of the
underlying senior notes, resulting in an effective interest rate of 6.33%. A
portion of the proceeds generated



from the issuance of the senior notes was
used to prepay a $115 million term loan. Accordingly, the related interest rate swap agreements were settled in cash and the
realized loss was deferred in other comprehensive income and is being
reclassified to interest expense over the life of the underlying term loan.

AutoZone reflects the current fair value of all interest rate hedge
instruments on our balance sheet. The related gains or losses on these
transactions are deferred in stockholders’ equity as a component of other
comprehensive income or loss. These deferred gains and losses are recognized in
income in the period in which the related interest rates being hedged are
recognized in expense. However, to the extent that the change in value of an
interest rate hedge instrument does not perfectly offset the change in the
value of the interest rate being hedged, that ineffective portion is
immediately recognized in income. For the years ended August 30, 2003, and
August 31, 2002, all of our hedge instruments were determined to be highly
effective, and no ineffective portion was recognized in income. The fair
values of the interest rate hedge instruments at August 30, 2003, were an asset
of $41.6 million. The fair values of the interest rate hedge instruments at
August 31, 2002, were a liability of $10.4 million.

The fair value of AutoZone’s debt was estimated at $1.57 billion as of
August 30, 2003, and $1.22 billion as of August 31, 2002, based on the quoted
market prices for the same or similar debt issues or on the current rates
available to AutoZone for debt of the same remaining maturities. Such fair
value is greater than the carrying value of debt at August 30, 2003, by $27.3
million, and greater than the carrying value of debt at August 31, 2002, by
$27.2 million. We had $556.8 million of variable rate debt outstanding at
August 30, 2003, and $699.8 million outstanding at August 31, 2002, both of
which exclude the effect of interest rate swaps designated and effective as
cash flow hedges of such variable rate debt. At these borrowing levels for
variable rate debt, a one percentage point increase in interest rates would
have had an unfavorable impact on AutoZone’s pretax earnings and cash flows of
$5.3 million in 2003 and $5.1 million in fiscal 2002, which includes the
effects of interest rate swaps. The primary interest rate exposure on variable
rate debt is based on LIBOR. We had $990.0 million of fixed rate debt
outstanding at August 30, 2003. A one percentage point increase in interest
rates would reduce the fair value of AutoZone’s fixed rate debt of $47.0
million.

Fuel Price Risk

Fuel swap contracts utilized by AutoZone have not previously been
designated as hedging instruments under the provisions of SFAS 133 and do not
qualify for hedge accounting treatment, although the instruments were executed
to economically hedge the consumption of diesel fuel used to distribute our
products. Accordingly, mark-to-market gains and losses related to such fuel
swap contracts are recorded in cost of sales as a component of distribution
costs. As of August 30, 2003, no fuel swap contracts were outstanding.
During fiscal 2003, we entered into fuel swaps to economically hedge a portion
of our diesel fuel exposure between April and August 2003. These swaps were
settled prior to August 30, 2003, and had no significant impact on cost of
sales for fiscal year 2003.

Management’s Report

Management is responsible for the preparation, integrity, and fair
presentation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the
Company and its subsidiaries. The financial statements have been prepared in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
and include the best estimates and judgments of management. Management also
prepared the other information included in the annual report and is responsible
for its accuracy and consistency with the financial statements. The opinion of
the independent auditors, Ernst & Young LLP, based upon their audits of the
consolidated financial statements, is contained in this Annual Report.

Management is responsible for maintaining a system of internal control
over financial reporting that provides reasonable assurance, at an appropriate
cost-benefit relationship, about the reliability of financial reporting. The
system contains self-monitoring mechanisms, and is regularly tested by Deloitte
& Touche LLP, the Company’s internal auditors. Actions are taken to correct
deficiencies as they are identified. Even an effective internal control
system, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations – including the
possibility of the circumvention or overriding of controls – and therefore can
provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement
preparation. Further, because of changes in conditions, internal control
system effectiveness may vary over time.

The Audit Committee of our Company’s Board of Directors, composed solely
of independent directors, regularly meets with the independent auditors,
management and internal auditors to discuss auditing and financial reporting
matters and the system of internal control. The Committee also meets regularly
with the independent auditors and the internal auditors without management
present to discuss any matters that may require attention.

Management assessed the Company’s system of internal control over
financial reporting as of August 30, 2003, in relation to criteria for
effective internal control over financial reporting described in “Internal
Control – Integrated Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management
believes that, as of August 30, 2003, the Company’s system of internal control
over financial reporting met those criteria.

Report of Independent Auditors

Stockholders

AutoZone, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of AutoZone,
Inc. as of August 30, 2003 and August 31, 2002, and the related consolidated
statements of income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended August 30, 2003. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on
a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of AutoZone, Inc.
at August 30, 2003 and August 31, 2002, and the consolidated results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
August 30, 2003, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States.

As discussed in Note A, Vendor Allowances and Advertising Costs, to the
consolidated financial statements, in fiscal year 2003 the Company adopted
Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 02-16, “Accounting by a Customer
(Including a Reseller) for Certain Consideration Received from a Vendor.”

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note A – Significant Accounting Policies

Business:

The Company is principally a retailer of automotive parts and
accessories. At the end of fiscal 2003, the Company operated 3,219 domestic
auto parts stores in 48 states and the District of Columbia and 49 auto parts
stores in Mexico. Each store carries an extensive product line for cars, sport
utility vehicles, vans and light trucks, including new and remanufactured
automotive hard parts, maintenance items and accessories.

In addition, the Company also has a domestic commercial program that
provides commercial credit and delivery of parts and other products to local,
regional and national repair garages, dealers and service stations. The
Company also sells products online at

autozone.com

and sells ALLDATA automotive
diagnostic and repair software which is also available through

alldatapro.com

and

alldatadiy.com.

Fiscal Year:

The Company’s fiscal year consists of 52 or 53 weeks ending
on the last Saturday in August.

Basis of Presentation:

The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of AutoZone, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (the Company).
All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in
consolidation.

Use of Estimates:

Management of the Company has made a number of estimates
and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the
disclosure of contingent liabilities to prepare these financial statements.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Cash Equivalents:

Cash equivalents consist of investments with original
maturities of 90 days or less at the date of purchase.

Merchandise Inventories:

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or
market using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. Included in inventory are
related purchasing, storage and handling costs.

Property and Equipment:

Property and equipment is stated at cost.
Depreciation is computed principally using the straight-line method over the
following estimated useful lives: buildings, 40 to 50 years; building
improvements, 5 to 15 years; equipment, 3 to 7 years; and leasehold
improvements, 5 to 15 years, not to exceed the remaining lease term.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets:

The Company adopted the provisions of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, “Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” (SFAS 144) on September 1, 2002.
SFAS 144 establishes accounting standards for the impairment of long-lived
assets such as property and equipment. In accordance with SFAS 144, the
Company evaluates the recoverability of the carrying amounts of the assets
covered by this standard whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying value may not be recoverable. As part of the evaluation, the
Company reviews performance at the store level to identify any stores



with current period operating losses that should be considered for
impairment. The Company compares the sum of the undiscounted expected future
cash flows with the carrying amounts of the assets. If impairments are
indicated, the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeded the
fair value of the assets is recognized as an impairment loss. The adoption of
SFAS 144 did not have a significant impact on the Company’s Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Intangible Assets:

The cost in excess of fair value of net assets of
businesses acquired is recorded as goodwill. Prior to the adoption of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets” (SFAS 142) in fiscal 2002, goodwill was amortized on a
straight-line basis over 40 years. Since the adoption of SFAS 142 on August
26, 2001, amortization of goodwill was discontinued. Under the provisions of
SFAS 142, an annual test of goodwill is required to compare the fair value of
goodwill to the carrying amount to determine if any impairment exists. The
Company performs its annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each
fiscal year, unless circumstances dictate more frequent assessments. No
impairment loss resulted from the 2003 or 2002 tests performed under SFAS 142.
Refer to Note C for additional disclosures regarding the adoption of SFAS 142.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities:

AutoZone is exposed to
market risk from, among other things, changes in interest rates, foreign
exchange rates and fuel prices. From time to time, the Company uses various
financial instruments to reduce such risks. To date, based upon the Company’s
current level of foreign operations, hedging costs and past changes in the
associated foreign exchange rates, no instruments have been utilized to reduce
this market risk. All of the Company’s hedging activities are governed by
guidelines that are authorized by AutoZone’s Board of Directors. Further, the
Company does not buy or sell financial instruments for trading purposes.

AutoZone’s financial market risk results primarily from changes in
interest rates. At times, AutoZone reduces its exposure to changes in interest
rates by entering into various interest rate hedge instruments such as interest
rate swap contracts, treasury lock agreements and forward starting interest
rate swaps. The Company complies with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards Nos. 133, 137 and 138 (collectively “SFAS 133”) pertaining to the
accounting for these derivatives and hedging activities which require all such
interest rate hedge instruments to be recognized on the balance sheet at fair
value. All of the Company’s interest rate hedge instruments are designated as
cash flow hedges. Refer to Note B for additional disclosures regarding the
Company’s derivatives instruments and hedging activities.

Financial Instruments:

The Company has financial instruments, including
cash, accounts receivable and accounts payable. The carrying amounts of these
financial instruments approximate fair value because of their short maturities.
A discussion of the carrying values and fair values of the Company’s debt is
included in Note F, while a discussion of the Company’s fair values of its
derivatives is included in Note B.

Income Taxes:

The Company accounts for income taxes under the liability
method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on
differences between financial reporting and tax



bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax
rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to
reverse.

Revenue Recognition:

The Company recognizes sales at the time the sale is
made and the product is delivered to the customer.

Vendor Allowances and Advertising Costs:

The Company receives various
payments and allowances from its vendors based on the volume of purchases or
for services that AutoZone provides to the vendors. Monies received from
vendors include rebates, allowances and promotional funds. Typically, these
funds are dependent on purchase volumes and advertising plans. The amounts to
be received are subject to changes in market conditions, vendor marketing
strategies and changes in the profitability or sell-through of the related
merchandise for AutoZone.

Rebates and other miscellaneous incentives are earned based on purchases
or product sales. These monies are treated as a reduction of inventories and
are recognized as a reduction to cost of sales as the inventories are sold.

Certain vendor allowances are used exclusively for promotions and to
partially or fully offset certain other direct expenses. Such vendor funding
arrangements, that were entered into on or before December 31, 2002, were
recognized as a reduction to selling, general and administrative expenses when
earned. However, for such vendor funding arrangements entered into or modified
after December 31, 2002, the Company applied the new guidance pursuant to the
Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 02-16, “Accounting by a Customer
(Including a Reseller) for Cash Consideration Received from a Vendor” (EITF
Issue No. 02-16). Accordingly, all vendor funds are recognized as a reduction
to cost of sales as the inventories are sold. As a result of the adoption of
EITF Issue No. 02-16, fiscal 2003 selling, general, and administrative expenses
were approximately $53 million higher and gross margin was approximately $43
million higher than such amounts would have been prior to the accounting
change.

Advertising expense, net of vendor funding, was approximately $32.5
million in fiscal 2003, $17.5 million in fiscal 2002 and $20.7 million in
fiscal 2001. The higher expense for fiscal 2003 reflects the impact of vendor
allowances, from agreements entered into or modified subsequent to December 31,
2002, that are no longer netted against advertising expense but recorded as a
reduction of cost of sales. The Company expenses advertising costs as
incurred.

Warranty Costs:

The Company or the vendors supplying its products provide
its customers with a warranty on certain products. Estimated warranty
obligations are provided at the time of sale of the product and are charged to
cost of sales.

Shipping and Handling Costs:

The Company does not generally charge
customers separately for shipping and handling. The cost the Company incurs to
ship products to the stores for delivery to the customer is included in cost of
sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income.



Preopening Expenses:

Preopening expenses, which consist primarily of
payroll and occupancy costs, are expensed as incurred.

Earnings Per Share:

Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted
average outstanding common shares. Diluted earnings per share is based on the
weighted average outstanding shares adjusted for the effect of common stock
equivalents. At this time, stock options are the Company’s only common stock
equivalents.

Stock Options:

At August 30, 2003, the Company has stock option plans that
provide for the purchase of the Company’s common stock by some of its employees
and directors, which are described more fully in Note I. The Company accounts
for those plans using the intrinsic-value-based recognition method prescribed
by Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees,” and related interpretations. Accordingly, no stock-based
employee compensation cost is reflected in net income, as options are granted
under those plans at an exercise price equal to the market value of the
underlying common stock on the date of grant. SFAS 123, “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation,” and SFAS 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation – Transition and Disclosure,” established accounting and
disclosure requirements using a fair-value-based method of accounting for
stock-based employee compensation plans. As allowed under SFAS 123, the
Company has elected to continue to apply the intrinsic-value-based method of
accounting and has adopted only the disclosure requirements of SFAS 123. The
following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share had
the Company applied the fair-value recognition provisions of SFAS 123 to
stock-based employee compensation.

Stock options that were not included in the pro forma fully diluted
computation because they would have been anti-dilutive were 1.5 million shares
at August 30, 2003, and 0.1 million shares at August 31, 2002.



The effects of applying SFAS 123 and the results obtained through the use
of the Black-Scholes option pricing model in this pro forma disclosure are not
necessarily indicative of future amounts. The weighted average fair value of
the stock options granted was $24.59 per share during fiscal 2003, $16.10 per
share during fiscal 2002 and $10.19 per share during fiscal 2001. The fair
value of each option granted is estimated on the date of the grant using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average
assumptions for grants in 2003, 2002 and 2001:

Recent Accounting Pronouncements:

In January 2003, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation No. 46, “Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities” (FIN 46). FIN 46 clarifies the application of
Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, “Consolidated Financial Statements,” to
certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a
controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the
entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial
support from other parties. FIN 46 requires the consolidation of certain types
of entities in which a company absorbs a majority of another entity’s expected
losses or residual returns, or both, as a result of ownership, contractual or
other financial interests in the other entity. These entities are called
variable interest entities. FIN 46 applies immediately to variable interest
entities created or acquired after January 31, 2003. For variable interest
entities created or acquired prior to February 1, 2003, the provisions of FIN
46 must be applied at the end of periods ending after December 15, 2003. The
Company is currently evaluating the impact of FIN 46 and does not expect its
adoption to have a significant impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.

Note B – Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities:

AutoZone has utilized interest rate swaps to convert variable rate debt to
fixed rate debt. At August 30, 2003, the Company held an interest rate swap
contract, with a September 2003 maturity date, to hedge $25 million variable
rate debt associated with commercial paper borrowings.

At August 30, 2003, the Company held treasury lock agreements with
notional amounts of $300 million and forward starting swaps with notional
amounts of $200 million. These agreements, which expire in November 2003, are
used to hedge the exposure to variability in



future cash flows resulting from changes in variable interest rates
relating to anticipated debt transactions. It is expected that upon settlement
of the agreements, the realized gain or loss will be deferred in other
comprehensive income and reclassified to interest expense over the life of the
underlying debt. In addition, during fiscal 2003, the Company entered into and
settled a forward starting interest rate swap with a notional amount of $200
million, used to hedge the variability in future cash flows resulting from
changes in variable interest rates related to AutoZone’s issuance of $200
million 4.375% Senior Notes. The loss realized upon settlement was deferred in
other comprehensive income and is being reclassified to interest expense over
the life of the underlying senior notes, resulting in an effective interest
rate of 5.65%

At August 31, 2002, the Company held interest rate swap contracts related
to $190 million of variable rate debt. Of the $190 million, $115 million of
the swaps, due in December 2003, were used to hedge the variable rate debt
associated with AutoZone’s $115 million term loan. The remaining $75 million
of swaps, with expiration dates throughout fiscal years 2003 and 2004, were
designated to hedge the variable rate debt associated with commercial paper
borrowings. Additionally, at August 31, 2002, the Company held treasury lock
agreements with notional amounts of $300 million that expired in October 2002
and hedged the exposure to variability in future cash flows resulting from
changes in variable interest rates related to AutoZone’s issuance of $300
million 5.875% Senior Notes. The loss realized upon settlement was deferred in
other comprehensive income and is being reclassified to interest expense over
the life of the underlying senior notes, resulting in an effective interest
rate of 6.33%. A portion of the proceeds generated from the issuance of the
senior notes was used to prepay a $115 million term loan. Accordingly, the
related interest rate swap agreements were settled in cash and the realized
loss was deferred in other comprehensive income and is being reclassified to
interest expense over the life of underlying term loan.

The Company reflects the current fair value of all interest rate hedge
instruments on its balance sheet. The related gains or losses on these
transactions are deferred in stockholders’ equity as a component of other
comprehensive income or loss. These deferred gains and losses are recognized in
income in the period in which the related interest rates being hedged have been
recognized in expense. However, to the extent that the change in value of an
interest rate hedge instrument agreement does not perfectly offset the change
in the value of the interest rate being hedged, that ineffective portion is
immediately recognized in income. For the years ended August 30, 2003, and
August 31, 2002, all of the Company’s interest rate hedge instruments were
determined to be highly effective, and no ineffective portion was recognized in
income. The fair values of the interest rate hedge instruments at August 30,
2003 were an asset of $41.6 million. The fair values of the interest rate
hedge instruments at August 31, 2002, were a liability of $10.4 million.

The Company primarily executes derivative transactions of relatively short
duration with strong creditworthy counterparties. These counterparties expose
the Company to credit risk in the event of non-performance. The amount of such
exposure is limited to the unpaid portion of amounts due to the Company
pursuant to the terms of the derivative financial instruments, if any.
Although there are no collateral requirements, if a downgrade in the credit
rating of these counterparties occurs, management believes that this exposure
is mitigated by provisions in the derivative agreements which allow for the
legal right of offset of any amounts due to the Company from the counterparties
with amounts payable, if any, to the counterparties by the Company.
Management considers the risk of counterparty default to be minimal.



Note C - Amortization of Goodwill

As of the beginning of fiscal 2002, the Company adopted SFAS 142. Under
SFAS 142, goodwill amortization ceased upon adoption. The following SFAS 142
disclosure presents the net income and related per share amounts for fiscal
2001 as if amortization of goodwill had not been recorded.

During fiscal 2003, the Company terminated various leases relating to
stores closed in connection with previous acquisitions. The amount paid to
terminate these leases was less than the related accrual and, as a result, the
excess accrual of $11.0 million was recorded as a reduction against the
goodwill established at the acquisition date.

The Company or the vendors supplying its products provide its customers
limited warranties on certain products that range from 30 days to lifetime
warranties. In most cases, the Company’s vendors are primarily responsible for
warranty claims. Warranty costs relating to merchandise sold under warranty
not covered by vendors are estimated and recorded as warranty obligations at
the time of sale based on each product’s historical return rate. The Company
periodically assesses the adequacy of its recorded warranty liability and
adjusts the amount as necessary. Accrued sales returns amounted to
approximately $5 million at August 30, 2003, and August 31, 2002. Changes in
the Company’s accrued sales and warranty returns for the last three fiscal
years consisted of the following:

Note E – Income Taxes

At August 30, 2003, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards
(NOLs) for federal income tax purposes of approximately $27.5 million that
expire in years 2007 through 2017. These carryforwards resulted from the
Company’s acquisition of ADAP, Inc. (which had been doing business as “Auto
Palace”) in fiscal 1998. The use of the federal tax NOLs is subject to annual
limitations. A valuation allowance of $8.6 million in fiscal 2003 and $8.7
million in fiscal 2002 relates to these carryforwards. In addition, some of the
Company’s subsidiaries have state income tax NOLs that expire in years 2004
through 2022. These state NOLs resulted from the Company’s acquisition of
Chief Auto Parts Inc. and ADAP, Inc. The use of the NOLs is limited to future
taxable earnings of these subsidiaries and may be subject to annual
limitations. Valuation allowances of $5.7 million in fiscal 2003 and fiscal
2002 relate to these carryforwards.



The provision for income tax expense for each of the last three fiscal
years consisted of the following:

The Company maintains $950 million of revolving credit facilities with a
group of banks. Of the $950 million, $300 million expires in May 2004. The
remaining $650 million expires in May 2005. The 364-day facility expiring in
May 2004 includes a renewal feature as well as an option to extend the maturity
date of the then-outstanding debt by one year. The credit facilities exist
largely to support commercial paper borrowings and other short term unsecured
bank loans. At August 30, 2003

,

outstanding commercial paper of $268 million,
the 6% Notes due November 2003 of $150 million, and other debt of $2.7 million
are classified as long term as the Company has the ability and intention to
refinance them on a long term basis. The rate of interest payable under the
credit facilities is a function of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR),
the lending bank’s base rate (as defined in the agreement) or a competitive bid
rate at the option of the Company. The Company has agreed to observe certain
covenants under the terms of its credit agreements, including limitations



on
total indebtedness, restrictions on liens and minimum fixed charge coverage.
As of August 30, 2003, the Company was in compliance with all covenants.

On October 16, 2002, the Company issued $300 million of 5.875% Senior
Notes. The notes mature in October 2012, and interest is payable semi-annually
on April 15 and October 15. A portion of the proceeds from these senior notes
was used to prepay a $115 million unsecured bank term loan due December 2003,
to repay a portion of the Company’s outstanding commercial paper borrowings,
and to settle interest rate hedges associated with the issuance and repayment
of the related debt securities. On June 3, 2003, the Company issued $200
million of 4.375% Senior Notes. These senior notes mature in June 2013, and
interest is payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1. The proceeds were
used to repay a portion of the Company’s outstanding commercial paper
borrowings, to prepay $100 million of the $350 million unsecured bank loan due
November 2004, and to settle interest rate hedges associated with the issuance
of the debt securities.

On August 8, 2003, the Company filed a shelf registration with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, which was declared effective on August 22,
2003. This filing will allow the Company to sell up to $500 million in debt
securities to fund general corporate purposes, including repaying, redeeming or
repurchasing outstanding debt, and for working capital, capital expenditures,
new store openings, stock repurchases and acquisitions. No debt had been
issued under this registration statement as of August 30, 2003.

As of August 30, 2003, “Other” long term debt included approximately $30
million related to the Company’s synthetic leases, with expiration dates in
fiscal 2006, for a small number of its domestic stores. At August 30, 2003,
the Company recognized the obligations under the lease facility and increased
its property and long term debt balances on its balance sheet by approximately
$30 million.

All of the Company’s debt is unsecured, except for $8.9 million, which is
collateralized by property. Maturities of long-term debt are $420.7 million in
fiscal 2004, $252.7 million in fiscal 2005, $182.7 million in fiscal 2006, $0.7
million in fiscal 2007, $190.0 million in fiscal 2008 and $500.0 million
thereafter. The maturities for fiscal 2004 are classified as long term as the
Company has the ability and intention to refinance them on a long term basis.

The fair value of the Company’s debt was estimated at $1.57 billion as of
August 30, 2003, and $1.22 billion as of August 31, 2002, based on the quoted
market prices for the same or similar issues or on the current rates available
to the Company for debt of the same remaining maturities. Such fair value is
greater than the carrying value of debt at August 30, 2003, and August 31,
2002, by $27.3 million and $27.2 million, respectively. The Company had
outstanding variable rate debt of $556.8 million at August 30, 2003, and $699.8
million at August 31, 2002, both of which exclude the effect of interest rate
swaps designated and effective as cash flow hedges of such variable rate debt.

Note H – Stock Repurchase Program

As of August 30, 2003, the Board of Directors had authorized the Company
to repurchase up to $3.3 billion of common stock in the open market. From
January 1998 to August 30, 2003, the Company has repurchased a total of 72.1
million shares at an aggregate cost of $2.8 billion. During fiscal 2003, the
Company repurchased 12.3 million shares of its common stock at an aggregate
cost of $891.1 million.

At times in the past, the Company utilized equity forward agreements to
facilitate its repurchase of common stock. There were no equity forward
agreements for share repurchases as of August 30, 2003. At August 31, 2002,
the Company held equity forward agreements, which were settled in cash during
fiscal 2003, for the purchase of approximately 2.2 million shares of common
stock at an average cost of $68.82 per share. Such obligations under the
equity forward agreements at August 31, 2002, were not reflected on the balance
sheet. During 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 150, “Accounting for Certain Financial
Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity” (SFAS 150).
SFAS 150 applied to the Company’s use of equity forward agreements to
repurchase common stock and would have required the Company to record any
forward purchase obligations as a liability on the balance sheet. All of the
Company’s outstanding forward purchase contracts were settled prior to the
adoption of SFAS 150 during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. Accordingly,
the adoption of SFAS 150 had no impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Note I – Employee Stock Plans

The Company has granted options to purchase common stock to some of its
employees and directors under various plans at prices equal to the market value
of the stock on the dates the options were granted. Options become exercisable
in a one to seven year period, and expire ten years after the grant date. See
Note A for additional information regarding the Company’s stock option plans.

Options to purchase 1.5 million shares at August 30, 2003, 2.1 million
shares at August 31, 2002, and 2.9 million shares at August 25, 2001, were
exercisable. Shares reserved for future grants were 3.9 million at August 30,
2003.

The Company also has an employee stock purchase plan, qualified under
Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code, under which all eligible employees
may purchase AutoZone’s common stock at 85% of the lower of the market price of
the common stock on the first day or



last day of each calendar quarter through payroll deductions. Maximum
permitted annual purchases are $15,000 per employee or 10 percent of
compensation, whichever is less. Under the plan, 0.1 million shares were sold
in fiscal 2003, 0.1 million shares were sold in fiscal 2002 and 0.2 million
shares were sold in fiscal 2001. The Company repurchased, at fair value, 0.1
million shares in fiscal 2003, 0.3 million shares in fiscal 2002 and 0.2
million shares in fiscal 2001 from employees electing to sell their stock. At
August 30, 2003, 0.6 million shares of common stock were reserved for future
issuance under this plan.

The Amended and Restated Executive Stock Purchase Plan permits senior
Company executives to purchase common stock up to 25 percent of their annual
salary and bonus after the limits under the employee stock purchase plan have
been exceeded. The Company has reserved 0.3 million shares for issuance under
the plan. During fiscal 2003, purchases under this plan were approximately
18,500 shares.

Under the AutoZone, Inc. 2003 Director Compensation Plan, a non-employee
director may receive no more than one-half of the annual and meeting fees
immediately in cash, and the remainder of the fees must be taken in common
stock or may be deferred in units with value equivalent to the value of shares
of common stock as of the grant date (also known as “stock appreciation
rights”).

Under the AutoZone, Inc. 2003 Director Stock Option Plan, on January 1 of
each year, each non-employee director receives an option to purchase 1,500
shares of common stock, and each non-employee director that owns common stock
worth at least five times the annual fee paid to each non-employee director on
an annual basis will receive an additional option to purchase 1,500 shares of
common stock. In addition, each new director receives an option to purchase
3,000 shares upon election to the Board of Directors, plus a portion of the
annual directors’ option grant prorated for the portion of the year actually
served in office. These stock option grants are made at the fair market value
as of the grant date.

Note J – Pension and Savings Plans

Prior to January 1, 2003, substantially all full-time employees were
covered by a defined benefit pension plan. The benefits under the plan were
based on years of service and the employee’s highest consecutive five-year
average compensation. On January 1, 2003, the plan was frozen. Accordingly,
pension plan participants will earn no new benefits under the plan formula and
no new participants will join the pension plan.

On January 1, 2003, the Company’s supplemental defined benefit pension
plan for certain highly compensated employees was also frozen. Accordingly,
plan participants will earn no new benefits under the plan formula and no new
participants will join the pension plan.

The Company makes annual contributions in amounts at least equal to the
minimum funding requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974. The following table sets forth the plans’ funded status and amounts
recognized in the Company’s financial statements:

The actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligation was
determined using weighted average discount rates of 6.0% at August 30, 2003,
7.25% at August 31, 2002, and 7.5% at August 25, 2001. In fiscal years 2003,
2002 and 2001, the assumed increases in future compensation levels were
generally age weighted rates from 5-10% after the first two years of service
using 15% for year one and 12% for year two. The expected long-term rate of
return on plan assets was 8.0% at August 30, 2003, and August 31, 2002, and
9.5% at August 25, 2001. Prior service cost is amortized over the estimated
average remaining service lives of the plan participants and the unrecognized
actuarial loss is amortized over the remaining service period of 8.23 years at
August 30, 2003.

On January 1, 2003, the Company introduced an enhanced defined
contribution plan (“401(k) plan”) pursuant to Section 401(k) of the Internal
Revenue Code that replaced the previous 401(k) plan. The 401(k) plan covers
substantially all employees that meet the plan’s service requirements. The new
plan features include increased Company matching contributions, immediate 100%
vesting of Company contributions and an increased savings option to 25% of
qualified earnings. The Company makes matching contributions, per pay period,
up to a specified percentage of employees’ contributions as approved by the
Board of Directors. The Company made matching contributions to employee
accounts in connection with the 401(k) plan of $4.5 million in fiscal 2003 and
$1.4 million in fiscal years 2002 and 2001.

Note K – Leases

Some of the Company’s retail stores, distribution centers and equipment
are leased. Most of these leases include renewal options and some include
options to purchase and provisions for percentage rent based on sales.

Rental expense was $110.7 million in fiscal 2003, $99.0 million in fiscal
2002 and $100.4 million for fiscal 2001. Percentage rentals were
insignificant.

Minimum annual rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases
were as follows at the end of fiscal 2003 (in thousands):

In connection with the Company’s December 2001 sale of the TruckPro
business, the Company subleased some properties to the purchaser for an initial
term of not less than 20 years. The Company’s remaining aggregate rental
obligation at August 30, 2003 of $31.6 million is entirely offset by the
sublease rental agreement.

Note L – Restructuring and Impairment Charges

In fiscal 2001, the Company recorded restructuring and impairment charges
of $156.8 million. The planned closure of 51 domestic auto parts stores and
the disposal of real estate projects in process and excess properties accounted
for the largest portion, or $56.1 million, of the charge. In fiscal 2002,
these stores were closed, and sales of certain excess properties resulted in
gains of approximately $2.6 million. During fiscal 2002, all remaining excess
properties were reevaluated. At that time, it was determined that several
properties could be developed. This resulted in the reversal of accrued lease
obligations totaling $6.4 million. It was also determined that additional
writedowns were needed to state remaining excess properties at fair value.
These writedowns totaled $9.0 million. During fiscal 2003, AutoZone recognized
$4.6 million of gains as a result of the disposition of properties associated
with the restructuring and impairment charges in fiscal 2001.

Another portion of the charge, $32.0 million, related to other asset
writedowns and the accrual of lease obligations associated with the closure of
a supply depot and for the unoccupied ALLDATA office building. During fiscal
2002, the ALLDATA office building was sold to a third party. The reserve
previously established was adequate to cover the loss incurred on the sale.

The Company also reserved $30.1 million for inventory rationalization,
including a provision for inventory losses in closed stores. All of the
scheduled recalls and disposals of inventory took place during fiscal 2002 and
the reserve was adequate to cover all losses incurred.

The Company recorded asset writedowns and contractual obligations
aggregating $29.9 million related to the planned sale of TruckPro, its
heavy-duty truck parts subsidiary. In December 2001, TruckPro was sold to a
group of investors for cash proceeds of $25.7 million and a promissory note.
The Company had deferred a gain of $3.6 million related to the sale due to
uncertainties associated with the realization of the gain. During fiscal 2003,
the note (with a face value of $4.5 million) was repaid to the Company and
certain liabilities were settled. As a result, a total gain of $4.7 million
was recognized into income during fiscal 2003.

The remainder of the restructuring and impairment charges, $8.7 million,
was related to contractual obligations, severance and other charges. The cash
outlays associated with these charges were made during fiscal 2002.



Total remaining accrued obligations for restructuring charges were $12.5
million at August 30, 2003. The following table presents a summary of the
activity in accrued obligations for the restructuring charges:

Note M – Commitments and Contingencies

Construction commitments, primarily for new stores, totaled approximately
$16.8 million at August 30, 2003.

AutoZone, Inc., was one of multiple defendants in a lawsuit entitled
“Coalition for a Level Playing Field, L.L.C.,

et al.

,

v. AutoZone, Inc.,

et
al.

” filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York in
February 2000. The case was brought by approximately 225 plaintiffs, which are
principally automotive aftermarket warehouse distributors and jobbers. The
plaintiffs claimed that the defendants knowingly received volume discounts,
rebates, slotting and other allowances, fees, free inventory, sham advertising
and promotional payments, a share in the manufacturers’ profits, and excessive
payments for services purportedly performed for the manufacturers in violation
of the Robinson-Patman Act. Plaintiffs sought unspecified damages (prior to
statutory trebling), ranging from several million dollars to $35 million for
each plaintiff, and a permanent injunction prohibiting defendants from
committing further violations of the Robinson-Patman Act and from opening any
further stores to compete with plaintiffs as long as defendants continue to
violate the Act. The claims of 22 of the original plaintiffs were tried to a
jury verdict in favor of AutoZone in January 2003. On February 26, 2003, the
plaintiffs, involved in the trial, filed a notice to appeal. The U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit will hear oral argument on the appeal
on November 5, 2003. On July 22, 2003, approximately 200 plaintiffs in the
original lawsuit, whose cases had been dismissed without prejudice and with
leave to reinstate their claims, filed a notice to be reactivated as parties in
the



lawsuit and for their claims against the defendants to be reinstated.
While the outcome of this matter cannot be predicted, AutoZone intends to
vigorously defend against it.

The Company currently, and from time to time, is involved in various other
legal proceedings incidental to the conduct of its business. Although the
amount of liability that may result from these proceedings cannot be
ascertained, the Company does not currently believe that, in the aggregate,
these other matters will result in liabilities material to the Company’s
financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

The Company is self-insured for workers’ compensation, automobile, general
and product liability and property losses. The Company is also self-insured
for health care claims for eligible active employees. The Company maintains
certain levels for stop loss coverage for each self-insured plan.
Self-insurance costs are accrued based upon the aggregate of the liability for
reported claims and an estimated liability for claims incurred but not
reported.

Note N – Segment Reporting

The Company manages its business on the basis of one reportable segment.
See Note A for a brief description of the Company’s business. As of August 30,
2003, the majority of the Company’s operations were located within the United
States. Other operations include ALLDATA and the Mexico locations, each of
which comprises less than 3 percent of consolidated net sales, net income and
total assets. The following data is presented in accordance with SFAS 131,
“Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information.”
