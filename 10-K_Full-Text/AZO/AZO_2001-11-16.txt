PART I

Item 1. Business

Introduction

We are the nation's leading
specialty retailer of automotive parts and accessories, with most of our
sales to do-it-yourself ("DIY") customers. We began operations in 1979
and at August 25, 2001, operated 3,019 auto parts stores in the United
States and 21 in Mexico. Each auto parts store carries an extensive product
line for cars, vans, and light trucks, including new and re-manufactured
automotive hard parts, maintenance items, and accessories. We also have
a commercial sales program in the United States that provides commercial
credit and prompt delivery of parts and other products to local repair
garages, dealers, and service stations. We do not sell tires nor do we
perform automotive repair or installation.

In addition, we sell automotive
diagnostic and repair information software through our ALLDATA subsidiary
and diagnostic and repair information through

alldatadiy.com

.

At August 25, 2001, our auto
parts stores were in the following states:

Marketing and Merchandising
Strategy

We are dedicated to providing
customers with superior service, value, and quality automotive parts and
products at conveniently located, well-designed stores. Key elements of
this strategy are:

Customer Service

We believe that our customers
value customer service; therefore, customer service is the most important
element in our marketing and merchandising strategy. We emphasize that
our AutoZoners (employees) should always put customers first. Our electronic
parts catalogs assist in the selection of parts; we offer free testing
of starters, alternators, batteries, sensors, and actuators; and we were
among the first auto parts companies to offer lifetime warranties on many
of the parts we sell. Our satellite system in our auto parts stores helps
us to speed up credit card and check approval processes and locate parts
at neighboring AutoZone stores.

Our stores generally open
at 8 a.m. and close between 8 and 10 p.m. (with some open 24 hours) Monday
through Saturday and typically open at 9 a.m. and close between 6 and 8
p.m. on Sunday.

AutoZone also provides specialty
tools in our loan-a-tool program. Customers can borrow a specialty tool,
such as a steering wheel puller, that a do-it-yourself customer or a small
repair shop would have no use for other than for a single job.

Tools

We believe that the satisfaction
of DIY and professional technician customers often is impacted by our ability
to provide specific automotive products as requested. Our auto parts stores
generally offer between 19,000 and 22,000 stock keeping units ("SKUs")
covering a broad range of vehicle types. Each auto parts store carries
the same basic product line with some regional differences based on climate,
demographics, and age and type of vehicle registration. Our "flexogram"
program enables us to tailor our parts inventory to the makes and models
of the automobiles in each store's trade area. We also offer a range of
lower turnover products through overnight delivery to our auto parts stores
and at hub stores that carry a larger range of products.

Pricing

We employ an everyday low
price strategy and want to be perceived by our customers as the value leader
in our industry by consistently providing quality merchandise at a good
price, with a good warranty and backed by outstanding customer service.
Our prices are generally structured to meet the lowest price offered by
a competitor for a product and we believe that our prices overall compare
favorably to those of our competitors.

Commercial Sales Program

Our commercial sales program
provides credit and prompt delivery of parts and other products to local
repair garages, dealers, and service stations. The program operated out
of 1,638 stores as of August 25, 2001. In addition, we have opened 39 hub
stores that offer a greater range of parts and products desired by commercial
customers and that can be used as additive inventory for local stores.

Store Design and Visual Merchandising

We design and build stores
for a high visual impact. The typical AutoZone store has an industrial
"high tech" appearance by utilizing colorful exterior signage, exposed
beams and ductwork, and brightly lighted interiors. Maintenance products,
accessories, and miscellaneous items are attractively displayed for easy
browsing by customers. In-store signage and special displays promote products
in floor displays, endcaps, and on the shelf. Store managers are able to
customize areas of the store to prominently display products that are in
demand in the local community.

Store Operations

Store Formats

As of August 25, 2001, we
had domestic auto parts stores in the following square footage ranges:

Substantially all AutoZone
stores are based on standard store formats resulting in generally consistent
appearance, merchandising, and product mix. Approximately 85% to 90% of
each store's square footage is selling space, of which approximately 40%
to 45% is dedicated to hard parts inventory. The hard parts inventory area
is fronted by a counter that generally runs the depth or length of the
store, dividing the hard parts area from the remainder of the store. The
remaining selling space contains displays of accessories and maintenance
items.

We have knowledgeable AutoZoners
(employees) available to assist customers with their parts needs utilizing
our proprietary electronic parts catalog with a video screen which is visible
to both the AutoZoner and the customer. The parts catalog will suggest
additional items that a customer should purchase in order to properly install
the part being purchased.

We believe that our stores
are "destination stores," generating their own traffic rather than relying
on traffic created by the presence of other stores in the immediate vicinity.
Therefore, we situate most stores on major thoroughfares with easy access
and good parking. Approximately 2,300 of our auto parts stores are freestanding,
with the balance principally located within strip shopping centers. Freestanding
large format stores typically have parking for approximately 40 to 45 cars
on a lot of approximately 3/4 to one acre. Our smaller auto parts stores
typically have parking for approximately 25 to 35 cars and are usually
located on a lot of approximately 1/2 to 3/4 acre.

Store Personnel and Training

Each auto parts store typically
employs from six to eighteen AutoZoners, including a manager and an assistant
manager. AutoZoners typically have prior automotive experience. All AutoZoners
are encouraged to complete courses resulting in certification by the National
Institute for Automotive Service Excellence ("ASE"), which is broadly recognized
for training certification in the automotive industry. Although we rely
primarily on on-the-job training, we also provide formal training programs,
including regular store meetings on specific sales and product issues,
standardized training manuals, and a specialist program where AutoZoners
can obtain certification in several areas of technical expertise from both
the company and from independent certification agencies. Training is supplemented
with frequent store visits by management.

Store managers get financial
incentives through performance-based bonuses and grants of stock options.
In addition, our growth has provided opportunities for the promotion of
qualified AutoZoners. We believe these opportunities are important to attract,
motivate, and retain quality AutoZoners.

Our domestic auto parts stores
are primarily supervised through district managers who oversee approximately
six to ten stores each and who report to regional managers. Regional managers
with approximately fifty-five to sixty-five stores each, in turn, report
to five Vice Presidents-Store Operations. Purchasing, merchandising, advertising,
accounting, cash management, store development, systems technology and
support, and other store support functions are centralized in our store
support center in Memphis, Tennessee. We believe that this centralization
enhances consistent execution of our merchandising and marketing strategy
at the store level, and reduces expenses and cost of goods.

Store Automation

All auto parts stores have
proprietary electronic parts catalogs that provide parts information based
on the make, model, and year of an automobile. The catalog display screens
are placed on the hard parts counter where both AutoZoners and customers
can view the screen. In addition, our satellite system enables the auto
parts stores to speed up credit card and check approval processes and locate
parts at neighboring AutoZone stores.

Our domestic auto parts stores
utilize our computerized Store Management System, which includes bar code
scanning and point-of-sale data collection terminals. The Store Management
System provides administrative assistance and improved personnel scheduling
at the store level, as well as enhanced merchandising information and improved
inventory control. We believe the Store Management System also enhances
customer service through faster processing of transactions and simplified
warranty and product return procedures.

Store Development

This table shows the domestic
auto parts store development during the past five fiscal years:


Includes
stores obtained in Chief and Auto Palace acquisitions in 1998, and store
real estate acquired from Pep Boys in fiscal year 1999.


Closed
stores include replaced stores.

We believe that expansion
opportunities exist both in markets that we do not currently serve, and
in markets where we can achieve a larger presence. We attempt to obtain
high visibility sites in high traffic locations and undertake substantial
research prior to entering new markets. The most important criteria for
opening a new store is its projected future profitability. Key factors
in selecting new site and market locations include population, demographics,
vehicle profile, number and strength of competitors' stores, and the cost
of real estate. We generally seek to open new stores within or contiguous
to existing market areas and attempt to cluster development in new urban
markets in a relatively short period of time in order to achieve economies
of scale in advertising and distribution costs. In addition to continuing
to construct our own stores, we occasionally evaluate potential acquisition
candidates in new as well as in existing markets.

Purchasing and Supply Chain

Merchandise is selected and
purchased for all stores at our store support center in Memphis. No one
class of product accounts for as much as ten percent of our total sales.
In fiscal 2001, no single supplier accounted for more than seven percent
of our total purchases, and our ten largest suppliers accounted for approximately
32 percent of our purchases. We generally have few long-term contracts
for the purchase of merchandise. We believe that we have excellent relationships
with suppliers. We also believe that alternative sources of supply exist,
at similar cost, for substantially all types of product sold.

Our vendors ship substantially
all of our merchandise to our distribution centers. Stores typically place
orders on a weekly basis with merchandise shipped from the warehouse in
our trucks on the following day.

We want to have the right
merchandise in our stores at the right time. In the past two fiscal years,
we have improved our supply chain by eliminating excess inventory and increasing
our purchasing terms while increasing sales. This has resulted in increases
in inventory turns and substantial increases in net inventory turns.

Competition

AutoZone competes in both
the DIY and professional technician auto parts markets. Primary competitors
include national and regional auto parts chains, independently owned parts
stores, wholesalers and jobbers, and auto dealers. Although auto parts
stores are the most important retail outlets for DIY customers, some aftermarket
vehicle supplies, chemicals, accessories, and tools are also available
at discount and department stores, hardware stores, supermarkets, drug
stores, and home stores. Auto parts retailers have remained competitive
in the DIY aftermarket by offering superior product knowledge and an extensive
number of products in stock. AutoZone competes on the basis of customer
service, including the knowledge and expertise of our AutoZoners, merchandise
selection and availability, price, product warranty, store layout, and
location.

Trademarks and Patents

We have registered several
service marks and trademarks in the United States Patent and Trademark
office, including our service mark "AutoZone" and trademarks "AutoZone,"
"Duralast," and "ALLDATA." We believe that the "AutoZone" service mark
and trademarks are important components in our merchandising and marketing
strategy.

Employees

As of August 25, 2001, we
employed approximately 44,600 persons, approximately 29,000 of whom were
employed full-time. Approximately 90 percent of our AutoZoners were employed
in stores or in direct field supervision, approximately seven percent in
distribution centers, and approximately three percent in store support
functions.

We have never experienced any material labor disruption, and believe
that our labor relations are generally good.

Risk Factors

We may not be able to increase sales by the same historic growth
rates.

We have significantly increased
our domestic store count in the past five fiscal years, growing from 1,143
stores at August 25, 1996, to 3,019 stores at August 25, 2001, an average
store count increase per year of 16%. We do not plan to continue our store
count growth rate at the historic pace. In addition, a portion of our total
sales increases each year results from increases in sales at existing stores.
We cannot provide any assurance that we can continue to increase same store
sales as our stores mature in their markets.

We have an ever-increasing need for qualified employees.

In fiscal year 2001, our
consolidated employee count increased from approximately 43,200 at the
beginning of the year to about 44,600, a 3% increase in the year. We do
not know if we can continue to hire and retain qualified employees at current
wage rates.

If demand for our products slows, then our business may be materially
affected.

Demand for products sold
by our stores depends on many factors. In the short term, it may depend
upon:

the weather, as vehicle maintenance may be deferred during periods of inclement
weather. However, as AutoZone stores are geographically disbursed, isolated
instances of inclimate weather will generally not have a material effect
upon our aggregate sales.

the economy, as during periods of good economic conditions, more of our
do-it-yourself customers may pay others to repair and maintain their cars
instead of working on their own vehicles or they may purchase new vehicles.
This factor is tempered by our commercial parts sales program that sells
parts to installers. In periods of declining economic conditions, both
do-it-yourself and do-it-for-me customers may defer vehicle maintenance
or repair.

For the long term, demand for
our products may depend upon the quality of the vehicles manufactured by
the original vehicle manufacturers, and the length of the warranty offered
on new vehicles.

If we cannot profitably increase market share in the commercial auto
parts business, our sales growth may be limited.

Although we are one of the
five largest sellers of auto parts in the commercial "do-it-for-me" market,
to increase commercial sales we must compete against automotive aftermarket
jobbers and warehouse distributors, in addition to other auto parts retailers
that have recently entered the commercial business. Some of these jobbers
and warehouse distributors have been in business for substantially longer
periods of time than we have, have developed long-term customer relationships,
and have larger available inventories. We can make no assurance that we
can profitably develop new commercial customers or make available inventories
required by commercial customers.

If we cannot profitably open and operate stores in international
markets, our sales growth may be limited.

We opened our first auto
parts stores in Mexico during fiscal year 1999. Although we believe that
great potential exists for auto parts stores in the fragmented international
auto parts market, we have little experience opening or operating stores
outside of the United States, and no assurances can be made that we can
open additional stores in Mexico or stores in any other country in a timely
or profitable manner.

In addition, products sold
in Mexico must be properly labeled for sale in accordance with Mexican
law. If AutoZone cannot source products in Mexico, it must obtain products
elsewhere and have them appropriately labeled for sale in Mexico. We can
make no assurances that we can purchase goods of appropriate quality or
in sufficient quantities in Mexico to sell in our stores, nor can we make
any assurances that we can profitably obtain products outside of Mexico
and have them relabeled in accordance with Mexican law.

If our vendors continue to consolidate, we may pay higher prices
for our merchandise.

Recently, several of our
vendors have merged and others have announced plans to merge. Further vendor
consolidation could limit the number of vendors from which we may purchase
products and could materially affect the prices we pay for these products.

Consolidation among our competitors may negatively impact our business.

Recently, several large auto
parts chains have announced plans to merge. We do not know what impact
these mergers will have upon competition in the retail automotive aftermarket.
If our merging competitors are able to achieve efficiencies in their mergers,
then there may be greater competitive pressures in the markets in which
they are strongest.

War, acts of terrorism, or the threat of either may negatively impact
availability of merchandise and adversely impact our sales.

In the event of war, acts
of terrorism, or either are threatened, it may have a negative impact on
our ability to obtain merchandise available for sale in our stores. Some
of our merchandise is imported from other countries. If imported goods
become difficult or impossible to bring into the United States, and if
we cannot obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar costs,
our sales and profit margins may be negatively affected. In addition, a
significant amount of the merchandise sold in our Mexico stores is exported
from the United States. If we cannot export this merchandise in a timely
manner, sales in our Mexico stores may be adversely affected.

In the event that commercial
transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed, our business may
be adversely impacted, as we may have difficulty shipping merchandise to
our distribution centers and stores.

Item 2. Properties

This table shows the square
footage and number of leased and owned properties for our domestic auto
parts stores:

We have 2,998,834 square
feet in our distribution centers servicing our auto parts stores, all of
which is owned, except for 998,237 square feet, which is leased. The distribution
centers are located in Arizona, California, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana,
Ohio, Tennessee, and Texas.

Our store support center,
which we own, is located in Memphis, Tennessee, and consists of 260,000
square feet.

We also own and lease other
properties that are not material in the aggregate.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

AutoZone, Inc., was a defendant
in a class action lawsuit entitled "Melvin Quinnie on behalf of all others
similarly situated v. AutoZone, Inc., and DOES 1 through 100, inclusive"
filed in the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles, in November
1998. The plaintiff claimed that the defendants failed to pay overtime
to store managers as required by California law and failed to pay terminated
managers in a timely manner as required by California law. The plaintiff
was seeking injunctive relief, restitution, statutory penalties, prejudgment
interest, and reasonable attorneys' fees, expenses, and costs. The parties
have settled the lawsuit and the settlement has received court approval.
The terms of the settlement were not material to AutoZone's operations
or consolidated financial position.

AutoZone, Inc., is a defendant
in a lawsuit entitled "Coalition for a Level Playing Field, L.L.C.,

et
al.,

v. AutoZone, Inc.,

et al

.," filed in the U.S. District
Court for the Eastern District of New York in February 2000. The case was
filed by over 100 plaintiffs, principally automotive aftermarket warehouse
distributors and jobbers, against eight defendants, principally automotive
aftermarket parts retailers. The plaintiffs claim that the defendants have
knowingly received volume discounts, rebates, slotting and other allowances,
fees, free inventory, sham advertising and promotional payments, a share
in the manufacturers' profits, and excessive payments for services purportedly
performed for the manufacturers in violation of the Robinson-Patman Act.
Plaintiffs seek approximately $1 billion in damages (including statutory
trebling) and a permanent injunction prohibiting defendants from committing
further violations of the Robinson-Patman Act and from opening any further
stores to compete with plaintiffs as long as defendants continue to violate
the Act. We and the other defendants filed a motion to dismiss this action
in the fiscal fourth quarter. Subsequently, on October 23, 2001, the court
overruled a substantial portion of the defendants' motion. We believe this
suit is without merit and will vigorously defend against it.

We are also involved in various
other legal proceedings incidental to the conduct of our business. Although
the amount of liability that may result from these other proceedings cannot
be ascertained, we do not currently believe that, in the aggregate, they
will result in liabilities material to our financial condition or results
of operations.
