      1. Business

Introduction

We
      are
      the nation’s leading specialty retailer of automotive parts and accessories,
      with most of our sales to do-it-yourself (“DIY”) customers. We began operations
      in 1979 and at August 26, 2006 operated 3,771 stores in the United States,
      and
      100 in Mexico. Each of our stores carries an extensive product line for cars,
      sport utility vehicles, vans and light trucks, including new and remanufactured
      automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and non-automotive
      products. In many of our stores we also have a commercial sales program that
      provides commercial credit and prompt delivery of parts and other products
      to
      local, regional and national repair garages, dealers and service stations.
      We
      also sell the ALLDATA brand automotive diagnostic and repair software. On the
      web at www.autozone.com, we sell diagnostic and repair information, auto and
      light truck parts, and accessories. We do not derive revenue from automotive
      repair or installation.

Marketing
      and Merchandising Strategy

We
      are
      dedicated to providing customers with superior service, value and quality
      automotive parts and products at conveniently located, well-designed stores.
      Key
      elements of this strategy are:

Customer
      Service

Customer
      service is the most important element in our marketing and merchandising
      strategy, which is based upon consumer marketing research. We emphasize that
      our
      AutoZoners (employees) should always put customers first by providing prompt,
      courteous service and trustworthy advice. Our electronic parts catalog assists
      in the selection of parts; and lifetime warranties are offered by us or our
      vendors on many of the parts we sell. Our wide area network in our stores helps
      us to expedite credit or debit card and check approval processes, to locate
      parts at neighboring AutoZone stores and in some cases to place orders directly
      with our vendors.

Our
      stores generally open at 7:30 or 8 a.m. and close between 8 and 10 p.m. Monday
      through Saturday and typically open at 9 a.m. and close between 6 and 9 p.m.
      on
      Sunday. However, some stores are open 24 hours, and some have extended hours
      of
      6 or 7 a.m. until midnight seven days a week.

We
      also
      provide specialty tools through our Loan-A-Tool® program. Customers can borrow a
      specialty tool, such as a steering wheel puller, for which a DIY customer or
      a
      repair shop would have little or no use other than for a single job. AutoZoners
      also provide other free services, including check engine light readings; battery
      charging; oil recycling; and testing of starters, alternators, batteries,
      sensors and actuators.

We
      believe that the satisfaction of DIY customers and professional technicians
      is
      often impacted by our ability to provide specific automotive products as
      requested. Our stores generally offer approximately 21,000 stock keeping units
      (“SKUs”), covering a broad range of vehicle types. Each store carries the same
      basic product lines, but we tailor our parts inventory to the makes and models
      of the vehicles in each store’s trade area. Our hub stores carry a larger
      assortment of products that can be delivered to commercial customers or local
      satellite stores. In excess of 750,000 additional SKUs of slower-selling
      products are available either through our vendor direct program (“VDP”), which
      offers overnight delivery, or through our salvage auto parts and original
      equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) parts programs.

We
      are
      constantly updating the products that we offer to assure that our inventory
      matches the products that our customers demand.

Pricing

We
      want
      to be perceived by our customers as the value leader in our industry by
      consistently providing quality merchandise at the right price, backed by a
      good
      warranty and outstanding customer service. On many of our products we offer
      multiple value choices in a good/better/best assortment, with appropriate price
      and quality differences from the “good” products to the “better” and “best”
products. A key component is our exclusive line of in-house brands: Valucraft,
      AutoZone, Duralast and Duralast Gold. We believe that our overall prices and
      value compare favorably to those of our competitors.

Marketing:
      Advertising and Promotions

We
      believe that targeted advertising and promotions play important roles in
      succeeding in today’s environment. We are constantly working to understand our
      customers’ wants and needs so that we can build long-lasting, loyal
      relationships. We utilize promotions and advertising primarily to advise
      customers about the overall importance of vehicle maintenance, our great value
      and the availability of high quality parts. Broadcast and targeted loyalty
      efforts are our primary marketing methods of driving traffic to our stores.
      We
      utilize in-store signage and creative product placement to help educate
      customers about products they need.

Store
      Design and Visual Merchandising

We
      design
      and build stores for a high visual impact. The typical AutoZone store has an
      industrial “high tech” appearance by utilizing colorful exterior and interior
      signage, exposed beams and ductwork and brightly lighted interiors. Maintenance
      products, accessories and miscellaneous items are attractively displayed for
      easy browsing by customers. In-store signage and special displays promote
      products on floor displays, end caps and on the shelf.

Commercial

Our
      commercial sales program is one of the largest aftermarket sellers of automotive
      parts and other products to local, regional and national repair garages, dealers
      and service stations in the United States. As a part of the program we offer
      credit and delivery to our commercial customers. The program operated out of
      2,134 stores as of August 26, 2006. Through our hub stores, we offer a greater
      range of parts and products desired by professional technicians, and this
      additional inventory is available for our DIY customers as well. Commercial
      has
      a national sales team focused on national and regional commercial accounts,
      as
      well as an outside sales force for customers located around our commercial
      stores.

Store
      Operations

Store
      Formats

Substantially
      all AutoZone stores are based on standard store formats, resulting in generally
      consistent appearance, merchandising and product mix. Approximately 85% to
      90%
      of each store’s square footage is selling space, of which approximately 40% to
      45% is dedicated to hard parts inventory. The hard parts inventory area is
      generally fronted by counters or pods that run the depth or length of the store,
      dividing the hard parts area from the remainder of the store. The remaining
      selling space contains displays of maintenance, accessories and non-automotive
      items.


We
      have
      knowledgeable AutoZoners available to assist customers with their parts needs,
      utilizing our proprietary electronic parts catalog with a display screen that
      is
      visible to both the AutoZoner and the customer. In addition to helping ensure
      fast, accurate parts look-up in both English and Spanish, the parts catalog
      will
      also suggest additional items that a customer should purchase to properly
      install the merchandise being purchased.

We
      believe that our stores are “destination stores,” generating their own traffic
      rather than relying on traffic created by adjacent stores. Therefore, we situate
      most stores on major thoroughfares with easy access and good parking.

Store
      Personnel and Training

Each
      store typically employs from 10 to 16 AutoZoners, including a manager and,
      in
      some cases, an assistant manager. AutoZoners typically have prior automotive
      experience. All AutoZoners are encouraged to complete courses resulting in
      certification by the National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence
      (“ASE”), which is broadly recognized for training certification in the
      automotive industry. Although we do on-the-job training, we also provide formal
      training programs, including an annual national sales meeting, regular store
      meetings on specific sales and product issues, standardized training manuals
      and
      a specialist program that trains AutoZoners in several areas of technical
      expertise from both the Company and from independent certification agencies.
      Training is supplemented with frequent store visits by management.

Store
      managers receive financial incentives through performance-based bonuses. In
      addition, our growth has provided opportunities for the promotion of qualified
      AutoZoners. We believe these opportunities are important to attract, motivate
      and retain quality AutoZoners.

All
      store
      support functions are centralized in our store support centers located in
      Memphis, Tennessee and Mexico. We believe that this centralization enhances
      consistent execution of our merchandising and marketing strategies at the store
      level, while reducing expenses and cost of sales.

Store
      Automation

All
      of
      our stores have a proprietary electronic parts catalog that provides parts
      information based on the make, model and year of a vehicle. The electronic
      catalog also tracks inventory availability at the store, at other nearby stores
      and through special order. The catalog display screens are placed on the hard
      parts counter or pods, where both AutoZoners and customers can view the screen.
      In addition, our wide area network enables the stores to expedite credit or
      debit card and check approval processes, to access immediately national warranty
      data, to implement real-time inventory controls and to locate and hold parts
      at
      neighboring AutoZone stores.

Our
      stores utilize our computerized proprietary Store Management System, which
      includes bar code scanning and point-of-sale data collection terminals. The
      Store Management System provides administrative assistance and improved
      personnel scheduling at the store level, as well as enhanced merchandising
      information and improved inventory control. We believe the Store Management
      System also enhances customer service through faster processing of transactions
      and simplified warranty and product return procedures.

The
      fiscal 2006 closed store count reflects 4 stores that remain closed temporarily
      from hurricane damage. We believe that expansion opportunities exist both in
      markets that we do not currently serve, as well as in markets where we can
      achieve a larger presence. We attempt to obtain high visibility sites in high
      traffic locations and undertake substantial research prior to entering new
      markets. The most important criteria for opening a new store are its projected
      future profitability and its ability to achieve our required investment hurdle
      rate. Key factors in selecting new site and market locations include population,
      demographics, vehicle profile, number and strength of competitors’ stores and
      the cost of real estate. In reviewing the vehicle profile, we also consider
      the
      number of vehicles that are seven years old and older- “our kind of vehicles,”
as these are generally no longer under the original manufacturers’ warranties
      and will require more maintenance and repair than younger vehicles. We generally
      seek to open new stores within or contiguous to existing market areas and
      attempt to cluster development in markets in a relatively short period of time.
      In addition to continuing to lease or develop our own stores, we evaluate and
      may make strategic acquisitions.

Purchasing
      and Supply Chain

Merchandise
      is selected and purchased for all stores through our two store support centers
      located in Memphis, Tennessee and Mexico. No one class of product accounts
      for
      as much as 10 percent of our total sales. In fiscal 2006, no single supplier
      accounted for more than 10 percent of our total purchases. We generally have
      few
      long-term contracts for the purchase of merchandise. We believe that we have
      good relationships with suppliers. We also believe that alternative sources
      of
      supply exist, at similar cost, for most types of product sold. Most of our
      merchandise flows through our distribution centers to our stores by our fleet
      of
      tractors and trailers or by third-party trucking firms.

Our
      hub
      stores have increased our ability to distribute products on a timely basis
      to
      many of our stores. A hub store is able to provide replenishment of products
      sold and deliver other products maintained only in hub store inventories to
      a
      store in its coverage area generally within 24 hours. Hub stores are generally
      replenished from distribution centers multiple times per week.

Competition

The
      sale
      of automotive parts, accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive
      in
      many areas, including name recognition, product availability, customer service,
      store location and price. AutoZone competes in both the retail DIY and
      commercial do it for me (“DIFM”) auto parts and accessories
      markets.

Competitors
      include national and regional auto parts chains, independently owned parts
      stores, wholesalers and jobbers, repair shops, car washes and auto dealers,
      in
      addition to discount and mass merchandise stores, department stores, hardware
      stores, supermarkets, drugstores and home stores that sell aftermarket vehicle
      parts and supplies, chemicals, accessories, tools and maintenance parts.
      AutoZone competes on the basis of customer service, including the trustworthy
      advice of our AutoZoners, merchandise selection and availability, price, product
      warranty, store layouts and location.


Trademarks
      and Patents

We
      have
      registered several service marks and trademarks in the United States Patent
      and
      Trademark office as well as in certain other countries, including our service
      marks, “AutoZone” and “Get in the Zone,” and trademarks, “AutoZone,” “Duralast,”
“Duralast Gold,” “Valucraft” and “ALLDATA.” We believe that the “AutoZone”
service marks and trademarks are important components of our merchandising
      and
      marketing strategy.

Employees

As
      of
      August 26, 2006, we employed approximately 53,000 persons, approximately 57
      percent of whom were employed full-time. About 91 percent of our AutoZoners
      were
      employed in stores or in direct field supervision, approximately 6 percent
      in
      distribution centers and approximately 3 percent in store support functions.
      Included in the above numbers are approximately 1,600 persons employed in our
      Mexico operations.

We
      have
      never experienced any material labor disruption and believe that relations
      with
      our AutoZoners are generally good.

Item
      1A. Risk Factors

Our
      business is subject to a variety of risks. Set forth below are certain of the
      important risks that we face and that could cause actual results to differ
      materially from historical results. These risks are not the only ones we face.
      Our business could also be affected by additional factors that are presently
      unknown to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial to our
      business.

We
      may not be able to increase sales by the same historic growth
      rates.

We
      have
      increased our store count in the past five fiscal years, growing from 3,040
      stores at August 25, 2001, to 3,871 stores at August 26, 2006, an average store
      count increase per year of 5%. Additionally, we have increased annual revenues
      in the past five fiscal years from $4.818 billion in fiscal 2001 to $5.948
      billion in fiscal 2006, an average increase per year of 5%. Annual revenue
      growth is driven by the opening of new stores and same-store sales. We cannot
      provide any assurance that we can continue to open stores or increase same-store
      sales.


Our
      business depends upon qualified employees.

At
      the
      end of fiscal 2006, our consolidated employee count was approximately 53,000.
      We
      cannot assure that we can continue to hire and retain qualified employees at
      current wage rates. If we do not maintain competitive wages, our customer
      service could suffer by reason of a declining quality of our workforce or,
      alternatively, our earnings could decrease if we increase our wage
      rates.

If
      demand for our products slows, then our business may be materially
      affected.

Demand
      for products sold by our stores depends on many factors. In the short term,
      it
      may depend upon:

•

the
                number of miles vehicles are driven annually, as higher vehicle mileage
                increases the need for maintenance and repair. Mileage levels may
                be
                affected by gas prices and other
                factors.

•

the
                number of vehicles in current service that are seven years old and
                older,
                as these vehicles are no longer under the original vehicle manufacturers’
                warranties and will need more maintenance and repair than younger
                vehicles.

•

the
                weather, as vehicle maintenance may be deferred.

•

the
                economy. In periods of rapidly declining economic conditions, both
                retail
                DIY and commercial DIFM customers may defer vehicle maintenance or
                repair.
                During periods of expansionary economic conditions, more of our DIY
                customers may pay others to repair and maintain their cars instead
                of
                working on their own vehicles or they may purchase new vehicles.

For
      the
      long term, demand for our products may depend upon:

•

the
                quality of the vehicles manufactured by the original vehicle manufacturers
                and the length of the warranty or maintenance offered on new
                vehicles.

•

restrictions
                on access to diagnostic tools and repair information imposed by the
                original vehicle manufacturers or by governmental
                regulation.

If
      we are unable to compete successfully against other businesses that sell
      the

products
      that we sell, we could lose customers and our sales and profits
      may

decline.

The
      sale
      of automotive parts, accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive
      based on many factors, including name recognition, product availability,
      customer service, store location and price. Competitors are rapidly opening
      locations near our existing stores. AutoZone competes as a supplier in both
      the
      DIY and DIFM auto parts and accessories markets.

Competitors
      include national, regional and local auto parts chains, independently owned
      parts stores, jobbers, repair shops, car washes and auto dealers, in addition
      to
      discount and mass merchandise stores, department stores, hardware stores,
      supermarkets, drugstores and home stores that sell aftermarket vehicle parts
      and
      supplies, chemicals, accessories, tools and maintenance parts. Although we
      believe we compete effectively on the basis of customer service, including
      the
      knowledge and expertise of our AutoZoners, merchandise quality, selection and
      availability, product warranty, store layout, location and convenience, price,
      and the strength of our AutoZone brand name, trademarks and service marks;
      some
      competitors may have competitive advantages, such as greater financial and
      marketing resources, larger stores with more merchandise, longer operating
      histories, more frequent customer visits and more effective advertising. If
      we
      are unable to continue to develop successful competitive strategies, or if
      our
      competitors develop more effective strategies, we could lose customers and
      our
      sales and profits may decline.


If
      we cannot profitably increase our market share in the commercial auto
      parts

business,
      our sales growth may be limited.

Although
      we are one of the largest sellers of auto parts in the commercial market, to
      increase commercial sales we must compete against national and regional auto
      parts chains, independently owned parts stores, wholesalers and jobbers, repair
      shops and auto dealers. Although we believe we compete effectively on the basis
      of customer service, merchandise quality, selection and availability, price,
      product warranty and distribution locations, and the strength of our AutoZone
      brand name, trademarks and service marks, some automotive aftermarket jobbers
      have been in business for substantially longer periods of time than we have,
      have developed long-term customer relationships and have large available
      inventories. We can make no assurances that we can profitably develop new
      commercial customers or make available inventories required by commercial
      customers.

If
      our vendors continue to consolidate, we may pay higher prices for
      our

merchandise.

In
      recent
      years, several of our vendors have merged and others have announced plans to
      merge. Further vendor consolidation could limit the number of vendors from
      which
      we may purchase products and could materially affect the prices we pay for
      these
      products.

Consolidation
      among our competitors may negatively impact our business.

In
      recent
      years, several large auto parts chains have merged. We do not know the impact
      these mergers will have upon competition in the automotive aftermarket. If
      our
      competitors are able to achieve efficiencies in their mergers, then there may
      be
      greater competitive pressures in the markets in which they are
      stronger.

War
      or acts of terrorism or the threat of either may negatively
      impact

availability
      of merchandise and adversely impact our sales.

War
      or
      acts of terrorism, or the threat of either, may have a negative impact on our
      ability to obtain merchandise available for sale in our stores. Some of our
      merchandise is imported from other countries. If imported goods become difficult
      or impossible to bring into the United States, and if we cannot obtain such
      merchandise from other sources at similar costs, our sales and profit margins
      may be negatively affected.

In
      the
      event that commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed,
      our
      business may be adversely impacted, as we may have difficulty shipping
      merchandise to our distribution centers and stores.

Rising
      energy prices may negatively impact our profitability.

As
      mentioned above, rising energy prices may impact demand for the products that
      we
      sell, overall transaction count and our profitability. Energy prices impact
      our
      merchandise distribution, commercial delivery, utility, and product costs.

Demand
      for our merchandise may decline if vehicle manufacturers refuse to make
      available the information our customers need to work on their own
      vehicles.

Demand
      for our merchandise may decline if vehicle manufacturers refuse to make
      available to the automotive aftermarket industry diagnostic, repair and
      maintenance information our customers, both retail (DIY) and commercial (DIFM),
      require to diagnose, repair and maintain their vehicles. Without public
      dissemination of this information, consumers may be forced to have all
      diagnostic work, repairs and maintenance performed by the vehicle manufacturers'
      dealer network.

      Illinois, Ohio, Tennessee, Texas and Mexico. We opened a new distribution center
      near Dallas, Texas in fiscal 2005 and closed our smaller facilities in San
      Antonio, Texas in fiscal 2005 and Lafayette, Louisiana in fiscal 2006. Our
      primary store support center, which we own, is located in Memphis, Tennessee,
      and consists of approximately 260,000 square feet. We also own and lease other
      properties that are not material in the aggregate.

Item
      3. Legal Proceedings

AutoZone,
      Inc. is a defendant in a lawsuit entitled "Coalition for a Level Playing Field,
      L.L.C., et al., v. AutoZone, Inc. et al.," filed in the U.S. District Court
      for
      the Southern District of New York in October 2004. The case was filed by more
      than 200 plaintiffs, which are principally automotive aftermarket warehouse
      distributors and jobbers (collectively “Plaintiffs”), against a number of
      defendants, including automotive aftermarket retailers and aftermarket
      automotive parts manufacturers. In the amended complaint, the plaintiffs allege,
      inter alia, that some or all of the automotive aftermarket retailer defendants
      have knowingly received, in violation of the Robinson-Patman Act (the “Act”),
      from various of the manufacturer defendants benefits such as volume discounts,
      rebates, early buy allowances and other allowances, fees, inventory without
      payment, sham advertising and promotional payments, a share in the
      manufacturers' profits, benefits of pay on scan purchases, implementation of
      radio frequency identification technology, and excessive payments for services
      purportedly performed for the manufacturers. Additionally, a subset of
      plaintiffs alleges a claim of fraud against the automotive aftermarket retailer
      defendants based on discovery issues in a prior litigation involving similar
      Robinson-Patman Act claims. In the prior litigation, the discovery dispute,
      as
      well as the underlying claims, were decided in favor of AutoZone and the other
      automotive aftermarket retailer defendants who proceeded to trial, pursuant
      to a
      unanimous jury verdict which was affirmed by the Second Circuit Court of
      Appeals. In the current litigation, plaintiffs seek an unspecified amount of
      damages (including statutory trebling), attorneys' fees, and a permanent
      injunction prohibiting the aftermarket retailer defendants from inducing and/or
      knowingly receiving discriminatory prices from any of the aftermarket
      manufacturer defendants and from opening up any further stores to compete with
      plaintiffs as long as defendants allegedly continue to violate the Act. The
      Company believes this suit to be without merit and is vigorously defending
      against it. Defendants have filed motions to dismiss all claims with prejudice
      on substantive and procedural grounds. Additionally, the Defendants have sought
      to enjoin plaintiffs from filing similar lawsuits in the future. If granted
      in
      their entirety, these dispositive motions would resolve the litigation in
      Defendants' favor.

On
      June
      22, 2005, the Attorney General of the State of California, in conjunction with
      District Attorneys for San Bernardino, San Joaquin and Monterey Counties, filed
      suit in the San Bernardino County Superior Court against AutoZone, Inc. and
      its
      California subsidiaries. The San Diego County District Attorney later joined
      the
      suit. The lawsuit alleges that AutoZone failed to follow various state statutes
      and regulations governing the storage and handling of used motor oil and other
      materials collected for recycling or used for cleaning AutoZone stores and
      parking lots. The suit seeks $12.0 million in penalties and injunctive relief.

AutoZone
      is involved in various other legal proceedings incidental to the conduct of
      our
      business. Although the amount of liability that may result from these other
      proceedings cannot be ascertained, we do not currently believe that, in the
      aggregate, they will result in liabilities material to our financial condition,
      results of operations, or cash flows.

AutoZone’s
      common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “AZO.” On
      October 17, 2006, there were 3,589 stockholders of record, which does not
      include the number of beneficial owners whose shares were represented by
      security position listings.

We
      currently do not pay a cash dividend on our common stock. Any payment of
      dividends in the future would be dependent upon our financial condition, capital
      requirements, earnings, cash flow and other factors.

      2006, 87,974 shares in fiscal 2005, and 102,084 shares in fiscal 2004 from
      employees electing to sell their stock under the Company’s Third Amended and
      Restated Employee Stock Purchase Plan, qualified under Section 423 of the
      Internal Revenue Code, under which all eligible employees may purchase
      AutoZone’s common stock at 85% of the lower of the market price of the common
      stock on the first day or last day of each calendar quarter through payroll
      deductions. Maximum permitted annual purchases are $15,000 per employee or

      sold to employees in fiscal 2006, 59,479 shares were sold in fiscal 2005, and

      have reached the maximum under the employee stock purchase plan, the Amended
      and
      Restated Executive Stock Purchase Plan permits all eligible executives to
      purchase AutoZone’s common stock up to 25 percent of his or her annual salary
      and bonus. Purchases by executives under this plan were 811 shares in fiscal
      2006, 5,366 shares in fiscal 2005 and 11,005 shares in fiscal 2004. At August
      26, 2006, 264,294 shares of common stock were reserved for future issuance
      under
      this plan.
