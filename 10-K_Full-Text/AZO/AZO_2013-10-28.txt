accounts. We also have commercial programs in select stores in Mexico, as well as in our stores in Brazil. We also sell the ALLDATA brand automotive diagnostic and repair software through www.alldata.com. Additionally, we sell automotive hard parts,
maintenance items, accessories, and non-automotive products through www.autozone.com, and accessories and performance parts through www.autoanything.com, and our commercial customers can make purchases through www.autozonepro.com. We do not derive
revenue from automotive repair or installation services.

Marketing and Merchandising Strategy

We are dedicated to providing customers with superior service and trustworthy advice as well as quality automotive parts and products at a great value in
conveniently located, well-designed stores. Key elements of this strategy are:

Customer Service

Customer service is the most important element in our marketing and merchandising strategy, which is based upon consumer marketing research. We emphasize that
our AutoZoners (employees) should always put customers first by providing prompt, courteous service and trustworthy advice. Our electronic parts catalog assists in the selection of parts as well as warranties that are offered by us or our vendors on
many of the parts that we sell. The wide area network in our stores helps us expedite credit or debit card and check approval processes, locate parts at neighboring AutoZone stores, including our hub stores, and in some cases, place special orders
directly with our vendors. We sell automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and non-automotive parts through www.autozone.com for pick-up in store or to be shipped directly to a customer’s home or business. Additionally, we offer
smartphone apps that provide customers with store locations, driving directions, operating hours, and product availability.

Our stores generally open at
7:30 or 8 a.m. and close between 8 and 10 p.m. Monday through Saturday and typically open at 9 a.m. and close between 6 and 9 p.m. on Sunday. However, some stores are open 24 hours, and some have extended hours of 6 or 7 a.m. until midnight seven
days a week.

We also provide specialty tools through our Loan-A-Tool program. Customers can borrow a specialty tool, such as a steering wheel puller, for
which a do-it-yourself (“DIY”) customer or a repair shop would have little or no use other than for a single job. AutoZoners also provide other free services, including check engine light readings where allowed by law, battery charging,
the collection of used oil for recycling, and the testing of starters, alternators, batteries, sensors and actuators.

We believe that the satisfaction of our customers is often impacted by our ability to provide specific automotive products as
requested. Each store carries the same basic products, but we tailor our inventory to the makes and models of the vehicles in each store’s trade area, and our sales floor products are tailored to the local store’s demographics. Our hub
stores carry a larger assortment of products that are delivered to local satellite stores. We are constantly updating the products we offer to ensure that our inventory matches the products our customers need or desire.

Pricing

We want to be perceived by our customers as the
value leader in our industry, by consistently providing quality merchandise at the right price, backed by a satisfactory warranty and outstanding customer service. For many of our products, we offer multiple value choices in a good/better/best
assortment, with appropriate price and quality differences from the “good” products to the “better” and “best” products. A key differentiating component versus our competitors is our exclusive line of in-house brands,
which includes the Econocraft, Valucraft, AutoZone, SureBilt, ProElite, Duralast, Duralast Gold, and Duralast Platinum brands. We believe that our overall value compares favorably to that of our competitors.

Brand Marketing: Advertising and Promotions

We believe
that targeted advertising and promotions play important roles in succeeding in today’s environment. We are constantly working to understand our customers’ wants and needs so that we can build long-lasting, loyal relationships. We utilize
promotions, advertising and loyalty card programs primarily to advise customers about the overall importance of vehicle maintenance, our great value and the availability of high quality parts. Broadcast and internet media are our primary advertising
methods of driving traffic to our stores. We utilize in-store signage, in-store circulars, and creative product placement and promotions to help educate customers about products that they need.

Store Design and Visual Merchandising

We design and
build stores for high visual impact. The typical AutoZone store utilizes colorful exterior and interior signage, exposed beams and ductwork and brightly lit interiors. Maintenance products, accessories and non-automotive items are attractively
displayed for easy browsing by customers. In-store signage and special displays promote products on floor displays, end caps and shelves.

Commercial

Our commercial sales program operates in a highly fragmented market, and we are one of the leading distributors of automotive parts and
other products to local, regional and national repair garages, dealers, service stations and



public sector accounts in the United States, Puerto Rico, Mexico and Brazil. As a part of the program, we offer credit and delivery to our customers, as well as online ordering through
www.autozonepro.com. Through our hub stores, we offer a greater range of parts and products desired by professional technicians. We have dedicated sales teams focused on independent repair shops as well as national, regional and public sector
commercial accounts.

Store Operations

Store Formats

Substantially all AutoZone stores are based
on standard store formats, resulting in generally consistent appearance, merchandising and product mix. Approximately 85% to 90% of each store’s square footage is selling space, of which approximately 40% to 45% is dedicated to hard parts
inventory. The hard parts inventory area is generally fronted by counters or pods that run the depth or length of the store, dividing the hard parts area from the remainder of the store. The remaining selling space contains displays of maintenance,
accessories and non-automotive items.

We believe that our stores are “destination stores,” generating their own traffic rather than relying on
traffic created by adjacent stores. Therefore, we situate most stores on major thoroughfares with easy access and good parking.

Store Personnel and
Training

Each store typically employs from 10 to 16 AutoZoners, including a manager and, in some cases, an assistant manager. We provide on-the-job
training as well as formal training programs, including an annual national sales meeting, regular store meetings on specific sales and product issues, standardized training manuals and a specialist program that provides training to AutoZoners in
several areas of technical expertise from the Company, our vendors and independent certification agencies. All AutoZoners are encouraged to complete tests resulting in certifications by the National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence
(“ASE”), which is broadly recognized for training certification in the automotive industry. Training is supplemented with frequent store visits by management.

Store managers, sales representatives, commercial specialists, and managers at various levels across the organization receive financial incentives through
performance-based bonuses. In addition, our growth has provided opportunities for the promotion of qualified AutoZoners. We believe these opportunities are important to attract, motivate and retain high quality AutoZoners.

All store support functions are centralized in our store support centers located in Memphis, Tennessee; Monterrey, Mexico; Chihuahua, Mexico and Sao Paulo,
Brazil. We believe that this centralization enhances consistent execution of our merchandising and marketing strategies at the store level, while reducing expenses and cost of sales.

Store Automation

All of our stores have Z-net, our
proprietary electronic catalog that enables our AutoZoners to efficiently look up the parts that our customers need and to provide complete job solutions, advice and information for customer vehicles. Z-net provides parts information based on the
year, make, model and engine type of a vehicle and also tracks inventory availability at the store, at other nearby stores and through special order. The Z-net display screens are placed on the hard parts counter or pods, where both the AutoZoner
and customer can view the screen.

Our stores utilize our computerized proprietary Store Management System, which includes bar code scanning and
point-of-sale data collection terminals. The Store Management System provides administrative assistance and improved personnel scheduling at the store level, as well as enhanced merchandising information and improved inventory control. We believe
the Store Management System also enhances customer service through faster processing of transactions and simplified warranty and product return procedures. In addition, our wide area network enables the stores to expedite credit or debit card and
check approval processes, to access national warranty data, to implement real-time inventory controls and to locate and hold parts at neighboring AutoZone stores.

We believe that expansion opportunities exist both in markets that we do not currently serve, as well as in markets where we
can achieve a larger presence. We attempt to obtain high visibility sites in high traffic locations and undertake substantial research prior to entering new markets. The most important criteria for opening a new store are the projected future
profitability and the ability to achieve our required investment hurdle rate. Key factors in selecting new site and market locations include population, demographics, vehicle profile, customer buying trends, commercial businesses, number and
strength of competitors’ stores and the cost of real estate. In reviewing the vehicle profile, we also consider the number of vehicles that are seven years old and older, or “our kind of vehicles”; these vehicles are generally no
longer under the original manufacturers’ warranties and require more maintenance and repair than newer vehicles. We generally seek to open new stores within or contiguous to existing market areas and attempt to cluster development in markets in
a relatively short period of time. In addition to continuing to lease or develop our own stores, we evaluate and may make strategic acquisitions.

Purchasing and Supply Chain

Merchandise is selected and purchased for all stores through our store support centers located in Memphis, Tennessee
and Monterrey, Mexico. In fiscal 2013, one class of similar products accounted for approximately 10 percent of our total sales. No vendor supplied more than 10 percent of our purchases, and we believe that alternative sources of supply exist, at
similar costs, for most types of product sold. Most of our merchandise flows through our distribution centers to our stores by our fleet of tractors and trailers or by third-party trucking firms.

Our hub stores have increased our ability to distribute products on a timely basis to many of our stores and to expand our product assortment. A hub store
generally has a larger assortment of products as well as regular replenishment items that can be delivered to a store in its network within 24 hours. Hub stores are generally replenished from distribution centers multiple times per week.

Competition

The sale of
automotive parts, accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive in many areas, including name recognition, product availability, customer service, store location and price. AutoZone competes in the after-market auto parts industry, which
includes both the retail DIY and commercial do-it-for-me (“DIFM”) auto parts and products markets.

Competitors include national, regional and
local auto parts chains, independently owned parts stores, online parts stores, jobbers, repair shops, car washes and auto dealers, in addition to discount and mass merchandise stores, department stores, hardware stores, supermarkets, drugstores,
convenience stores, home stores, and other online retailers that sell aftermarket vehicle parts and supplies, chemicals, accessories, tools and maintenance parts. AutoZone competes on the basis of customer service, including the trustworthy advice
of our AutoZoners; merchandise quality, selection and availability; price; product warranty; store layouts, location and convenience; and the strength of our AutoZone brand name, trademarks and service marks.



Trademarks and Patents

We have registered several service marks and trademarks in the United States Patent and Trademark office as well as in certain other countries, including our
service marks, “AutoZone” and “Get in the Zone,” and trademarks, “AutoZone,” “Duralast,” “Duralast Gold,” “Duralast Platinum,” “Valucraft,” “Econocraft,”
“ALLDATA,” “AutoAnything,” “Loan-A-Tool” and “Z-net.” We believe that these service marks and trademarks are important components of our marketing and merchandising strategies.

Employees

As of
August 31, 2013, we employed over 71,000 persons, approximately 59 percent of whom were employed full-time. About 92 percent of our AutoZoners were employed in stores or in direct field supervision, approximately 5 percent in distribution
centers and approximately 3 percent in store support and other functions. Included in the above numbers are approximately 5,000 persons employed in our Mexico and Brazil operations.

We have never experienced any material labor disruption and believe that relations with our AutoZoners are good.

AutoZone Websites

AutoZone’s primary website is at http://www.autozone.com. We make available, free of charge, at our investor relations website,

Item 1A. Risk Factors

Our business is subject to a variety of risks. Set forth below are certain of the important risks that we face, the occurrence of which could have a material,
adverse effect on our business. These risks are not the only ones we face. Our business could also be affected by additional factors that are presently unknown to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial to our business.

If demand for our products slows, then our business may be materially affected.

Demand for products sold by our stores depends on many factors, including:

•

the number of vehicles in current service, including those that are seven years old and older. These vehicles are generally no longer under the original vehicle manufacturers’ warranties and tend to need more
maintenance and repair than newer vehicles.

•

rising energy prices. Increases in energy prices may cause our customers to defer purchases of certain of our products as they use a higher percentage of their income to pay for gasoline and other energy costs.

•

the economy. In periods of declining economic conditions, both retail and commercial customers may defer vehicle maintenance or repair. Additionally, such conditions may affect our customers’ ability to obtain
credit. During periods of expansionary economic conditions, more of our DIY customers may pay others to repair and maintain their cars instead of working on their own vehicles or they may purchase new vehicles.

•

the weather. Mild weather conditions may lower the failure rates of automotive parts, while wet conditions may cause our customers to defer maintenance and repair on their vehicles. Extremely hot or cold conditions may
enhance demand for our products due to increased failure rates of our customers’ automotive parts.

•

technological advances. Advances in automotive technology and parts design could result in cars needing maintenance less frequently and parts lasting longer.

For the long term, demand for our products may be affected by:

•

the number of miles vehicles are driven annually. Higher vehicle mileage increases the need for maintenance and repair. Mileage levels may be affected by gas prices and other factors.

•

the quality of the vehicles manufactured by the original vehicle manufacturers and the length of the warranties or maintenance offered on new vehicles.

•

restrictions on access to diagnostic tools and repair information imposed by the original vehicle manufacturers or by governmental regulation.

All of these factors could result in immediate and longer term declines in the demand for our products, which could adversely affect our sales, cash flows and
overall financial condition.

If we are unable to compete successfully against other businesses that sell the products that we sell, we could lose
customers and our sales and profits may decline.

The sale of automotive parts, accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive and is based
on many factors, including name recognition, product availability, customer service, store location and price. Competitors are opening locations near our existing stores. AutoZone competes as a provider in both the DIY and DIFM auto parts and
accessories markets.

Competitors include national, regional and local auto parts chains, independently owned parts stores, online parts stores, jobbers,
repair shops, car washes and auto dealers, in addition to discount and mass merchandise stores, hardware stores, supermarkets, drugstores, convenience stores, home stores, and other online retailers that sell aftermarket vehicle parts and supplies,
chemicals, accessories, tools and maintenance parts. Although we believe we compete effectively on the basis of customer service, including the knowledge and expertise of our AutoZoners; merchandise quality, selection and availability; product
warranty; store layout, location and convenience; price; and the strength of our AutoZone brand name, trademarks and service marks; some competitors may gain competitive advantages, such as greater financial and marketing resources allowing them to
sell automotive products at lower prices, larger stores with more merchandise, longer operating histories, more



frequent customer visits and more effective advertising. If we are unable to continue to develop successful competitive strategies, or if our competitors develop more effective strategies, we
could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline.

We may not be able to sustain our historic rate of sales growth.

We have increased our store count in the past five fiscal years, growing from 4,240 stores at August 30, 2008, to 5,201 stores at August 31, 2013,
an average store count increase per year of 5%. Additionally, we have increased annual revenues in the past five fiscal years from $6.523 billion in fiscal 2008 to $9.148 billion in fiscal 2013, an average increase per year of 8%. Annual revenue
growth is driven by the opening of new stores and increases in same-store sales. We open new stores only after evaluating customer buying trends and market demand/needs, all of which could be adversely affected by continued job losses, wage cuts,
small business failures and microeconomic conditions unique to the automotive industry. Same store sales are impacted both by customer demand levels and by the prices we are able to charge for our products, which can also be negatively impacted by
continued recessionary pressures. We cannot provide any assurance that we will continue to open stores at historical rates or continue to achieve increases in same-store sales.

If we cannot profitably increase our market share in the commercial auto parts business, our sales growth may be limited.

Although we are one of the largest sellers of auto parts in the commercial market, to increase commercial sales we must compete against national and regional
auto parts chains, independently owned parts stores, wholesalers and jobbers and auto dealers. Although we believe we compete effectively on the basis of customer service, merchandise quality, selection and availability, price, product warranty,
distribution locations, and the strength of our AutoZone brand name, trademarks and service marks, some automotive aftermarket jobbers have been in business for substantially longer periods of time than we have, have developed long-term customer
relationships and have large available inventories. If we are unable to profitably develop new commercial customers, our sales growth may be limited.

Significant changes in macroeconomic factors could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Our short-term and long-term debt is rated investment grade by the major rating agencies. These investment-grade credit ratings have historically allowed us
to take advantage of lower interest rates and other favorable terms on our short-term credit lines, in our senior debt offerings and in the commercial paper markets. To maintain our investment-grade ratings, we are required to meet certain financial
performance ratios. An increase in our debt and/or a decline in our earnings could result in downgrades in our credit ratings. A downgrade in our credit ratings could limit our access to public debt markets, limit the institutions willing to provide
credit facilities to us, result in more restrictive financial and other covenants in our public and private debt and would likely significantly increase our overall borrowing costs and adversely affect our earnings.

Moreover, significant deterioration in the financial condition of large financial institutions in calendar years 2008 and 2009 resulted in a severe loss of
liquidity and availability of credit in global credit markets and in more stringent borrowing terms. During brief time intervals in the fourth quarter of calendar 2008 and the first quarter of calendar 2009, there was limited liquidity in the
commercial paper markets, resulting in an absence of commercial paper buyers and extraordinarily high interest rates on commercial paper. We can provide no assurance that credit market events such as those that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2008
and the first quarter of 2009 will not occur again in the foreseeable future. Conditions and events in the global credit market could have a material adverse effect on our access to short-term debt and the terms and cost of that debt.

Macroeconomic conditions also impact both our customers and our suppliers. Job growth in the United States has stagnated and unemployment has remained at
historically high levels during the past five years. If the United States government is unable to reach agreement on legislation addressing the United States’ current debt level and budget deficit, many economists have predicted another
economic recession. Continued recessionary conditions could result in additional job losses and business failures, which could result in our loss of certain small business customers and curtailment of spending by our retail customers. In addition,
continued distress in global credit markets, business failures and other recessionary conditions could have a material adverse effect on the ability of



our suppliers to obtain necessary short and long-term financing to meet our inventory demands. Moreover, rising energy prices could impact our merchandise distribution, commercial delivery,
utility and product costs. All of these macroeconomic conditions could adversely affect our sales growth, margins and overhead, which could adversely affect our financial condition and operations.

Our business depends upon hiring and retaining qualified employees.

We believe that much of our brand value lies in the quality of the more than 71,000 AutoZoners employed in our stores, distribution centers, store support
centers, ALLDATA and AutoAnything. We cannot be assured that we can continue to hire and retain qualified employees at current wage rates. If we are unable to hire, properly train and/or retain qualified employees, we could experience higher
employment costs, reduced sales, losses of customers and diminution of our brand, which could adversely affect our earnings. If we do not maintain competitive wages, our customer service could suffer due to a declining quality of our workforce or,
alternatively, our earnings could decrease if we increase our wage rates.

Inability to acquire and provide quality merchandise could adversely affect
our sales and results of operations.

We are dependent upon our vendors continuing to supply us with quality merchandise. If our merchandise offerings
do not meet our customers’ expectations regarding quality and safety, we could experience lost sales, increased costs and exposure to legal and reputational risk. All of our vendors must comply with applicable product safety laws, and we
are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety and quality standards. Events that give rise to actual, potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to government enforcement action or private
litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities. To the extent our suppliers are subject to added government regulation of their product design and/or manufacturing processes, the cost of the merchandise we purchase may rise.
In addition, negative customer perceptions regarding the safety or quality of the products we sell could cause our customers to seek alternative sources for their needs, resulting in lost sales. In those circumstances, it may be difficult
and costly for us to regain the confidence of our customers. Moreover, if any of our significant vendors experience financial difficulties or otherwise are unable to deliver merchandise to us on a timely basis, or at all, we could have product
shortages in our stores that could adversely affect customers’ perceptions of us and cause us to lose customers and sales.

Our ability to grow
depends in part on new store openings, existing store remodels and expansions and effective utilization of our existing supply chain and hub network.

Our continued growth and success will depend in part on our ability to open and operate new stores and expand and remodel existing stores to meet
customers’ needs on a timely and profitable basis. Accomplishing our new and existing store expansion goals will depend upon a number of factors, including the ability to partner with developers and landlords to obtain suitable sites for
new and expanded stores at acceptable costs, the hiring and training of qualified personnel, particularly at the store management level, and the integration of new stores into existing operations. There can be no assurance we will be able to achieve
our store expansion goals, manage our growth effectively, successfully integrate the planned new stores into our operations or operate our new, remodeled and expanded stores profitably.

In addition, we extensively utilize hub stores, our supply chain and logistics management techniques to efficiently stock our stores. If we fail to
effectively utilize our existing hubs and/or supply chains, we could experience inappropriate inventory levels in our stores, which could adversely affect our sales volume and/or our margins.

Our failure to protect our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brand name.

We believe our continued strong sales growth is driven in significant part by our brand name. The value in our brand name and its continued effectiveness in
driving our sales growth are dependent to a significant degree on our ability to maintain our reputation for safety, high product quality, friendliness, service, trustworthy advice, integrity and business ethics. Any negative publicity about these
types of concerns may reduce demand for our merchandise. Failure to comply with ethical, social, product, labor and environmental standards could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions. Failure to
comply with applicable laws and regulations, to maintain an effective system of internal controls or to provide accurate and timely financial statement information could also hurt our reputation.



Our business involves the storage of personal information about our customers and AutoZoners. Failure to protect
the security of our customers’, employees’ and company information could subject us to costly regulatory enforcement actions, expose us to litigation and our reputation could suffer. While we take significant steps to protect customer,
employee and other confidential information, including maintaining compliance with payment card industry standards, our security measures may be breached in the future due to cyber attack, employee error or other acts, and unauthorized parties may
obtain access to this data. To date, we have not experienced any significant breaches of information.

Damage to our reputation or loss of consumer
confidence for any of these or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation.

Business interruptions may negatively impact our store hours, operability of our computer and other systems, availability of merchandise and otherwise have
a material negative effect on our sales and our business.

War or acts of terrorism, political unrest, hurricanes, windstorms, fires, earthquakes and
other natural or other disasters or the threat of any of them, may result in certain of our stores being closed for a period of time or permanently or have a negative impact on our ability to obtain merchandise available for sale in our stores. Some
of our merchandise is imported from other countries. If imported goods become difficult or impossible to bring into the United States, and if we cannot obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar costs, our sales and profit margins may be
negatively affected.

In the event that commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed, our business may be adversely impacted, as we may
have difficulty shipping merchandise to our distribution centers and stores resulting in lost sales and/or a potential loss of customer loyalty. Transportation issues could also cause us to cancel purchase orders if we are unable to receive
merchandise in our distribution centers.

We rely extensively on our computer systems to manage inventory, process transactions and summarize results. Our
systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches and catastrophic events. If our systems are damaged or fail to function properly, we may incur substantial costs to
repair or replace them, and may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process transactions, which could result in lost sales, inability to process purchase orders and/or a potential loss
of customer loyalty, which could adversely affect our results of operations.

Memphis, Tennessee, and consists of approximately 260,000 square feet. We also have three additional store support centers located in Monterrey, Mexico; Chihuahua, Mexico and Sao Paulo, Brazil. The ALLDATA headquarters building in Elk Grove,
California, and the AutoAnything headquarters space in San Diego, California are leased, and we also own or lease other properties that are not material in the aggregate.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

In 2004, we acquired a store site in Mount Ephraim, New Jersey that had previously been the site of a gasoline service station and contained evidence of
groundwater contamination. Upon acquisition, we voluntarily reported the groundwater contamination issue to the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and entered into a Voluntary Remediation Agreement providing for the remediation of the
contamination associated with the property. We have conducted and paid for (at an immaterial cost to us) remediation of contamination on the property. We are also investigating, and will be addressing, potential vapor intrusion impacts in
downgradient residences and businesses. The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection asserted, in a Directive and Notice to Insurers dated February 19, 2013 (“Directive”), that we are liable for the downgradient impacts under
a joint and severable liability theory, and we have contested any such assertions due to the existence of other entities/sources of contamination, some of which are also named in the Directive, in the area of the property. Pursuant to the Voluntary
Remediation Agreement, upon completion of all remediation required by the agreement, we believe we are eligible to be reimbursed up to 75 percent of qualified remediation costs by the State of New Jersey. We have asked the state for clarification
that the agreement applies to off-site work, and the state is considering the request. Although the aggregate amount of additional costs that we may incur pursuant to the remediation cannot currently be ascertained, we do not currently believe that
fulfillment of our obligations under the agreement or otherwise will result in costs that are material to our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.

We are involved in various other legal proceedings incidental to the conduct of our business, including several lawsuits containing class-action allegations
in which the plaintiffs are current and former hourly and salaried employees who allege various wage and hour violations and unlawful termination practices. We do not currently believe that, either individually or in the aggregate, these matters
will result in liabilities material to our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

The Company also repurchased, at fair value, an additional 22,915 shares in fiscal 2013, 24,113 shares in fiscal 2012, and
30,864 shares in fiscal 2011 from employees electing to sell their stock under the Company’s Sixth Amended and Restated Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “Employee Plan”), qualified under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code,
under which all eligible employees may purchase AutoZone’s common stock at 85% of the lower of the market price of the common stock on the first day or last day of each calendar quarter through payroll deductions. Maximum permitted annual
purchases are $15,000 per employee or 10 percent of compensation, whichever is less. Under the Employee Plan, 18,228 shares were sold to employees in fiscal 2013, 19,403 shares were sold to employees in fiscal 2012, and 21,608 shares were sold to
employees in fiscal 2011. At August 31, 2013, 234,744 shares of common stock were reserved for future issuance under the Employee Plan.



Once executives have reached the maximum purchases under the Employee Plan, the Fifth Amended and Restated
Executive Stock Purchase Plan (the “Executive Plan”) permits all eligible executives to purchase AutoZone’s common stock up to 25 percent of his or her annual salary and bonus. Purchases by executives under the Executive Plan were
3,454 shares in fiscal 2013, 3,937 shares in fiscal 2012, and 1,719 shares in fiscal 2011. At August 31, 2013, 248,953 shares of common stock were reserved for future issuance under the Executive Plan.

Item 7.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

We are the nation’s leading retailer, and a leading
distributor, of automotive replacement parts and accessories in the United States. We began operations in 1979 and at August 31, 2013, operated 4,836 stores in the United States, including Puerto Rico; 362 in Mexico; and three in Brazil. Each
of our stores carries an extensive product line for cars, sport utility vehicles, vans and light trucks, including new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and non-automotive products. At August 31, 2013, in
3,421 of our domestic stores, we also have a commercial sales program that provides commercial credit and prompt delivery of parts and other products to local, regional and national repair garages, dealers, service stations and public sector
accounts. We also have commercial programs in select stores in Mexico, as well as in our stores in Brazil. We also sell the ALLDATA brand automotive diagnostic and repair software through www.alldata.com. Additionally, we sell automotive hard parts,
maintenance items, accessories, and non-automotive products through www.autozone.com, and accessories and performance parts through www.autoanything.com, and our commercial customers can make purchases through www.autozonepro.com. We do not derive
revenue from automotive repair or installation services.

Executive Summary

We achieved strong performance in fiscal 2013, delivering record net income of $1.016 billion, a 9.3% increase over the prior year, and sales growth of
$543.7 million, a 6.3% increase over the prior year. We completed the year with growth in all areas of our business. We are pleased with the results of our retail business and the increase in our commercial business, where we continue to build
our internal sales force and continue to refine our parts assortment. Over the past several years, various factors have occurred within the economy that affect both our customers and our industry, including the impact of the recession, continued
high unemployment, and other challenging economic conditions. Although we have seen a recent increase in new vehicle sales, we believe our consumers’ cash flows continue to decrease due to the previously listed factors. Given the nature of
these macroeconomic factors, we cannot predict whether or for how long these trends will continue, nor can we predict to what degree these trends will impact us in the future.

We believe other macroeconomic factors have adversely affected both our customers and our industry. During fiscal 2013, the average price per gallon of
unleaded gasoline in the United States remained at a high level, $3.65 per gallon, compared to $3.57 per gallon during fiscal 2012. We continue to believe gas prices will remain at overall high levels, thereby reducing discretionary spending for all
consumers, and, in particular, our customers. With approximately 11 billion gallons of unleaded gas consumed each month across the U.S., each $1 decrease at the pump contributes approximately $11 billion of additional spending capacity to consumers
each month. Given the unpredictability of gas prices, we cannot predict whether gas prices will increase or decrease, nor can we predict how any future changes in gas prices will impact our sales in future periods.

An additional macroeconomic factor facing our customer is the reinstitution of payroll taxes back to historic levels. The reduction in our customers’
take home pay as a result of the recent increase in payroll taxes was effective at the beginning of the 2013 calendar year and, at this point, we cannot predict the impact this change has had or will have on our sales in future periods.

During fiscal 2013, failure and maintenance related categories represented the largest portion of our sales mix, at approximately 84% of total sales, with
failure related categories continuing to be our strongest performers. While



we have not experienced any fundamental shifts in our category sales mix as compared to previous years, we did experience a slight decline in sales of the maintenance category as a percentage of
sales. We believe the slowdown in maintenance related products during fiscal 2013 was largely due to weather related impacts in various regions. Because of the unusually mild winter during fiscal 2012 across parts of the U.S., we saw a reduced
benefit from sales of maintenance related products in fiscal 2013 compared to the prior fiscal year. However, sales in the maintenance category did improve in the last quarter of fiscal 2013 due to a more normalized winter in fiscal 2013 as compared
to fiscal 2012.

Our primary response to fluctuations in the demand for the products we sell is to adjust our advertising message, store staffing, and
product assortment. Specifically, during fiscal 2013, we have closely studied our hub distribution model and store inventory levels and assortment. As a result, we are performing certain strategic tests including adding additional inventory into our
hub stores and increasing product availability in our stores. We continue to believe we are well positioned to help our customers save money and meet their needs in a challenging macroeconomic environment.

The two statistics we believe have the closest correlation to our market growth over the long-term are miles driven and the number of seven year old or older
vehicles on the road.

Miles Driven

We believe that
as the number of miles driven increases, consumers’ vehicles are more likely to need service and maintenance, resulting in an increase in the need for automotive hard parts and maintenance items. While over the long-term, we have seen a close
correlation between our net sales and the number of miles driven, we have also seen certain time frames of minimal correlation in sales performance and miles driven. During the periods of minimal correlation between net sales and miles driven, we
believe net sales have been positively impacted by other factors, including the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road. Since the beginning of the fiscal year and through June 2013 (latest publicly available information), miles
driven decreased slightly compared to the same period last year.

Seven Year Old or Older Vehicles

Since 2008, new vehicle sales have been significantly lower than historical levels, which we believe contributed to an increasing number of seven year old or
older vehicles on the road. We estimate vehicles are driven an average of approximately 12,500 miles each year. In seven years, the average miles driven equates to approximately 87,500 miles. Our experience is that at this point in a vehicle’s
life, most vehicles are not covered by warranties and increased maintenance is needed to keep the vehicle operating. According to the latest data provided by the Automotive Aftermarket Industry Association, as of January 1, 2013, the average
age of vehicles on the road is 11.3 years as compared to 11.1 years as of January 1, 2012. Although the average age of vehicles continues to increase, it is increasing at a decelerated rate primarily driven by the improvement in new car sales
in recent years. However, in the near term, we expect the aging vehicle population to continue to increase, as consumers keep their cars longer in an effort to save money during this uncertain economy. As the number of seven year old or older
vehicles on the road increases, we expect an increase in demand for the products we sell.

Results of Operations

Fiscal 2013 Compared with Fiscal 2012

For the fiscal year
ended August 31, 2013, we reported net sales of $9.148 billion compared with $8.604 billion for the year ended August 25, 2012, a 6.3% increase from fiscal 2012. This growth was driven primarily by sales from new stores of $222.3 million,
the 53

rd

week sales of $177.7 million, and sales from AutoAnything for a portion of the fiscal year.

At August 31, 2013, we operated 4,836 domestic stores, 362 stores in Mexico and three stores in Brazil, compared with 4,685 domestic stores, 321 stores
in Mexico and none in Brazil at August 25, 2012. We reported a total auto parts (domestic, Mexico and Brazil) sales increase of 5.2% for fiscal 2013.

Gross profit for fiscal 2013 was $4.741 billion, or 51.8% of net sales, compared with $4.432 billion, or 51.5% of net sales for fiscal 2012. The improvement
in gross margin was primarily driven by lower product acquisition costs, partially offset by the inclusion of AutoAnything (28 basis points).



Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2013 increased to $2.968 billion, or 32.4% of
net sales, from $2.803 billion, or 32.6% of net sales for fiscal 2012. Operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, improved due to lower incentive compensation (19 basis points), partially offset by lower sales growth rates.

Interest expense, net for fiscal 2013 was $185.4 million compared with $175.9 million during fiscal 2012. This increase was primarily due to higher average
borrowing levels over the comparable prior year period; partially offset by a decline in borrowing rates. Average borrowings for fiscal 2013 were $3.927 billion, compared with $3.507 billion for fiscal 2012 and weighted average borrowing rates were
4.5% for fiscal 2013, compared to 4.7% for fiscal 2012.

Our effective income tax rate was 36.0% of pre-tax income for fiscal 2013 compared to 36.0% for
fiscal 2012.

Net income for fiscal 2013 increased by 9.3% to $1.016 billion, and diluted earnings per share increased 18.3% to $27.79 from $23.48 in
fiscal 2012. The impact of the fiscal 2013 stock repurchases on diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2013 was an increase of approximately $1.09.

Effective December 2012, we acquired certain assets and liabilities of AutoAnything, an online retailer of specialized automotive products for up to $150
million, including an initial cash payment of $115 million, up to a $5 million holdback payment for working capital true-ups, and contingent payments not to exceed $30 million. During the third quarter of fiscal 2013, we paid the holdback payment
for working capital true-ups of $1.1 million. With this acquisition, we expect to bolster our online presence in the automotive accessory and performance markets. The results of operations from AutoAnything have been included in our Other business
activities since the date of acquisition. The purchase price allocation resulted in goodwill of $83.4 million and intangible assets totaling $58.7 million. Goodwill generated from the acquisition is tax deductible and is primarily attributable to
expected synergies and the assembled workforce. The contingent consideration is based on the achievement of certain performance metrics through calendar year 2014 with any earned payments due during the first calendar quarter of 2014 and 2015. The
fair value of the contingent consideration as of the acquisition date was $22.7 million.

We performed our annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter
of fiscal 2013 for the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset related to the acquisition of AutoAnything. Based on an analysis of AutoAnything’s revised planned financial results compared to the initial projections, we determined it was
more likely than not the goodwill attributed to AutoAnything was impaired. Accordingly, we performed a goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. Because the fair value of
the reporting unit was lower than its carrying value, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $18.3 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. Based on our evaluation of the future discounted cash flows of AutoAnything’s trade name
as compared to its carrying value, it was determined that AutoAnything’s trade name was also impaired. We recorded an impairment charge of $4.1 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 related to the trade name.

Based on the revised plan financial results, we also determined AutoAnything is not likely to achieve the operating income targets necessary to earn the
contingent consideration. Therefore, we adjusted the fair value of the contingent consideration at August 31, 2013 to $0.2 million, resulting in a decrease to the contingent consideration liability of $23.3 million during the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2013. The net impact of the impairment charges and the contingent consideration adjustment is a gain of $0.9 million. The net impact is included in Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses in our Other business activities.

Fiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011

For the fiscal
year ended August 25, 2012, we reported net sales of $8.604 billion compared with $8.073 billion for the year ended August 27, 2011, a 6.6% increase from fiscal 2011. This growth was driven primarily by an increase in domestic same store
sales of 3.9% and sales from new stores of $214.2 million. The improvement in domestic same store sales was driven by higher transaction value, partially offset by decreased transaction counts.

At August 25, 2012, we operated 4,685 domestic stores and 321 stores in Mexico, compared with 4,534 domestic stores and 279 stores in Mexico at
August 27, 2011. We reported a total auto parts (domestic and Mexico operations) sales increase of 6.5% for fiscal 2012.



Gross profit for fiscal 2012 was $4.432 billion, or 51.5% of net sales, compared with $4.119 billion, or 51.0% of
net sales for fiscal 2011. The improvement in gross margin was primarily attributable to higher merchandise margins (19 basis points) and lower shrink expense (17 basis points). Lower acquisition costs drove the higher merchandise margins for the
year.

Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2012 increased to $2.803 billion, or 32.6% of net sales, from $2.625 billion, or
32.5% of net sales for fiscal 2011. The slight increase in operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, was the result of higher self-insurance costs (42 basis points); partially offset by lower incentive compensation (30 basis points).

Interest expense, net for fiscal 2012 was $175.9 million compared with $170.6 million during fiscal 2011. This increase was primarily due to higher average
borrowing levels over the comparable prior year period; partially offset by a decline in borrowing rates. Average borrowings for fiscal 2012 were $3.507 billion, compared with $3.103 billion for fiscal 2011 and weighted average borrowing rates were
4.7% for fiscal 2012, compared to 5.1% for fiscal 2011.

Our effective income tax rate was 36.0% of pre-tax income for fiscal 2012 compared to 35.9% for
fiscal 2011.

Net income for fiscal 2012 increased by 9.6% to $930.4 million, and diluted earnings per share increased 20.6% to $23.48 from $19.47 in
fiscal 2011. The impact of the fiscal 2012 stock repurchases on diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2012 was an increase of approximately $0.96.

Seasonality and Quarterly Periods

Our business is
somewhat seasonal in nature, with the highest sales typically occurring in the spring and summer months of February through September, in which average weekly per-store sales historically have been about 15% to 25% higher than in the slower months
of December and January. During short periods of time, a store’s sales can be affected by weather conditions. Extremely hot or extremely cold weather may enhance sales by causing parts to fail; thereby increasing sales of seasonal products.
Mild or rainy weather tends to soften sales, as parts failure rates are lower in mild weather, with elective maintenance deferred during periods of rainy weather. Over the longer term, the effects of weather balance out, as we have stores throughout
the United States, Puerto Rico, Mexico and Brazil.

Each of the first three quarters of our fiscal year consists of 12 weeks, and the fourth quarter
consisted of 17 weeks in 2013 and 16 weeks in 2012 and 2011. Because the fourth quarter contains seasonally high sales volume and consists of 16 or 17 weeks, compared with 12 weeks for each of the first three quarters, our fourth quarter represents
a disproportionate share of the annual net sales and net income. The fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013 represented 33.8% of annual sales and 36.5% of net income; the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 represented 32.1% of annual sales and 34.8% of net
income; and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 represented 32.7% of annual sales and 35.5% of net income.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The primary source of our liquidity is our cash flows realized through the sale of automotive parts and products. Net cash provided by operating activities was
$1.415 billion in fiscal 2013, $1.224 billion in fiscal 2012, and $1.292 billion in fiscal 2011. Cash flows from operations are favorable to last year due to the change in inventories net of payables and the growth in net income. We had an accounts
payable to inventory ratio of 115.6% at August 31, 2013, 111.4% at August 25, 2012, and 111.7% at August 27, 2011. Our inventory increases are primarily attributable to our efforts to update product assortments in all of our stores
and an increased number of stores. During fiscal 2013, we initiated a variety of strategic inventory tests focused on increasing inventory availability, which increased our inventory per store. Many of our vendors have supported our initiative to
update our product assortments by providing extended payment terms. These extended payment terms have allowed us to continue our high accounts payable to inventory ratio.

Our primary capital requirement has been the funding of our continued new-store development program. From the beginning of fiscal 2011 to August 31,
2013, we have opened 578 new stores. Net cash flows used in investing activities were $527.3 million in fiscal 2013, compared to $374.8 million in fiscal 2012, and $319.0 million in



fiscal 2011. We invested $414.5 million in capital assets in fiscal 2013, compared to $378.1 million in fiscal 2012, and $321.6 million in fiscal 2011. The increase in capital expenditures during
this time was primarily attributable to the number and types of stores opened and increased investment in our existing stores. New store openings were 197 for fiscal 2013, 193 for fiscal 2012, and 188 for fiscal 2011. Cash flows used in the
acquisition of AutoAnything were $116.1 million during fiscal 2013. There were no acquisitions in fiscal 2012 or fiscal 2011. We invest a portion of our assets held by our wholly owned insurance captive in marketable securities. We purchased $44.5
million of marketable securities in fiscal 2013, $45.7 million in fiscal 2012, and $43.8 million in fiscal 2011. We had proceeds from the sale of marketable securities of $37.9 million in fiscal 2013, $42.4 million in fiscal 2012, and $43.1 million
in fiscal 2011. Capital asset disposals provided proceeds of $9.8 million in fiscal 2013, $6.6 million in fiscal 2012, and $3.3 million in fiscal 2011.

Net cash used in financing activities was $847.0 million in fiscal 2013, $843.4 million in fiscal 2012, and $973.8 million in fiscal 2011. The net cash used
in financing activities reflected purchases of treasury stock which totaled $1.387 billion for fiscal 2013, $1.363 billion for fiscal 2012, and $1.467 billion for fiscal 2011. The treasury stock purchases in fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011 were primarily
funded by cash flows from operations, and by increases in debt levels. Proceeds from issuance of debt were $800 million for fiscal 2013, $500 million for fiscal 2012, and $500 million for fiscal 2011. In fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012, the proceeds
from the issuance of debt were used for the repayment of a portion of commercial paper borrowings and general corporate purposes, including for working capital requirements, capital expenditures, store openings and stock repurchases. Proceeds from
the issuance of debt in fiscal 2013 were also used for the acquisition of AutoAnything. In fiscal 2013, we repaid our $200 million Senior Notes due in June 2013 and our $300 million Senior Notes due in October 2012 using commercial paper borrowings.
There were no repayments of debt in fiscal 2012. In fiscal 2011, we used the proceeds from the issuance of debt to repay our $199.3 million Senior Notes due in November 2010, to repay a portion of our commercial paper borrowings and for general
corporate purposes. In 2013, we received proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and short-term borrowings in the amount of $118.7 million. In 2012, net payments of commercial paper and short-term borrowings were $81.3 million. In 2011, we
received proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and short-term borrowing in the amount of $141.5 million.

During fiscal 2014, we expect to invest
in our business at an increased rate as compared to fiscal 2013. Our investments are expected to be directed primarily to our new-store development program and enhancements to existing stores and infrastructure. The amount of our investments in our
new-store program is impacted by different factors, including such factors as whether the building and land are purchased (requiring higher investment) or leased (generally lower investment), located in the United States, Mexico or Brazil, or
located in urban or rural areas. During fiscal 2013, fiscal 2012, and fiscal 2011, our capital expenditures have increased by approximately 10%, 18% and 2%, respectively, as compared to the prior year. Our mix of store openings has moved away from
build-to-suit leases (lower initial capital investment) to ground leases and land purchases (higher initial capital investment), resulting in increased capital expenditures per store over the previous three years, and we expect this trend to
continue during the fiscal year ending August 30, 2014.

In addition to the building and land costs, our new-store development program requires
working capital, predominantly for inventories. Historically, we have negotiated extended payment terms from suppliers, reducing the working capital required and resulting in a high accounts payable to inventory ratio. We plan to continue leveraging
our inventory purchases; however, our ability to do so may be limited by our vendors’ capacity to factor their receivables from us. Certain vendors participate in financing arrangements with financial institutions whereby they factor their
receivables from us, allowing them to receive payment on our invoices at a discounted rate.

Depending on the timing and magnitude of our future
investments (either in the form of leased or purchased properties or acquisitions), we anticipate that we will rely primarily on internally generated funds and available borrowing capacity to support a majority of our capital expenditures, working
capital requirements and stock repurchases. The balance may be funded through new borrowings. We anticipate that we will be able to obtain such financing in view of our credit ratings and favorable experiences in the debt markets in the past.

Our cash balances are held in various locations around the world. Of the $142.2 million and $103.1 million of cash and cash equivalents at August 31,
2013, and August 25, 2012, respectively, $38.2 million and $7.8 million, respectively, were held outside of the U.S. and were generally utilized to support liquidity needs in our foreign operations. We intend to continue to permanently reinvest
the cash held outside of the U.S. in our foreign operations.



For the fiscal year ended August 31, 2013, our after-tax return on invested capital (“ROIC”) was
32.7% as compared to 33.0% for the comparable prior year period. ROIC is calculated as after-tax operating profit (excluding rent charges) divided by average invested capital (which includes a factor to capitalize operating leases). The decrease in
ROIC is primarily due to the acquisition of AutoAnything. We use ROIC to evaluate whether we are effectively using our capital resources and believe it is an important indicator of our overall operating performance.

Debt Facilities

In September 2011, we amended and
restated our $800 million revolving credit facility, which was scheduled to expire in July 2012. The capacity under the revolving credit facility was increased to $1.0 billion. This credit facility is available to primarily support commercial paper
borrowings, letters of credit and other short-term, unsecured bank loans. The capacity of the credit facility may be increased to $1.250 billion prior to the maturity date at our election and subject to bank credit capacity and approval, may include
up to $200 million in letters of credit, and may include up to $175 million in capital leases each fiscal year. Under the revolving credit facility, we may borrow funds consisting of Eurodollar loans or base rate loans. Interest accrues on
Eurodollar loans at a defined Eurodollar rate, defined as the London InterBank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus the applicable percentage, as defined in the revolving credit facility, depending upon our senior, unsecured, (non-credit enhanced)
long-term debt rating. Interest accrues on base rate loans as defined in the revolving credit facility. We also have the option to borrow funds under the terms of a swingline loan subfacility. The revolving credit facility expires in September 2016.

The revolving credit facility agreement requires that our consolidated interest coverage ratio as of the last day of each quarter shall be no less than
2.50:1. This ratio is defined as the ratio of (i) consolidated earnings before interest, taxes and rents to (ii) consolidated interest expense plus consolidated rents. Our consolidated interest coverage ratio as of August 31, 2013 was
4.68:1.

As of August 31, 2013, $637 million of commercial paper borrowings and $326.3 million of the 6.500% Senior Notes due January 2014 are
classified as long-term in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as we have the ability and intent to refinance on a long-term basis through available capacity in our revolving credit facility. As of August 31, 2013, we had $963.3 million of
availability under our $1.0 billion revolving credit facility, expiring in September 2016 that would allow us to replace these short-term obligations with long-term financing.

In addition to the revolving credit facility, we also maintain a letter of credit facility that allows us to request the participating bank to issue letters
of credit on our behalf up to an aggregate amount of $100 million. As of August 31, 2013, we have $99.4 million in letters of credit outstanding under the letter of credit facility, which expires in June 2016.

In addition to the outstanding letters of credit issued under the committed facilities discussed above, we had $41.8 million in letters of credit outstanding
as of August 31, 2013. These letters of credit have various maturity dates and were issued on an uncommitted basis.

On April 29, 2013, we
issued $500 million in 3.125% Senior Notes due July 2023 under our shelf registration statement filed with the SEC on April 17, 2012 (the “Shelf Registration”). The Shelf Registration allows us to sell an indeterminate amount in debt
securities to fund general corporate purposes, including repaying, redeeming or repurchasing outstanding debt and for working capital, capital expenditures, new store openings, stock repurchases and acquisitions. Proceeds from the debt issuance on
April 29, 2013, were used to repay a portion of the outstanding commercial paper borrowings and for general corporate purposes. We used commercial paper borrowings to repay the $200 million in 4.375% Senior Notes due June 2013.

On November 13, 2012, we issued $300 million in 2.875% Senior Notes due January 2023 under the Shelf Registration. Proceeds from the debt issuance on
November 13, 2012, were used to repay a portion of the outstanding commercial paper borrowings, which were used to repay the $300 million in 5.875% Senior Notes due in October 2012, and for general corporate purposes.



On April 24, 2012, we issued $500 million in 3.700% Senior Notes due April 2022 under the Shelf
Registration. Proceeds from the debt issuance on April 24, 2012, were used to repay a portion of the commercial paper borrowings and for general corporate purposes. On November 15, 2010, we issued $500 million in 4.000% Senior Notes due
2020 under a shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 29, 2008. We used the proceeds from the November 15, 2010 issuance of debt to repay the principal due relating to the 4.750% Senior Notes
that matured on November 15, 2010, to repay a portion of the commercial paper borrowings and for general corporate purposes.

The 5.750% Senior Notes
issued in July 2009 and the 6.500% and 7.125% Senior Notes issued during August 2008, (collectively, the “Notes”), are subject to an interest rate adjustment if the debt ratings assigned to the Notes are downgraded. The Notes, along with
the 3.125% Senior Notes issued in April 2013, the 2.875% Senior Notes issued in November 2012, the 3.700% Senior Notes issued in April 2012 and the 4.000% Senior Notes issued in during November 2010, also contain a provision that repayment of the
notes may be accelerated if we experience a change in control (as defined in the agreements). Our borrowings under our other senior notes contain minimal covenants, primarily restrictions on liens. Under our revolving credit facility, covenants
include limitations on total indebtedness, restrictions on liens, a maximum debt to earnings ratio, and a change of control provision that may require acceleration of the repayment obligations under certain circumstances. These covenants are in
addition to the consolidated interest coverage ratio discussed above. All of the repayment obligations under our borrowing arrangements may be accelerated and come due prior to the scheduled payment date if covenants are breached or an event of
default occurs.

As of August 31, 2013, we were in compliance with all covenants related to our borrowing arrangements and expect to remain in
compliance with those covenants in the future.

For the fiscal year ended August 31, 2013, our adjusted debt to earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation, amortization, rent and share-based compensation expense (“EBITDAR”) ratio was 2.5:1 as compared to 2.5:1 as of the comparable prior year end. We calculate adjusted debt as the sum of total debt, capital lease obligations and
rent times six; and we calculate EBITDAR by adding interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and share-based compensation expense to net income. We target our debt levels to a ratio of adjusted debt to EBITDAR in order to maintain our
investment grade credit ratings. We believe this is important information for the management of our debt levels.

Stock Repurchases

During 1998, we announced a program permitting us to repurchase a portion of our outstanding shares not to exceed a dollar maximum established by our Board of
Directors (the “Board”). On June 11, 2013, the Board voted to increase the authorization by $750 million to raise the cumulative share repurchase authorization from $12.65 billion to $13.40 billion. From January 1998 to
August 31, 2013, we have repurchased a total of 134.6 million shares at an aggregate cost of $12.93 billion. We repurchased 3.5 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $1.39 billion during fiscal 2013, 3.8 million
shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $1.36 billion during fiscal 2012, and 5.6 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $1.47 billion during fiscal 2011. Considering cumulative repurchases as of August 31, 2013, we
have $468.4 million remaining under the Board of Director’s authorization to repurchase our common stock.

Subsequent to August 31, 2013, we
have repurchased 355,150 shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $149.8 million.

Self-insurance reserves reflect estimates based on actuarial calculations. Although these obligations do not have scheduled maturities, the timing of future payments are predictable based upon historical patterns.
Accordingly, we reflect the net present value of these obligations in our consolidated balance sheets.

We have pension obligations
reflected in our consolidated balance sheets that are not reflected in the table above due to the absence of scheduled maturities and the nature of the account. During fiscal 2013, we made contributions of $16.9 million to the pension plan. We
expect to make contributions of approximately $4 million during fiscal 2014; however a change to the expected cash funding may be impacted by a change in interest rates or a change in the actual or expected return on plan assets.

As of August 31, 2013, our defined benefit obligation associated with our pension plans is $256.8 million and our pension assets are valued at $208.1
million, resulting in a net pension obligation of $48.7 million. Amounts recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss are $83.6 million at August 31, 2013. The balance in Accumulated other comprehensive loss will be amortized into pension
expense in the future, unless the losses are recovered in future periods through actuarial gains.

Additionally, our tax liability for uncertain tax
positions, including interest and penalties, was $35.4 million at August 31, 2013. Approximately $2.2 million is classified as current liabilities and $33.2 million is classified as long-term liabilities. We did not reflect these obligations in
the table above as we are unable to make an estimate of the timing of payments due to uncertainties in the timing and amounts of the settlement of these tax positions.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

“Selected Financial Data” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” include certain
financial measures not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). These non-GAAP financial measures provide additional information for determining our optimum capital structure and are used to assist
management in evaluating performance and in making appropriate business decisions to maximize stockholders’ value.

Non-GAAP financial measures
should not be used as a substitute for GAAP financial measures, or considered in isolation, for the purpose of analyzing our operating performance, financial position or cash flows. However, we have presented the non-GAAP financial measures, as we
believe they provide additional information that is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly our comparative year-to-year operating results. Furthermore, our management and Compensation Committee of the Board use the above-mentioned non-GAAP
financial measures to analyze and compare our underlying operating results and use select measurements to determine payments of performance-based compensation. We have included a reconciliation of this information to the most comparable GAAP
measures in the following reconciliation tables.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measure: Adjusted Debt to EBITDAR

The following table calculates the ratio of adjusted debt to EBITDAR. Adjusted debt to EBITDAR is calculated as the sum of total debt, capital lease

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

See Note A of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion on recent accounting pronouncements.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Preparation
of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period and related disclosures of contingent liabilities. In the notes to our consolidated financial statements, we describe our significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Our policies are evaluated on
an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ under different assumptions or conditions. Our senior management has identified the
critical accounting policies for the areas that are materially impacted by estimates and assumptions and have discussed such policies with the Audit Committee of our Board. The following items in our consolidated financial statements represent our
critical accounting policies that require significant estimation or judgment by management:

Inventory Reserves and Cost of Sales

LIFO

We state our inventories at the lower of cost or
market using the last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) method for domestic merchandise and the first-in, first out (“FIFO”) method for Mexico inventories. Due to price deflation on our merchandise purchases, our domestic inventory balances
are effectively maintained under the FIFO method. We do not write up inventory for favorable LIFO adjustments, and due to price deflation, LIFO costs of our domestic inventories exceed replacement costs by $283.7 million at August 31, 2013,
calculated using the dollar value method.



Inventory Obsolescence and Shrinkage

Our inventory, primarily hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and non-automotive products, is used on vehicles that have rather long lives; and
therefore, the risk of obsolescence is minimal and the majority of excess inventory has historically been returned to our vendors for credit. In the isolated instances where less than full credit will be received for such returns and where we
anticipate that items will be sold at retail prices that are less than recorded costs, we record a charge (less than $20 million in each of the last three years) through cost of sales for the difference. These charges are based on management’s
judgment, including estimates and assumptions regarding marketability of products and the market value of inventory to be sold in future periods.

Historically, we have not encountered material exposure to inventory obsolescence or excess inventory, nor have we experienced material changes to our
estimates. However, we may be exposed to material losses should our vendors alter their policy with regard to accepting excess inventory returns.

Additionally, we reduce inventory for projected losses related to shrinkage, which is estimated based on historical losses and current inventory loss trends
resulting from previous physical inventories. Shrinkage may occur due to theft, loss or inaccurate records for the receipt of goods, among other things. Throughout the year, we take physical inventory counts of our stores and distribution centers to
verify these estimates. We make assumptions regarding upcoming physical inventory counts that may differ from actual results. Over the last three years, there has been less than a 50 basis point fluctuation in our shrinkage rate.

Each quarter, we evaluate the accrued shrinkage in light of the actual shrink results. To the extent our actual physical inventory count results differ from
our estimates, we may experience material adjustments to our financial statements. Historically, we have not experienced material adjustments to our shrinkage estimates and do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a
material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use.

A 10% difference in our inventory reserves as of August 31, 2013, would have affected
net income by approximately $6 million in fiscal 2013.

Vendor Allowances

We receive various payments and allowances from our vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements, including allowances for warranties, advertising
and general promotion of vendor products. Vendor allowances are treated as a reduction of inventory, unless they are provided as a reimbursement of specific, incremental, identifiable costs incurred by the Company in selling the vendor’s
products. Approximately 87% of the vendor funds received are recorded as a reduction of the cost of inventories and recognized as a reduction to cost of sales as these inventories are sold.

Based on our vendor agreements, a significant portion of vendor funding we receive is based on our inventory purchases. Therefore, we record receivables for
funding earned but not yet received as we purchase inventory. During the year, we regularly review the receivables from vendors to ensure vendors are able to meet their obligations. We generally have not recorded a reserve against these receivables
as we have legal right of offset with our vendors for payments owed them. Historically, we have had write-offs less than $500 thousand in each of the last three years.

Goodwill and Intangibles

We evaluate goodwill and
indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values exceeds the current fair value. We evaluate the likelihood of impairment by
considering qualitative factors, such as macroeconomic, industry, market, or any other factors that could impact the reporting unit’s fair value. If these factors indicate impairment, we perform a quantitative assessment to determine if the
carrying value exceeds the fair value. Goodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level and involves valuation methods including forecasting future financial performance, estimates of discount rates, and other factors. If the carrying value of the
reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the fair value, we recognize an impairment loss.

Indefinite-lived intangibles are evaluated by comparing the
carrying amount of the asset to the future discounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate. If the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset



exceeds the fair value based on the future discounted cash flows, we recognize an impairment loss. These impairment analyses require a significant amount of subjective judgment by management, and
as a result these estimates are uncertain and our actual results may be different from our estimates.

The carrying value of goodwill at August 31,
2013 and August 25, 2012 was $367.8 million and $302.6 million, respectively. During fiscal fourth quarter of 2013, we recorded an $18.3 million goodwill impairment charge in our Other business activities related to the goodwill of AutoAnything
and a $4.1 million impairment charge to AutoAnything’s trade name. The $4.1 million impairment charge resulted in a remaining carrying value of $24.6 million at August 31, 2013. No indefinite-lived intangible amounts were recorded at
August 25, 2012. We also determined AutoAnything is not likely to achieve the operating income targets necessary to earn the contingent consideration. Therefore, these impairment charges were offset by an adjustment of $23.3 million to the
contingent consideration liability to reflect its fair value at August 31, 2013. No impairment charges were recognized in our Other business activities in previous fiscal years. No impairment charges were recognized in the Auto Parts Stores
reporting segment during fiscal 2013 or in previous fiscal years. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to evaluate goodwill or indefinite-lived
intangibles.

Self-Insurance Reserves

We retain a
significant portion of the risks associated with workers’ compensation, employee health, general and products liability, property and vehicle liability; and we obtain third party insurance to limit the exposure related to certain of these
risks. Our self-insurance reserve estimates totaled $190.2 million at August 31, 2013, and $175.8 million at August 25, 2012. This change is primarily reflective of our growing operations, including inflation, increases in health care
costs, the number of vehicles and the number of hours worked, as well as our historical claims experience and changes in our discount rate.

The
assumptions made by management in estimating our self-insurance reserves include consideration of historical cost experience, judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim and retention levels. We utilize various methods,
including analyses of historical trends and actuarial methods, to estimate the cost to settle reported claims, and claims incurred but not yet reported. The actuarial methods develop estimates of the future ultimate claim costs based on the claims
incurred as of the balance sheet date. When estimating these liabilities, we consider factors, such as the severity, duration and frequency of claims, legal costs associated with claims, healthcare trends, and projected inflation of related factors.
In recent history, our methods for determining our exposure have remained consistent, and our historical trends have been appropriately factored into our reserve estimates. As we obtain additional information and refine our methods regarding the
assumptions and estimates we use to recognize liabilities incurred, we will adjust our reserves accordingly.

Management believes that the various
assumptions developed and actuarial methods used to determine our self-insurance reserves are reasonable and provide meaningful data and information that management uses to make its best estimate of our exposure to these risks. Arriving at these
estimates, however, requires a significant amount of subjective judgment by management, and as a result these estimates are uncertain and our actual exposure may be different from our estimates. For example, changes in our assumptions about health
care costs, the severity of accidents and the incidence of illness, the average size of claims and other factors could cause actual claim costs to vary materially from our assumptions and estimates, causing our reserves to be overstated or
understated. For instance, a 10% change in our self-insurance liability would have affected net income by approximately $12 million for fiscal 2013.

Our
liabilities for workers’ compensation, certain general and product liability, property and vehicle claims do not have scheduled maturities; however, the timing of future payments is predictable based on historical patterns and is relied upon in
determining the current portion of these liabilities. Accordingly, we reflect the net present value of the obligations we determine to be long-term using the risk-free interest rate as of the balance sheet date. If the discount rate used to
calculate the present value of these reserves changed by 50 basis points, net income would have been affected by approximately $2 million for fiscal 2013. Our liability for health benefits is classified as current, as the historical average duration
of claims is approximately six weeks.

Income Taxes

Our income tax returns are audited by state, federal and foreign tax authorities, and we are typically engaged in various tax examinations at any given time.
Tax contingencies often arise due to uncertainty or differing interpretations of the application of tax rules throughout the various jurisdictions in which we operate. The



contingencies are influenced by items such as tax audits, changes in tax laws, litigation, appeals and prior experience with similar tax positions. We regularly review our tax reserves for these
items and assess the adequacy of the amount we have recorded. As of August 31, 2013, we had approximately $35.4 million reserved for uncertain tax positions.

We evaluate potential exposures associated with our various tax filings by estimating a liability for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The
first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or
litigation processes, if any. The second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement.

We believe our estimates to be reasonable and have not experienced material adjustments to our reserves in the previous three years; however, actual results
could differ from our estimates, and we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material. Specifically, management has used judgment and made assumptions to estimate the likely outcome of uncertain tax positions. Additionally, to the extent
we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established, or must pay in excess of recognized reserves, our effective tax rate in any particular period could be materially affected.

Pension Obligation

Prior to January 1, 2003,
substantially all full-time employees were covered by a qualified defined benefit pension plan. The benefits under the plan were based on years of service and the employee’s highest consecutive five-year average compensation. On January 1,
2003, the plan was frozen. Accordingly, pension plan participants will earn no new benefits under the plan formula and no new participants will join the pension plan. On January 1, 2003, our supplemental, unqualified defined benefit pension
plan for certain highly compensated employees was also frozen. Accordingly, plan participants will earn no new benefits under the plan formula and no new participants will join the pension plan. As the plan benefits are frozen, the annual pension
expense and recorded liabilities are not impacted by increases in future compensation levels, but are impacted by the use of two key assumptions in the calculation of these balances:

Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets:

For the fiscal year ended August 31, 2013, we have assumed a 7.5% long-term rate
of return on our plan assets. This estimate is a judgmental matter in which management considers the composition of our asset portfolio, our historical long-term investment performance and current market conditions. We review the expected long-term
rate of return on an annual basis, and revise it accordingly. Additionally, we monitor the mix of investments in our portfolio to ensure alignment with our long-term strategy to manage pension cost and reduce volatility in our assets. At
August 31, 2013, our plan assets totaled $208 million in our qualified plan. Our assets are generally valued using the net asset values, which are determined by valuing investments at the closing price or last trade reported on the major market
on which the individual securities are traded. We have no assets in our nonqualified plan. A 50 basis point change in our expected long term rate of return would impact annual pension expense by approximately $1 million for the qualified plan.

Discount rate used to determine benefit obligations:

This rate is highly sensitive and is adjusted annually based on the interest rate
for long-term, high-quality, corporate bonds as of the measurement date using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities. This same discount rate is also used to determine pension expense for the following
plan year. For fiscal 2013, we assumed a discount rate of 5.2%. A decrease in the discount rate increases our projected benefit obligation and pension expense. A 50 basis point change in the discount rate at August 31, 2013 would impact annual
pension expense/income by approximately $2 million for the qualified plan and $30 thousand for the nonqualified plan.



Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

We are exposed to market risk from, among other things, changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and fuel prices. From time to time, we use various
derivative instruments to reduce interest rate and fuel price risks. To date, based upon our current level of foreign operations, no derivative instruments have been utilized to reduce foreign exchange rate risk. All of our hedging activities are
governed by guidelines that are authorized by the Board. Further, we do not buy or sell derivative instruments for trading purposes.

Interest Rate
Risk

Our financial market risk results primarily from changes in interest rates. At times, we reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates by
entering into various interest rate hedge instruments such as interest rate swap contracts, treasury lock agreements and forward-starting interest rate swaps.

We have historically utilized interest rate swaps to convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt and to lock in fixed rates on future debt issuances. We
reflect the current fair value of all interest rate hedge instruments as a component of either other current assets or accrued expenses and other. Our interest rate hedge instruments are designated as cash flow hedges.

Unrealized gains and losses on interest rate hedges are deferred in stockholders’ deficit as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss. These
deferred gains and losses are recognized in income as a decrease or increase to interest expense in the period in which the related cash flows being hedged are recognized in expense. However, to the extent that the change in value of an interest
rate hedge instrument does not perfectly offset the change in the value of the cash flow being hedged, that ineffective portion is immediately recognized in earnings.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, we entered into two treasury rate locks, each with a notional amount of $100 million. These agreements were cash
flow hedges used to hedge the exposure to variability in future cash flows resulting from changes in variable interest rates related to the $300 million Senior Note debt issuance in November 2012. The fixed rates of the hedges were 2.07% and 1.92%
and were benchmarked based on the 10-year U.S. treasury notes. These locks expired on November 1, 2012 and resulted in a loss of $5.1 million, which has been deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive loss and will be reclassified to Interest
expense over the life of the underlying debt. The hedges remained highly effective until they expired, and no ineffectiveness was recognized in earnings.

During the third quarter of fiscal 2012, we entered into two treasury rate locks. These agreements were designated as cash flow hedges and were used to hedge
the exposure to variability in future cash flows resulting from changes in variable interest rates related to the $500 million Senior Note debt issuance in April 2012. The treasury rate locks had notional amounts of $300 million and $100 million
with associated fixed rates of 2.09% and 2.07% respectively. The locks were benchmarked based on the 10-year U.S. treasury notes. These locks expired on April 20, 2012 and resulted in a loss of $2.8 million, which has been deferred in
Accumulated other comprehensive loss and will be reclassified to Interest expense over the life of the underlying debt. The hedges remained highly effective until they expired, and no ineffectiveness was recognized in earnings.

The fair value of our debt was estimated at $4.259 billion as of August 31, 2013, and $4.055 billion as of August 25, 2012, based on the quoted
market prices for the same or similar debt issues or on the current rates available to us for debt having the same remaining maturities. Such fair value is greater than the carrying value of debt by $72.2 million and $286.6 million at
August 31, 2013 and August 25, 2012, respectively. We had $637.0 million of variable rate debt outstanding at August 31, 2013, and $518.2 million of variable rate debt outstanding at August 25, 2012. In fiscal 2013, at this
borrowing level for variable rate debt, a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have had an unfavorable impact on our pre-tax earnings and cash flows of approximately $6 million. The primary interest rate exposure on variable
rate debt is based on LIBOR. We had outstanding fixed rate debt of $3.550 billion at August 31, 2013, and $3.250 billion at August 25, 2012. A one percentage point increase in interest rates would reduce the fair value of our fixed rate
debt by approximately $128.4 million at August 31, 2013.

Fuel Price Risk

From time to time, we utilize fuel swap contracts in order to lower fuel cost volatility in our operating results. Historically, the instruments were executed
to economically hedge a portion of our diesel and unleaded fuel



exposure. However, we have not designated the fuel swap contracts as hedging instruments; and therefore, the contracts have not qualified for hedge accounting treatment. We did not enter into any
fuel swap contracts during fiscal 2013, fiscal 2012 or fiscal 2011.

Foreign Currency Risk

Foreign currency exposures arising from transactions include firm commitments and anticipated transactions denominated in a currency other than our
entities’ functional currencies. To minimize our risk, we generally enter into transactions denominated in the respective functional currencies. Foreign currency exposures arising from transactions denominated in currencies other than
the functional currency are not material.

We are exposed to euros, Canadian dollars, and Brazilian reals, but our primary foreign currency exposure
arises from Mexican peso-denominated revenues and profits and their translation into U.S. dollars.

We view our investments in Mexican subsidiaries as
long-term. As a result, we generally do not hedge these net investments. The net asset exposure in the Mexican subsidiaries translated into U.S. dollars using the year-end exchange rates was $378.7 million at August 31, 2013 and
$315.7 million at August 25, 2012. The year-end exchange rates with respect to the Mexican peso decreased by approximately 1.1% with respect to the U.S. dollar during fiscal 2013 and decreased by approximately 6.2% during fiscal 2012. The
potential loss in value of our net assets in the Mexican subsidiaries resulting from a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates at August 31, 2013 and August 25, 2012, amounted to approximately $34
million and approximately $29 million, respectively. Any changes in our net assets in the Mexican subsidiaries relating to foreign currency exchange rates would be reflected in the foreign currency translation component of Accumulated other
comprehensive loss, unless the Mexican subsidiaries are sold or otherwise disposed. A hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in average exchange rates would not have a material impact on our results of operations.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Our internal control over financial reporting includes, among other things, defined policies and procedures for conducting and governing our business, sophisticated information systems for
processing transactions and properly trained staff. Mechanisms are in place to monitor the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, including regular testing performed by the Company’s internal audit team, which is
comprised of Company personnel. Actions are taken to correct deficiencies as they are identified. Our procedures for financial reporting include the active involvement of senior management, our Audit Committee and a staff of highly qualified
financial and legal professionals.

Management, with the participation of our principal executive and financial officers, assessed our internal control
over financial reporting as of August 31, 2013, the end of our fiscal year. Management based its assessment on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission 1992 framework.

Based on this assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective
as of August 31, 2013.

Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, audited the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting. Ernst & Young LLP’s attestation report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2013 is included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of AutoZone, Inc.

We
have audited AutoZone, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission 1992 framework (the “COSO criteria”). AutoZone, Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on AutoZone, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting based on our
audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in
the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, AutoZone, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of August 31, 2013, based on the COSO criteria

.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of AutoZone, Inc. as of August 31, 2013 and August 25, 2012, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’
deficit, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended August 31, 2013 of AutoZone, Inc. and our report dated October 28, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
AutoZone, Inc. as of August 31, 2013 and August 25, 2012, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended August 31, 2013, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note A – Significant Accounting Policies

Business:

AutoZone, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (“AutoZone” or the “Company”) are principally a
retailer and distributor of automotive parts and accessories. At the end of fiscal 2013, the Company operated 4,836 stores in the United States (“U.S.”), including Puerto Rico; 362 stores in Mexico; and three stores in Brazil. Each store
carries an extensive product line for cars, sport utility vehicles, vans and light trucks, including new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and non-automotive products. In 3,421 of the domestic stores, select
stores in Mexico, and the stores in Brazil, at the end of fiscal 2013, the Company had a commercial sales program that provides commercial credit and prompt delivery of parts and other products to local, regional and national repair garages,
dealers, service stations and public sector accounts. The Company also sells the ALLDATA brand automotive diagnostic and repair software through www.alldata.com. Additionally, the Company sells automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories,
and non-automotive products through www.autozone.com, and accessories and performance parts through www.autoanything.com, and its commercial customers can make purchases through www.autozonepro.com. The Company does not derive revenue from
automotive repair or installation services.

Fiscal Year:

The Company’s fiscal year consists of 52 or 53 weeks ending on the last Saturday in
August. Fiscal 2013 represented 53 weeks and fiscal 2012 and 2011 represented 52 weeks.

Basis of Presentation:

The consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of AutoZone, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

Use of Estimates:

Management of the Company has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the
disclosure of contingent liabilities to prepare these financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Cash and Cash
Equivalents:

Cash equivalents consist of investments with original maturities of 90 days or less at the date of purchase. Cash equivalents include proceeds due from credit and debit card transactions with settlement terms of less than 5 days.
Credit and debit card receivables included within cash and cash equivalents were $39.8 million at August 31, 2013 and $34.0 million at August 25, 2012.

Cash balances are held in various locations around the world. Of the $142.2 million and $103.1 million of cash and cash equivalents at August 31, 2013,
and August 25, 2012, respectively, $38.2 million and $7.8 million, respectively, were held outside of the U.S. and were generally utilized to support liquidity needs in foreign operations. The Company intends to continue to permanently reinvest
the cash held outside of the U.S. in its foreign operations.

Accounts Receivable:

Accounts receivable consists of receivables from commercial
customers and vendors, and are presented net of an allowance for uncollectible accounts. AutoZone routinely grants credit to certain of its commercial customers. The risk of credit loss in its trade receivables is substantially mitigated by the
Company’s credit evaluation process, short collection terms and sales to a large number of customers, as well as the low dollar value per transaction for most of its sales. Allowances for potential credit losses are determined based on
historical experience and current evaluation of the composition of accounts receivable. Historically, credit losses have been within management’s expectations and the allowances for uncollectible accounts were $2.9 million at August 31,
2013, and $2.4 million at August 25, 2012.

Merchandise Inventories:

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using the last-in,
first-out method for domestic inventories and the first-in, first out (“FIFO”) method for Mexico inventories. Included in inventory are related purchasing, storage and handling costs. Due to price deflation on the Company’s
merchandise purchases, the Company’s domestic inventory balances are effectively maintained under the FIFO method. The Company’s policy is not to write up inventory in excess of replacement cost. The cumulative balance of this unrecorded
adjustment, which will be reduced upon experiencing price inflation on our merchandise purchases, was $283.7 million at August 31, 2013, and $270.4 million at August 25, 2012.



Marketable Securities:

The Company invests a portion of its assets held by the Company’s wholly owned
insurance captive in marketable debt securities and classifies them as available-for-sale. The Company includes these securities within the Other current assets and Other long-term assets captions in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and
records the amounts at fair market value, which is determined using quoted market prices at the end of the reporting period. A discussion of marketable securities is included in “Note E – Fair Value Measurements” and “Note F
– Marketable Securities.”

Property and Equipment:

Property and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are computed
principally using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: buildings, 40 to 50 years; building improvements, 5 to 15 years; equipment, 3 to 10 years; and leasehold improvements, over the shorter of the asset’s
estimated useful life or the remaining lease term, which includes any reasonably assured renewal periods. Depreciation and amortization include amortization of assets under capital lease.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets:

The Company evaluates the recoverability of its long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. When such an event occurs, the Company compares the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows of the asset (asset group) with the carrying amounts of the asset. If the undiscounted
expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets, the Company measures the amount of impairment loss as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. There were no material
impairment losses recorded in the three years ended August 31, 2013.

Goodwill:

The cost in excess of fair value of identifiable net assets of
businesses acquired is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill has not been amortized since fiscal 2001, but an analysis is performed at least annually to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying amount to determine if any impairment
exists. The Company performs its annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, unless circumstances dictate more frequent assessments. Refer to “Note N – Goodwill and Intangibles” for additional disclosures
regarding the Company’s goodwill and impairment assessment.

Intangible Assets:

Intangible assets consist of assets from the acquisition of
AutoAnything, and include technology, noncompete agreements, customer relationships and trade name. Intangible assets are amortized over periods ranging from 5 to 10 years. Non-amortizing intangibles are reviewed at least annually for impairment by
comparing the carrying amount to fair value. The Company performs its annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, unless circumstances dictate more frequent assessments. Refer to “Note N – Goodwill and
Intangibles” for additional disclosures regarding the Company’s intangible assets and impairment assessment.

Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities:

AutoZone is exposed to market risk from, among other things, changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and fuel prices. From time to time, the Company uses various derivative instruments to reduce such risks. To date,
based upon the Company’s current level of foreign operations, no derivative instruments have been utilized to reduce foreign exchange rate risk. All of the Company’s hedging activities are governed by guidelines that are authorized by
AutoZone’s Board of Directors (the “Board”). Further, the Company does not buy or sell derivative instruments for trading purposes.

AutoZone’s financial market risk results primarily from changes in interest rates. At times, AutoZone reduces its exposure to changes in interest rates
by entering into various interest rate hedge instruments such as interest rate swap contracts, treasury lock agreements and forward-starting interest rate swaps. All of the Company’s interest rate hedge instruments are designated as cash flow
hedges. Refer to “Note H – Derivative Financial Instruments” for additional disclosures regarding the Company’s derivative instruments and hedging activities. Cash flows related to these instruments designated as qualifying
hedges are reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the same categories as the cash flows from the items being hedged. Accordingly, cash flows relating to the settlement of interest rate derivatives hedging the
forecasted issuance of debt have been reflected upon settlement as a component of financing cash flows. The resulting gain or loss from such settlement is deferred to Accumulated other comprehensive loss and reclassified to interest expense over the
term of the underlying debt. This reclassification of the deferred gains and losses impacts the interest expense recognized on the underlying debt that was hedged and is therefore reflected as a component of operating cash flows in periods
subsequent to settlement.



Foreign Currency:

The Company accounts for its Mexican and Brazilian operations using the Mexican peso and
the Brazilian real as the functional currencies and converts its financial statements from these currencies to U.S. dollars. The cumulative loss on currency translation is recorded as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss and
approximated $62.5 million at August 31, 2013, and $50.3 million at August 25, 2012.

Self-Insurance Reserves:

The Company retains a
significant portion of the risks associated with workers’ compensation, employee health, general, products liability, property and vehicle insurance. Through various methods, which include analyses of historical trends and utilization of
actuaries, the Company estimates the costs of these risks. The costs are accrued based upon the aggregate of the liability for reported claims and an estimated liability for claims incurred but not reported. Estimates are based on calculations that
consider historical lag and claim development factors. The long-term portions of these liabilities are recorded at the Company’s estimate of their net present value.

Deferred Rent:

The Company recognizes rent expense on a straight-line basis over the course of the lease term, which includes any reasonably assured
renewal periods, beginning on the date the Company takes physical possession of the property (see “Note O – Leases”). Differences between this calculated expense and cash payments are recorded as a liability within the Accrued
expenses and other and Other long-term liabilities captions in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, based on the terms of the lease. Deferred rent approximated $96.5 million as of August 31, 2013, and $86.9 million as of
August 25, 2012.

Financial Instruments:

The Company has financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable,
other current assets and accounts payable. The carrying amounts of these financial instruments approximate fair value because of their short maturities. A discussion of the carrying values and fair values of the Company’s debt is included in
“Note I – Financing,” marketable securities is included in “Note F – Marketable Securities,” and derivatives is included in “Note H – Derivative Financial Instruments.”

Income Taxes:

The Company accounts for income taxes under the liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences
between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Our effective tax rate is based on income by tax
jurisdiction, statutory rates, and tax saving initiatives available to the Company in the various jurisdictions in which we operate.

The Company
recognizes liabilities for uncertain income tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that
the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step requires the Company to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be
realized upon ultimate settlement. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as the Company must determine the probability of various possible outcomes. The Company reevaluates these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly
basis or when new information becomes available to management. These reevaluations are based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, successfully settled issues under audit, expirations due to
statutes, and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an increase to the tax accrual.

The Company classifies interest related to income tax liabilities, and if applicable, penalties, as a component of Income tax expense. The income tax
liabilities and accrued interest and penalties that are expected to be payable within one year of the balance sheet date are presented within the Accrued expenses and other caption in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The remaining
portion of the income tax liabilities and accrued interest and penalties are presented within the Other long-term liabilities caption in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets because payment of cash is not anticipated within one year of the
balance sheet date. Refer to “Note D – Income Taxes” for additional disclosures regarding the Company’s income taxes.

Sales and
Use Taxes:

Governmental authorities assess sales and use taxes on the sale of goods and services. The Company excludes taxes collected from customers in its reported sales results; such amounts are included within the Accrued expenses and other
caption until remitted to the taxing authorities.



Dividends:

The Company currently does not pay a dividend on its common stock. The ability to pay dividends
is subject to limitations imposed by Nevada law. Under Nevada law, any future payment of dividends would be dependent upon the Company’s financial condition, capital requirements, earnings and cash flow.

Revenue Recognition:

The Company recognizes sales at the time the sale is made and the product is delivered to the customer. Revenue from sales are
presented net of allowances for estimated sales returns, which are based on historical return rates.

A portion of the Company’s transactions include
the sale of auto parts that contain a core component. The core component represents the recyclable portion of the auto part. Customers are not charged for the core component of the new part if a used core is returned at the point of sale of the new
part; otherwise the Company charges customers a specified amount for the core component. The Company refunds that same amount upon the customer returning a used core to the store at a later date. The Company does not recognize sales or cost of sales
for the core component of these transactions when a used part is returned or expected to be returned from the customer.

Vendor Allowances and
Advertising Costs:

The Company receives various payments and allowances from its vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements. Monies received from vendors include rebates, allowances and promotional funds. The amounts to be received
are subject to the terms of the vendor agreements, which generally do not state an expiration date, but are subject to ongoing negotiations that may be impacted in the future based on changes in market conditions, vendor marketing strategies and
changes in the profitability or sell-through of the related merchandise.

Rebates and other miscellaneous incentives are earned based on purchases or
product sales and are accrued ratably over the purchase or sale of the related product. These monies are generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise inventories and are recognized as a reduction to cost of sales as the related inventories are
sold.

For arrangements that provide for reimbursement of specific, incremental, identifiable costs incurred by the Company in selling the vendors’
products, the vendor funds are recorded as a reduction to Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses in the period in which the specific costs were incurred.

The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising expense, net of vendor promotional funds, was $83.7 million in fiscal 2013, $74.7 million in
fiscal 2012, and $71.5 million in fiscal 2011. Vendor promotional funds, which reduced advertising expense, amounted to $24.4 million in fiscal 2013, $19.7 million in fiscal 2012, and $23.2 million in fiscal 2011.

Cost of Sales and Operating, Selling, General and Administrative Expenses:

The following illustrates the primary costs classified in each major expense
category:

Cost of Sales

•

Total cost of merchandise sold, including:

•

Freight expenses associated with moving merchandise inventories from the Company’s vendors to the distribution centers;

•

Vendor allowances that are not reimbursements for specific, incremental and identifiable costs

•

Costs associated with operating the Company’s supply chain, including payroll and benefit costs, warehouse occupancy costs, transportation costs and depreciation; and

•

Inventory shrinkage

Operating, Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

•

Payroll and benefit costs for store and store support employees;

•

Occupancy costs of store and store support facilities;

•

Depreciation and amortization related to retail and store support assets;

•

Transportation costs associated with commercial and hub deliveries;

•

Advertising;

•

Self insurance costs; and

•

Other administrative costs, such as credit card transaction fees, supplies, and travel and lodging



Warranty Costs:

The Company or the vendors supplying its products provides the Company’s customers
limited warranties on certain products that range from 30 days to lifetime. In most cases, the Company’s vendors are primarily responsible for warranty claims. Warranty costs relating to merchandise sold under warranty not covered by vendors
are estimated and recorded as warranty obligations at the time of sale based on each product’s historical return rate. These obligations, which are often funded by vendor allowances, are recorded within the Accrued expenses and other caption in
the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For vendor allowances that are in excess of the related estimated warranty expense for the vendor’s products, the excess is recorded in inventory and recognized as a reduction to cost of sales as the related
inventory is sold.

Shipping and Handling Costs:

The Company does not generally charge customers separately for shipping and handling.
Substantially all the costs the Company incurs to ship products to our stores are included in cost of sales.

Pre-opening Expenses:

Pre-opening
expenses, which consist primarily of payroll and occupancy costs, are expensed as incurred.

Earnings per Share:

Basic earnings per share is based
on the weighted average outstanding common shares. Diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted average outstanding common shares adjusted for the effect of common stock equivalents, which are primarily stock options. There were 8,600 stock
options excluded from the diluted earnings per share computation that would have been anti-dilutive as of August 31, 2013. There were 30,000 options excluded for the year ended August 25, 2012, and no options excluded for the year ended
August 27, 2011.

Share-Based Payments:

Share-based payments include stock option grants and certain other transactions under the
Company’s stock plans. The Company recognizes compensation expense for its share-based payments based on the fair value of the awards. See “Note B – Share-Based Payments” for further discussion.

Risk and Uncertainties:

In fiscal 2013, one class of similar products accounted for 10 percent of the Company’s total revenues, and no vendor
supplied more than 10 percent of the Company’s total purchases.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements:

In August 2011, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2011-08,

Intangibles – Goodwill and Other,

which amends Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 350,

Intangibles
– Goodwill and Other

. The purpose of ASU 2011-08 is to simplify how an entity tests goodwill for impairment. Entities will assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is
less than its carrying value. In instances where the fair value is determined to be less than the carrying value, entities will perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. The Company adopted this standard effective August 31,
2013, and it had no impact on the consolidated financial statements.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements:

In July 2012, the FASB issued ASU
2012-02,

Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment.

The purpose of ASU 2012-02 is to simplify how an entity tests for impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets. Entities will assess qualitative factors to determine
whether it is more likely than not that a long-lived intangible asset’s fair value is less than its carrying value. In instances where the fair value is determined to be less than the carrying value, entities will perform the two-step
quantitative goodwill impairment test. The Company does not expect the provision of ASU 2012-02 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. This update will be effective for the Company at the beginning of its fiscal 2014
year.

In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-02,

Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income

. Under ASU
2013-02, an entity is required to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) by component. In addition, an entity is required to present, either on the face of the financial
statements or in the notes, significant amounts reclassified out of AOCI by the respective line items of net income, but only if the amount reclassified is required to be reclassified in its entirety in the same reporting period. For amounts that
are not required to be reclassified in their entirety to net income, an entity is required to cross-reference to other disclosures that provide additional details about those amounts. ASU 2013-02 does not change the current requirements for
reporting net income or other comprehensive income in the financial statements. The Company does not expect the provision of ASU 2013-02 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. This update will be effective for the
Company at the beginning of its fiscal 2014 year.



In July 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-11,

Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a
Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists.

Under ASU 2013-11, an entity is required to disclose a liability related to an unrecognized tax benefit as an offset against a deferred tax asset
for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss or tax credit carryforward if certain criteria are met. In situations of a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward is not available at the reporting
date under the tax law of the jurisdiction or the tax law of the jurisdiction does not require, and the entity does not intend to use, the deferred tax asset for such purpose, the unrecognized tax benefit will be presented in the financial
statements as a liability and will not be combined with deferred tax assets. The Company does not expect the provision of ASU 2013-11 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. This update will be effective for the Company
at the beginning of its fiscal 2015 year.

Note B – Share-Based Payments

Total share-based compensation expense (a component of Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses) was $37.3 million for fiscal
2013, $33.4 million for fiscal 2012, and $26.6 million for fiscal 2011. As of August 31, 2013, share-based compensation expense for unvested awards not yet recognized in earnings is $25.9 million and will be recognized over a weighted average
period of 2.5 years. Tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost are classified as a financing cash inflow.

On December 15, 2010, the
Company’s stockholders approved the 2011 Equity Incentive Award Plan (the “2011 Plan”), allowing the Company to provide equity-based compensation to non-employee directors and employees for their service to AutoZone or its
subsidiaries or affiliates. Under the 2011 Plan, participants may receive equity-based compensation in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, dividend equivalents, deferred stock, stock
payments, performance share awards and other incentive awards structured by the Board and the Compensation Committee of the Board. Prior to the Company’s adoption of the 2011 Plan, equity-based compensation was provided to employees under the
2006 Stock Option Plan and to non-employee directors under the 2003 Director Compensation Plan (the “2003 Comp Plan”) and the 2003 Director Stock Option Plan (the “2003 Option Plan”).

The Company grants options to purchase common stock to certain of its employees under its plan at prices equal to the market value of the stock on the date of
grant. Options have a term of 10 years or 10 years and one day from grant date. Employee options generally vest in equal annual installments on the first, second, third and fourth anniversaries of the grant date and generally have 30 or 90 days
after the service relationship ends, or one year after death, to exercise all vested options. The fair value of each option grant is separately estimated for each vesting date. The fair value of each option is amortized into compensation expense on
a straight-line basis between the grant date for the award and each vesting date.

In addition to the 2011 Plan, on December 15, 2010, the Company
adopted the 2011 Director Compensation Program (the “2011 Program”), which states that non-employee directors will receive their compensation in awards of restricted stock units under the 2011 Plan. Under the 2011 Program, restricted stock
units are granted the first day of each calendar quarter. The number of restricted stock units granted each quarter is determined by dividing one-fourth of the amount of the annual retainer by the fair market value of the shares of common stock as
of the grant date. The restricted stock units are fully vested on the date they are issued and are paid in shares of the Company’s common stock subsequent to the non-employee director ceasing to be a member of the Board.

The 2011 Program replaced the 2003 Comp Plan and the 2003 Option Plan. Under the 2003 Comp Plan, non-employee directors could receive no more than one-half of
their director fees immediately in cash, and the remainder of the fees was required to be taken in common stock or stock appreciation rights. The director had the option to elect to receive up to 100% of the fees in stock or defer all or part of the
fees in units with value equivalent to the value of shares of common stock as of the grant date. At August 31, 2013, the Company has $7.6 million accrued related to 17,990 outstanding units issued under the 2003 Comp Plan and prior plans, and
there was $6.7 million accrued related to 18,241 outstanding units issued as of August 25, 2012. No additional shares of stock or units will be issued in future years under the 2003 Comp Plan.



Under the 2003 Option Plan, each non-employee director received an option grant on January 1 of each year,
and each new non-employee director received an option to purchase 3,000 shares upon election to the Board, plus a portion of the annual directors’ option grant prorated for the portion of the year actually served. These stock option grants were
made at the fair market value as of the grant date and generally vested three years from the grant date. There were 51,000 and 104,679 outstanding options under the 2003 Option Plan as of August 31, 2013 and August 25, 2012, respectively.
No additional shares of stock or units will be issued in future years under the 2003 Option Plan.

The Company has estimated the fair value of all stock
option awards as of the date of the grant by applying the Black-Scholes-Merton multiple-option pricing valuation model. The application of this valuation model involves assumptions that are judgmental and highly sensitive in the determination of
compensation expense. The following table presents the weighted average for key assumptions used in determining the fair value of options granted and the related share-based compensation expense:

The following methodologies were applied in developing the assumptions used in determining the fair value of options granted:

Expected price volatility

– This is a measure of the amount by which a price has fluctuated or is expected to fluctuate. The
Company uses actual historical changes in the market value of its stock to calculate the volatility assumption as it is management’s belief that this is the best indicator of future volatility. The Company calculates daily market value changes
from the date of grant over a past period representative of the expected life of the options to determine volatility. An increase in the expected volatility will increase compensation expense.

Risk-free interest rate

– This is the U.S. Treasury rate for the week of the grant having a term equal to the expected life of the
option. An increase in the risk-free interest rate will increase compensation expense.

Expected lives

– This is the period of
time over which the options granted are expected to remain outstanding and is based on historical experience. Separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. Options
granted have a maximum term of ten years or ten years and one day. An increase in the expected life will increase compensation expense.

Forfeiture rate

– This is the estimated percentage of options granted that are expected to be forfeited or canceled before becoming
fully vested. This estimate is based on historical experience at the time of valuation and reduces expense ratably over the vesting period. An increase in the forfeiture rate will decrease compensation expense. This estimate is evaluated
periodically based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to differ, from the previous estimate.

Dividend
yield

– The Company has not made any dividend payments nor does it have plans to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. An increase in the dividend yield will decrease compensation expense.

The weighted average grant date fair value of options granted was $98.58 during fiscal 2013, $94.71 during fiscal 2012, and $58.57 during fiscal 2011. The
intrinsic value of options exercised was $194.6 million in fiscal 2013, $176.5 million in fiscal 2012, and $100.0 million in fiscal 2011. The total fair value of options vested was $37.3 million in fiscal 2013, $32.6 million in fiscal 2012, and
$20.7 million in fiscal 2011.

The Company recognized $1.5 million in expense related to the discount on the selling of shares to employees and executives
under various share purchase plans in fiscal 2013, $1.5 million in fiscal 2012 and $1.4 million in fiscal 2011. The Sixth Amended and Restated AutoZone, Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “Employee Plan”), which is qualified under
Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code, permits all eligible employees to purchase AutoZone’s common stock at 85% of the lower of the market price of the common stock on the first day or last day of each calendar quarter through payroll
deductions. Maximum permitted annual purchases are $15,000 per employee or 10 percent of compensation, whichever is less. Under the Employee Plan, 18,228 shares were sold to employees in fiscal 2013, 19,403 shares were sold to employees in fiscal
2012, and 21,608 shares were sold to employees in fiscal 2011. The Company repurchased 22,915 shares at fair value in fiscal 2013, 24,113 shares at fair value in fiscal 2012, and 30,864 shares at fair value in fiscal 2011 from employees electing to
sell their stock. Issuances of shares under the Employee Plan are netted against repurchases and such repurchases are not included in share repurchases disclosed in “Note K – Stock Repurchase Program.” At August 31, 2013, 234,744
shares of common stock were reserved for future issuance under the Employee Plan.

Once executives have reached the maximum purchases under the Employee
Plan, the Fifth Amended and Restated Executive Stock Purchase Plan (the “Executive Plan”) permits all eligible executives to purchase AutoZone’s common stock up to 25 percent of his or her annual salary and bonus. Purchases under the
Executive Plan were 3,454 shares in fiscal 2013, 3,937 shares in fiscal 2012, and 1,719 shares in fiscal 2011. At August 31, 2013, 248,953 shares of common stock were reserved for future issuance under the Executive Plan.

general, products liability, property and vehicle insurance. A portion of these self-insured losses



is managed through a wholly owned insurance captive. The Company maintains certain levels for stop-loss coverage for each self-insured plan in order to limit its liability for large claims. The
limits are per claim and are $1.5 million for workers’ compensation and property, $0.5 million for employee health, and $1.0 million for general, products liability, and vehicle.

Deferred taxes are not provided for temporary differences of approximately $260.0 million at August 31, 2013, and $195.8
million at August 25, 2012, representing earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries that are intended to be permanently reinvested. Computation of the potential deferred tax liability associated with these undistributed earnings and other basis
differences is not practicable.

At August 31, 2013 and August 25, 2012, the Company had deferred tax assets of $8.7 million and $12.3 million,
respectively, from net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income totaling approximately $75.5 million and $76.6 million, respectively. Certain NOLs have no expiration date and others will expire, if not
utilized, in various years from fiscal 2014 through 2032. At August 31, 2013 and August 25, 2012, the Company had deferred tax assets for income tax credit carryforwards of $33.1 million and $24.3 million, respectively. Certain income tax
credit carryforwards have no expiration and others will expire, if not utilized, in various years from fiscal 2014 through 2027.

At August 31, 2013
and August 25, 2012, the Company had a valuation allowance of $11.6 million and $9.5 million, respectively, on deferred tax assets associated with NOL and tax credit carryforwards for which management has determined it is more likely than not
that the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The $2.1 million net increase in the valuation allowance during fiscal 2013 related to increases from certain NOLs and tax credits arising in fiscal 2013 and decreases due to NOL expirations.
Management believes it is more likely than not that the remaining deferred tax assets will be fully realized.

Included in the August 31, 2013 balance is $20.1 million of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would reduce
the Company’s effective tax rate.



The Company accrues interest on unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. Penalties, if
incurred, would be recognized as a component of income tax expense. The Company had $4.7 million and $4.1 million accrued for the payment of interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits at August 31, 2013 and August 25,
2012, respectively.

The Company files U.S. federal, U.S. state and local, and international income tax returns. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service has
completed exams on U.S. federal income tax returns for years 2009 and prior. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to state and local or non-U.S. examinations by tax authorities for years before 2009. The Company is typically engaged
in various tax examinations at any given time, both by U.S. federal, state and local, and international taxing jurisdictions. As of August 31, 2013, the Company estimates that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could be reduced by
approximately $1.5 million over the next twelve months as a result of tax audit settlements. While the Company believes that it is adequately accrued for possible audit adjustments, the final resolution of these examinations cannot be determined at
this time and could result in final settlements that differ from current estimates.

Note E – Fair Value Measurements

The Company has adopted ASC Topic 820,

Fair Value Measurement

, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair
value in generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and expands disclosure requirements about fair value measurements. This standard defines fair value as the price received to transfer an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC Topic 820 establishes a framework for measuring fair value by creating a hierarchy of valuation inputs used to measure fair value, and although it does not require
additional fair value measurements, it applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements.

The hierarchy
prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels:

Level 1 inputs

— unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical
assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access. An active market for the asset or liability is one in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide ongoing pricing information.

Level 2 inputs

— inputs other than quoted market prices included in Level 1 that are observable, either directly or
indirectly, for the asset or liability. Level 2 inputs include, but are not limited to, quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in an active market, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active
and inputs other than quoted market prices that are observable for the asset or liability, such as interest rate curves and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, volatilities, credit risk and default rates.

Level 3 inputs

— unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

At August 31, 2013, the fair value measurement amounts for assets and liabilities recorded in the accompanying
Consolidated Balance Sheet consisted of short-term marketable securities of $16.4 million, which are included within Other current assets and long-term marketable securities of $65.8 million, which are included in Other long-term assets. The
Company’s marketable securities are typically valued at the closing price in the principal active market as of the last business day of the quarter or through the use of other market inputs relating to the securities, including benchmark yields
and reported trades. A discussion on how the Company’s cash flow hedges are valued is included in “Note H – Derivative Financial Instruments,” while the fair value of the Company’s pension plan assets are disclosed in
“Note L – Pension and Savings Plans.”

Effective December 19, 2012, the Company acquired certain assets and liabilities of
AutoAnything, an online retailer of specialized automotive products for up to $150 million, including an initial cash payment of $115 million, a $5 million holdback payment for working capital true-ups, and contingent payments totaling up to $30
million. The contingent consideration is based on the performance of AutoAnything, and is not subject to continued employment by the selling stockholders. Based on specific operating income targets for each year, the sellers can receive up to $10
million in the first year, and up to $30 million in the second year, with contingent consideration not exceeding $30 million in the aggregate. The estimated fair value of the performance-based contingent consideration of $22.7 million was included
as part of the purchase price allocation at the time of acquisition. The Company determined the fair value of the contingent consideration based on a probability-weighted discounted cash flow analysis. The fair value remeasurement is based on
significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represents a Level 3 measurement as defined in the fair value hierarchy. In each period, the Company reassesses its current estimates of performance relative to the stated targets and adjusts
the liability to fair value.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, the Company determined AutoAnything is not likely to achieve the operating income
targets necessary to earn the contingent consideration. Therefore, the contingent consideration was adjusted to reflect the fair value at August 31, 2013 of $0.2 million, resulting in a decrease to the contingent consideration liability of
$23.3 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. As of August 31, 2013, the contingent liability is reflected as a current liability of $0.1 million in Accrued expenses and other and a non-current liability of $0.1 million in Other
long-term liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. A discussion of the acquisition is included in “Note M – Acquisition.”

Non-Financial Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis

Non-financial assets are required to be measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis in certain circumstances, including the event of impairment. The assets
could include assets acquired in an acquisition as well as property, plant and equipment that are determined to be impaired. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $18.3 million related to
the acquisition of AutoAnything and an impairment charge of $4.1 million of AutoAnything’s trade name in order to record these assets at fair value. The fair value remeasurements are based on significant inputs not observable in the market and
thus represent a Level 3 measurement as defined in the fair value hierarchy. See “Note N – Goodwill and Intangibles” for further discussion. During fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012, the Company did not have any other significant
non-financial assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis in periods subsequent to initial recognition.

Financial Instruments not
Recognized at Fair Value

The Company has financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, other current assets and
accounts payable. The carrying amounts of these financial instruments approximate fair value because of their short maturities. The fair value of the Company’s debt is disclosed in “Note I – Financing.”

Note F – Marketable Securities

The Company’s basis for determining the cost of a security sold is the “Specific Identification Model”. Unrealized gains
(losses) on marketable securities are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss. The Company’s available-for-sale marketable securities consisted of the following:

The debt securities held at August 31, 2013, had effective maturities ranging from less than one year to approximately 3
years. The Company did not realize any material gains or losses on its sale of marketable securities during fiscal 2013, fiscal 2012, or fiscal 2011.



The Company holds 45 securities that are in an unrealized loss position of approximately $277 thousand at
August 31, 2013. The Company has the intent and ability to hold these investments until recovery of fair value or maturity, and does not deem the investments to be impaired on an other than temporary basis. In evaluating whether the securities
are deemed to be impaired on an other than temporary basis, the Company considers factors such as the duration and severity of the loss position, the credit worthiness of the investee, the term to maturity and its intent and ability to hold the
investments until maturity or until recovery of fair value.

Note G – Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss

Accumulated other comprehensive loss includes certain adjustments to pension liabilities, foreign currency translation adjustments, certain
activity for interest rate swaps and treasury rate locks that qualify as cash flow hedges and unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities. Changes in Accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, consisted of the following:

The fiscal 2013 pension adjustment of $43.1 million reflects actuarial gains not yet reflected in periodic pension cost primarily driven by a higher discount
rate at August 31, 2013.

Note H – Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company periodically uses derivatives to hedge exposures to interest rates. The Company does not hold or issue financial instruments for
trading purposes. For transactions that meet the hedge accounting criteria, the Company formally designates and documents the instrument as a hedge at inception and quarterly thereafter assesses the hedges to ensure they are effective in offsetting
changes in the cash flows of the underlying exposures. Derivatives are recorded in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value, determined using available market information or other appropriate valuation methodologies. In accordance
with ASC Topic 815,

Derivatives and Hedging

, the effective portion of a financial instrument’s change in fair value is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss for derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges and any ineffective
portion of an instrument’s change in fair value is recognized in earnings.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, the Company entered into two
treasury rate locks, each with a notional amount of $100 million. These agreements were cash flow hedges used to hedge the exposure to variability in future cash flows resulting from changes in variable interest rates related to the $300 million
Senior Note debt issuance in November 2012. The fixed rates of the hedges were 2.07% and 1.92% and were benchmarked based on the 10-year U.S. treasury notes. These locks expired on November 1, 2012 and resulted in a loss of $5.1 million, which
has been deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive loss and will be reclassified to Interest expense over the life of the underlying debt. The hedges remained highly effective until they expired, and no ineffectiveness was recognized in earnings.

During the third quarter of fiscal 2012, the Company entered into two treasury rate locks. These agreements were designated as cash flow hedges and were
used to hedge the exposure to variability in future cash flows resulting from changes in variable interest rates related to the $500 million Senior Note debt issuance in April 2012. The treasury rate locks had notional amounts of $300 million and
$100 million with associated fixed rates of 2.09% and 2.07% respectively. The locks were benchmarked based on the 10-year U.S. treasury notes. These locks



expired on April 20, 2012 and resulted in a loss of $2.8 million, which has been deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive loss and will be reclassified to Interest expense over the life
of the underlying debt. The hedges remained highly effective until they expired, and no ineffectiveness was recognized in earnings.

At August 31,
2013, the Company had $11.8 million recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss related to net realized losses associated with terminated interest rate swap and treasury rate lock derivatives which were designated as hedging instruments. Net
losses are amortized into Interest expense over the remaining life of the associated debt. During the fiscal year ended August 31, 2013, the Company reclassified $1.3 million of net losses from Accumulated other comprehensive loss to Interest
expense. In the fiscal year ended August 25, 2012, the Company reclassified $1.9 million of net losses from Accumulated other comprehensive loss to Interest expense. The Company expects to reclassify $182 thousand of net losses from Accumulated
other comprehensive loss to Interest expense over the next 12 months.

As of August 31, 2013, $637 million of commercial paper borrowings and $326.3 million of the 6.500% Senior Notes due
January 2014 are classified as long-term in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as the Company has the ability and intent to refinance on a long-term basis through available capacity in its revolving credit facility. As of August 31,
2013, the Company had $963.3 million of availability under its $1.0 billion revolving credit facility, expiring in September 2016 that would allow it to replace these short-term obligations with long-term financing.

In September 2011, the Company amended and restated its $800 million revolving credit facility, which was scheduled to expire in July 2012. The capacity under
the revolving credit facility was increased to $1.0 billion. This credit facility is available to primarily support commercial paper borrowings, letters of credit and other short-term, unsecured bank loans. The capacity of the credit facility may be
increased to $1.250 billion prior to the maturity date at the Company’s election and subject to bank credit capacity and approval, may include up to $200 million in letters of credit, and may include up to $175 million in capital leases each
fiscal year. Under the revolving credit facility, the Company may borrow funds consisting of Eurodollar loans or base rate loans. Interest accrues on Eurodollar loans at a defined Eurodollar rate, defined as LIBOR plus the applicable percentage, as
defined in the revolving credit facility, depending upon the Company’s senior, unsecured, (non-credit enhanced) long-term debt rating. Interest accrues on base rate loans as defined in the credit facility. The Company also has the option to
borrow funds under the terms of a swingline loan subfacility. The revolving credit facility expires in September 2016.



The revolving credit facility agreement requires that the Company’s consolidated interest coverage ratio as
of the last day of each quarter shall be no less than 2.50:1. This ratio is defined as the ratio of (i) consolidated earnings before interest, taxes and rents to (ii) consolidated interest expense plus consolidated rents. The
Company’s consolidated interest coverage ratio as of August 31, 2013 was 4.68:1.

In addition to the revolving credit facility, the Company also
maintains a letter of credit facility that allows it to request the participating bank to issue letters of credit on its behalf up to an aggregate amount of $100 million. As of August 31, 2013, the Company has $99.4 million in letters of credit
outstanding under the letter of credit facility, which expires in June 2016.

In addition to the outstanding letters of credit issued under the committed
facilities discussed above, the Company had $41.8 million in letters of credit outstanding as of August 31, 2013. These letters of credit have various maturity dates and were issued on an uncommitted basis.

On April 29, 2013, the Company issued $500 million in 3.125% Senior Notes due July 2023 under its shelf registration statement filed with the SEC on
April 17, 2012 (the “Shelf Registration”). The Shelf Registration allows the Company to sell an indeterminate amount in debt securities to fund general corporate purposes, including repaying, redeeming or repurchasing outstanding debt
and for working capital, capital expenditures, new store openings, stock repurchases and acquisitions. Proceeds from the debt issuance on April 29, 2013, were used to repay a portion of the outstanding commercial paper borrowings and for
general corporate purposes. The Company used commercial paper borrowings to repay the $200 million in 4.375% Senior Notes due June 2013.

On
November 13, 2012, the Company issued $300 million in 2.875% Senior Notes due January 2023 under its Shelf Registration. Proceeds from the debt issuance on November 13, 2012, were used to repay a portion of the outstanding commercial paper
borrowings, which were used to repay the $300 million in 5.875% Senior Notes due in October 2012, and for general corporate purposes.

On April 24,
2012, the Company issued $500 million in 3.700% Senior Notes due April 2022 under its Shelf Registration. The Company used the proceeds from the issuance of debt to repay a portion of the commercial paper borrowings and for general corporate
purposes.

The 5.750% Senior Notes issued in July 2009 and the 6.500% and 7.125% Senior Notes issued during August 2008, (collectively, the
“Notes”), are subject to an interest rate adjustment if the debt ratings assigned to the Notes are downgraded. The Notes, along with the 3.125% Senior Notes issued in April 2013, the 2.875% Senior Notes issued in November 2012, the 3.700%
Senior Notes issued in April 2012 and the 4.000% Senior Notes issued in during November 2010, also contain a provision that repayment of the notes may be accelerated if the Company experiences a change in control (as defined in the agreements). The
Company’s borrowings under its other senior notes contain minimal covenants, primarily restrictions on liens. Under the revolving credit facility, covenants include limitations on total indebtedness, restrictions on liens, a maximum debt to
earnings ratio, and a change of control provision that may require acceleration of the repayment obligations under certain circumstances. These covenants are in addition to the consolidated interest coverage ratio discussed above. All of the
repayment obligations under the borrowing arrangements may be accelerated and come due prior to the scheduled payment date if covenants are breached or an event of default occurs.



As of August 31, 2013, the Company was in compliance with all covenants related to its borrowing
arrangements. All of the Company’s debt is unsecured. Scheduled maturities of long-term debt are as follows:

The fair value of the Company’s debt was estimated at $4.259 billion as of August 31, 2013, and $4.055 billion as of
August 25, 2012, based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or on the current rates available to the Company for debt of the same terms (Level 2). Such fair value is greater than the carrying value of debt by $72.2 million
at August 31, 2013 and $286.6 million at August 25, 2012.

Note K – Stock Repurchase Program

During 1998, the Company announced a program permitting the Company to repurchase a portion of its outstanding shares not to exceed a dollar
maximum established by the Board. The program was last amended on June 11, 2013 to increase the repurchase authorization to $13.40 billion from $12.65 billion. From January 1998 to August 31, 2013, the Company has repurchased a total of
134.6 million shares at an aggregate cost of $12.93 billion.

During the fiscal year 2013, the Company retired 3.9 million shares of treasury stock which had previously been
repurchased under the Company’s share repurchase program. The retirement increased Retained deficit by $1,362.2 million and decreased Additional paid-in capital by $75.7 million. During the comparable prior year period, the Company retired
4.9 million shares of treasury stock, which increased Retained deficit by $1,319.6 million and decreased Additional paid-in capital by $72.5 million.



Subsequent to August 31, 2013, the Company has repurchased 355,150 shares of common stock at an aggregate
cost of $149.8 million.

Note L – Pension and Savings Plans

Prior to January 1, 2003, substantially all full-time employees were covered by a defined benefit pension plan. The benefits under the
plan were based on years of service and the employee’s highest consecutive five-year average compensation. On January 1, 2003, the plan was frozen. Accordingly, pension plan participants will earn no new benefits under the plan formula and
no new participants will join the pension plan.

On January 1, 2003, the Company’s supplemental defined benefit pension plan for certain highly
compensated employees was also frozen. Accordingly, plan participants will earn no new benefits under the plan formula and no new participants will join the pension plan.

The Company has recognized the unfunded status of the defined pension plans in its Consolidated Balance Sheets, which represents the difference between the
fair value of pension plan assets and the projected benefit obligations of its defined benefit pension plans. The net unrecognized actuarial losses and unrecognized prior service costs are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss. These
amounts will be subsequently recognized as net periodic pension expense pursuant to the Company’s historical accounting policy for amortizing such amounts. Further, actuarial gains and losses that arise in subsequent periods and are not
recognized as net periodic pension expense in the same periods will be recognized as a component of other comprehensive income. Those amounts will be subsequently recognized as a component of net periodic pension expense on the same basis as the
amounts previously recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive loss.

The Company’s investment strategy for pension plan assets is to utilize a
diversified mix of domestic and international equity and fixed income portfolios to earn a long-term investment return that meets the Company’s pension plan obligations. The pension plan assets are invested primarily in listed securities, and
the pension plans hold only a minimal investment in AutoZone common stock that is entirely at the discretion of third-party pension fund investment managers. The Company’s largest holding classes, fixed income bonds and U.S. equities, are
invested with a fund manager that holds diversified portfolios. Accordingly, the Company does not have any significant concentrations of risk in particular securities, issuers, sectors, industries or geographic regions. Alternative investment
strategies, are in the process of being liquidated and constitute less than 1% of the pension plan assets. The Company’s investment managers are prohibited from using derivatives for speculative purposes and are not permitted to use derivatives
to leverage a portfolio.

The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the Company’s investments measured at fair value:

U.S., international, emerging, and high yield equities –

These investments are commingled funds and are valued using the net
asset values, which are determined by valuing investments at the closing price or last trade reported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded. These investments are subject to annual audits.

Alternative investments –

This category represents a hedge fund of funds made up of 9 different hedge fund managers diversified
over 4 different hedge strategies. The fair value of the hedge fund of funds is determined using valuations provided by the third party administrator for each of the underlying funds.

Fixed income securities –

The fair values of corporate, U.S. government securities and other fixed income securities are estimated
by using bid evaluation pricing models or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics.

Cash and cash equivalents –

These investments include cash equivalents valued using exchange rates provided by an industry pricing vendor and commingled funds valued using the net asset value. These investments also include cash.



The fair values of investments by level and asset category and the weighted-average asset allocations of the
Company’s pension plans at the measurement date are presented in the following table:

The asset allocations in the charts above include $11.0 million and $8.7 million in cash contributions made prior to the
balance sheet date of August 31, 2013, and August 25, 2012, respectively. Subsequent to August 31, 2013, and August 25, 2012, these cash contributions were allocated to the pension plan investments in accordance with the targeted
asset allocation.

In August 2011, the Company’s Investment Committee approved a revised asset allocation target for the investments held by the
pension plan. Based on the revised asset allocation target, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets changed from 8.0% in fiscal 2011 to 7.5% for the years ending August 25, 2012, and August 31, 2013.

As the plan benefits are frozen, increases in future compensation levels no longer impact the calculation and there is no
service cost. The discount rate is determined as of the measurement date and is based on the calculated yield of a portfolio of high-grade corporate bonds with cash flows that generally match the Company’s expected benefit payments in future
years. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on the historical relationships between the investment classes and the capital markets, updated for current conditions.

The Company makes annual contributions in amounts at least equal to the minimum funding requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.
The Company contributed $16.9 million to the plans in fiscal 2013, $15.4 million to the plans in fiscal 2012 and $34.1 million to the plans in fiscal 2011. The Company expects to contribute approximately $4 million to the plans in fiscal 2014;
however, a change to the expected cash funding may be impacted by a change in interest rates or a change in the actual or expected return on plan assets.

Based on current assumptions about future events, benefit payments are expected to be paid as follows for each of the following fiscal years. Actual benefit
payments may vary significantly from the following estimates:

The Company has a 401(k) plan that covers all domestic employees who meet the plan’s participation requirements. The plan
features include Company matching contributions, immediate 100% vesting of Company contributions and a savings option up to 25% of qualified earnings. The Company makes matching contributions, per pay period, up to a specified percentage of
employees’ contributions as approved by the Board. The Company made matching contributions to employee accounts in connection with the 401(k) plan of $14.1 million in fiscal 2013, $14.4 million in fiscal 2012 and $13.3 million in fiscal 2011.



Note M – Acquisition

Effective December 19, 2012, the Company acquired certain assets and liabilities of AutoAnything, an online retailer of specialized
automotive products for up to $150 million, including an initial cash payment of $115 million, up to a $5 million holdback payment for working capital true-ups, and contingent payments not to exceed $30 million. During the third quarter of fiscal
2013, the Company paid the holdback payment for working capital true-ups of $1.1 million. With this acquisition, the Company expects to bolster its online presence in the automotive accessory and performance markets. The results of operations from
AutoAnything have been included in the Company’s Other business activities since the date of acquisition. Pro forma results of operations related to the acquisition of AutoAnything are not presented as AutoAnything’s results are not
material to the Company’s results of operations. The purchase price allocation resulted in goodwill of $83.4 million and intangible assets totaling $58.7 million. Goodwill generated from the acquisition is tax deductible and is primarily
attributable to expected synergies and the assembled workforce. The contingent consideration is based on the achievement of certain performance metrics through calendar year 2014 with any earned payments due during the first calendar quarter of 2014
and 2015. The fair value of the contingent consideration as of the acquisition date was $22.7 million.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, the
Company determined AutoAnything is not likely to achieve the operating income targets necessary to earn the contingent consideration. Therefore, the contingent consideration was adjusted to reflect the fair value at August 31, 2013, of $0.2
million, resulting in a decrease in the contingent consideration liability of $23.3 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. See “Note E – Fair Value Measurements” for further discussion.

Total accumulated goodwill impairment as of August 31, 2013 is $18.3 million

The Company
performed its annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 for the recorded goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset related to the acquisition of AutoAnything. Based on an analysis of AutoAnything’s revised planned
financial results compared to the initial projections, the Company determined it was more likely than not that the goodwill attributed to AutoAnything was impaired. Accordingly, the Company performed a goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair
value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. The Company uses the discounted cash flow methodology to determine fair value as it is considered to be the most reliable indicator of the fair values of the business. Because
the fair value of the reporting unit was lower than its carrying value, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $18.3 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013.

As part of its annual impairment test, the Company evaluated the AutoAnything trade name for impairment. Based on the
Company’s evaluation of the future discounted cash flows of AutoAnything’s trade name as compared to its carrying value, it was determined that AutoAnything’s trade name was impaired. The Company recorded an impairment charge of $4.1
million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 related to the trade name.

Note O – Leases

The Company leases some of its retail stores, distribution centers, facilities, land and equipment, including vehicles. Other than vehicle
leases, most of the leases are operating leases, which include renewal options made at the Company’s election, options to purchase and provisions for percentage rent based on sales. Rental expense was $246.3 million in fiscal 2013, $229.4
million in fiscal 2012, and $213.8 million in fiscal 2011. Percentage rentals were insignificant.

The Company has a fleet of vehicles used for delivery
to its commercial customers and stores and travel for members of field management. The majority of these vehicles are held under capital lease. At August 31, 2013, the Company had capital lease assets of $107.5 million, net of accumulated
amortization of $44.8 million, and capital lease obligations of $106.2 million, of which $32.2 million is classified as Accrued expenses and other as it represents the current portion of these obligations. At August 25, 2012, the Company had
capital lease assets of $104.2 million, net of accumulated amortization of $36.4 million, and capital lease obligations of $102.3 million, of which $29.8 million was classified as Accrued expenses and other.

The Company records rent for all operating leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term, including any reasonably assured renewal periods and the
period of time prior to the lease term that the Company is in possession of the leased space for the purpose of installing leasehold improvements. Differences between recorded rent expense and cash payments are recorded as a liability in Accrued
expenses and other and Other long-term liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, based on the terms of the lease. The deferred rent approximated $96.5 million on August 31, 2013, and $86.9 million on August 25, 2012.

In connection with the Company’s December 2001 sale of the TruckPro business, the Company subleased some properties to
the purchaser for an initial term of not less than 20 years. The Company’s remaining aggregate rental obligation at August 31, 2013 of $15.6 million is included in the above table, but the obligation is entirely offset by the sublease
rental agreement.

Note P – Commitments and Contingencies

Construction commitments, primarily for new stores, totaled approximately $21.0 million at August 31, 2013.

The Company had $145.4 million in outstanding standby letters of credit and $30.7 million in surety bonds as of August 31, 2013, which all have
expiration periods of less than one year. A substantial portion of the outstanding standby letters of credit (which are primarily renewed on an annual basis) and surety bonds are used to cover reimbursement obligations to our workers’
compensation carriers. There are no additional contingent liabilities associated with these instruments as the underlying liabilities are already reflected in the consolidated balance sheet. The standby letters of credit and surety bonds
arrangements have automatic renewal clauses.

Note Q – Litigation

In 2004, the Company acquired a store site in Mount Ephraim, New Jersey that had previously been the site of a gasoline service station and
contained evidence of groundwater contamination. Upon acquisition, the Company voluntarily reported the groundwater contamination issue to the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and entered into a Voluntary Remediation Agreement
providing for the remediation of the contamination associated with the property. The Company has conducted and paid for (at an immaterial cost to the Company) remediation of contamination on the property. The Company is also investigating, and will
be addressing, potential vapor intrusion impacts in downgradient residences and businesses. The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection has asserted, in a Directive and Notice to Insurers dated February 19, 2013
(“Directive”), that the Company is liable for the downgradient impacts under a joint and severable liability theory, and the Company has contested any such assertions due to the existence of other entities/sources of contamination, some of
which are named in the Directive, in the area of the property. Pursuant to the Voluntary Remediation Agreement, upon completion of all remediation required by the agreement, the Company believes it should be eligible to be reimbursed up to 75
percent of qualified remediation costs by the State of New Jersey. The Company has asked the state for clarification that the agreement applies to off-site work, and the state is considering the request. Although the aggregate amount of additional
costs that the Company may incur pursuant to the remediation cannot currently be ascertained, the Company does not currently believe that fulfillment of its obligations under the agreement or otherwise will result in costs that are material to its
financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.

The Company is involved in various other legal proceedings incidental to the conduct of its
business, including several lawsuits containing class-action allegations in which the plaintiffs are current and former hourly and salaried employees who allege various wage and hour violations and unlawful termination practices. The Company does
not currently believe that, either individually or in the aggregate, these matters will result in liabilities material to the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.



Note R – Segment Reporting

Three of the Company’s operating segments (Domestic Auto Parts, Mexico and Brazil) are aggregated as one reportable segment: Auto Parts
Stores. The criteria the Company used to identify the reportable segment are primarily the nature of the products the Company sells and the operating results that are regularly reviewed by the Company’s chief operating decision maker to make
decisions about the resources to be allocated to the business units and to assess performance. The accounting policies of the Company’s reportable segment are the same as those described in Note A.

The Auto Parts Stores segment is a retailer and distributor of automotive parts and accessories through the Company’s 5,201 stores in the United States,
Puerto Rico, Mexico and Brazil. Each store carries an extensive product line for cars, sport utility vehicles, vans and light trucks, including new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and non-automotive products.

The Other category reflects business activities of three operating segments that are not separately reportable due to the materiality of these operating
segments. The operating segments include ALLDATA, which produces, sells and maintains diagnostic and repair information software used in the automotive repair industry; E-commerce, which includes direct sales to customers through www.autozone.com;
and AutoAnything, which includes direct sales to customers through www.autoanything.com.



The Company evaluates its reportable segment primarily on the basis of net sales and segment profit, which is
defined as gross profit. The following table shows segment results for the following fiscal years:
