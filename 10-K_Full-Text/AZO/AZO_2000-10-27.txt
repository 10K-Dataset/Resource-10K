PART I

Item 1. Business

Introduction

We are the nation's leading
specialty retailer of automotive parts and accessories, primarily focusing
on do-it-yourself customers. We began operations in 1979 and at August
26, 2000, operated 2,915 auto parts stores in 42 states and 13 in Mexico.
Each auto parts store carries an extensive product line for cars, vans
and light trucks, including new and re-manufactured automotive hard parts,
maintenance items, and accessories. At August 26, 2000, 1,486 of our domestic
auto parts stores also had a commercial sales program, which provides commercial
credit and prompt delivery of parts and other products to local repair
garages, dealers and service stations. We do not sell tires nor do we perform
automotive repairs or installations.

In addition, we sell heavy-duty
truck parts and accessories through 49 TruckPro stores in 15 states, automotive
diagnostic and repair information software through our ALLDATA subsidiary
and diagnostic and repair information through alldatadiy.com.

At
August 26, 2000, our auto parts stores were in the following locations:

Marketing and Merchandising Strategy

We are dedicated to providing
customers with superior service, value, and quality parts selection at
conveniently located, well-designed stores. Key elements of this strategy
are:

Customer Service

We believe that
our customers value customer service; therefore, customer service is the
most important element in our marketing and merchandising strategy. We
emphasize that our AutoZoners should always put customers first. To do
so, we employ parts personnel with technical expertise to advise customers
regarding the correct part type and application, utilize a wide range of
training methods to educate and motivate our AutoZoners, and provide store
personnel with significant opportunities for promotion and incentive compensation.
Our electronic parts catalogs assist in the selection of parts; we offer
free testing of starters, alternators, batteries, sensors and actuators;
and we were among the first auto parts companies to offer lifetime warranties
on many of the parts we sell. Our satellite system in our auto parts stores
helps us to speed up credit card and check approval processes and locate
parts at neighboring AutoZone stores. Our auto parts stores generally open
at 8 a.m. and close between 8 and 10 p.m. (with some open 24 hours) Monday
through Saturday and typically open at 9 a.m. and close between 6 and 8
p.m. on Sunday.

Through ALLDATA,
we provide electronic diagnostic and repair information. We offer the professional
technician a complete software package, and the do-it-yourselfer can purchase
vehicle-specific information on CD-ROM or via the Internet at alldatadiy.com.

Tools

Our auto parts stores
generally offer between 16,000 and 21,000 stock keeping units ("SKUs")
covering a broad range of vehicle types. Each auto parts store carries
the same basic product line with some regional differences based on climate,
demographics and age and type of vehicle registration. Our "flexogram"
program enables us to tailor our hard parts inventory to the makes and
models of the automobiles in each store's trade area. The auto parts stores
sell a number of products, including batteries, engines, starters, alternators,
brake parts and filters, under our private label names. We also offer a
range of products, consisting principally of hard parts, through our express
parts program, which provides overnight delivery of lower turnover products
to our auto parts stores.

Pricing

We employ an everyday low
price strategy and attempt to be the price leader in hard parts categories.
We believe that our prices overall compare favorably to those of our competitors.

Commercial Sales Program

Our commercial sales
program in the auto parts stores provides credit and prompt delivery of
parts and other products to local repair garages, dealers and service stations.
At August 26, 2000, this program was offered in 1,486 auto parts stores.
Commercial customers generally pay the same everyday low prices as paid
by do-it-yourself customers.

Store Design and Visual Merchandising

We design and build stores
for a high visual impact. The typical AutoZone store has an industrial
"high tech" appearance by utilizing colorful exterior signage, exposed
beams and ductwork, and brightly lighted interiors. Maintenance products,
accessories, and miscellaneous items are attractively displayed for easy
browsing by customers, with specialized gravity-feed racks for batteries
and, in many stores, oil. We employ a uniform ("planogrammed") store layout
system to promote consistent merchandise presentation in all of our auto
parts stores. In-store signage and special displays aid customers in locating
merchandise and promoting products.

Store Development and Expansion Strategy

This table shows the domestic
auto parts store development during the past five fiscal years:


Includes stores obtained through
Chief and Auto Palace acquisitions in 1998, and stores opened on real estate
acquired from Pep Boys in 1999.


Closed stores include replaced stores.

We believe that expansion opportunities
exist both in markets that we do not currently serve, and in markets where
we can achieve a larger presence, for both AutoZone and TruckPro stores.
We attempt to obtain high visibility sites in high traffic locations and
undertake substantial research prior to entering new markets. Key factors
in selecting new site and market locations include population, demographics,
vehicle profile, and number and strength of competitors' stores. We generally
seek to open new stores within or contiguous to existing market areas and
attempt to cluster development in new urban markets in a relatively short
period of time in order to achieve economies of scale in advertising and
distribution costs. In addition to continuing to construct our own stores,
we occasionally evaluate potential acquisition candidates in new as well
as in existing markets.

Our net sales have grown
significantly in recent years, increasing from $2.2 billion in fiscal 1996
to $4.5 billion in fiscal 2000. Continued growth and financial performance
will be dependent, in large part, upon our ability to open new stores on
a profitable basis in existing and new markets and also upon our ability
to continue to increase sales in existing stores. We make no assurance
that we can continue to open and operate new stores on a timely and profitable
basis, or continue to attain increases in comparable store sales.

Store Operations

Store Formats

As of August 26, 2000, we
had domestic auto parts stores in the following square footage ranges:

Substantially all
AutoZone stores are based on standard store formats resulting in generally
consistent appearance, merchandising and product mix. Approximately 85%
to 90% of each store's square footage is selling space, of which approximately
40% to 45% is dedicated to hard parts inventory. The hard parts inventory
area is fronted by a counter that generally runs the depth or length of
the store, dividing the hard parts area from the remainder of the store.
The remaining selling space contains displays of accessories and maintenance
items.

At the hard parts counter,
we have knowledgeable parts personnel available to assist customers with
their parts needs utilizing our proprietary electronic parts catalog with
a video screen which is visible to both the AutoZoner (employee) and the
customer. The parts catalog will suggest additional items that a customer
should purchase in order to properly install the part being purchased.

Approximately 2,300 of our auto parts stores
are freestanding, with the balance principally located within strip shopping
centers. Freestanding large format stores typically have parking for approximately
40 to 45 cars on a lot of approximately 3/4 to one acre. Our smaller auto
parts stores typically have parking for approximately 25 to 35 cars and
are usually located on a lot of approximately 1/2 to 3/4 acre.

Store Personnel and Training

Each auto parts store typically
employs from 9 to 20 AutoZoners, including a manager and an assistant manager.
AutoZoners typically have prior automotive experience. Although we rely
primarily on on-the-job training, we also provide formal training programs,
which include regular store meetings on specific sales and product issues,
standardized training manuals and a specialist program where AutoZoners
can obtain certification in several areas of technical expertise from both
the company and from independent certification agencies. Training is supplemented
with frequent store visits by management.

Store managers get
financial incentives through performance-based bonuses and grants of stock
options. In addition, our growth has provided opportunities for the promotion
of qualified AutoZoners. We believe these opportunities are important to
attract, motivate and retain quality personnel.

Our domestic auto parts stores
are primarily supervised through district managers who oversee approximately
five to eight stores each and who report to regional managers. Regional
managers with approximately 45 to 60 stores each, in turn, report to six
Vice Presidents-Stores. Purchasing, merchandising, advertising, accounting,
cash management, store development, systems technology and support and
other store support functions are centralized in our store support center
in Memphis, Tennessee. We believe that this centralization enhances consistent
execution of our merchandising and marketing strategy at the store level.

Store Automation

All auto parts stores have
proprietary electronic parts catalogs that provide parts information based
on the make, model and year of an automobile. The catalog display screens
are placed on the hard parts counter where both AutoZoners and customers
can view the screen. In addition, our satellite system enables the auto
parts stores to speed up credit card and check approval processes and locate
parts at neighboring AutoZone stores.

Our domestic auto
parts stores utilize our computerized Store Management System, which includes
bar code scanning and point-of-sale data collection terminals. The Store
Management System provides administrative assistance and improved personnel
scheduling at the store level, as well as enhanced merchandising information
and improved inventory control. We believe the Store Management System
also enhances customer service through faster processing of transactions
and simplified warranty and product return procedures.

Purchasing and Distribution

Merchandise is selected and
purchased for all stores at our store support center in Memphis. No one
class of product accounts for as much as 10% of our total sales. In fiscal
2000, no single supplier accounted for more than 7% of our total purchases,
and our ten largest suppliers accounted for approximately 32% of our purchases.
We generally have few long-term contracts for the purchase of merchandise.
We believe that we have excellent relationships with suppliers. We also
believe that alternative sources of supply exist, at similar cost, for
substantially all types of product sold.

Our vendors ship substantially
all of our merchandise to our distribution centers. Stores typically place
orders on a weekly basis with merchandise shipped from the warehouse in
our trucks on the following day.

Competition

We compete principally in
the do-it-yourself and, more recently, the commercial automotive aftermarket.
Although the number of competitors and the level of competition experienced
by our stores vary by market area, the automotive aftermarket is fragmented
and generally very competitive. We principally compete using customer service,
store location, product selection, product warranty and price. While we
believe that we compete effectively across the United States, some of our
competitors have been operating longer in particular geographic areas and
may be more familiar with particular regional needs or may have a name
more recognizable in a particular region.

In addition to competing
with other auto parts retailers, we compete with jobber stores, which principally
sell to wholesale accounts and installers, but also have significant sales
to do-it-yourself customers. With respect to some products, we also compete
with mass merchants who sell automotive maintenance products such as oil,
filters, windshield wiper blades, wash and wax, chemicals and batteries.

Trademarks and Patents

We have registered several
service marks and trademarks in the United States Patent and Trademark
office, including our service mark "AutoZone" and trademarks "AutoZone,"
"Duralast," "Valucraft," "Ultra Spark," "Deutsch," "Albany," "ALLDATA"
and "TruckPro". We believe that the "AutoZone" service mark and trademarks
have become an important component in our merchandising and marketing strategy.

In the 1998 fiscal year we
were granted a patent by the Patent and Trademark Office for a starter
and alternator tester which is being used exclusively in our AutoZone stores.
This tester gives us greater testing accuracy and improved customer service.

Employees

As of August 26, 2000, we
employed approximately 43,000 persons, approximately 29,000 of whom were
employed full-time. Approximately 87% of our employees were employed in
stores or in direct field supervision, approximately 7% in distribution
centers and approximately 6% in store support functions.

We have never experienced
any material labor disruption, and believe that our labor relations are
generally good.

RISK FACTORS

We may not be able to
increase sales by the same historic growth rates.

We have significantly increased
our domestic store count in the past five fiscal years, growing from 1,143
stores at August 26, 1995, to 2,915 stores at August 26, 2000, an average
store count increase per year of 24%. We do not plan to continue our store
count growth rate at the historic pace. In addition, a portion of our total
sales increases each year results from increases in sales at existing stores.
We cannot make any assurance that we can continue to increase same store
sales as our stores mature in their markets.

We have an ever-increasing
need for qualified employees.

In fiscal year 2000, our
consolidated employee count increased from approximately 40,500 at the
beginning of the year to about 43,200, a 7% increase in the year. We do
not know if we can continue to hire and retain qualified employees at current
wage rates.

If demand for our products
slows, then our business may be materially affected.

Demand for products sold
by our stores depends on many factors. In the short term, it may depend
upon:

the weather, as vehicle maintenance may be deferred during periods
of inclement weather.

the economy, as during periods of good economic conditions, more of our
do-it-yourself customers may pay others to repair and maintain their cars
instead of working on their own cars. This factor is tempered by our commercial
parts sales program that sells parts to installers. In periods of declining
economic conditions, both do-it-yourself and do-it-for-me customers may
defer vehicle maintenance or repair.

For the long term, demand for
our products may depend upon:

the quality of the vehicles manufactured by the original vehicle manufacturers,
and the length of the warranty offered on new vehicles.

the law. Contrary to the terms of the federal Clean Air Act, the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency has adopted regulations that would limit access to computerized
diagnostic information (commonly referred to as "on-board diagnostics")
relating to vehicle emission systems on cars and light trucks beginning
with the 1996 model year. Legislation is pending in several states to negate
the effect of these regulations upon do-it-yourself customers and commercial
installers not associated with the original manufacturers. If these regulations
remain in effect, our customers will have little or no access to on-board
diagnostic information for vehicles, which may limit their ability to diagnose,
maintain or repair the emissions systems of vehicles.

If we cannot profitably increase
market share in the commercial auto parts business, our sales growth may
be limited.

Although we are one of the
five largest sellers of auto parts in the commercial "do-it-for-me" market,
to increase commercial sales we must compete against automotive aftermarket
jobbers and warehouse distributors, in addition to other auto parts retailers
which recently entered the commercial business. Some of these jobbers and
warehouse distributors have been in business for substantially longer periods
of time than we have, have developed long-term customer relationships and
have larger available inventories. We can make no assurance that we can
profitably develop new commercial customers or make available inventories
required by commercial customers.

If we cannot profitably
open stores in international markets, our sales growth may be limited.

We opened our first auto
parts stores in Mexico during fiscal year 1999. Although we believe that
great potential exists for auto parts stores in the fragmented international
auto parts market, we have little experience opening or operating stores
outside of the United States, and no assurances can be made that we can
open additional stores in Mexico or stores in any other country in a timely
or profitable manner.

If our vendors continue
to consolidate, we may pay higher prices for our merchandise.

Recently, several of our
vendors have merged and others have announced plans to merge. Further vendor
consolidation could limit the number of vendors from which we may purchase
products and could materially affect the prices we pay for these products.

Item 2. Properties

This table shows the square footage and number of leased and owned properties
for our domestic auto parts stores:

We have 3,447,172 square
feet in our distribution centers, all of which is owned, except for 892,978
square feet, which is leased. The distribution centers are located in Arizona,
California, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Ohio, Tennessee, and Texas.

Our store support center,
which we own, is located in Memphis, Tennessee, and consists of 360,000
square feet.

We also own and lease other
properties that are not material in the aggregate.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

AutoZone, Inc., is a defendant
in a class action lawsuit entitled "Melvin Quinnie on behalf of all others
similarly situated v. AutoZone, Inc., and DOES 1 through 100, inclusive"
filed in the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles, in November
1998. The plaintiff claims that the defendants failed to pay overtime to
store managers as required by California law and failed to pay terminated
managers in a timely manner as required by California law. The plaintiff
is seeking injunctive relief, restitution, statutory penalties, prejudgment
interest, and reasonable attorneys' fees, expenses and costs. On April
3, 2000, the court certified the class as consisting of all AutoZone store
managers, and Chief managers who became AutoZone employees in standardized
stores on January 1, 1999, for their claims since January 1, 1999, only.
The Company is unable to predict the outcome of this lawsuit at this time,
but believes that the potential damages recoverable by any single plaintiff
are minimal. However, if the plaintiff class were to prevail on all of
its claims, the aggregate amount of damages could be substantial. The Company
is vigorously defending against this action.

AutoZone, Inc., and its wholly-owned
subsidiary, Chief Auto Parts Inc., are defendants in a purported class
action lawsuit entitled "Paul D. Rusch, on behalf of all others similarly
situated, v. Chief Auto Parts Inc. and AutoZone, Inc." filed in the Superior
Court of California, County of Los Angeles, in May 1999. The plaintiffs
claim that the defendants have failed to pay their store managers overtime
pay from March 1997 to present. The plaintiffs are seeking back overtime
pay, interest, an injunction against the defendants committing such practices
in the future, costs and attorneys' fees. The Company is unable to predict
the outcome of this lawsuit at this time, but believes that the potential
damages recoverable by any single plaintiff are minimal. However, if the
plaintiff class were to be certified and prevail on all of its claims,
the aggregate amount of damages could be substantial. The Company is vigorously
defending against this action.

AutoZone, Inc., is a defendant
in a lawsuit entitled "Coalition for a Level Playing Field, L.L.C.,

et
al.,

v. AutoZone, Inc.,

et al

.," filed in the U.S. District
Court for the Eastern District of New York on February 16, 2000. The case
was filed by over 100 plaintiffs, which are principally automotive aftermarket
warehouse distributors and jobbers, against eight defendants, which are
principally automotive aftermarket parts retailers. The plaintiffs claim
that the defendants have knowingly received volume discounts, rebates,
slotting and other allowances, fees, free inventory, sham advertising and
promotional payments, a share in the manufacturers' profits, and excessive
payments for services purportedly performed for the manufacturers in violation
of the Robinson-Patman Act. Plaintiffs seek approximately $1 billion in
damages (including statutory trebling) and a permanent injunction prohibiting
defendants from committing further violations of the Robinson-Patman Act
and from opening up any further stores to compete with plaintiffs as long
as defendants continue to violate the Act. The Company believes this suit
to be without merit and will vigorously defend against it.

AutoZone, Inc., was a defendant
in a lawsuit entitled "Ty Newlin, individually, and on behalf of others
similarly situated, v. AutoZone, Inc., and Does 1 through 50, inclusive,"
filed in the Kern County, California, Superior Court on April 27, 2000.
The plaintiff, on behalf of a class of employees, alleges that AutoZone
failed to pay overtime to its store management employees. The plaintiff
is seeking unpaid overtime compensation, penalties, punitive damages, interest,
attorneys' fees and an injunction requiring AutoZone to pay overtime compensation
as required under California and federal law. This case was dismissed without
prejudice during September 2000.

We are also involved in various
other legal proceedings incidental to the conduct of our business. Although
the amount of liability that may result from these other proceedings cannot
be ascertained, we do not currently believe that, in the aggregate, they
will result in liabilities material to our financial condition or results
of operations.
