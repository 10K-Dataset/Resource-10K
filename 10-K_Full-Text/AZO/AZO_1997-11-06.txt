ITEM 1 BUSINESS

INTRODUCTION
- ------------

   AutoZone is the nation's leading specialty retailer of  automotive parts and 
accessories,  primarily  focusing on "Do-It-Yourself" ("D-I-Y") customers.  The
Company began operations in  1979 and at August 30, 1997, operated 1,728 stores
in 32 states, principally  located in  the  Sunbelt  and Midwest regions of the
United  States.  Each  AutoZone  store  carries   an  extensive  product  line, 
including  new and re-manufactured automotive hard parts, such as  alternators,
starters, water pumps, brake shoes and pads, carburetors, clutches and engines;
maintenance items,  such  as   oil, antifreeze, transmission, brake  and  power
steering fluids,  engine additives,  protectants  and  waxes;  and accessories,
such as car stereos and floor mats.  The Company carries parts for domestic and
foreign cars, vans  and  light  trucks. The Company also has a commercial sales
program  which  provides  commercial credit and prompt delivery  of  parts  and
other  products  to local  repair garages, dealers  and service stations.  This
program  was  offered  in 1,265 of the  Company's  stores at August  30,  1997. 
AutoZone does not perform automotive repairs or installations.

   AutoZone  is dedicated to a marketing and merchandising strategy to  provide
customers with  superior  service,  value  and  parts selection at conveniently
located,  well-designed  stores.   The  Company has implemented  this  strategy
primarily with knowledgeable and motivated store personnel trained to emphasize
prompt and courteous customer service, through an everyday low price policy and
by maintaining an extensive product line  with  an  emphasis on automotive hard
parts.   AutoZone's stores are generally situated in high-visibility  locations
and provide  a  distinctive  merchandise  presentation  in  an attractive store
environment.

   At August 30, 1997, AutoZone had stores in the following 32 states:

   Alabama         77     Louisiana       70    South Carolina   49
   Arizona         64     Maryland         1    Tennessee       106

                                                              =====   


MARKETING AND MERCHANDISING STRATEGY
- ------------------------------------

   AutoZone's marketing and merchandising strategy is to provide customers with
superior  service,  value  and  parts  selection   at   conveniently   located,
well-designed stores.  Key elements of this strategy are as follows:

  CUSTOMER SERVICE

   The  Company  believes  that  D-I-Y  customers  place a significant value on
customer service.  As a result, the Company emphasizes  customer service as the
most  important  element  in  its  marketing and merchandising  strategy.   The
Company attempts to promote a corporate  culture  which  "always puts customers
first"  and  emphasizes knowledgeable and courteous service.   To  do  so,  the
Company employs  parts  personnel  with technical expertise to advise customers
regarding the correct part type and  application,  utilizes  a  wide  range  of
training  methods  to  educate  and  motivate its store personnel, and provides
store  personnel with significant opportunities  for  promotion  and  incentive

compensation.   Customer  service  is  enhanced by proprietary electronic parts
catalogs which assist in the selection of  parts;  free  testing  of  starters,
alternators,  batteries,  and  sensors  and  actuators;  and liberal return and
warranty policies.  AutoZone  also  has a satellite system for all  its  stores
which, among  other  things, enables the Company to speed credit card and check 
approval processes and locate  parts  at  neighboring AutoZone stores. AutoZone 
stores generally open at 8 a.m. and close between 8 and 10 p.m. (with some open
to midnight)  Monday through Saturday and  typically  open  at 9 a.m. and close
between 6 and 7 p.m. on Sunday.

   During fiscal  year  1997, the Company  discontinued the  operations  of the 
Memphis  and  Houston  call  centers and  offered  to  transfer all call center
employees to stores  in  the Memphis and Houston area.  The Company anticipates
that the discontinuation of  the  call center operations will result in ongoing
savings to the Company.

   Alldata Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of AutoZone, has  developed a
database   system  that   provides comprehensive   and   up-to-date  automotive 
diagnostic,  service  and repair information  which it  markets to professional
repair shops.

  PRODUCT SELECTION

   The  Company  offers a wide selection of automotive parts and other products
designed to cover  a  broad range of specific vehicle applications.  AutoZone's
stores generally carry between 17,000  and 20,000 stock keeping units ("SKUs").
Each AutoZone  store  carries the same  basic product line  with  some regional
differences  based on  climate,   demographics  and  age  and type  of  vehicle
registration.  The Company's "flexogram" program enables the Company to  tailor
its  hard  parts  inventory  to the makes and models of the automobiles in each
store's trade area.  In addition  to  brand  name products, the Company sells a
number of products,  including batteries and engines,  under the "AutoZone" and 
"Duralast" names and a selection of  automotive hard parts, including starters,
alternators, water pumps, brakes, and  filters,  under its private label names.
In addition to  products  stocked  in  stores, the Company  offers a  range  of
products,  consisting  principally  of  automotive   hard  parts,  through  its
Express Parts program.  The Express Parts program provides air-freight delivery
of lower turnover products to AutoZone's stores.

  PRICING

   The Company employs an everyday  low  price  strategy and attempts to be the
price leader in hard parts categories.  Management  believes  that  its  prices
overall compare favorably to those of its competitors.

  COMMERCIAL SALES PROGRAM

   The  Company's commercial sales program provides credit and prompt  delivery
of parts and  other  products to  local  repair  garages, dealers  and  service
stations. At August 30, 1997,this program was offered in 1,265 of the Company's
stores.  Commercial customers generally pay the same  everyday  low prices  for
parts and other products as paid by the Company's D-I-Y customers.

  STORE DESIGN AND VISUAL MERCHANDISING

   AutoZone  seeks  to  design  and build stores with  a  high  visual  impact.
AutoZone stores are designed to have  an  industrial  "high tech" appearance by
utilizing colorful exterior signage, exposed beams  and  ductwork, and brightly
lighted interiors.  Merchandise in stores is attractively  displayed, typically
utilizing diagonally placed gondolas for maintenance and accessory  products as
well  as  specialized shelving for batteries and, in many stores, oil products.
The Company  employs  a uniform ("planogrammed") store layout system to promote
consistent merchandise presentation in all of its stores.  In-store signage and
special displays are used  extensively to aid customers in locating merchandise
and promoting products.





STORE DEVELOPMENT AND EXPANSION STRATEGY
- ----------------------------------------

   The following table sets  forth  the  Company's store development activities
during the past five fiscal years:

                                                FISCAL YEAR
                         ------------------------------------------------------
                          1993        1994        1995         1996        1997

Beginning Stores           678         783         933        1,143       1,423
New Stores                 107         151         210          280         308
Replaced Stores (1)         20          20          29           31          17
Closed Stores (1)         (22)        (21)        (29)         (31)        (20)
                          -----       -----       -----       -----       -----
Ending Stores              783         933        1,143       1,423       1,728
                          =====       =====       =====       =====       =====


      (1)  Replaced  stores  are  either relocations or conversions of existing
smaller stores to larger formats. Closed stores include replaced stores.

   The  Company  opened 305 net new stores  in  fiscal  1997,  representing  an
increase in total square footage from fiscal 1996 of approximately 23%, and had
52 stores  under construction  at the end of fiscal 1997.  The Company plans to 
open approximately 350 stores in fiscal 1998, representing an increase in total
store  square  footage of approximately 22%, as compared with the end of fiscal 
1997.

   The Company believes  that  expansion  opportunities  exist  both in markets
which it does not currently serve and in markets where it can achieve  a larger
presence.  The Company attempts to obtain high visibility sites in high traffic
locations  and  undertakes  substantial research prior to entering new markets.
Key factors in selecting new  site  and  market  locations  include population,
demographics,  vehicle profile and number and strength of competitors'  stores.
The Company generally seeks to open new stores within or contiguous to existing
market areas and  attempts  to  cluster  development  in new urban markets in a
relatively  short  period  of time in order to achieve economies  of  scale  in
advertising and distribution costs.  The Company may also expand its operations
through  acquisitions of existing  stores  from  third  parties.   The  Company
regularly  evaluates  potential  acquisition  candidates,  in  new  as  well as
existing market areas.

   AutoZone's  net  sales  have  grown significantly in the past several years,
increasing from $1,217 million in fiscal 1993 to $2,691 million in fiscal 1997.
The  continued  growth  and  financial  performance  of  the  Company  will  be
dependent, in large part, upon  management's  ability  to  open new stores on a
profitable  basis  in  existing  and new markets and also upon its  ability  to
continue to increase sales in existing  stores.   There can be no assurance the
Company will continue to be able to open and operate new stores on a timely and
profitable  basis  or  will continue to attain increases  in  comparable  store
sales.

STORE OPERATIONS
- ----------------

  STORE FORMATS

   Substantially all of  AutoZone's  stores are based on standard store formats
resulting in generally consistent appearance,  merchandising  and  product mix.
Although the smaller store formats were generally used by the Company  for  its
earlier stores, the Company has increasingly used larger format stores starting
with  its  8,100  square  foot  store introduced in 1987, its 6,600 square foot
store introduced in 1991 and its  7,700  square  foot store introduced in 1993.
In fiscal 1998, the 6,600 square foot and larger store  formats are expected to 
account  for  more  than  85% of new and replacement stores.  Total store space
as of August 30, 1997 was as follows:

                                                             Total Store
    STORE FORMAT                 NUMBER  OF  STORES        SQUARE FOOTAGE(1)
    ------------                 ------------------        -----------------
   8,100 sq. ft                          230                 1,863,000
   7,700 sq. ft.                         415                 3,195,500
   6,600 sq. ft.                         610                 4,026,000
   5,400 sq. ft.                         453                 2,446,200
   4,000 sq. ft.                          20                    80,000
                                       -----                ----------
       Total                           1,728                11,610,700
                                       =====                ==========

   (1)  Total  store  square footage is based on the Company's  standard  store
formats, including normal  selling,  office, stockroom and receiving space, but
excluding excess space not utilized in a store's operations.

   Approximately 85% to 90% of each store's  square  footage  is selling space,
of which  approximately 30% to 40% is  dedicated to automotive parts  inventory
The parts inventory  area is fronted  by  a  counter  staffed  by knowledgeable
parts  personnel and  equipped  with  proprietary  electronic  parts  catalogs.
The remaining  selling  space  contains  gondolas for  accessories, maintenance
items, including  oil and air  filters,  additives  and  waxes, and other parts 
together with specifically designed shelving for batteries and, in many stores,
oil products.

   Approximately three quarters  of the Company's stores are freestanding, with
the balance principally located within  strip  shopping  centers.  Freestanding
large format stores typically have parking for approximately 45 to 50 cars on a
lot  of approximately 3/4 to one acre.  The Company's 5,400  and  4,000  square
foot stores  typically  have  parking  for  approximately 25 to 40 cars and are
usually located on a lot of approximately 1/2 to 3/4 acre.

 STORE PERSONNEL AND TRAINING

   While  subject to fluctuation based on seasonal  volumes  and  actual  store
sales, the  4,000,  5,400 and 6,600 square foot stores typically employ 8 to 20
persons, including a  manager  and  an assistant manager, and the larger stores
typically employ 9 to 21 persons.  The  Company  generally hires personnel with
prior automotive experience.  Although the Company  relies primarily on on-the-
job training, it also provides formal training programs,  which include regular
store  meetings  on  specific  sales and product issues, standardized  training
manuals and a specialist program under which store personnel can obtain Company
certification in several areas of technical expertise.  The Company supplements
training with frequent store visits by management.

   The Company provides financial  incentives  to  store  managers  through  an
incentive compensation program and through participation in the Company's stock
option plan.  In addition, AutoZone's growth has provided opportunities for the
promotion  of qualified employees.  Management believes these opportunities are
an important  factor  in  AutoZone's  ability  to  attract, motivate and retain
quality personnel.

   The Company supervises store operations primarily  through approximately 286
area advisors who report to one of 33 district managers,  who,  in turn, report
to  one  of  seven  regional  managers,  as  of  August  30, 1997.  Purchasing,
merchandising,  advertising,  accounting,  cash management, store  development,
systems   technology  and  support, and  other  store  support   functions  are
centralized in the Company's store support center in Memphis,  Tennessee.   The
Company believes that such centralization enhances  consistent execution of the
Company's  merchandising  and  marketing strategy at the store level.

  STORE AUTOMATION

   In order to assist store  personnel  in  providing  a high level of customer
service,  all  stores have proprietary electronic parts catalogs  that  provide
parts information  based  on  the  make,  model and year of an automobile.  The
catalog display screens are placed on the hard  parts inventory counter so that
both employees and customers can view the screen.   In  addition, the Company's
satellite system enables the stores to speed up credit card  and check approval
processes and locate parts at neighboring AutoZone stores.

   All stores utilize the Company's computerized Store Management System, which
includes   optical   character  recognition  scanning  and  point-of-sale  data
collection  terminals.   The  Store  Management  System  provides  productivity
benefits, including  lower  administrative  requirements and improved personnel
scheduling  at the store level, as well as enhanced  merchandising  information
and improved  inventory  control.   The  Company  believes the Store Management
System also enhances customer service through faster processing of transactions
and simplified warranty and product return procedures.


PURCHASING AND DISTRIBUTION
- ---------------------------

   Merchandise  is  selected  and  purchased for all stores  at  the  Company's
store support center in Memphis.   No one class of product accounts for as much
as 10% of the Company's total sales.  In  fiscal  1997, the  Company  purchased
products  from  approximately  300  suppliers  and no single supplier accounted
for more  than 7% of the Company's  total  purchases. During fiscal year  1997,
the  Company's  ten  largest  suppliers  accounted  for  approximately  33%  of
the Company's purchases.  The Company generally has few long-term contracts for
the purchase of merchandise.  Management believes that AutoZone's relationships
with suppliers  are  excellent.   Management  also  believes  that  alternative
sources  of  supply  exist,  at  similar  cost, for substantially all types  of
product sold.

   Substantially all of the Company's merchandise  is shipped by vendors to the
Company's distribution centers.  Orders are typically  placed  by  stores  on a
weekly  basis  with orders shipped from the warehouse in trucks operated by the
Company on the following day.

COMPETITION
- -----------

   The Company competes  principally  in  the  D-I-Y  and,  more  recently, the
commercial automotive aftermarket.  Although the number of competitors  and the
level  of  competition  experienced by AutoZone's stores varies by market area,
the automotive aftermarket is highly fragmented and generally very competitive.
The Company believes that  the  largest  share of the automotive aftermarket is
held by independently owned jobber stores  which,  while principally selling to
wholesale accounts, have significant D-I-Y sales.  The  Company  also  competes
with  other  automotive  specialty  retailing  chains  and,  in certain product
categories,  such  as  oil  and filters, with discount and general  merchandise
stores.  The principal competitive  factors which affect the Company's business
are store location, customer service, product selection and quality  and price.
While AutoZone believes that it competes  effectively in its various geographic
areas,  certain  of its competitors have substantial  resources  or  have  been
operating longer in particular geographic areas.

TRADEMARKS
- ----------

   The Company has  registered  several  service  marks  and  trademarks in the
United  States  Patent  and  Trademark  office,  including  its  service   mark
"AutoZone"  and  its  trademarks  "AutoZone,"  "Duralast,"  "Valucraft," "Ultra
Spark,"  "Deutsch,"  "Albany"  and  "Alldata".  The Company believes  that  the
"AutoZone" service mark and trademarks  have  become  an important component in
its merchandising and marketing strategy.

EMPLOYEES
- ---------

   As  of  August 30, 1997, the Company employed approximately  28,700 persons,
approximately 20,000 of whom  were employed  full-time.   Approximately  86% of 
the Company's employees were employed in stores or in direct field supervision,
approximately 7% in distribution  centers and approximately 7% in store support
functions.

   The  Company's  employees  currently  are  not  members  of any unions.  The

   The lease of the Express Parts and Fixture warehouse  in  Memphis expires in
March 2000.   The  Company  also  rents  additional  warehouse  space,  various 
district  offices and  training  and  other  office  facilities  which  are not 
material in the aggregate.

   At August 30, 1997, the Company leased 595 and  owned  1,133  of  its  1,728
store  properties.   Original lease terms generally range from five to 20 years

ITEM 3 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

   The Company was a defendant  in  a  purported  class  action  entitled "Jack
Elliot  and  Greg  Dobson,  on  behalf  of  themselves and all others similarly
situated,  vs. AutoZone,  Inc. and  AutoZone  Stores, Inc." filed on  or  about 
May 9,  1997,  in  the Circuit Court for Roane  County,  Tennessee.    AutoZone 
Stores, Inc.,  is  a   wholly-owned   subsidiary  of   the  Company.  In  their
complaint, which was similar to class action complaints filed  against  several
other  retailers  of  aftermarket  automotive batteries, the plaintiffs alleged
that the Company sold "old," "used,"  or "out of warranty" automotive batteries
to customers as if the batteries were new,  and  purported to  state  causes of
action  for  unfair  or  deceptive  acts  or  practices,  breaches of contract,
breaches of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, intentional misrepresenta-
tion, fraudulent concealment, civil  conspiracy, and  unjust  enrichment.   The
plaintiffs were seeking an accounting  of all moneys wrongfully received by the
Company, compensatory and punitive damages,  as well as plaintiffs' costs.  On
September  4,  1997,  on the plaintiffs' motion, the court dismissed  the  case
without prejudice.

   The Company is a defendant  in  a  purported  class  action entitled "Joe C.
Proffitt,  Jr.,  on  behalf of himself and all others similarly  situated,  vs.
AutoZone, Inc., and  AutoZone Stores,  Inc.,"  filed in  the Circuit Court  for
Jefferson County,  Tennessee, on or about  October  17,  1997.  Along  with the
complaint, the  Plaintiff filed a motion to  conditionally certify a multistate 
class.  In the complaint, which is similar to the class action complaint in the 
action "Elliott v. AutoZone, Inc." described above  (and with substantially the 
same lawyers representing the plaintiff), and is similar to other class  action
complaints  filed  against several  other retailers  of aftermarket  automotive
batteries, the  plaintiff  alleges that the Company sold "old," "used," or "out 
of warranty" automotive batteries to customers as if the  batteries  were  new, 
and  purports  to  state  causes  of  action  for  unfair or deceptive acts  or 
practices,  breach of contract, breach of the duty of good faith and fair deal-
ing, intentional  misrepresentation, fraudulent concealment,  civil conspiracy,
and unjust enrichment.  The plaintiffs are seeking an accounting of all  moneys
wrongfully received by the Company, compensatory and  punitive damages, as well 
as plaintiffs'  costs.  The  Company  believes the claims are without merit and 
intends to vigorously defend this action.

   The  Company is also a party to various claims and lawsuits arising in  the
ordinary  course  of business.  The Company does not believe that  such claims 
and  lawsuits, individually  or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse 
effect on its results of operations or financial condition.
