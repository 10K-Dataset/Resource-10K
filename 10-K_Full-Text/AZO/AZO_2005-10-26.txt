        1. Business

Introduction

We
        are
        the nation’s leading specialty retailer of automotive parts and accessories,
        with most of our sales to do-it-yourself (“DIY”) customers. We began operations
        in 1979 and at August 27, 2005, operated 3,592 stores in the United States,
        including 2 in Puerto Rico, and 81 in Mexico. Each of our stores carries
        an
        extensive product line for cars, sport utility vehicles, vans and light trucks,
        including new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items,
        accessories and non-automotive products. In many of our stores we also have
        a
        commercial sales program that provides commercial credit and prompt delivery
        of
        parts and other products to local, regional and national repair garages,
        dealers
        and service stations. We also sell the ALLDATA brand automotive diagnostic
        and
        repair software. On the web at www.autozone.com, we sell diagnostic and repair
        information, auto and light truck parts, and accessories. We do not derive
        revenue from automotive repair or installation.

Marketing
        and Merchandising Strategy

We
        are
        dedicated to providing customers with superior service, value and quality
        automotive parts and products at conveniently located, well-designed stores.
        Key
        elements of this strategy are:

Customer
        Service

Customer
        service is the most important element in our marketing and merchandising
        strategy, which is based upon consumer input. We emphasize that our AutoZoners
        (employees) should always put customers first by providing prompt, courteous
        service and trustworthy advice. Our electronic parts catalog assists in the
        selection of parts; and lifetime warranties are offered by us or our vendors
        on
        many of the parts we sell. Our wide area network in our stores helps us to
        expedite credit or debit card and check approval processes and to locate
        parts
        at neighboring AutoZone stores.

Our
        stores generally open at 7:30 or 8 a.m. and close between 8 and 10 p.m. Monday
        through Saturday and typically open at 9 a.m. and close between 6 and 9 p.m.
        on
        Sunday. However, some stores are open 24 hours, and some have extended hours
        of
        6 or 7 a.m. until midnight seven days a week.

We
        also
        provide specialty tools through our Loan-A-Tool program. Customers can borrow
        a
        specialty tool, such as a steering wheel puller, for which a DIY customer
        or a
        repair shop would have little or no use other than for a single job. AutoZoners
        also provide other free services, including check engine light readings;
        battery
        charging; oil recycling; and testing of starters, alternators, batteries,
        sensors and actuators.

We
        believe that the satisfaction of DIY customers and professional technicians
        is
        often impacted by our ability to provide specific automotive products as
        requested. Our stores generally offer approximately 21,000 stock keeping
        units
        (“SKUs”), covering a broad range of vehicle types. Each store carries the same
        basic product line, but we tailor our parts inventory to the makes and models
        of
        the vehicles in each store’s trade area. Our hub stores carry a larger
        assortment of products that can be delivered to commercial customers or local
        satellite stores. In excess of 750,000 additional SKUs of slower-selling
        products are available either through our vendor direct program (“VDP”), which
        offers overnight delivery, or through our salvage auto parts and original
        equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) parts programs.

We
        are
        constantly updating the products that we offer to assure that our inventory
        matches the products that our customers want, when they want them.


Pricing

We
        want
        to be perceived by our customers as the value leader in our industry by
        consistently providing quality merchandise at the right price, backed by
        a good
        warranty and outstanding customer service. On many of our products we offer
        multiple value choices in a good/better/best assortment, with appropriate
        price
        and quality differences from the “good” products to the “better” and “best”
        products. A key component is our exclusive line of in-house brands: Valucraft,
        AutoZone, Duralast and Duralast Gold. We believe that our overall prices
        compare
        favorably to those of our competitors.

Marketing

We
        believe that targeted advertising and marketing play important roles in
        succeeding in today’s environment. We are constantly working to understand our
        customers’ wants and needs so that we can build long-lasting, loyal
        relationships. We utilize marketing and advertising primarily to advise
        customers about the overall importance of vehicle maintenance, our great
        value
        and the availability of high quality parts. Broadcast and targeted loyalty
        efforts are our primary marketing methods of driving traffic to our stores.
        To
        increase average sales dollars per transaction, we utilize in-store signage
        and
        creative product placement to help educate customers about products they
        need.

Store
        Design and Visual Merchandising

We
        design
        and build stores for a high visual impact. The typical AutoZone store has
        an
        industrial “high tech” appearance by utilizing colorful exterior and interior
        signage, exposed beams and ductwork and brightly lighted interiors. Maintenance
        products, accessories and miscellaneous items are attractively displayed
        for
        easy browsing by customers. In-store signage and special displays promote
        products on floor displays, end caps and on the shelf.

Commercial

We
        believe our commercial sales program is one of the largest aftermarket seller
        of
        automotive parts and other products to local, regional and national repair
        garages, dealers and service stations in the United States. As a part of
        the
        program we offer credit and delivery to our commercial customers. The program
        operated out of 2,104 stores as of August 27, 2005. Through our hub stores,
        we
        offer a greater range of parts and products desired by professional technicians
        and this additional inventory is available for our DIY customers as well.
        Commercial has a national sales team focused on national and regional commercial
        accounts, as well as an outside sales force for customers located around
        our
        commercial stores.

Store
        Operations

Store
        Formats

Substantially
        all AutoZone stores are based on standard store formats resulting in generally
        consistent appearance, merchandising and product mix. Approximately 85% to
        90%
        of each store’s square footage is selling space, of which approximately 40% to
        45% is dedicated to hard parts inventory. The hard parts inventory area is
        generally fronted by a counter or pods that run the depth or length of the
        store, dividing the hard parts area from the remainder of the store. The
        remaining selling space contains displays of maintenance, accessories, and
        non-automotive items.


We
        have
        knowledgeable AutoZoners available to assist customers with their parts needs
        utilizing our proprietary electronic parts catalog with a display screen
        that is
        visible to both the AutoZoner and the customer. In addition to helping ensure
        fast, accurate parts lookup in English or Spanish, the parts catalog will
        suggest additional items that a customer should purchase in order to properly
        install the merchandise being purchased.

We
        believe that our stores are “destination stores,” generating their own traffic
        rather than relying on traffic created by adjacent stores. Therefore, we
        situate
        most stores on major thoroughfares with easy access and good parking.

Store
        Personnel and Training

Each
        store typically employs from 10 to 16 AutoZoners, including a manager and,
        in
        some cases, an assistant manager. AutoZoners typically have prior automotive
        experience. All AutoZoners are encouraged to complete courses resulting in
        certification by the National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence
        (“ASE”), which is broadly recognized for training certification in the
        automotive industry. Although we do on-the-job training, we also provide
        formal
        training programs, including an annual national sales meeting, regular store
        meetings on specific sales and product issues, standardized training manuals
        and
        a specialist program that trains AutoZoners in several areas of technical
        expertise from both the Company and from independent certification agencies.
        Training is supplemented with frequent store visits by management.

Store
        managers receive financial incentives through performance-based bonuses.
        In
        addition, our growth has provided opportunities for the promotion of qualified
        AutoZoners. We believe these opportunities are important to attract, motivate
        and retain quality AutoZoners.

All
        store
        support functions are centralized in our two store support centers located
        in
        Memphis, Tennessee and Mexico. We believe that this centralization enhances
        consistent execution of our merchandising and marketing strategies at the
        store
        level, while reducing expenses and cost of sales.

Store
        Automation

All
        of
        our stores have a proprietary electronic parts catalog that provides parts
        information based on the make, model and year of a vehicle. The electronic
        catalog also tracks inventory availability at the store, at other nearby
        stores
        and through special order. The catalog display screens are placed on the
        hard
        parts counter or pods where both AutoZoners and customers can view the screen.
        In addition, our wide area network enables the stores to expedite credit
        or
        debit card and check approval processes, immediately access national warranty
        data, implement real-time inventory controls and locate and hold parts at
        neighboring AutoZone stores.

Our
        stores utilize our computerized proprietary Store Management System, which
        includes bar code scanning and point-of-sale data collection terminals. The
        Store Management System provides administrative assistance and improved
        personnel scheduling at the store level, as well as enhanced merchandising
        information and improved inventory control. We believe the Store Management
        System also enhances customer service through faster processing of transactions
        and simplified warranty and product return procedures.

We
        believe that expansion opportunities exist both in markets that we do not
        currently serve, and in markets where we can achieve a larger presence. We
        attempt to obtain high visibility sites in high traffic locations and undertake
        substantial research prior to entering new markets. The most important criteria
        for opening a new store are its projected future profitability and its ability
        to achieve our required investment hurdle rate. Key factors in selecting
        new
        site and market locations include population, demographics, vehicle profile,
        number and strength of competitors’ stores and the cost of real estate. In
        reviewing the vehicle profile, we also consider the number of vehicles that
        are
        seven years old and older, “our kind of vehicles”, as these are generally no
        longer under the original manufacturers’ warranty and will require more
        maintenance and repair than younger vehicles. We generally seek to open new
        stores within or contiguous to existing market areas and attempt to cluster
        development in markets in a relatively short period of time. In addition
        to
        continuing to lease or develop our own stores, we evaluate and may make
        strategic acquisitions.

Purchasing
        and Supply Chain

Merchandise
        is selected and purchased for all stores through our two store support centers
        located in Memphis, Tennessee and Mexico. No one class of product accounts
        for
        as much as 10 percent of our total sales. In fiscal 2005, no single supplier
        accounted for more than 10 percent of our total purchases. We generally have
        few
        long-term contracts for the purchase of merchandise. We believe that we have
        good relationships with suppliers. We also believe that alternative sources
        of
        supply exist, at similar cost, for most types of product sold. Most of our
        merchandise flows through our distribution centers to our stores.

Our
        hub
        stores have increased our ability to distribute products on a timely basis
        to
        many of our stores. A hub store is able to provide replenishment of products
        sold and deliver other products only maintained in hub store inventories
        to a
        store in its coverage area generally within 24 hours. Hub stores are generally
        replenished from distribution centers multiple times per week.

Competition

The
        sale
        of automotive parts, accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive
        in
        many areas, including name recognition, product availability, customer service,
        store location and price. AutoZone competes in both the retail DIY and
        commercial do it for me (“DIFM”) auto parts and accessories
        markets.

Competitors
        include national and regional auto parts chains, independently owned parts
        stores, wholesalers and jobbers, repair shops, car washes and auto dealers,
        in
        addition to discount and mass merchandise stores, department stores, hardware
        stores, supermarkets, drugstores and home stores that sell aftermarket vehicle
        parts and supplies, chemicals, accessories, tools and maintenance parts.
        AutoZone competes on the basis of customer service, including the trustworthy
        advice of our AutoZoners, merchandise selection and availability, price,
        product
        warranty, store layouts and location.


Trademarks
        and Patents

We
        have
        registered several service marks and trademarks in the United States Patent
        and
        Trademark office as well as in certain other countries, including our service
        marks, “AutoZone” and “Get in the Zone,” and trademarks,
“AutoZone,” “Duralast,” “Duralast Gold,” “Valucraft,” and “ALLDATA.” We believe
        that the “AutoZone” service marks and trademarks are important components of our
        merchandising and marketing strategy.

Employees

As
        of
        August 27, 2005, we employed approximately 52,000 persons, approximately
        percent of whom were employed full-time. About 91 percent of our AutoZoners
        were
        employed in stores or in direct field supervision, approximately 6 percent
        in
        distribution centers and approximately 3 percent in store support functions.
        Included in the above numbers are approximately 1,300 persons employed in
        our
        Mexico operations.

We
        have
        never experienced any material labor disruption and believe that relations
        with
        our AutoZoners are generally good.

Risk
        Factors

We
        may not be able to increase sales by the same historic growth
        rates.

We
        have
        increased our store count in the past five fiscal years, growing from 2,928
        stores at August 26, 2000, to 3,673 stores at August 27, 2005, an average
        store
        count increase per year of 5%. Additionally, we have increased annual revenues
        in the past five fiscal years from $4.5 billion in fiscal 2000 to $5.7 billion
        in fiscal 2005, an average increase per year of 5%. Annual revenue growth
        is
        driven by the opening of new stores and same-store sales. Same store sales
        were
        negative in fiscal 2005. We cannot provide any assurance that we can continue
        to
        open stores or increase same-store sales.

Our
        business depends upon qualified employees.

At
        the
        end of fiscal 2005, our consolidated employee count was approximately 52,000.
        We
        can not assure that we can continue to hire and retain qualified employees
        at
        current wage rates. If we do not maintain competitive wages, our customer
        service could suffer by reason of a declining quality of our workforce or,
        alternatively, our earnings could decrease if we increase our wage
        rates.


If
        demand for our products slows, then our business may be materially
        affected.

Demand
        for products sold by our stores depends on many factors. In the short term,
        it
        may depend upon:

•

the
                  number of miles vehicles are driven annually, as higher vehicle
                  mileage
                  increases the need for maintenance and repair. Mileage levels may
                  be
                  affected by gas prices and other
                  factors.

•

the
                  number of vehicles in current service that are seven years old
                  and older,
                  as these vehicles are no longer under the original vehicle manufacturers’
                  warranty and will need more maintenance and repair than younger
                  vehicles.

•

the
                  weather, as vehicle maintenance may be deferred in periods of inclement
                  weather.

•

the
                  economy. In periods of rapidly declining economic conditions, both
                  retail
                  DIY and commercial DIFM customers may defer vehicle maintenance
                  or repair.
                  During periods of expansionary economic conditions, more of our
                  DIY
                  customers may pay others to repair and maintain their cars instead
                  of
                  working on their own vehicles or they may purchase new vehicles.

For
        the
        long term, demand for our products may depend upon:

•

the
                  quality of the vehicles manufactured by the original vehicle manufacturers
                  and the length of the warranty or maintenance offered on new
                  vehicles.

•

restrictions
                  on access to diagnostic tools and repair information imposed by
                  the
                  original vehicle manufacturers or by governmental
                  regulation.

If
        we are unable to compete successfully against other businesses that sell
        the

products
        that we sell, we could lose customers and our sales and profits
        may

decline.

The
        sale
        of automotive parts, accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive
        based on many factors, including name recognition, product availability,
        customer service, store location and price. Competitors are rapidly opening
        locations near our existing stores. AutoZone competes as a supplier in both
        the
        DIY and DIFM auto parts and accessories markets.

Competitors
        include national, regional and local auto parts chains, independently owned
        parts stores, jobbers, repair shops, car washes and auto dealers, in addition
        to
        discount and mass merchandise stores, department stores, hardware stores,
        supermarkets, drugstores and home stores that sell aftermarket vehicle parts
        and
        supplies, chemicals, accessories, tools and maintenance parts. Although we
        believe we compete effectively on the basis of customer service, including
        the
        knowledge and expertise of our AutoZoners, merchandise quality, selection
        and
        availability, product warranty, store layout, location and convenience, price,
        and the strength of our AutoZone brand name, trademarks and service marks;
        some
        competitors may have competitive advantages, such as greater financial and
        marketing resources, larger stores with more merchandise, longer operating
        histories, more frequent customer visits and more effective advertising.
        If we
        are unable to continue to develop successful competitive strategies, or if
        our
        competitors develop more effective strategies, we could lose customers and
        our
        sales and profits may decline.

If
        we cannot profitably increase share in the commercial auto
        parts

business,
        our sales growth may be limited.

Although
        we are one of the largest sellers of auto parts in the commercial market,
        to
        increase commercial sales we must compete against automotive aftermarket
        jobbers, in addition to other auto parts retailers that have entered the
        commercial business. Although we believe we compete effectively on the basis
        of
        customer service, merchandise quality, selection and availability, price,
        product warranty and distribution locations, and the strength of our AutoZone
        brand name, trademarks and service marks, some automotive aftermarket jobbers
        have been in business for substantially longer periods of time than we have,
        have developed long-term customer relationships and have larger available
        inventories. We can make no assurances that we can profitably develop new
        commercial customers or make available inventories required by commercial
        customers.


If
        our vendors continue to consolidate, we may pay higher prices for
        our

merchandise.

In
        recent
        years, several of our vendors have merged and others have announced plans
        to
        merge. Further vendor consolidation could limit the number of vendors from
        which
        we may purchase products and could materially affect the prices we pay for
        these
        products.

Consolidation
        among our competitors may negatively impact our business.

In
        recent
        years, several large auto parts chains have merged. We do not know the impact
        these mergers will have upon competition in the retail automotive aftermarket.
        If our competitors are able to achieve efficiencies in their mergers, then
        there
        may be greater competitive pressures in the markets in which they are
        stronger.

War
        or acts of terrorism or the threat of either may negatively
        impact

availability
        of merchandise and adversely impact our sales.

War,
        or
        acts of terrorism or the threat of either, may have a negative impact on
        our
        ability to obtain merchandise available for sale in our stores. Some of our
        merchandise is imported from other countries. If imported goods become difficult
        or impossible to bring into the United States, and if we cannot obtain such
        merchandise from other sources at similar costs, our sales and profit margins
        may be negatively affected.

In
        the
        event that commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed,
        our
        business may be adversely impacted, as we may have difficulty shipping
        merchandise to our distribution centers and stores.

Rising
        fuel prices may negatively impact our profitability.

As
        mentioned above, rising fuel prices may demand for the products that we sell,
        overall transaction count and our profitability. Fuel prices impact our
        merchandise distribution, commercial delivery, utility, and product costs.

        Illinois, Louisiana, Ohio, Tennessee, Texas and Mexico. During fiscal 2005,
        we
        opened a new distribution center near Dallas, Texas and closed our smaller
        facility in San Antonio, Texas. Our store support center, which we own, is
        located in Memphis, Tennessee, and consists of 260,000 square feet. We also
        own
        and lease other properties that are not material in the aggregate.


Item
        3. Legal Proceedings

AutoZone,
        Inc. is a defendant in a lawsuit entitled "Coalition for a Level Playing
        Field,
        L.L.C., et al., v. AutoZone, Inc. et al.," filed in the U.S. District Court
        for
        the Southern District of New York in October 2004. The case was filed by
        approximately 240 plaintiffs, which are principally automotive aftermarket
        warehouse distributors and jobbers, against 24 defendants, 11 of which are
        principally automotive aftermarket retailers and 13 of which are principally
        aftermarket manufacturers. One aftermarket retailer was subsequently dismissed,
        leaving 10 aftermarket retailer defendants, and 6 aftermarket manufacturers
        subsequently settled, were dismissed, or were improperly served, leaving
        aftermarket manufacturer defendants; for a current total of 17 remaining
        defendants ("Defendants"). The plaintiffs allege, inter alia, that the
        automotive aftermarket retailer defendants have conspired with the aftermarket
        manufacturer defendants to receive benefits such as volume discounts, rebates,
        early buy allowances and other allowances, fees, inventory without payment,
        sham
        advertising and promotional payments, a share in the manufacturers' profits
        and
        excessive payments for services purportedly performed for the manufacturers
        in
        violation of the Robinson-Patman Act and the Sherman Act (collectively, the
        "Acts"). Additionally, a subset of plaintiffs alleges a claim of fraud against
        the automotive aftermarket retailer defendants based on discovery issues
        in a
        prior litigation involving similar Robinson-Patman Act claims. In the prior
        litigation, the discovery dispute, as well as the underlying claims, were
        decided in favor of AutoZone and the other automotive aftermarket retailer
        defendants who proceeded to trial, pursuant to a unanimous jury verdict which
        was affirmed by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. In the current litigation,
        plaintiffs seek an unspecified amount of damages (including statutory trebling),
        attorneys' fees, and a permanent injunction prohibiting the aftermarket retailer
        defendants from inducing and/or knowingly receiving discriminatory prices
        from
        any of the aftermarket manufacturer defendants and from opening up any further
        stores to compete with plaintiffs as long as defendants allegedly continue
        to
        violate the Acts.

We
        believe this suit to be without merit and are vigorously defending against
        it.
        In August 2005, the Defendants filed two motions to dismiss all claims with
        prejudice on substantive and procedural grounds, which if granted in their
        entirety, would resolve the litigation in Defendants' favor. Additionally,
        the
        Defendants are seeking to enjoin plaintiffs from filing similar lawsuits
        in the
        future.

On
        June
        22, 2005, the Attorney General of the State of California, in conjunction
        with
        District Attorneys for San Bernardino, San Joaquin and Monterey Counties,
        filed
        suit in the San Bernardino County Superior Court against AutoZone, Inc. and
        its
        California subsidiaries. The San Diego County District Attorney later joined
        the
        suit. The lawsuit alleges that AutoZone failed to follow various state statutes
        and regulations governing the storage and handling of used motor oil and
        other
        materials collected for recycling or used for cleaning AutoZone stores and
        parking lots. The suit seeks $12.0 million in penalties and injunctive relief.

AutoZone
        is involved in various other legal proceedings incidental to the conduct
        of our
        business. Although the amount of liability that may result from these other
        proceedings cannot be ascertained, we do not currently believe that, in the
        aggregate, they will result in liabilities material to our financial condition,
        results of operations, or cash flows.

Item
        5. Market for Registrant’s Common Stock and Related Stockholder
        Matters

AutoZone’s
        common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “AZO.” On
        October 17, 2005, there were 3,553 stockholders of record, which does not
        include the number of beneficial owners whose shares were represented by
        security position listings.

We
        currently do not pay a cash dividend on our common stock. Any payment of
        dividends in the future would be dependent upon our financial condition,
        capital
        requirements, earnings, cash flow and other factors.

The
        following table sets forth the high and low sales prices per share of common
        stock, as reported by the New York Stock Exchange, for the periods
