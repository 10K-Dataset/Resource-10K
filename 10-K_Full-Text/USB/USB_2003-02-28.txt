Five Star

Service Guaranteed


The U.S. Bank Five Star Service Guarantee

Our service is what ultimately differentiates U.S. Bank from our competitors. Every
day. Every transaction. To win customers, satisfy them, keep them and expand their
business relationship with U.S. Bank, we strive to deliver outstanding service to
every customer.

If we fall short in keeping our service guarantees, and the customer tells us they
did not get the service they expected and deserved, we pay the customer for the
inconvenience. We consider it a privilege to serve our customers; they are the reason
we are in business and because of them, our bank succeeds.

Our service guarantees apply
to every line of business, and we pledge outstanding service to every customer—from
personal checking account customers to large corporate banking clients; from small
business partners to private banking clients. Every one of our ten million customers is
covered by one or more guarantees that encompass accuracy, accessibility, timeliness
and responsiveness.

The U.S. Bank Five Star Service Guarantee is fundamental to the way we do
business. Evaluating outstanding customer service is a key element in our recruiting
practices, our training programs and our employee compensation structure.

The Company analyzes its performance on a net income basis in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, as well
as on an operating basis before merger and restructuring-related items and
cumulative effect of change in accounting principles referred to in this
Annual Report and Form 10-K as “operating earnings.” Operating earnings are
presented as supplemental information to enhance the reader’s understanding
of, and highlight trends in, the Company’s financial results excluding the
impact of merger and restructuring-related items of specific business
acquisitions and restructuring activities and cumulative effect of change
in accounting principles. Operating earnings should not be viewed as a
substitute for net income and earnings per share as determined in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States. Merger and restructuring-related items excluded from net income to
derive operating earnings may be significant and may not be comparable to
other companies.

Dividends per share have not been restated for the 2001 merger of Firstar
and the former U.S. Bancorp.

Forward-Looking Statements

This Annual Report and Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements.
Statements that are not historical or current facts, including statements about beliefs
and expectations, are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements
cover, among other things, anticipated future revenue and expenses and the
future prospects of the Company. Forward-looking statements involve inherent
risks and uncertainties, and important factors could cause actual results to
differ materially from those anticipated, including the following, in addition
to those contained in U.S. Bancorp’s reports on file with the SEC: (i) general
economic or industry conditions could be less favorable than expected,
resulting in a deterioration in credit quality, a change in the allowance for credit
losses, or a reduced demand for credit or fee-based products and services; (ii)
changes in the domestic interest rate environment could reduce net interest
income and could increase credit losses; (iii) the conditions of the securities
markets could change, adversely affecting revenues from capital markets
businesses, the value or credit quality of the Company’s assets, or the
availability and terms of funding necessary to meet the Company’s liquidity
needs; (iv) changes in the extensive laws, regulations and policies governing
financial services companies could alter the Company’s business environment or
affect operations; (v) the potential need to adapt to industry changes in
information technology systems, on which the Company is highly dependent, could
present operational issues or require significant capital spending; (vi)
competitive pressures could intensify and affect the Company’s profitability,
including as a result of continued industry consolidation, the increased
availability of financial services from non-banks, technological developments
or bank regulatory reform; (vii) acquisitions may not produce revenue enhancements
or cost savings at levels or within timeframes originally anticipated, or may
result in unforeseen integration difficulties; and (viii) capital investments
in the Company’s businesses may not produce expected growth in earnings
anticipated at the time of the expenditure. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the
date they are made, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update them in
light of new information or future events.

U.S. Bancorp 3


Fellow Shareholders:

I am pleased to tell you that U.S. Bancorp achieved its goals for the year
2002—to successfully complete the systems integration of Firstar and the “old”
U.S. Bancorp without any disruption of superior service to our customers; to
reduce the risk profile of our corporation; and to improve customer service
throughout our entire franchise

First, it is not overstating to say that the integration process was virtually
flawless and transparent to our more than ten million customers. The
integration was completed on schedule and met or exceeded our high expectations. We are now
a rarity in our industry—a 24-state, $180 billion corporation doing business
on a totally unified, single operating system for all of our markets and all of
our customers. The service, cost, accuracy and responsiveness advantages of that
are enormous, and we are already putting our new capabilities to work for our
customers.

Second, during the year, we continued to reduce the risk profile of
our corporation. We exited higher risk businesses; we intensified and improved
collection efforts; and we put improved credit and underwriting policies into
effect across the corporation. While our credit costs are still too high,
reflecting the nation’s current economic condition, it appears credit quality
has stabilized, and the improvements we have made put us in a position of
strength to take every advantage of our skill and expertise, our products and
services, our markets and an economic recovery.

Third, a re-energized culture of outstanding customer service is growing appreciably
throughout our company, which is especially gratifying in those markets where our
relentless pursuit of unparalleled service is a newer concept. We are pleased that our
employees embrace customer service as the single most important factor in our ongoing and
future success.

Our goals for 2003 are to generate increased organic growth, maximize our
operating leverage, skillfully manage credit quality, continue the reduction of
our risk profile—and, as always, grow revenues faster than expenses. We are
persistent and disciplined in our approach to these goals—we have specific
initiatives in process, and fully anticipate achieving our goals.

Despite a challenging economy, we ended 2002 seeing an increase in core revenue
growth, a decrease in total noninterest expense, improvement in the net
interest margin and a significant increase in deposits. Though 2003 will most certainly
present its own demands, we have the pieces in place to grow and the momentum to
meet whatever challenges may lie ahead.

Please know that, as always, our highest priority is increasing the value of
your investment in U.S. Bancorp. It is the reason we come to work each day.

Sincerely,

Jerry A. Grundhofer

Chairman, President and

Chief Executive Officer

February 28, 2003

In Remembrance

September 26, 2002, was a sad day for all members of the U.S. Bank family. Four
of our U.S. Bank colleagues and a valued customer were victims of a fatal
robbery attempt at a U.S. Bank branch office in Norfolk, Nebraska.

Our hearts are still heavy with the pain of this tragedy, and our thoughts
and prayers continue to go out to the families, friends and co-workers of Lisa,
Lola, Jo, Samuel and Evonne.

Corporate Governance

Good corporate governance promotes ethical business practices, demands
meticulous accounting policies and procedures, and includes a structure with
effective checks and balances. Corporate governance is vital to the continued
success of U.S. Bancorp and the entire financial services industry.

Our ethical standards have rewarded us with an enviable reputation in today’s
marketplace—a marketplace where trust is hard to earn. Our shareholders,
customers, communities and employees demand—and deserve—to do business with
companies they can trust.

U.S. Bancorp operates with uncompromising honesty and integrity. Our Board of
Directors has had a Corporate Governance Committee for many years. We have
adopted new Corporate Governance Guidelines in response to today’s heightened
concern. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines are available for you to view on
our Internet web site at usbank.com.

Following are some of the important elements of our Corporate Governance
practices.

Independent Oversight

Our Audit Committee is composed entirely of independent outside directors. In
addition, the Board, the Audit Committee and the other committees of the Board
meet in “executive session” without management in attendance at every meeting.
The presiding director at every executive session of the Board is an independent
director. The Board and each committee also have express authority to engage
outside advisors to provide additional independent expertise for their deliberations.

Board of Directors’ Focus on U.S. Bancorp

To ensure that our directors are able to focus effectively on our business, we
limit the number of other public company boards a director may serve on to
three. The Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of U.S. Bancorp
serves on only two other public company boards. Audit Committee members may
serve on no more than three other public company audit committees, and the
chairman of the Audit Committee serves on no other audit committees.

Board of Directors’ Knowledge and Expertise

All of our directors are skilled business leaders. Directors are encouraged to
attend continuing director education seminars in order to keep a sharp focus on
current good governance practices. In addition, the Board and each committee
have express authority to retain outside advisors.

The Board and each committee perform annual self-evaluations in order to assess
their performance and to ensure that the Board and committee structure is
providing effective oversight of corporate management. You may review the
charters of each of our Board committees on our Internet web site at
usbank.com.

Management’s Vested Interest in U.S. Bancorp

We understand clearly that U.S. Bancorp shareholders are the primary
beneficiaries of management’s actions. All U.S. Bancorp executive officers and
directors own shares of company stock, and in order to further emphasize the
alignment of management’s interests with those of our shareholders, we have
established stock ownership guidelines for our executive officers.

Disclosure Controls

We have established rigorous procedures to ensure that we provide complete and
accurate disclosure in our publicly filed documents. We have also established a
telephone hotline for employees to anonymously submit any concern they may have
regarding corporate controls or ethical breaches. Management investigates all
complaints and directs to our Audit Committee any relating to concerns about
our financial statements or public disclosures.

Shareholder Approval of Equity Compensation Plans

All equity compensation plans under which future grants may be made have been
shareholder approved. In addition, no options issued under any current plans
have been repriced.

U.S. Bancorp Code of Ethics and Business Conduct

Each year, we reiterate the vital importance of our Code of Ethics and Business
Conduct. The Code applies to directors, officers and all employees, who must
certify annually their compliance with the standards of the Code. The content
of the Code is based not solely on what we have the right to do, but, even more
importantly, on what is the right thing to do. Our standards are higher than
any legal minimum because our business is built on trust. You may review our Code
of Ethics and Business Conduct on our Internet web site at usbank.com. Click on
About U.S. Bancorp and then on Ethics at U.S. Bank.

Outstanding Service and Convenience

Choices. Flexibility. Availability. U.S. Bank customers bank on their own
schedules and on their own terms. Whether it’s visiting one of our 2,142
branch offices in 24 states, logging onto U.S. Bank Internet Banking from
the comfort of home, or stopping by a U.S. Bank ATM while traveling, our
customers enjoy the ease and convenience of financial services delivered
when, where and how they want them. And, regardless of the distribution
system they choose, we deliver responsive, prompt and helpful
service—guaranteed.

Broadening Relationships Across Our
Branch Network

Our expansive scope multiplies our sales opportunities, and enhances the
access our customers have to bank when and where they want.

Local decision-making, combined with the strength of our company’s
extensive resources, is the hallmark of Community Banking. Smaller,
non-urban communities enjoy our full array of financial products and
services delivered by local people living and working in their communities
and responding to local situations with autonomy. In our larger and urban
locations, Metropolitan Banking staff deliver products and services as
separate lines of business, partnering with all areas of the bank to
provide customers with the specialized services they need, such as
Commercial Banking, Corporate Banking, Trust or Treasury Management.
Banking with us doesn’t stop with brick and mortar buildings. In-Store and
Corporate On-Site Banking brings banking right to customers, inside grocery
and convenience stores, colleges and universities, workplaces, retirement
centers and other high-traffic locations. Specialized trust, home mortgage
and brokerage offices across the country and in several international
cities add to the extensive network of locations U.S. Bank operates.

Delivering Anytime ATM Access

Customers enjoy 24-hour access to 4,604 U.S. Bank ATMs, making ours the
third largest bank-owned ATM network in the nation. But our ATM network
isn’t just big; it’s the best in the business. Customers can withdraw
funds, make deposits, check balances, receive statements, order checks,
purchase phone minutes and stamps, transfer funds between accounts and
request check copies. To deliver on our commitment of convenience, nearly
one-half of the ATMs owned by U.S. Bank are located in non-bank settings,
including corporate offices, manufacturing facilities, shopping centers,
gas stations, medical facilities and airports. We deliver convenient
access where our customers need it.

Providing Anytime Phone Banking Options

Around the clock, our 24-hour call center bankers are ready to take
customers’ calls. Our service centers in Cincinnati, Milwaukee, St. Paul,
Denver and Portland handled over 126 million inbound inquiries in 2002,
including those served by our interactive voice response system. These
centers also handled over one million inbound

6 U.S. Bancorp


and outbound telesales calls, offering customers new products and services
to meet their needs while generating revenue growth. Spanish language
options and multilingual call center bankers are always available to meet
the needs of our non-English-speaking customers. In 2002, an average of
50,000 callers each month chose to use the Spanish version of 24-Hour
Banking, representing a 90 percent increase over 2001. The number of
customer service calls to our multilingual call center bankers reached an
average of 15,000 each month, representing a 131 percent annual increase.
Personalized service, account information, product sales, and more—all
with one phone call to U.S. Bank.

E-Enabling Customers with Online Capabilities

Our nationally recognized Internet web site, usbank.com, makes it easier
than ever for customers to review account balances, make transfers, open
checking accounts, apply for loans and more—anywhere they have Internet
access. With a host of new features introduced in 2002, including a
streamlined transfer function and online account opening, U.S. Bank
Internet Banking was ranked in the elite top 10 Internet banking sites by
Gomez.com, an independent quality measurement company. More than 1.3
million customers have selected U.S. Bank Internet Banking to meet their
need for easy-to-use, comprehensive and secure online services. In 2002,
enrollment in U.S. Bank Bill Pay, our online bill payment product,
increased by 25 percent, showing that online banking is quickly becoming
the most active banking delivery channel.

Among other new benefits and functionality introduced in the past year,
Trust customers can now enjoy the convenience of U.S. Bank TrustNow Essentials,
a way to retrieve account information and reports via the Internet. Corporate
Payment Systems has significantly enhanced the capabilities of PowerTrack®,
our innovative online business to business payment and transaction system, giving
corporate customers even greater control of costs in the supply and payment
process. And U.S. Bank AccessOnline, a web-based program management and
reporting tool, is the next generation in our complete suite of commercial
products.

U.S. Bank operates branches across 24 states in a wide variety of traditional
offices and non-traditional locations. Our Pike Place Market office matches the
excitement, traffic and customer service renown of the Pike Place Fish Market.

Growing Core Revenue

Attracting. Retaining. Expanding. These are the building blocks we will
use to grow core revenue, the foundation for creating and sustaining
shareholder value. Ultimately, growth depends on our employees fulfilling
the financial needs of our customers. By tapping into the tremendous
potential of our employee sales force, focusing on the highest level of
service, building cross-market and cross-business partnerships and
developing new products and services, we are exceeding customers’ needs,
positioning us for superior revenue growth.

Taking Ownership of Our Business

Employees, shareholders and customers are all linked by a common
interest—achieving our goals and performance expectations. Ownership of
these goals exists at the business line level. Business lines have the
autonomy to implement industry-competitive business models and strategies.
Resources are allocated based on growth and return expectations, and
monthly financial reviews track results. This environment creates a front
line accountability where every employee understands and contributes to
sales volume targets, service standards and profit objectives. Results are
measured quickly and widely shared. National sales management calls
provide a forum to communicate sales opportunities and best practices among
business lines.

Developing a Superior Sales Culture

Customer needs drive our business. U.S. Bank continues to develop a sales
culture designed to proactively identify sales opportunities based on
customer needs. Every employee contributes to the revenue growth of our
company through sales production, superior customer service, efficiency
and a continuous focus on shareholder value. Employees know what is expected
within this dynamic sales environment, where everyone takes ownership of
our business and is held accountable for the results. And every employee
can stand proudly behind our Five Star Service Guaranteed products and
services because they are among the finest in the industry, backed by
up-to-date processing and technology, personalized training, ongoing
product education, effective marketing campaigns and competitive
performance incentives. Our Pay for Performance compensation program
rewards employees financially and personally for their achievements in
sales and customer service and for their contributions to company
earnings.

Introducing a New FOCUS

Recognizing the power of the primary checking customer, on April 1, 2002,
U.S. Bank introduced a dedicated and focused strategy across the entire
franchise to attract, retain and expand the core U.S. Bank customer base,
specifically those customers who maintain a primary checking account with
U.S. Bank. This initiative, called FOCUS, involves dramatically modifying
our activities, investments and attention to increase our demand deposit
account base. By concentrating on this critical segment, we are more
likely to grow and strengthen a customer’s existing banking relationship with us,
providing opportunities for increased sales and service across every line
of business, from credit cards and trust products to home mortgages and
investments and insurance products.

Among other support programs,
employees are regularly supplied with specialized tools designed to drive growth,
build new customer relationships and enhance existing relationships. We
are extremely pleased with the exceptional results of our first year’s FOCUS
efforts, which have energized us for an even more powerful FOCUS
commitment in 2003.

Partnering Across Our Company

We have the power to share ideas, best practices, capabilities and sales
opportunities across business lines throughout 24 states. Local relationship
management, combined with expert advice and support from across our
organization, truly gives our customers an advantage—personalized service and
increased resources. A great partnership in our Private Client Group shows the
power of cross-business cooperation. In 2002, the collaboration among Private
Banking, Personal Trust and Asset Management was strengthened, allowing clients
to manage all their complex financial needs in one place. Significantly more
referrals among these business lines resulted in a 28 percent increase in
Personal Trust sales.

Providing Innovative Products and Services

We continuously expand our line of superior, competitive products and services
to fulfill the financial needs of our broad customer base. In 2002, U.S. Bank
introduced a variety of financial services that are helping to fuel revenue and
customer growth, while providing first-rate benefits our customers expect and

a priority. Our employees reflect the diversity of their local communities,
maintain strong relationships with Hispanic individuals, businesses and
community organizations and communicate most effectively with customers.

Any employee across our company can contact bilingual bankers using an internal
directory, so customers who speak another language can be served anywhere,
anytime.

Spanish-language marketing tools assist our employees in fulfilling the
financial needs of Spanish-speaking customers. Branch signage, brochures,
bilingual direct mail, billboards and print and radio advertisements communicate
our products, services and commitment to the Hispanic market.

We offer many products and services tailored to meet the specific needs
of Hispanic customers. Our ATMs and 24-Hour Banking system feature complete
Spanish language options. Product information in Spanish is also available on
our web site at usbank.com/espanol. We accept identification issued by the
Consulate of Mexico to open an account. First-time borrowers can qualify for
credit using our Credit Builder Secured Loan and the Secured Visa Card, and U.S.
Bank is a partner in the En Su Casa program to provide homeownership counseling
and flexible mortgages. We reach out to Hispanic-owned businesses in
face-to-face meetings, calling sessions and letters.

U.S. Bank also sponsors a variety of cultural and community events of
importance to Hispanic communities, including events during Cinco de Mayo and
Hispanic Heritage Month. We sponsor and partner with local and national Hispanic
organizations, including the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce (USHCC),
the National Council of La Raza (NCLR) and the Latin Business Association (LBA).

Management’s Discussion and Analysis

OVERVIEW

U.S. Bancorp and its subsidiaries (the
“Company”) comprise the organization created by the
acquisition by Firstar Corporation of the former
U.S. Bancorp of Minneapolis, Minnesota (“USBM”).
The merger was completed on February 27, 2001, as a
pooling-of-interests, and accordingly all financial information
has been restated to include the historical information of both
companies. Each share of Firstar stock was exchanged for one
share of the Company’s common stock while each share of
USBM stock was exchanged for 1.265 shares of the Company’s
common stock. The new company retained the U.S. Bancorp
name.

The Company began 2002 with several specific
goals. The first goal was to successfully complete the
integration of Firstar and the former U.S. Bancorp. The
second goal was to reduce the overall risk profile of the
Company. Third, the Company was determined to improve customer
service throughout the franchise in an effort to enhance
customer retention and longer-term revenue growth opportunities.
Finally, despite the efforts to complete these goals, the
Company had an additional objective, to grow revenues faster
than expenses. The Company’s results for 2002 largely
reflected the achievement of these goals and improved
significantly over 2001 despite the current economic conditions.

Earnings Summary

The
Company reported net income of $3.3 billion in 2002, or
$1.71 per diluted share, compared with $1.7 billion, or
$.88 per diluted share, in 2001. Return on average assets and
return on average equity were 1.91 percent and
19.4 percent in 2002, compared with returns of
1.03 percent and 10.5 percent in 2001. The increase in
earnings per diluted share, return on average assets and return
on average equity was primarily due to total net revenue growth,
lower noninterest expense and a reduction in the provision for
credit losses. Net income in 2002 included after-tax merger and
restructuring-related items of $211.3 million
($324.1 million on a pre-tax basis) and a cumulative effect
of change in accounting principles of $37.2 million, or
$0.2 per diluted share, compared with after-tax merger and
restructuring-related items of $844.3 million
($1.3 billion on a pre-tax basis) in 2001. Refer to the
“Accounting Changes” section for further discussion of
the earnings impact of changes in accounting principles. Merger
and restructuring-related items in 2002, on a pre-tax basis,
included $271.1 million of net expenses associated with the
Firstar/USBM merger and $53.0 million associated with the
acquisition of NOVA Corporation and other smaller acquisitions.
In 2001, merger and restructuring-related items, on a pre-tax
basis, included a $62.2 million gain on the sale of
branches, $847.2 million of noninterest expense and
$382.2 million of provision for credit losses associated
with the Firstar/USBM merger. Merger and restructuring-related
items in 2001 also included $50.7 million of expense for
restructuring operations of U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray, and
$48.5 million related to the acquisition of NOVA and other
smaller acquisitions. Refer to the “Merger and
Restructuring-Related Items” section for further discussion.

The Company reported operating earnings (net
income excluding merger and restructuring-related items and
cumulative effect of change in accounting principles) of
$3.5 billion in 2002, or $1.84 per diluted share, compared
with $2.6 billion, or $1.32 per diluted share in 2001.
Return on average assets and return on average equity, excluding
merger and restructuring-related items and cumulative effect of
change in accounting principles, were 2.06 percent and
20.9 percent in 2002, respectively, compared with returns
of 1.54 percent and 15.7 percent in 2001. Operating
earnings in 2002 reflected total net revenue growth, on a
taxable-equivalent basis, excluding merger and
restructuring-related gains, of 8.4 percent. This growth
was driven by strong core growth in consumer and payment
processing revenues, cash management fees, and mortgage banking
as well as the impact of acquisitions. This revenue growth was
offset somewhat by growth of 4.8 percent in noninterest
expense, excluding merger and restructuring-related charges. The
change in noninterest expense, excluding merger and
restructuring-related charges, reflected the impact of acquired
businesses and a higher level of impairments of mortgage
servicing rights (“MSRs”), offset by cost savings and
the elimination of goodwill amortization upon adopting new
accounting principles for business combinations. As a result,
the efficiency ratio on an operating basis was 47.7 percent
in 2002, compared with 49.5 percent in 2001. The banking
efficiency ratio (the ratio of expenses to revenues without the
impact of investment banking and brokerage activity), on an
operating basis, was 44.0 percent in 2002, compared with
45.2 percent in 2001. The change in the banking efficiency
ratio reflected the favorable impact in 2002 of adopting new
accounting principles and cost savings from ongoing integration
efforts, partially offset by an increase in MSR impairments and
the impact of acquisitions of fee-based businesses that have
higher efficiency ratios than the core banking business. The
provision for credit losses, on an operating basis, declined by
$797.6 million from a year ago primarily reflecting credit
related actions taken in 2001.

While net income and operating earnings for 2002
and 2001 included a number of significant items, core growth was
strong. Notable items in 2002 included net gains on the sale of
securities of $299.9 million, a decrease of

$29.2 million, compared with 2001, and the
recognition of $186.0 million in MSR impairments in 2002,
an increase of $125.2 million, compared with 2001. Results
for 2002 also reflected $67.4 million in gains from credit
card portfolio sales; a $50.0 million litigation charge,
including investment banking regulatory matters at Piper;
incremental personnel costs of $46.4 million, in part to
rationalize post-integration technology, operations and support
functions; and $25.5 million in leasing residual
impairments. Notable items in 2001 included $1.2 billion in
the provision for credit losses representing an incremental
third quarter provision of $1,025 million and a
$160 million increase in the first quarter of 2001 in
connection with the acceleration of certain workout strategies.
Results for 2001 also reflected $36.0 million of leasing
residual impairments, $40.2 million of write-downs of
commercial leasing partnerships and $22.2 million of asset
write-downs of tractor/trailer inventory and other items.
Excluding the impact of these items, accounting changes and
acquisitions, the Company’s revenue growth in 2002 was
5.4 percent while noninterest expense was essentially flat.

The Company analyzes its performance on a net
income basis determined in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States, as well as on an
operating basis before merger and restructuring-related items
and cumulative effect of change in accounting principles,
referred to in this Annual Report and Form 10-K as
“operating earnings.” Management believes that
separately capturing merger and restructuring-related items in
the income statement is important because each acquisition
transaction is discrete, and the amount and nature of the
non-recurring items related to the integration can vary
significantly from transaction to transaction. Moreover, merger
and restructuring-related items are not incurred in connection
with the core operations of the business and their separate
disclosure provides more transparent financial information about
the Company. Operating earnings and related discussions are
presented as supplementary information to enhance the
reader’s understanding of, and highlight trends in, the
Company’s core financial results by excluding the effects
of discrete business acquisitions and restructuring activities.
Operating earnings should not be viewed as a substitute for net
income and earnings per share as determined in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
Merger and restructuring-related items excluded from net income
to derive operating earnings may be significant and may not
be comparable to other companies.

Table 2 provides a reconciliation of
operating earnings to net income in accordance with GAAP.

Acquisition and Divestiture Activity

In addition to restating all prior
periods to reflect the Firstar/USBM merger, operating results
for 2002 reflected the following transactions accounted for as
purchases from the date of completion.

On December 31, 2002, the Company acquired
the corporate trust business of State Street Bank and Trust
Company (“State Street Corporate Trust”) in a cash
transaction valued at $725 million. State Street Corporate
Trust was a leading provider, particularly in the Northeast, of
corporate trust and agency services to a variety of
municipalities, corporations, government agencies and other
financial institutions serving approximately 20,000 client
issuances representing over $689 billion of assets under
administration. With this acquisition, the Company is among the
nation’s leading providers of a full range of corporate
trust products and services. The transaction represented total
assets acquired of $681 million and total liabilities of
$39 million at the closing date. Included in total assets
were contract and other intangibles with a fair value of
$225 million and the excess of purchase price over the fair
value of identifiable net assets (“goodwill”) of
$444 million. The goodwill reflected the strategic value of
the combined organization’s leadership position in the
corporate trust business and processing economies of scale
resulting from the transaction. As part of the purchase price,
$75 million was placed in escrow for up to eighteen months
with payment contingent on the successful transition of business
relationships. Concurrent with the system conversion expected in
2003, certain State Street Corporate Trust assets under
administration will be transferred to the Company or its
affiliated mutual funds.

On November 1, 2002, the Company acquired 57
branches and a related operations facility in California from
Bay View Bank, a wholly owned subsidiary of Bay View Capital
Corporation, in a cash transaction. The transaction represented
total assets acquired of $853 million and total liabilities
(primarily retail and small business deposits) of
$3.3 billion. Included in total assets were approximately
$336 million of select loans primarily with depository
relationships, core deposit intangibles of $56 million and
goodwill of $427 million. The goodwill reflected the
strategic value of expanding the Company’s market within
the San Francisco Bay area.

On April 1, 2002, the Company acquired
Cleveland-based The Leader Mortgage Company, LLC, a wholly owned
subsidiary of First Defiance Financial Corp., in a cash
transaction valued at $85 million. The transaction
represented total assets acquired of $527 million and total
liabilities assumed of $446 million. Included in total
assets were mortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”) and
other intangibles of $173 million and goodwill of
$17 million. Leader specializes in acquiring servicing of
loans originated for state and local housing authorities. The
purchase agreement allows for an additional payment of up to
$1.2 million if certain performance criteria are met.

On September 7, 2001, the Company acquired
Pacific Century Bank in a cash transaction. The acquisition
included 20 branches located in Southern California with

Provision for credit losses in 2001 includes
    losses of $201.3 million on the disposition of an unsecured
    small business product, losses of $76.6 million on the
    sales of high loan-to-value home equity loans and the indirect
    automobile loan portfolio of USBM, a $90.0 million charge
    to align risk management practices, align charge-off policies
    and expedite the transition out of a specific segment of the
    health care industry not meeting the lower risk appetite of the
    Company, and a $14.3 million charge related to the
    restructuring of a co-branding credit card
    relationship.

approximately $712 million in deposits and
$570 million in assets.

On July 24, 2001, the Company acquired NOVA
Corporation, a merchant processor, in a stock and cash
transaction valued at approximately $2.1 billion. The
transaction represented total assets acquired of $2.9 billion
and total liabilities assumed of $773 million. Included in
total assets were merchant contracts and other intangibles of
$650 million and goodwill of $1.6 billion. The
goodwill reflected NOVA’s leadership position in the
merchant processing market and its ability to provide a
technologically superior product that is enhanced by a high
level of customer service. The Company believes that these
factors, among others, will allow NOVA to generate sufficient
positive cash flows from new business in future periods to
support the goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition.

The following acquisitions were completed during
the year 2000. On October 13, 2000, the Company acquired
Scripps Financial Corporation of San Diego, which had
10 branches in San Diego County and total assets of $650
million. On September 28, 2000, the Company acquired Lyon
Financial Services, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the
privately held Schwan’s Sales Enterprises, Inc. (now known
as The Schwan Food Company) in Marshall, Minnesota. Lyon
Financial specialized in small-ticket lease transactions and had
$1.3 billion in assets. On April 7, 2000, the
Company acquired Oliver-Allen Corporation, Inc., a privately
held information technology equipment leasing company with total
assets of $280 million. On January 14, 2000, the
Company acquired Peninsula Bank of San Diego, which had
11 branches in San Diego County and total assets of
$491 million. In addition to these business combinations,
the Company purchased 41 branches in Tennessee from First
Union National Bank on December 8, 2000, representing
approximately $450 million in assets and $1.8 billion
in deposits.

Refer to Notes 4 and 5 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information
regarding business combinations and merger and
restructuring-related items.

Planned Tax-Free Distribution

On February 19, 2003, the Company
announced that its Board of Directors approved a plan to effect
a spin-off of its capital markets business unit, including
investment banking and brokerage activities primarily conducted
by its wholly owned subsidiary, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray
Inc. In 2002, the capital markets business unit had average
assets of $3.0 billion, generated revenues of
$737.3 million (5.8 percent of total consolidated
revenues) and contributed $1.1 million of net income
representing less than 1 percent of the Company’s
consolidated net income.

The Company intends to execute this plan as a
tax-free distribution of 100% of its ownership interests in the
capital markets business and plans to retain $215 million
of subordinated debt of the new company. The distribution is
subject to certain conditions including SEC registration,
regulatory review and approval and a determination that the
distribution will be tax-free to the Company and its
shareholders. While expected to be completed in the third
quarter of 2003, the Company has no obligation to consummate the
distribution, whether or not these conditions are satisfied.

This distribution does not include brokerage,
financial advisory or asset management services offered to
customers through its other business units. The Company will
continue to provide asset management services to its customers
through the Private Client, Trust and Asset Management business
units and access to investment products and services through an
extensive network of licensed financial advisors within the
retail brokerage platform of the Consumer Banking business unit.

STATEMENT OF INCOME ANALYSIS

Net Interest Income

Net interest income, on a
taxable-equivalent basis, was $6.9 billion in 2002,
compared with $6.4 billion in 2001 and $6.1 billion in
2000. The increase in net interest income in 2002 was due to
improvement in net interest margin and growth in average earning
assets. The net interest margin in 2002 was 4.61 percent,
compared with 4.42 percent and 4.33 percent in 2001
and 2000, respectively. Average earning assets were
$149.1 billion for 2002, compared with $145.2 billion
and $140.6 billion for 2001 and 2000, respectively.

The 19 basis point improvement in 2002 net
interest margin, compared with 2001 reflected the funding
benefits of the declining interest rate environment, a more
favorable funding mix and improving spreads due to product
repricing dynamics, growth in net free funds and a shift in mix
toward retail loans, partially offset by lower yields on the
investment portfolio. The $3.9 billion (2.7 percent)
increase in average earning assets for 2002, compared with 2001
was primarily driven by increases in the investment portfolio
and retail loan growth, partially offset by transfers of high
credit quality commercial loans to Stellar Funding Group, Inc.
(the “loan conduit”) and a decline in commercial and
commercial real estate loans partially due to current economic
conditions.

Total average loans of $114.5 billion in
2002 were $3.7 billion (3.1 percent) lower, compared
with 2001, reflecting strong growth in average retail loans and
residential mortgages of $3.1 billion (9.1 percent) and

20 U.S. Bancorp


$.2 billion (1.9 percent),
respectively, which was more than offset by an overall decline
in average commercial and commercial real estate loans of
$6.3 billion (12.5 percent) and $.4 billion
(1.4 percent), respectively. The decline in commercial and
commercial real estate loans was primarily driven by softness in
loan demand, workout activities and reclassifications and
transfers to other loan categories. Approximately
$721 million of the change in average commercial loans
year-over-year for 2002 was due to the transfer of high credit
quality commercial loans to the loan conduit. Also included in
the change in average commercial and commercial real estate
loans in 2002, compared with 2001, was a reclassification of
approximately $634.5 million of commercial loans to other
loan categories, including the commercial real estate category
($266.9 million) and residential mortgages
($327.0 million), in connection with conforming loan
classifications at the time of system conversions. Prior years
were not restated, as it was impractical to determine the extent
of reclassification for all periods presented.

Average investment securities were
$28.8 billion (31.5 percent) higher in 2002, compared
with 2001, reflecting the reinvestment of proceeds from loan
sales, declines in commercial and commercial real estate loan
balances and deposits assumed in connection with the Bay View
transaction. During 2002, the Company sold $13.7 billion of
fixed-rate securities with a portion replaced with floating-rate
securities in conjunction with the Company’s interest rate
risk management strategies.

Average interest-bearing deposits of
$76.4 billion in 2002 were lower by $3.4 billion,
compared with 2001. Growth in average savings products
(5.4 percent) for 2002 reflected service quality
initiatives, product promotions directed toward government
banking sectors and customer decisions to maintain liquidity
given the current economic environment. The increase in savings
products was more than offset by reductions in the average
balances of higher cost time certificates of deposit
(17.3 percent) and time certificates of deposit greater
than $100,000 (13.2 percent). The decline in time
certificates and time deposits greater than $100,000 reflected
funding decisions toward more favorably priced wholesale funding
sources given the rate environment and customers’ desire to
maintain liquidity.

Average net free funds increased from a year ago,
including an increase in average noninterest-bearing deposits of
$3.6 billion (14.4 percent) in 2002, compared with
2001. The increase in noninterest-bearing deposits, primarily in
business and government banking accounts, reflected product
promotions and customers maintaining higher compensating
balances given the current rate environment.

The 9 basis point improvement in net interest
margin for 2001, compared with 2000, was due to the funding
benefit of the declining rate environment and improved spreads
due to product repricing dynamics and loan conduit activities,
partially offset by the first quarter of 2001 sales of the high
loan-to-value (“LTV”) home equity portfolios and lower
yields on the investment portfolio. The $4.6 billion
(3.2 percent) increase in average earning assets for 2001,
compared with 2000, was primarily driven by increases in the
investment portfolio, core retail loan growth and the impact of
acquisitions. This growth was partially offset by a
$2.6 billion decline in lower margin residential mortgages
and a $2.2 billion reduction related to transfers of high
credit quality commercial loans to the loan conduit. Average
investment securities were $4.6 billion (26.6 percent)
higher in 2001, compared with 2000, reflecting net purchases of

securities. Average interest-bearing deposits
increased $241 million (.3 percent) in 2001, compared
with 2000. Growth in average interest checking and money market
deposits was more than offset by reductions in the average
balances of higher cost time certificates of deposit less than
$100,000. The decline in time certificates of deposit less than
$100,000 reflected funding decisions toward more favorably
priced wholesale funding sources given the interest rate
environment during 2001. The increase in average net free funds
of $1.2 billion from 2000 included an increase in
noninterest-bearing deposits of $1.3 billion
(5.4 percent).

Provision for Credit Losses

The provision for credit
losses is recorded to bring the allowance for credit losses
to a level deemed appropriate by management based on
factors discussed in the “Analysis and Determination of
Allowance for Credit Losses” section. The provision for
credit losses was $1,349.0 million in 2002, compared
with $2,528.8 million and $828.0 million in 2001 and
2000, respectively.

The decline in the provision for credit losses of
$1,179.8 million in 2002 and the corresponding increase of
$1,700.8 million in 2001 was primarily related to specific
credit actions taken in 2001. Included in the provision for
credit losses in 2001 was a $1,025 million incremental
provision recognized in the third quarter of 2001 and a
$160 million charge during the first quarter of 2001 in
connection with an accelerated loan workout strategy. The third
quarter of 2001 provision for credit losses was significantly
above the level anticipated earlier in that quarter and was
taken after extensive reviews of the Company’s commercial
portfolio in light of the events of September 11, 2001,
declining economic conditions, and company-specific trends. This
action reflected the Company’s expectations, at that time,
of a prolonged economic slowdown and recovery. In addition to
these actions, the provision for credit losses in 2001 included
a merger and restructuring-related provision of
$382.2 million. The merger and restructuring-related
provision consisted of a $201.3 million provision for
losses related to the disposition of an unsecured small business
product; a $90.0 million charge to align risk management
practices, align charge-off policies and expedite the

transition out of a specific segment of the
health care industry not meeting the lower risk appetite of the
combined company; a $76.6 million provision for losses related
to the sales of high LTV home equity loans and the indirect
automobile loan portfolio of USBM; and a $14.3 million
charge related to the restructuring of a co-branding credit card
relationship. Refer to Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for further information on merger and
restructuring-related items.

Overall, the level of the provision for credit
losses and the level of the allowance for credit losses still
reflected elevated levels of nonperforming assets and net
charge-offs, continued stress in certain segments of the
portfolio and the economic uncertainty existing at year-end 2002.

Refer to the “Corporate Risk Profile”
section for further information on the provision for credit
losses, net charge-offs, nonperforming assets and other factors
considered by the Company in assessing the credit quality of the
loan portfolio and establishing the allowance for credit losses.

Noninterest Income

Noninterest income in 2002 was
$5.9 billion, compared with $5.4 billion in 2001 and
$4.9 billion in 2000. Noninterest income in 2001 included
$62.2 million of merger and restructuring-related gains in
connection with the sale of 14 branches representing
$771 million in deposits. Refer to Note 5 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on
merger and restructuring-related items.

Excluding merger and restructuring-related gains,
noninterest income was $5.9 billion in 2002, an increase of
$529.7 million (9.9 percent), compared with 2001. The
growth in noninterest income in 2002, compared with 2001 was
primarily driven by growth in banking product revenues of
$248.7 million (6.3 percent) and increases resulting
from acquisitions, including NOVA, Pacific Century, Leader and
Bay View, which accounted for approximately $301.3 million
of the increase in noninterest income in 2002. Offsetting these
favorable variances was a decline in capital markets-related
revenue of $97.1 million (10.3 percent), reflecting
continued softness in the equity capital markets that has
reduced investment banking activities, brokerage transaction
volumes and fees based on the valuation of assets under
management. Credit and debit card revenue, corporate payment
products revenue and ATM processing services revenue were higher
in 2002, compared with 2001, by $51.1 million
(11.0 percent), $28.0 million (9.4 percent) and
$6.3 million (4.8 percent), respectively, primarily
reflecting growth in sales and card usage. Merchant processing
services revenue grew by $258.4 million
(83.7 percent), primarily due to the acquisition of NOVA in
July of 2001. Deposit service charges increased in 2002 by
$46.7 million (7.0 percent), primarily due to fee
enhancements and new account growth. Cash management fees and
commercial products revenue grew by $69.6 million
(20.0 percent) and $41.8 million (9.6 percent),
respectively, primarily driven by changes in the earnings credit
rate for business deposits, growth in commercial business
activities, fees related to loan conduit activities and product
enhancements. Commercial product revenue growth was offset
somewhat by lease residual impairments in 2002. In addition to
the impact of the acquisition of Leader, the $96.2 million
(41.1 percent) increase in mortgage banking revenue was
also due to higher levels of mortgage originations and sales and
loan servicing revenue in 2002, compared with 2001. Included in
noninterest income were net securities gains of

$299.9 million in 2002, compared with
$329.1 million in 2001, representing a decline of
$29.2 million (8.9 percent). Other fee income was
higher in 2002, compared with 2001, by $53.2 million
(18.6 percent), primarily due to $67.4 million in
gains from credit card portfolio sales in 2002, a reduction in
retail leasing residual and other asset impairments and lower
levels of equity investment losses, compared with 2001, offset
somewhat by lower official check revenue that is sensitive to
changes in interest rates.

Excluding merger and restructuring-related gains,
noninterest income was $5.3 billion in 2001, an increase of
$412.5 million (8.4 percent) from 2000. Credit and
debit card revenue increased $34.9 million
(8.1 percent) in 2001, compared with 2000, reflecting
slower growth in corporate, purchasing and retail card
transaction volumes during the year. Corporate card transaction
volumes declined somewhat in late 2001, principally due to
slower economic conditions and declining business travel since
the events of September 11, 2001. Merchant processing
services increased $188.9 million (157.4 percent),
principally due to the NOVA acquisition in July 2001. Deposit
service charges, commercial product revenue, cash management
fees, and mortgage banking revenue also improved in 2001,
compared with 2000 by $111.7 million (20.1 percent),
$87.4 million (25.0 percent), $54.9 million
(18.8 percent), and $44.1 million (23.2 percent),
respectively. The increase in deposit service charges was
primarily due to the alignment and re-design of products and
features following the Firstar/USBM merger in February 2001. The
increase in commercial product revenue and cash management fees
was primarily driven by growth in core business, loan conduit
activities and product enhancements. Mortgage banking revenue
increased in 2001, compared with 2000 due to increased
origination and sales fees and loan servicing revenue, partially
offset by a decrease in gains on the sale of servicing rights.
Trust and investment management fees declined $31.8 million
(3.4 percent) and capital markets-related revenue declined
$145.4 million (13.4 percent), reflecting softness in
equity capital markets since late 2000. Included in noninterest
income for 2001 was $329.1 million of gains on the sale of
investment securities and principal-only residuals, compared
with $8.1 million of similar gains in 2000. Other income
declined $240.4 million in 2001, compared with 2000,
primarily reflecting a $125.0 million decline in the level
of earnings from equity investments and a $40.0 million
impairment of retail leasing residuals in 2001. The decline in
other income for 2001 also reflected a decline in gains from
sales of buildings of $42.5 million from 2000.

Noninterest Expense

Noninterest expense in 2002 was
$6.3 billion, compared with $6.6 billion and
$5.7 billion in 2001 and 2000, respectively. Noninterest
expense included merger and restructuring-related charges of
$324.1 million in 2002, compared with $946.4 million
in 2001 and $348.7 million in 2000. Excluding merger and

restructuring-related charges, noninterest
expense, on an operating basis, was $5.9 billion in 2002,
compared with $5.7 billion in 2001 and $5.4 billion in
2000. The increase in noninterest expense in 2002, on an
operating basis, of $273.7 million (4.8 percent) was
primarily the result of costs associated with recent
acquisitions, an increase in MSR impairments, litigation costs,
post-integration realignment costs, and core expense growth.
Recent acquisitions, including NOVA, Pacific Century, Leader and
Bay View, accounted for approximately $317.4 million of the
increase in 2002, which was comprised primarily of increased
intangible and personnel expenses. Included in noninterest
expense in 2002 was $186.0 million in MSR impairments,
compared with $60.8 million in 2001, an increase of
$125.2 million. The increase in MSR impairments was related
to increasing mortgage prepayments driven by declining interest
rates. Other significant items impacting noninterest expense
included recognizing a $50.0 million litigation charge in
2002, including $25.0 million for investment banking
regulatory matters at Piper and a $7.5 million liability
for funding independent analyst research for Piper’s
customers, and $46.4 million of personnel and related costs
for post-integration rationalization of technology, operations
and certain support functions. Offsetting these higher costs was
a reduction in capital markets-related expenses, the elimination
of $251.1 million of goodwill amortization in connection
with new accounting principles adopted in 2002 and a reduction
in asset write-downs of $52.6 million related to commercial
leasing partnerships and repossessed tractor/trailer property
taken in 2001. Refer to the “Acquisition and Divestiture
Activity” section for further information on the timing
of acquisitions.

The increase in noninterest expense in 2001,
compared with 2000, on an operating basis, of
$290.5 million (5.4 percent) was primarily the result
of acquisitions, including NOVA, Scripps Financial Corporation,
Pacific Century, Lyon Financial Services, Inc. and
41 branches in Tennessee, and represented an aggregate
increase of approximately $241.7 million. In addition to
the impact of acquisitions, noninterest expense in 2001
increased over 2000 due to the recognition of MSR impairments of
$60.8 million related to increasing mortgage prepayments
during the declining rate environment, and asset write-downs of
$52.6 million related to commercial leasing partnerships
and repossessed tractor/trailer property. These increases were
partially offset by a reduction in expenses related to capital
markets activity of $108.0 million and cost savings related
to merger and restructuring-related activities.

The efficiency ratio, before merger and
restructuring-related charges, improved to 47.7 percent in
2002, compared with 49.5 percent in 2001 and
48.8 percent in 2000. The banking efficiency ratio, before
merger and restructuring-related charges, was 44.0 percent
for 2002, compared with 45.2 percent in 2001 and
43.5 percent in 2000. The improvement in both the
efficiency ratio and the banking efficiency ratio for 2002,
compared with 2001, was primarily due to revenue growth, the
impact in 2002 of adopting the new accounting standards related
to amortization of intangibles and cost savings from ongoing
integration efforts, partially offset by an increase in MSR
impairments and the impact of acquisitions of fee-based
businesses that have higher efficiency ratios than the core
banking business. Both the efficiency ratio and the banking
efficiency ratio increased in 2001, compared with 2000,
primarily due to the NOVA acquisition.

Pension Plans

Because of the long-term nature of
pension plans, the accounting for pensions is complex and can be
impacted by several factors, including accounting methods,
investment and funding policies and the plan’s actuarial
assumptions. The Company’s pension accounting policy
complies with the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 87, “Employer’s Accounting for Pension
Plans” (“SFAS 87”), and reflects the long-term
nature of benefit obligations and the investment horizon of plan
assets. The Company has an established process for evaluating
the plans, their performance and significant plan assumptions,
including the assumed discount rate and the long-term rate of
return (“LTROR”). At least annually, an independent
consultant is engaged to assist U.S. Bancorp’s
Compensation Committee in evaluating plan objectives, investment
policies considering its long-term investment time horizon and
asset allocation strategies, funding policies and significant
plan assumptions. Although plan assumptions are established
annually, the Company may update its analysis on an interim
basis in order to be responsive to significant events that occur
during the year, such as plan mergers and amendments.

The Company’s pension plan measurement date
for purposes of its financial statements is September 30.
At the measurement date, plan assets are determined based on
fair value, generally representing observable market prices. The
projected benefit obligation is determined based on the present
value of projected benefit distributions at an assumed discount
rate. The discount rate utilized is based on match-funding
maturities and interest payments of high quality corporate bonds
available in the market place to the projected cash flows of the
plan as of the measurement date. At September 30, 2002 and
2001, the discount rate approximated the Moody’s Aa
corporate bond rating for projected benefit distributions with
duration of 11.6 years. Periodic pension expense includes
service costs, interest costs based on an assumed discount rate,
an expected return on plan assets based on an actuarially
derived market-related

U.S. Bancorp  25


value and amortization of actuarial gains and
losses. Accounting guidance provided within SFAS 87 has the
effect of reducing earnings volatility related to short-term
changes in interest rates and market valuations. Actuarial gains
and losses include the impact of plan amendments and various
unrecognized gains and losses which are deferred and amortized
over the future service periods of active employees. The
market-related value utilized to determine the expected return
on plan assets is based on fair value adjusted for the
difference between expected returns and actual performance of
plan assets. The unrealized difference between actual experience
and expected returns is included in the market-related value
ratably over a five-year period. Any unrecognized gains or
losses related to changes in the amount of the projected benefit
obligation or plan assets resulting from experience different
from the assumed discount rate or expected returns and from
changes in assumptions are deferred. To the extent an
unrecognized gain or loss, excluding the unrecognized asset gain
or loss, exceeds 10 percent of the greater of the projected
benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets
(“10 percent corridor”), the excess is recognized
over the future service periods of active employees. At
September 30, 2002, the accumulated unrecognized loss subject to
minimum amortization requirements under SFAS 87 for 2003
approximated $177 million and was less than the
10 percent corridor. The total unrecognized asset loss
approximated $675 million and will ratably decrease the
actuarially derived market-related value of plan assets through
2007. The impact to pension expense of the net unrecognized
losses will increase pension costs in each year from 2004 to
2007, by approximately $36.6 million, $41.9 million,
$52.3 million and $18.0 million, respectively, during
that timeframe. This assumes that the performance of plan assets
meets the assumed LTROR. Actual results may vary depending on
the performance of plan assets and changes to assumptions
required in the future.

In accordance with its existing practices, the
independent pension consultant utilized by the Company updated
the analysis of expected rates of return and evaluated peer
group data, market conditions and other factors relevant to
determining the LTROR assumptions for determining pension costs
for 2003. In light of recent market performance and the results
of the independent analysis, the Company made a decision to
re-measure its pension plans effective in the third quarter of
2002 based on current information with respect to asset values,
a reduction in the LTROR, discount rates, census data and other
relevant factors. The impact of changes to assumptions for the
pension plans did not have a material impact on the future
financial results of the Company. The funding policy is
generally to maintain a funded status sufficient to meet
participant benefit obligations. The Company contributed
$150.0 million in 2002 to the qualified pension plan in
accordance with this policy. Future funding requirements are
dependent on the performance of the pension plan but are not
expected to have a material impact on the liquidity of the
Company. The table below provides a summary of changes in
pension plan assumptions as of September 30.

As a result of this interim period re-measurement
and other factors, the Company’s total pension cost for
2002 increased by approximately $1.0 million, reducing the
Company’s pension and profit sharing credit from
$64.8 million in 2001 to $63.8 million in 2002.
Pension costs increased by $32.5 million related to a
reduction in the expected rate of return on the Company’s
pension plan assets, utilizing a lower discount rate to
determine the projected benefit obligation given the declining
rate environment and the impact of changes in employee
demographics. Offsetting this increase were a one-time
curtailment gain of $9.0 million related to freezing
certain benefits of a nonqualified pension plan, a reduction in
service costs of $11.9 million related to changes in the
pension plans at the time of the plan mergers and a
$10.5 million reduction in pension costs associated with
establishing a profit sharing plan for employees of Piper and
discontinuing their participation in the defined benefit plan.
Contributions to the profit sharing plan in 2002 were minimal
given the lower financial performance of the Capital Markets
business line.

For purposes of determining the periodic pension
cost for 2002, the LTROR declined from 12.2 percent for the
Firstar pension plan and 11.0 percent for the USBM plan (a
blended rate of approximately 11.6 percent) in 2001 to
approximately 10.9 percent for 2002. This reflected
utilizing a LTROR of 11.9 percent for the first six months
of 2002 and 9.9 percent for the remainder of the year. The
discount rate declined from 8.0 percent for the Firstar
pension plan and 7.8 percent for the USBM pension plan
(blended rate of approximately 7.9 percent) to
7.2 percent for 2002. This

The weighted rates for 2002 represent a
    blended rate utilizing the original 2002 assumption for the
    first six months of 2002 and the rates for 2003 for the

    most recent information available at the re-measurement
    date.

reflected utilizing a discount rate of
7.5 percent for the first six months of 2002 and
6.8 percent for the remainder of the year. Offsetting these
factors somewhat was the expected benefit of merging the defined
benefit pension plan of Firstar, which used a final average pay
formula for determining pension benefits, with the cash balance
pension plan of USBM.

In 2003, it is estimated that changes to the
LTROR and discount rate will increase 2003 pension costs by
approximately $27.3 million. Offsetting much of this
increase is an expected benefit of approximately
$19.0 million associated with lower interest costs related
to cash balance accounts and actual changes in employee
demographics, such as retirement age. Excluding the impact of
the one-time curtailment gain in 2002, the net increase in
pension cost relative to 2002 will be approximately
$8.3 million.

As discussed above, investment and funding
policies and related pension plan assumptions can have an impact
on the results of the Company. As such, U.S. Bancorp’s
Compensation Committee regularly evaluates plan objectives,
investment policies considering its long-term investment time
horizon and asset allocation strategies, funding policies and
significant plan assumptions. The Company’s pension plan
objectives include maintaining a funded status sufficient to
meet participant benefit obligations over time while reducing
long-term funding requirements and pension costs. In
establishing its investment policies and asset allocation
strategies, the Company considers expected returns and the
volatility associated with different strategies. The independent
consultant performs stochastic modeling that projects numerous
outcomes using a broad range of possible scenarios, including a
mix of possible rates of inflation and economic growth. Some of
the scenarios included are: low inflation and high growth (ideal
growth), low inflation and low growth (recession), high
inflation and low growth (stagflation) and high inflation and
high growth (inflationary growth). Starting with current
economic information, the model bases its projections on past
relationships between inflation, fixed income rates and equity
returns when these types of economic conditions have existed
over the previous 30 years, both in the U.S. and in foreign
countries. Approximately five-hundred different scenarios are
modeled and then the results are summarized into percentiles
that are utilized to evaluate the potential performance of
alternative asset allocation strategies under different
scenarios.

Based on an analysis of historical performance by
asset class, over any 20-year period since the
mid-1940’s, investments in equities have outperformed other
investment classes but are subject to higher volatility. While
an asset allocation including bonds and other assets generally
has lower volatility and may provide protection in a declining
interest rate environment, it limits the pension plan’s
long-term up-side potential. Given the pension plan’s
investment horizon and the financial viability of the Company to
meet its funding objectives, the Committee has determined
that an asset allocation strategy investing in 100%
equities diversified among various domestic equity categories
and international equities is appropriate. The following table
provides a summary of asset allocations adopted by
the Company compared with a typical asset
allocation alternative:

(a)

The target asset allocation was modified
    slightly from the existing asset allocation at
    September 30, 2002, to enhance the portfolio’s
    diversification.

(b)

The LTROR assumed for the target asset
    allocation strategy of 9.9 percent is based on a range of
    estimates evaluated by the Company, including the compound
    expected return of 9.1 percent and the average expected
    return of 10.7 percent.

(c)

The Sharpe ratio is a direct measure of
    reward-to-risk. The Sharpe ratio for these asset allocation
    strategies is considered to be within acceptable
    parameters.

Regardless of the extent of the Company’s
analysis of alternative asset allocation strategies, economic
scenarios and possible outcomes, plan assumptions developed are
subject to imprecision and changes in economic factors. To
illustrate, for the period from 1994 to 2001, the actual return
on plan assets was 11.3 percent compared with an

U.S. Bancorp  27


assumed LTROR of approximately 11.1 percent
and an expected compound rate of return of 9.9 percent. As
a result of the modeling imprecision and uncertainty, the
Company considers a range of potential expected rates of return,
economic conditions for several scenarios, historical
performance relative to assumed rates of return and asset
allocation and LTROR information for a peer group in
establishing its assumptions. The Company plans to
use the 9.9 percent LTROR established in the
recent re-measurement to initially estimate its periodic pension
expense for 2003.

Because of the subjective nature of plan
assumptions, a sensitivity analysis to hypothetical changes in
the LTROR and the discount rate is provided below:

Due to the complexity of forecasting pension plan
activities, the accounting method utilized for pension plans,
management’s ability to respond to factors impacting the
plans and the hypothetical nature of this information, the
actual changes in periodic pension costs could be significantly
different than the information provided in the
sensitivity analysis.

Merger and Restructuring-Related Items

The Company incurred merger and
restructuring-related items in each of the last three years in
conjunction with its acquisitions. Merger and
restructuring-related items included in pre-tax earnings were
$324.1 million ($211.3 million after-tax) in 2002,
compared with $1,266.4 million ($844.3 million
after-tax) and $348.7 million ($231.3 million
after-tax) for 2001 and 2000, respectively. Merger and
restructuring-related items in 2002 included $271.1 million
of net expense associated with the Firstar/USBM merger and
$53.0 million associated with NOVA and other smaller
acquisitions. Merger and restructuring-related items in 2002
associated with the Firstar/USBM merger were primarily related
to systems conversions and integration, asset write-downs and
lease terminations recognized at the completion of conversions.
Offsetting a portion of these costs in 2002 was an asset gain
related to the sale of a non-strategic investment in a sub-prime
lending business and a mark-to-market recovery associated with
the liquidation of U.S. Bancorp Libra’s investment
portfolio. The Company exited this business in 2001 and the
liquidation efforts were substantially completed in the second
quarter of 2002.

At December 31, 2002, the integration of
Firstar and USBM was completed. Total merger and
restructuring-related items associated with the Firstar/ USBM
merger were approximately $1.4 billion and no additional
costs are expected going forward. In connection with the
acquisition of NOVA, the integration of merchant processing
platforms and business processes of U.S. Bank National
Association and NOVA will continue through late 2003. Management
estimates the Company will incur pre-tax merger and
restructuring-related charges of approximately
$36.9 million in 2003 to complete the NOVA acquisition. In
addition, the Company anticipates additional pre-tax merger and
restructuring related expenses in 2003 of $14.7 million
related to the Bay View acquisition, $8.6 million related to the
State Street Corporate Trust acquisition and $7.2 million
as a result of other smaller acquisitions.

Merger and restructuring-related items in 2001
included $382.2 million in the provision for credit losses,
a $62.2 million gain on the required sale of branches and
$946.4 million of noninterest expense. Total merger and
restructuring-related items in 2001 consisted of
$1,167.2 million related to the Firstar/USBM merger,
$50.7 million of restructuring expenses for Piper and
$48.5 million related to NOVA and other smaller
acquisitions. With respect to the Firstar/USBM merger, the
$1,167.2 million of merger and restructuring-related items
included $268.2 million for severance and employee-related
costs and $477.6 million of charges to exit business lines
and products, sell credit portfolios or otherwise realign
business practices in the new Company. The Company also incurred
$208.1 million of systems conversion and business
integration costs, $48.7 million for lease cancellation and
other building-related costs, $226.8 million for
transaction costs, funding a charitable foundation to reaffirm a
commitment to its markets and other costs, and a
$62.2 million gain related to the required sale of
branches. In response to significant changes in the securities
markets during 2001, including increased volatility, changes in
equity valuations and the increasingly competitive environment
for the industry, Piper restructured its operations. The
restructuring improved the operating efficiency of the business
by removing excess capacity

28 U.S. Bancorp


from its product distribution network and by
implementing more effective business processes. Restructuring
activities related to Piper were completed in 2001.

In 2000, merger and restructuring-related items
included in noninterest expense consisted of $227.0 million
related to the merger of Firstar and Mercantile Bancorporation,
$52.6 million related to the merger of Firstar and Star
Banc Corporation and $69.1 million primarily related to
other acquisitions by USBM. Included in merger and
restructuring-related items were $59.4 for severance and
employee-related costs, $193.5 million for systems
conversions, $47.3 million for lease cancellations and
other building-related costs and $48.5 million of other
business integration costs.

Refer to Notes 4 and 5 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on
these acquired businesses and merger and restructuring-related
items.

Income Tax Expense

The provision for income taxes was
$1,776.3 million (an effective rate of 34.8 percent)
in 2002, compared with $927.7 million (an effective rate of
35.2 percent) in 2001 and $1,512.2 million (an
effective rate of 34.5 percent) in 2000. The decrease in
the effective tax rate in 2002, compared with 2001, was
primarily driven by a change in unitary state tax apportionment
factors, a decrease in non-deductible merger and
restructuring-related charges and the change in accounting for
goodwill. The effective tax rate increase in 2001, compared with
2000, was primarily due to a decline in tax-exempt interest
related to sales of investment securities, the impact of unitary
state tax apportionment factors on the Company, non-deductible
merger and restructuring-related costs and the acquisition
of NOVA.

The Company’s net deferred tax liability was
$1,664.1 million at December 31, 2002, compared with
$573.2 million for the year ended 2001. The change in 2002
primarily relates to leasing activities and unrealized
appreciation in securities available-for-sale and financial
instruments. For further information on income taxes,
refer to Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS

Average earning assets were $149.1 billion
in 2002, compared with $145.2 billion in 2001. The increase in
average earning assets of $3.9 billion (2.7 percent) was
primarily driven by increases in the investment portfolio, core
retail loan growth, and the impact of acquisitions. This growth
was partially offset by declines in commercial and commercial
real estate loans reflecting lower borrowing

requirements of commercial customers and credit
related actions of the Company. The increase in average earning
assets was funded with an increase in net free funds, including
an increase in average noninterest-bearing deposits of
$3.6 billion, and an increase in average interest-bearing
liabilities of $.8 billion, consisting principally of
higher core savings balances and more favorably priced
longer-term wholesale funding.

For average balance information, refer to
Consolidated Daily Average Balance Sheet and Related Yields and
Rates on pages 108 and 109.

Loans

The
Company’s total loan portfolio was $116.3 billion at
December 31, 2002, compared with $114.4 billion at
December 31, 2001, an increase of $1.9 billion
(1.6 percent). The increase in total loans was driven by
strong retail loan and residential mortgage growth, partially
offset by a decline in commercial loans due in part to current
economic conditions. During 2002, there were reclassifications
between loan categories that occurred in connection with
conforming loan classifications at the time of system
conversions. Prior years were not restated, as it was
impractical to determine the extent of reclassification for all
periods presented. Average total loans decreased
$3.7 billion (3.1 percent) in 2002, compared with
2001. The decline in total average loans in 2002, compared with
2001, was driven by the decline in commercial and commercial
real estate loans in 2002 and the impact of transfers of high
credit quality commercial loans to the loan conduit in 2001. The
decline in commercial and commercial real estate loans was
partially offset by growth in retail loans and residential
mortgages. Average total loans on a core basis decreased by
$2.7 billion (2.2 percent) relative to the prior year.

Commercial

Commercial loans, including lease
financing, totaled $41.9 billion at December 31, 2002,
compared with $46.3 billion at December 31, 2001, a
decrease of $4.4 billion (9.5 percent). The decline
was driven by softness in loan demand, credit-related actions
including

Table 8

Commercial Loan Exposure by Industry Group and Geography

30 U.S. Bancorp


workout activities, and reclassifications to
other loan categories. Included in the change for commercial
loans was a reclassification of approximately $1.2 billion
from commercial loans predominately to the commercial real
estate ($.5 billion) and residential mortgages
($.7 billion) loan categories in 2002. Average commercial
loans in 2002 decreased by $6.3 billion
(12.5 percent). Approximately $721 million of the change in
average commercial loans year-over-year for 2002 was due to the
transfer of high credit quality commercial loans to the loan
conduit. Also impacting the decline in average commercial loans
was the transfer of $680 million in unsecured small business
product to loans held for sale in 2001. On a core basis, average
commercial loans decreased by $5.3 billion
(9.9 percent) relative to the prior year.

Table 8 provides a summary of commercial
loans by industry and geographic locations.

Commercial Real Estate

The Company’s portfolio of
commercial real estate loans, which includes commercial
mortgages and construction loans, was $26.9 billion at
December 31, 2002, compared with $25.4 billion at
December 31, 2001, an increase of $1.5 billion
(5.9 percent). Included in the change in commercial real
estate loans at year-end was a net reclassification of
approximately $.5 billion to the commercial real estate
loan category predominately from the commercial loan category.
Commercial mortgages outstanding increased by $1.6 billion
(8.3 percent), driven by loan reclassifications and growth
in small business administration lending, while real estate
construction and development loans remained essentially flat
compared with a year ago. Average commercial real estate loans
were essentially flat at $25.7 billion in 2002, compared
with $26.1 billion in 2001. Table 9 provides a summary of
commercial real estate exposures by property type and geographic
location.

The Company maintains the real estate
construction designation until the project is producing
sufficient cash flow to service traditional mortgage financing,
at which time, if retained, the loan is transferred to the
commercial mortgage portfolio. Approximately $1.4 billion
of construction loans were permanently financed and transferred
to the commercial mortgage loan category in 2002. At year-end
2002, $182 million of tax-exempt industrial development
loans were secured by real estate.

Table 9

Commercial Real Estate Exposure by Property Type and Geography

U.S. Bancorp  31


The Company’s commercial real estate
mortgages and construction loans had unfunded commitments of
$7.9 billion at December 31, 2002, compared with
$6.0 billion at December 31, 2001. The Company also
finances the operations of real estate developers and other
entities with operations related to real estate. These loans are
not secured directly by real estate and are subject to terms and
conditions similar to commercial loans. These loans were
included in the commercial loan category and totaled
$635 million at December 31, 2002.

Residential Mortgages

Residential mortgages held in the loan
portfolio were $9.7 billion at December 31, 2002,
compared with $7.8 billion at December 31, 2001, an
increase of $1.9 billion (24.5 percent). The increase
in residential mortgages was driven by an increase in
refinancing given the current rate environment and strong growth
in first lien home equity loans through the Company’s
Consumer Finance division. The increase also reflects a decision
to retain adjustable rate mortgages in the portfolio for asset
liability management purposes and a reclassification of
approximately $.7 billion to the residential mortgages
category predominately from the commercial loan category. This
growth was partially offset by approximately $.9 billion in
residential loan sales during 2002. Average residential
mortgages of $8.4 billion were essentially unchanged from a year
ago.

Retail

Total retail
loans outstanding, which include credit card, retail leasing,
home equity and second mortgages and other retail loans, were
$37.7 billion at December 31, 2002, compared with
$34.9 billion at December 31, 2001. The increase of
$2.8 billion (8.1 percent) was driven by an increase
in home equity lines during the recent declining rate
environment and an increase in the retail leasing portfolio.
This growth was partially offset by two credit card sales in
2002 that totaled approximately $483 million. Average
retail loans increased $3.1 billion (9.1 percent) to
$36.5 billion in 2002. Impacting the growth in average
retail loans in 2002, compared with 2001, were portfolio sales
of $1.3 billion in 2001 related to the high loan-to-value
home equity portfolio and indirect automobile loans. On a core
basis, average retail loans increased $1.8 billion
(5.3 percent) from a year ago with growth in most retail
loan categories. Of the total retail loans outstanding,
approximately 89.8 percent are to customers located in the
Company’s banking region.

Loans Held for Sale

At December 31, 2002, loans held
for sale, consisting primarily of residential mortgages to be
sold in the secondary markets, were $4.2 billion, compared
with $2.8 billion at December 31, 2001. The $1.3
billion (47.5 percent) increase primarily reflected strong
mortgage loan origination volume in connection with refinancing
activity in 2002 given the declining interest rates for
residential mortgage loans. Residential mortgage production was
$23.2 billion in 2002, compared with $15.6 billion in
2001. This is substantially higher than mortgage production of
$6.7 billion in 2000.

Investment Securities

The Company uses its investment
securities portfolio for several purposes. It serves as a
vehicle to manage interest rate and prepayment risk, generates
interest and dividend income from the investment of excess funds
depending on loan demand, provides liquidity and is used as
collateral for public deposits and wholesale funding sources.

At December 31, 2002, investment securities,
both available-for-sale and held-to-maturity, totaled
$28.5 billion, compared with $26.6 billion at
December 31, 2001. The $1.9 billion (7.1 percent)
increase reflected the reinvestment of proceeds from loan sales,
declines in commercial and commercial real estate loan balances
and deposits assumed from the recent Bay View transaction.
During 2002, the Company sold $13.7 billion of fixed-rate
securities, in part to realign the portfolio to hedge against
interest rate changes and to generate gains given the impact of
prepayments in the mortgage servicing rights portfolio. A
portion of the fixed-rate securities sold was replaced with
floating-rate securities in conjunction with the Company’s
interest rate risk management strategies. At December 31,
2002, approximately 18.6 percent of the investment
securities portfolio represented adjustable rate financial
instruments, compared with 15.6 percent as of
December 31, 2001.

Table 10

Selected Loan Maturity Distribution

The weighted-average yield of the
available-for-sale portfolio was 4.97 percent at
December 31, 2002, compared with 5.58 percent at
December 31, 2001. The average maturity of the
available-for-sale portfolio dropped to 2.8 years at
December 31, 2002, down from 5.4 years at
December 31, 2001. The relative mix of the type of
investment securities maintained in the portfolio is provided in
Table 11. The change in investment portfolio mix reflected
sales of tax-exempt municipal securities that were replaced
primarily by collateralized mortgage obligations. At
December 31, 2002, the available-for-sale portfolio
included a $714 million net unrealized gain, compared with
a net unrealized gain of $15 million at December 31,
2001.

Deposits

Total
deposits were $115.5 billion at December 31, 2002,
compared with $105.2 billion at December 31, 2001, an
increase of $10.3 billion (9.8 percent). The increase
in total deposits was the result of the continued desire by
customers to maintain liquidity and specific deposit gathering
initiatives and funding decisions in 2002.

Noninterest-bearing deposits were
$35.1 billion at December 31, 2002, compared with
$31.2 billion at December 31, 2001, an increase of
$3.9 billion (12.5 percent). Average
noninterest-bearing deposits were $28.7 billion in
2002, an increase of $3.6 billion (14.4 percent),
compared with 2001. The increase in noninterest-bearing deposits
was primarily attributable to business and government banking
customers that maintained higher compensating balances given the
current interest rate environment.

Interest-bearing savings deposits totaled
$50.2 billion at December 31, 2002, compared with
$44.7 billion at December 31, 2001, an increase of
$5.5 billion (12.3 percent). Average interest-bearing
savings deposits were $45.8 billion in 2002, an increase of
$2.3 billion (5.4 percent), compared with 2001. This
growth was related to specific deposit gathering initiatives of
the Company in 2002, the continued downturn in equity capital
markets and the current interest rate environment prompting many
customers to increase their liquidity in accessible deposits.

Interest-bearing time deposits were
$30.2 billion at December 31, 2002, compared with
$29.3 billion at December 31, 2001, an increase of
$.9 billion (3.1 percent). The increase in
interest-bearing time deposits was driven by an increase of
$3.7 billion (42.7 percent) in time deposits greater
than $100,000 partially offset by a decline in the higher cost
time certificates of deposits less than $100,000 of
$2.8 billion (13.3 percent). Time certificates of
deposits are largely viewed as purchased funds and are managed
to levels deemed appropriate given alternative funding sources.
The decline in time certificates of deposits less than $100,000
reflected a shift in product mix toward savings products and
funding decisions toward more favorably priced wholesale funding
sources given the current interest rate environment. Average
time certificates of deposit less than $100,000 declined
$4.0 billion (17.3 percent). The decline in average time
certificates of deposit less than $100,000 reflected the net
impact of bank acquisitions and branch divestitures and
management’s pricing decisions to change the mix of funding
toward lower rate wholesale funding sources.

Table 12 provides a summary of total
deposits by type of deposit.

Borrowings

The
Company utilizes both short-term and long-term borrowings to
fund growth of earning assets in excess of deposit growth.
Short-term borrowings, which include federal funds purchased,
securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other
short-term borrowings, were $7.8 billion at
December 31, 2002, down $6.9 billion
(46.8 percent) from $14.7 billion at year-end 2001.
Short-term funding is managed to levels deemed appropriate given

alternative funding sources. The decrease in
short-term borrowings reflected the impact of funding earning
assets primarily through growth in deposits and, to a lesser
extent, a shift toward longer-term funding sources.

Long-term debt was $28.6 billion at
December 31, 2002, up from $25.7 billion at
December 31, 2001. The $2.9 billion
(11.2 percent) increase in long-term debt included the
issuance of $1.0 billion of fixed-rate subordinated notes
in February 2002, the issuance of $6.5 billion of
medium-term notes and bank notes and the issuance of
$3.1 billion of long-term Federal Home Loan Bank advances
in 2002. The issuance of long-term debt was partially offset by
repayments and maturities of $8.4 billion in 2002,
including the repurchase on August 6, 2002, of
approximately $1.1 billion accreted value of the
Company’s convertible senior notes (the “CZARS”)
due to mature in 2021. Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information
regarding long-term debt and the “Liquidity Risk
Management” section for discussion of liquidity management
of the Company.

CORPORATE RISK PROFILE

Overview

Managing
risks is an essential part of successfully operating a financial
services company. The most prominent risk exposures are credit,
residual, operational, interest rate, market and liquidity.
Credit risk is the risk of not collecting the interest and/or
the principal balance of a loan or investment when it is due.
Residual risk is the potential reduction in the end-of-term
value of leased assets or the residual cash flows related to
asset securitization and other off-balance sheet structures.
Operational risk includes risks related to fraud, legal and
compliance risk, processing errors, technology and breaches of
internal controls. Interest rate risk is the potential reduction
of net interest income as a result of changes in interest rates.
Rate movements can affect the repricing of assets and
liabilities differently, as well as their market value. Market
risk arises from fluctuations in interest rates, foreign
exchange rates, and equity prices that may result in changes in
the values of financial instruments, such as trading and
available-for-sale securities that are accounted for on a
mark-to-market basis. Liquidity risk is the possible inability
to fund obligations to depositors, investors or borrowers. In
addition, corporate strategic decisions, as well as the risks
described above, could give rise to reputation risk. Reputation
risk is the risk that negative publicity or press, whether true
or not, could result in costly litigation or cause a decline in
the Company’s stock value, customer base or revenue.

Credit Risk Management

The Company’s strategy for credit
risk management includes well defined, centralized credit
policies, uniform underwriting criteria, and ongoing risk
monitoring and review processes for all commercial and consumer
credit exposures. The strategy also emphasizes diversification
on a geographic, industry and customer level, regular credit
examinations and management reviews of loans experiencing
deterioration of credit quality. The Company strives to identify
potential problem loans early, take any necessary charge-offs
promptly and maintain adequate reserve levels for probable loan
losses. Commercial banking operations rely on a strong credit
culture that combines prudent credit policies and individual
lender accountability. The Company utilizes a credit risk rating
system to measure the credit quality of individual commercial
loan transactions and regularly forecasts potential changes in
risk ratings and nonperforming status. The risk rating system is
intended to identify and measure the credit quality of lending
relationships. In the Company’s retail banking operations,
standard credit scoring systems are used to assess consumer
credit risks and to price consumer products accordingly. The
Company also engages in non-lending activities that may give
rise to credit risk, including interest rate swap contracts for
balance sheet hedging purposes, foreign exchange transactions
and interest rate swap contracts for customers, settlement risk
and the processing of credit card transactions for merchants.
These activities are also subject to credit review, analysis and
approval processes.

In evaluating its credit risk, the Company
considers changes, if any, in underwriting activities, the loan
portfolio composition (including product mix and geographic,
industry or customer-specific concentrations), trends in loan
performance, the level of allowance coverage and macroeconomic
factors. The domestic economy has experienced slower growth
since late 2000. During 2001, corporate earnings weakened and
credit quality indicators among certain industry sectors
deteriorated. Large corporate and middle market commercial
businesses announced or continued to implement restructuring
activities in an effort to improve operating margins. The
stagnant economic growth was evidenced by the Federal Reserve
Board’s (“FRB”) actions to stimulate economic
growth through a series of interest rate reductions over the
past 24 to 30 months. In response to declining economic
conditions, company-specific portfolio trends, and the
Firstar/USBM merger, the Company undertook an extensive review
of its commercial and consumer loan portfolios in early 2001. As
a result of this review, the Company initiated several actions
during the first six months of 2001 including aligning the risk
management practices and charge-off policies of the companies
and restructuring and disposing of certain portfolios that did
not align with the credit risk profile of the combined company.
Credit portfolio restructuring activities included a specific
segment of the Company’s health care portfolio, selling
certain USBM

U.S. Bancorp  35


consumer loan portfolios, renegotiating a credit
card co-branding relationship and discontinuing an unsecured
small business product that did not align with the product
offerings of the combined company. The Company also implemented
accelerated loan workout strategies for certain commercial
credits. By the end of the second quarter of 2001, economic
stimulus by the FRB as well as management’s actions
appeared to have reduced the rate of credit quality
deterioration. However, world events during the third quarter of
2001 had a profound impact on consumer confidence and related
spending, governmental priorities and business activities. As a
result of these events, the Company expected the economic
slowdown to accelerate or be more prolonged than it had
originally estimated. Accordingly, the Company conducted a
review of its credit portfolios and recognized the need to
address the impact that these events would have. In response to
this evaluation, the Company increased the provision for credit
losses by approximately $1,025 million in the third quarter
of 2001 beyond expected levels.

By the end of 2002, economic conditions had
stabilized somewhat although the banking sector continued to
experience elevated levels of nonperforming assets and net
charge-offs, especially with respect to certain industry
segments. Unemployment rates had increased slightly from a year
ago and consumer spending and confidence levels had declined
since 2001.

Credit Diversification

The Company manages its credit
risk, in part, through diversification of its loan portfolio. As
part of its normal business activities, it offers a broad array
of traditional commercial lending products and specialized
products such as asset-based lending, commercial lease
financing, agricultural credit, warehouse mortgage lending,
commercial real estate, health care and correspondent banking.
The Company also offers an array of retail lending products
including credit cards, retail leases, home equity, revolving
credit, lending to students and other consumer loans. These
retail credit products are primarily offered through the branch
office network, specialized trust, home mortgage and loan
production offices, indirect distribution channels, such as
automobile dealers and a consumer finance company. The Company
monitors and manages the portfolio diversification by industry,
customer and geography. Table 7 provides information with
respect to the overall product diversification and changes in
mix in 2002.

The commercial portfolio reflects the
Company’s focus on serving small business customers, middle
market and larger corporate businesses throughout its 24-state
banking region and national customers and within certain niche
industry groups. Table 8 provides a summary of the
significant industry groups and geographic locations of
commercial loans outstanding at December 31, 2002 and 2001.
The commercial loan portfolio is diversified among various
industries with somewhat higher concentrations in consumer
products and services, capital goods (including manufacturing
and commercial construction-related businesses), and consumer
staple industries. Additionally, the commercial portfolio is
diversified across the Company’s geographical markets with
86.2 percent of total commercial loans within the 24 state
banking region. Credit relationships outside of the
Company’s banking region are typically niche businesses
including the mortgage banking and the leasing businesses. Loans
to mortgage banking customers are primarily warehouse lines
which are collateralized with the underlying mortgages. The
Company regularly monitors its mortgage collateral position to
manage its risk exposure.

Certain industry segments within the commercial
loan portfolio, including communications, transportation and
manufacturing sectors, as well as highly leveraged enterprise
value financings, have experienced economic stress in 2002.
Since 2001, the communications sector has been adversely
impacted by excess capacity and represented only
1.2 percent of the commercial loan portfolio at
December 31, 2002. At December 31, 2002, the
transportation sector represented 5.3 percent of the total
commercial loan portfolio. It has been impacted by reduced
airline travel, slower economic activity and higher fuel costs
that adversely impacted the trucking businesses. At year-end
2002, the Company’s transportation portfolio consisted
of airline and airfreight businesses (28.1 percent of
the sector), trucking businesses (52.9 percent of the
sector) and the remainder in the railroad and shipping
businesses (19.0 percent of the sector). Capital goods
represented 13.1 percent of the total commercial portfolio
at December 31, 2002. Included in this sector
were approximately 34.0 percent of loans related to
building products while engineering and construction
equipment and machinery businesses were 31.6 percent and
21.6 percent, respectively. Manufacturing production levels
and inventory reductions continues to cause financial stress in
these portfolios.

Within its commercial lending business, the
Company also provides financing to enable customers to grow
their businesses through acquisitions of existing businesses,
buyouts or other recapitalizations. During a business cycle with
slower economic growth, businesses with leveraged capital
structures may experience insufficient cash flows to service
their debt. The Company manages leveraged enterprise-value
financings by maintaining well-defined underwriting standards,
portfolio diversification and actively managing the customer
relationship. Regardless of these actions, leveraged
enterprise-value financings often exhibit stress during a
recession or period of slow economic growth. Given this risk
profile, the Company began to significantly de-emphasize and
reduce the size of this

portfolio during the past year. The Company
actively monitors the credit quality of these customers and
develops action plans accordingly. Such leveraged
enterprise-value financings approximated $2.9 billion in
loans outstanding at December 31, 2002, compared with
approximately $3.9 billion outstanding at December 31,
2001. The decline was primarily due to the Company’s
decision to reduce its exposure to these types of lending
arrangements through repayments, refinancing activities and loan
sales. The sector has also been reduced by charge-offs taken
during the year. The Company’s portfolio of leveraged
financings is included in Table 8 and is diversified among
industry groups similar to the total commercial loan portfolio.

The commercial real estate portfolio reflects the
Company’s focus on serving business owners within its
footprint as well as regional investment-based real estate.
Table 9 provides a summary of the significant property
types and geographic locations of commercial real estate loans
outstanding at December 31, 2002 and 2001. At
December 31, 2002, approximately 24.2 percent of the
commercial real estate loan portfolio represented business
owner-occupied properties that tend to exhibit credit risk
characteristics similar to the middle-market commercial loan
portfolio. Generally, the investment-based real estate mortgages
are diversified among various property types with somewhat
higher concentrations in multi-family, office and retail
properties. Additionally, the commercial real estate portfolio
is diversified across the Company’s geographical markets
with 94.0 percent of total commercial real estate loans
outstanding at December 31, 2002, within the
24-state banking region. While vacancies in multi-family
and commercial properties had risen during the past
18 months, declining interest rates have allowed real
estate owners to reduce interest costs and generally maintain
adequate cash flows.

Analysis of Loan Net Charge-Offs

Total loan net charge-offs
decreased $173.5 million to $1,373.0 million in 2002,
compared with $1,546.5 million in 2001 and
$825.4 million in 2000. The ratio of total loan net
charge-offs to average loans was 1.20 percent in 2002,
compared with 1.31 percent in 2001 and .70 percent in
2000. Included in loan net charge-offs for 2001 were
$313.2 million of commercial loan charge-offs related to
specific events or credit initiatives taken by management,
$160 million of loan charge-offs relating to the
Company’s accelerated loan workout strategy and
$90 million of loan write-offs to conform risk management
practices, align loan charge-off policies and expedite the
transition out of a specific segment of the health care
portfolio not meeting the lower risk appetite of the Company.
The level of loan net charge-offs during 2002 reflected the
impact of soft economic conditions and continued weakness in the
communications, transportation and manufacturing sectors, as
well as the impact of the weak economy on highly leveraged
enterprise value financings. Assuming no further deterioration
in the economy, net charge-offs are expected to remain at recent
levels until the economy improves.

Commercial and commercial real estate loan net
charge-offs for 2002 were $679.9 million (.98 percent
of average loans outstanding), compared with $884.6 million
(1.16 percent of average loans outstanding) in 2001 and

Table 13

Net Charge-offs as a Percent of Average Loans Outstanding

(a)

In accordance with guidance provided in the
    Interagency Guidance on Certain Loans Held for Sale, loans held
    with the intent to sell are transferred to the Loans Held for
    Sale category based on the lower of cost or fair value. At the
    time of transfer, the portion of the mark-to-market losses
    representing probable credit losses determined in accordance
    with policies and methods utilized to determine the allowance
    for credit losses is included in net charge-offs. The remaining
    portion of the losses is reported separately as a reduction of
    the allowance for credit losses under “Losses from loan
    sales/transfers.” Had the entire amount of the loss been
    reported as charge-offs, total net charge-offs would have been
    $1,875.8 million (1.59 percent of average loans) for
    the year ended December 31, 2001.

$289.2 million (.38 percent of average
loans outstanding) in 2000. Commercial and commercial real
estate loan net charge-offs in 2002 continued to experience
higher levels of net charge-offs related to the leasing
portfolio including airline and other transportation related
losses. Additionally, credit losses related to highly leveraged
enterprise value financings continued at elevated levels.
Commercial and commercial real estate loan net charge-offs in
2001 included approximately $313.2 million related to
several factors including: a large cattle fraud, collateral
deterioration specific to transportation equipment caused by the
impact of higher fuel prices and the weak economy, deterioration
in the manufacturing, communications and technology sectors and
specific management decisions to accelerate its workout strategy
for certain borrowers. Also included in 2001 commercial and
commercial real estate loan net charge-offs were
$95 million in merger and restructuring-related charge-offs
and charge-offs of $160 million associated with an
accelerated loan workout strategy. Excluding loan net
charge-offs associated with merger and restructuring-related
items, commercial and commercial real estate loan net
charge-offs were .98 percent of average loans outstanding
in 2002, 1.04 percent in 2001 and .38 percent in 2000.
The decrease in commercial and commercial real estate loan net
charge-offs in 2002 when compared with 2001, and the increase
for 2001 when compared with 2000 was driven by the specific
credit actions noted above taken in the third quarter of 2001.

Retail loan net charge-offs in 2002 were
$674.0 million (1.85 percent of average loans
outstanding), compared with $649.3 million
(1.94 percent of average loans outstanding) in 2001 and
$523.8 million (1.69 percent of average loans
outstanding) in 2000. The improvement in the retail loan net
charge-offs in 2002, compared with 2001, principally reflected
changes in the mix of the retail loan portfolio to auto loans
and leases and home equity products, and improvement in ongoing
collection efforts as a result of the successful completion
of the integration efforts. The increase in retail loan net
charge-offs for 2001, compared with 2000, was primarily due to
increased bankruptcies and consumer delinquencies in 2001,
reflecting the downturn in economic conditions.

Analysis of Nonperforming Assets

Nonperforming assets include
nonaccrual loans, restructured loans not performing in
accordance with modified terms, other real estate and other
nonperforming assets owned by the Company. Interest payments are
typically applied against the principal balance and not recorded
as income. At December 31, 2002, total nonperforming assets
were $1,373.5 million, compared with $1,120.0 million
at year-end 2001 and $867.0 million at year-end 2000. The
ratio of total nonperforming assets to total loans and other
real estate increased to 1.18 percent at December 31,
2002, compared with .98 percent and .71 percent for
the years ending 2001 and 2000, respectively.

The $253.5 million increase in total
nonperforming assets in 2002 reflected an increase of
$284.6 million in nonperforming commercial and commercial
real estate loans partially offset by a decrease of
$27.1 million in nonperforming residential mortgages and a
$21.5 million decrease in nonperforming retail loans. The
increase in nonperforming commercial and commercial real estate
assets was principally due to the Company’s exposure to
certain communications, cable, manufacturing and highly
leveraged enterprise value financings. Nonperforming loans in
the capital goods sector also increased in 2002. Although the
level of nonperforming assets appeared to have stabilized in
late 2002, the Company continues to remain cautious regarding
the economy and its impact on the credit quality of the
portfolio. Nonperforming assets are expected to remain at
elevated levels until the economy rebounds.

The $253.0 million increase in nonperforming
assets in 2001 reflected an increase of $190.0 million of
nonperforming commercial and commercial real estate loans, a
$22.2 million increase in nonperforming residential
mortgages and a $23.8 million increase in nonperforming
retail loans. The increase in nonperforming commercial loans was
primarily due to merger and restructuring-related and risk
management actions taken during 2001; loans written down to
secondary market valuations and placed on nonperforming status;
and continued stress in certain sectors of the economy. The
increase was partially offset by the disposition of
nonperforming loans identified as part of the Company’s
accelerated workout programs and commercial charge-offs taken
during 2001. Certain industry sectors, including agriculture,
had stabilized or improved from 2000. The increase in
nonperforming residential mortgages and retail loans generally
reflected changes in portfolio delinquencies and the national
trends in unemployment and personal bankruptcies during 2001.

The Company had $50.0 million and
$18.2 million of restructured loans as of
December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Commitments to
lend additional funds under restructured loans were
$1.7 million and $3.7 million as
of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
Restructured loans performing under the restructured terms
beyond a specific timeframe are reported as accruing. Of the
Company’s total restructured loans at December 31,
2002, $1.4 million were reported as accruing.

Accruing loans 90 days or more past due
totaled $426.4 million at December 31, 2002, compared
with $462.9 million at December 31, 2001, and
$385.2 million at December 31, 2000. These loans were
not included in nonperforming assets and continue to accrue
interest because they are adequately secured by collateral
and/or are in the process of collection and are reasonably
expected to result in repayment or restoration to current
status. The ratio of delinquent loans to total loans declined
slightly to .37 percent at December 31, 2002, compared
with .40 percent at December 31, 2001.

Residential mortgages 30 to 89 days or more
past due were 2.85 percent of the total residential
mortgage portfolio at December 31, 2002, compared with
3.40 percent at December 31, 2001, and
2.93 percent at December 31, 2000. Residential
mortgages 90 days or more past due totaled
1.44 percent at December 31, 2002, compared with
1.79 percent at December 31, 2001, and
1.23 percent at December 31, 2000. The improvement in
2002 reflects, in part, the mix of first-lien home equity loans
originated through the Company’s consumer finance division.
Retail loans 30 to 89 days or more past due were
2.46 percent of the total retail portfolio at
December 31, 2002, compared with 3.30 percent at
December 31, 2001, and 2.96 percent at
December 31, 2000. The percentage of retail loans
90 days or more past due was .79 percent of total
retail loans at December 31, 2002, compared with
1.03 percent at December 31, 2001, and
..83 percent at December 31, 2000. The improvement in
retail loan delinquencies from December 31, 2001, to
December 31, 2002, primarily reflected the risk management
actions, stabilization and improvement in collection efforts
resulting from the successful completion of the integration
efforts. The increase in retail loan delinquencies from
December 31, 2000, to December 31, 2001, was primarily
related to the credit card, home equity and revolving credit
line portfolios and reflected the economic slowdown and
unemployment trends during 2001.

Analysis and Determination of the Allowance
for Credit Losses

The allowance
for credit losses provides coverage for probable and estimable
losses inherent in the Company’s loan and lease portfolio.
Management evaluates the allowance each quarter to determine
that it is adequate to cover inherent losses. The evaluation of
each element and the overall allowance is based on a continuing
assessment of problem loans and related off-balance sheet items,
recent loss experience and other factors, including regulatory
guidance and economic conditions.

At December 31, 2002, the allowance for
credit losses was $2.4 billion (2.08 percent of
loans). This compares with an allowance of $2.5 billion
(2.15 percent of loans) at December 31, 2001, and
$1.8 billion (1.46 percent of loans) at
December 31, 2000. The ratio of the allowance for credit
losses to nonperforming loans was 196 percent at year-end
2002, compared with 245 percent at year-end 2001 and
233 percent at year-end 2000. The ratio of the allowance
for credit losses to loan net charge-offs was 176 percent
at year-end 2002, compared with 159 percent at year-end
2001 and 216 percent at year-end 2000.

Management determined that the allowance for
credit losses was adequate at December 31, 2002.

Several factors were taken into consideration in
evaluating the 2002 allowance for credit losses, including
changes in the risk profile of the portfolios, extent of loan
net charge-offs during the period, the increasing trend in
nonperforming assets, the slight decline in accruing loans
90 days past due and the improvement in retail
delinquencies. Management also considered changes in economic
trends including corporate earnings, unemployment rates,
bankruptcies and economic growth since December 31, 2001.
The increase in the allowance for credit losses in 2001
reflected the impact of continued weakening of the economy and
related deterioration in certain sectors of the Company’s
credit portfolio. During 2001, the allowance for credit losses
was impacted by several factors, including merger and
restructuring-related credit actions and management’s
extensive review of the commercial loan portfolio in light of
economic conditions. The level of the allowance was also
impacted by risk rating changes by regulators of shared national
credits agented by other banks, Company-specific portfolio
trends discussed previously, and the transfer of the unsecured
small business product portfolio to loans held for sale. It also
reflected management’s recognition that the economic
slowdown had accelerated and may be more prolonged as a result
of world events that occurred in the third quarter of 2001.

Management determines the amount of allowance
that is required for specific loan categories based on relative
risk characteristics of the loan portfolio. Table 16 shows the
amount of the allowance for credit losses by loan category. The
allowance recorded for commercial loans is based on a regular
review of individual credit relationships. The Company’s
risk rating process is an integral component of the methodology
utilized in determining the allowance for credit losses. An
analysis of the migration of commercial and commercial real
estate loans and actual loss experience throughout the business
cycle is also conducted quarterly to assess reserves established
for credits with similar risk characteristics. An allowance is
established for pools of commercial and commercial real estate
loans based on the risk ratings assigned. The amount is
supported by the results of the migration analysis that
considers historical loss experience by risk rating, as well as
current and historical economic conditions and industry risk
factors. The Company separately analyzes the carrying value of
impaired loans to determine whether the carrying value is less
than or equal to the appraised collateral value or the present
value of expected cash flows. Based on this analysis, an
allowance for credit losses may be specifically established for
impaired loans. The allowance established for commercial and
commercial real estate loan portfolios, including impaired
commercial and commercial real estate loans, was
$1,090.4 million at December 31, 2002, compared with
$1,428.6 million and $496.9 million at

Table 15

Summary of Allowance for Credit Losses

(a)

In accordance with guidance provided in the
    Interagency Guidance on Certain Loans Held for Sale, loans held
    with the intent to sell are transferred to the Loans Held for
    Sale category based on the lower of cost or fair value. At the
    time of the transfer, the portion of the mark-to-market losses
    representing probable credit losses determined in accordance
    with policies and methods utilized to determine the allowance
    for credit losses is included in net charge-offs. The remaining
    portion of the losses is reported separately as a reduction of
    the allowance for credit losses under “Losses from loan
    sales/transfers.” Had the entire amount of the loss been
    reported as charge-offs, total net charge-offs would have been
    $1,875.8 million for the year ended 2001. Additionally, the
    allowance as a percent of net charge-offs would have been
    131 percent for the year ended December 31,
    2001.

December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
The decline in the allowance for commercial and commercial real
estate loans reflected a reduction of $93.7 million related
to a change in the volume of commercial and commercial real
estate portfolios and mix of the risk ratings within the
portfolio. The remaining decline of $244.3 million
reflected improvements in loss severity rates determined from
historical migration analysis. Although the Company’s level
of commercial and commercial real estate loans in higher risk
loan categories declined approximately 11 percent, the level of
nonperforming loans continued at elevated levels and increased
by 22.6 percent in 2002. The change from year-end 2000 to
year-end 2001 reflected higher levels of nonperforming loans,
increased loss severity reflected in the historical migration,
increased sector risk in certain industries and deterioration in
credit risk ratings compared with 2000.

The allowance recorded for the residential
mortgages and retail loan portfolios is based on an analysis of
product mix, credit scoring and risk composition of the
portfolio, loss and bankruptcy experiences, economic conditions
and historical and expected delinquency and charge-off
statistics for each homogenous category or group of loans. Based
on this information and analysis, an allowance was established
approximating a rolling twelve-month estimate of net
charge-offs. The allowance established for residential mortgages
was $34.2 million at December 31, 2002, compared with
$21.9 million and $11.6 million at December 31,
2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase in allowance for the
residential mortgage portfolio primarily reflected the growth of
the portfolio, a higher percentage of first-lien home equity
loans originated by the Company’s Consumer Finance division
that tend to have slightly higher loss ratios and the impact of
the continued downturn in economic conditions. The allowance
established for retail loans was $699.7 million at
December 31, 2002, compared with $705.3 million and
$650.8 million at December 31, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. The slight decrease in the allowance for the
retail portfolio in 2002 primarily reflected an improvement in
the credit quality and delinquency trends of the credit card
portfolio, offset by the impact of higher unemployment and
continued softness in economic conditions. The increase in the
allowance established for retail loans in 2001 was due to an
increase in net loss ratios caused by deteriorating economic
conditions.

Regardless of the extent of the Company’s
analysis of customer performance, portfolio trends or risk
management processes, certain inherent but undetected losses are
probable within the loan portfolios. This is due to several
factors, including inherent delays in obtaining information
regarding a customer’s financial condition or changes in
their unique business conditions, the judgmental nature of
individual loan evaluations, collateral assessments and the

Table 16

Elements of the Allowance for Credit Losses (a)

(a)

During 2001, the Company changed its
    methodology for determining the specific allowance for elements
    of the loan portfolio. Table 16 has been restated for 2000.
    Due to the Company’s inability to gather historical loss
    data on a combined basis for 1998 and 1999, the methodologies
    and amounts assigned to each element of the loan portfolio for
    these years have not been conformed. Utilizing the prior
    methods, the total assigned to the allocated allowance for 2000
    was $1,397.3 million and the allowance available for other
    factors portion was $389.6 million. Refer to
    paragraph four in the section captioned “Analysis and
    Determination of Allowance for Credit Losses.”

interpretation of economic trends. Volatility of
economic or customer-specific conditions affecting the
identification and estimation of losses from larger
non-homogeneous credits and the sensitivity of assumptions
utilized to establish allowances for homogeneous groups of
loans, loan portfolio concentrations, and other subjective
considerations are among other factors. Because of the
imprecision surrounding these factors, the Company estimates a
range of inherent losses based on statistical analyses and
management judgment, and maintains an “allowance for other
factors” that is not allocated to a specific loan category.
The amount of the allowance available for other factors was
$597.7 million at December 31, 2002, compared with
$301.5 million at December 31, 2001, and
$627.6 million at December 31, 2000.

Given the many subjective factors affecting the
credit portfolio, changes in the allowance for other factors may
not directly coincide with changes in the risk ratings of the
credit portfolio reflected in the risk rating process. This is,
in part, due to a lagging effect between changes in the business
cycle, the exposure and mix of loans within risk rating
categories, levels of nonperforming loans, and the timing of
charge-offs and recoveries. In late 2000, management identified
a slowdown in the business cycle, deteriorating portfolio trends
and other adverse factors relative to credit quality. At the
beginning of a downward business cycle, the accuracy of risk
ratings, migration loss ratios and available information of
customers often does not fully reflect the impact of various
leading economic indicators. In 2001, management conducted
extensive reviews of its portfolios and enhanced its commercial
migration methods to better differentiate and weight loss
severity ratios by risk rating category to reflect the adverse
impact of loss experienced in 2001. The $326.1 million
decrease in the allowance for other factors in 2001 reflected
the impact of that change in loss severity ratios, which led the
Company to increase the allowance established for commercial
loans. In 2002, the Company reduced the level of higher risk
commercial credits and net charge-off ratios improved by 20
basis points from a year ago. As a result, loss severity rates
determined through historical migration analysis had improved
somewhat relative to 2001. This led the Company to reduce the
level of the allowance specifically allocated to commercial
loans; however, nonperforming assets continued to remain at
elevated levels, economic growth continued to be soft and the
ability to further reduce higher risk credits had diminished as
refinancing opportunities had tightened. As such, volatility of
loss rates remained higher relative to prior periods and
management increased the level of the allowance for other
factors. At December 31, 2002, quantifiable factors
supporting the level of the allowance for other factors included
$15 million related to imprecision in risk ratings, $290
million for volatility of commercial loss rates,
$100 million for volatility of retail loss forecasts and
$30 million for uncollectible interest and fees on credit
card receivables. The remaining allowance for other factors was
primarily related to uncertainty in the economic outlook,
concentration risk, and other qualitative factors.

Although the Company determines the amount of
each element of the allowance separately and this process is an
important credit management tool, the entire allowance for
credit losses is available for the entire loan portfolio. The
actual amount of losses incurred can vary significantly from the
recorded amounts. The Company’s methodology included
several factors intended to minimize the differences in recorded
and actual losses. These factors allowed the Company to adjust
its estimate of losses based on the most recent information
available. Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for accounting policies related to the
allowance for credit losses.

Residual Risk Management

The Company manages its risk to
changes in the value of lease residual assets through
disciplined residual setting and valuation at the inception of a
lease, diversification of its leased assets, regular asset
valuation reviews and monitoring of residual value gains or
losses upon the disposition of assets. Commercial lease
originations are subject to the same well-defined underwriting
standards referred to in the “Credit Risk Management”
section which includes an evaluation of the residual risk.
Retail lease residual risk is mitigated further by originating
longer term vehicle leases and effective end-of-term marketing
of off-lease vehicles. Also, to reduce the financial risk of
potential changes in vehicle residual values, the Company
maintains residual value insurance. The catastrophic insurance
maintained by the Company provides for the potential recovery of
losses on individual vehicle sales in an amount equal to the
difference between: a) 105 percent or 110 percent of the
average wholesale auction price for the vehicle at the time of
sale; and, b) the vehicle residual value specified by the
Automotive Lease Guide (an authoritative industry source) at the
inception of the lease. The potential recovery is calculated for
each individual vehicle sold in a particular policy year and is
reduced by any gains realized on vehicles sold during the same
period. The Company will receive claim proceeds if, in the
aggregate, there is a net loss for such period. To reduce the
risk associated with collecting insurance claims, the

U.S. Bancorp  43


Company monitors the financial viability of the
insurance carrier based on insurance industry ratings and
available financial information.

Included in the retail leasing portfolio was
approximately $3.2 billion of retail leasing residuals at
December 31, 2002, compared with $2.8 billion at
December 31, 2001. The Company monitors concentrations of
leases by manufacturer and vehicle “make and model.”
At year-end 2002, no vehicle-type concentration exceeded five
percent of the aggregate portfolio. Because retail residual
valuations tend to be less volatile for longer-term leases,
relative to the estimated residual at inception of the lease,
the Company actively manages lease origination production to
achieve a longer-term portfolio. At December 31, 2002, the
weighted-average term of the portfolio was 52 months. Since
1998, the used vehicle market has experienced a decline in used
car prices. Several factors have contributed to this
deflationary cycle. Aggressive leasing programs by automobile
manufacturers and competitors within the banking industry
included a marketing focus on monthly lease payments, enhanced
residuals at lease inception, shorter-term leases and low
mileage leases. These practices have created a cyclical
oversupply of certain off-lease vehicles causing significant
declines in used vehicle prices. Automobile manufacturers and
others have retreated somewhat from these marketing programs or
exited the leasing business. However, zero percent financing
offered with rebates continued to exert pressure on used car
pricing. Another factor impacting the used vehicle market has
been the deflation in new vehicle prices. This trend has been
driven by surplus automobile manufacturing capacity and related
production and highly competitive sales programs. Economic
factors are expected to moderate new car production. Production
levels have continued to decline from record levels in 2000.
Also, many Internet marketers failed or transformed into
distribution channels of dealers rather than direct competitors.
These trends are expected to abate the deflationary pricing
pressures of the past few years. Another factor that has slowed
the decline in residual values is the growth of
“certified” used car programs. Certified cars are low
mileage, newer model vehicles that have been inspected,
reconditioned, and usually have a warranty program. The
Company’s exposure to declining valuation should benefit
from certified car programs that receive premium pricing from
dealers at auction. In response to factors impacting used
vehicle prices, the Company recognized a retail lease impairment
of $9.5 million in 2002 and $40.0 million in 2001.
Given the current economic environment, it is difficult to
assess the timing and degree of changes in residual values that
may impact financial results over the next several quarters.

At December 31, 2002, the commercial leasing
portfolio had $896 million of residuals, compared with
$985 million at December 31, 2001. At year-end 2002,
lease residuals related to railcars were 16 percent of the
total residual portfolio. Trucks and other transportation
equipment represented 31 percent of the aggregate
portfolio, while aircraft and manufacturing were 13 percent
and 9 percent, respectively. No other significant
concentrations of more than 10 percent existed at
December 31, 2002. In 2002, reduced airline travel and
higher fuel costs adversely impacted aircraft and transportation
equipment lease residual values. In 2002, the Company recognized
$16.0 million in equipment leasing residual impairments
primarily related to airline and railcar equipment. While not
considered significant, continued economic stress in certain
industries may further impact used equipment values into next
year.

Operational Risk Management

Operational risk represents the risk
of loss resulting from the Company’s operations, including,
but not limited to, the risk of fraud by employees or persons
outside the Company, the execution of unauthorized transactions
by employees, errors relating to transaction processing and
technology, and breaches of the internal control system and
compliance requirements. This risk of loss also includes the
potential legal actions that could arise as a result of an
operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with
applicable regulatory standards, adverse business decisions or
their implementation, and customer attrition due to potential
negative publicity.

The Company operates in many different businesses
in diverse markets and relies on the ability of its employees
and systems to process a high number of transactions.
Operational risk is inherent in all business activities, and the
management of this risk is important to the achievement of the
Company’s objectives. In the event of a breakdown in the
internal control system, improper operation of systems or
improper employees’ actions, the Company could suffer
financial loss, face regulatory action and suffer damage to its
reputation.

The Company manages operational risk through a
risk management framework and its internal control processes.
The framework involves the business lines, corporate risk
management personnel and executive management. Under this
framework, business lines have direct and primary responsibility
and accountability for identifying, controlling,

44 U.S. Bancorp


and monitoring operational risk. Clear structures
and processes with defined responsibilities are in place.
Business managers maintain a system of controls with the
objective of providing proper transaction authorization and
execution, proper system operations, safeguarding of assets from
misuse or theft, and ensuring the reliability of financial and
other data. Business managers ensure that the controls are
appropriate and are implemented as designed.

Each business line within the Company has
designated risk managers. These risk managers are responsible,
among other things, for coordinating the completion of ongoing
risk assessments and ensuring that operational risk management
is integrated into business decision-making activities. Business
continuation and disaster recovery planning is also critical to
effectively manage operational risks. Each mission critical
business unit is required to develop, maintain and test these
plans at least annually to ensure that recovery activities, if
needed, can support mission critical functions including
technology, networks and data centers supporting customer
applications and business operations. The Company’s
internal audit function validates the system of internal
controls through risk-based, regular and ongoing audit
procedures and reports on the effectiveness of internal
controls to executive management and the Audit Committee of the
Board of Directors.

While the Company believes that it has designed
effective methods to minimize operational risks, there is no
absolute assurance that business disruption or operational
losses would not occur in the event of a disaster.

Interest Rate Risk Management

In the banking industry, a significant
risk exists related to changes in interest rates. To minimize
the volatility of net interest income and of the market value of
assets and liabilities, the Company manages its exposure to
changes in interest rates through asset and liability management
activities within guidelines established by its Asset Liability
Policy Committee (“ALPC”) and approved by the Board of
Directors. ALPC has the responsibility for approving and
ensuring compliance with asset/liability management policies,
including interest rate risk exposure. The Company uses Net
Interest Income Simulation Analysis and Market Value of Equity
Modeling for measuring and analyzing consolidated interest rate
risk.

Net Interest Income Simulation Analysis

One of the primary tools used to
measure interest rate risk and the effect of interest rate
changes on rate sensitive income and net interest income is
simulation analysis. The monthly analysis incorporates
substantially all of the Company’s assets and liabilities
and off-balance sheet instruments, together with forecasted
changes in the balance sheet and assumptions that reflect the
current interest rate environment. Through these simulations,
management estimates the impact on rate sensitive income of a
300 basis point upward or downward gradual change of market
interest rates over a one year period. The simulations also
estimate the effect of immediate and sustained parallel shifts
in the yield curve of 50 basis points as well as the effect of
immediate and sustained flattening or steepening of the yield
curve. These simulations include assumptions about how the
balance sheet is likely to be affected by changes in loan and
deposit growth. Assumptions are made to project rates for new
loans and deposits based on historical analysis,
management’s outlook and repricing strategies. These
assumptions are validated on a periodic basis. A sensitivity
analysis is provided for key variables of the simulation. The
results are reviewed by ALPC monthly and are used to guide
hedging strategies. ALPC policy guidelines limit the estimated
change in rate sensitive income to 5.0 percent of
forecasted rate sensitive income over the succeeding
12 months.

The table below summarizes the interest rate risk
of net interest income and rate sensitive income. The
interest rate risk position of the Company was more liability
sensitive at December 31, 2002, than at December 31,
2001. The change in the rate risk position is primarily due to
higher levels of fixed rate investment portfolio securities
despite the gradual portfolio mix shift toward floating
rate securities. The rate risk position of these assets is
partially offset by higher levels of demand deposits. At
December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Company was well within its
policy guidelines.

Sensitivity of Net Interest Income and Rate Sensitive Income:

Given the current level of interest rates, a
    downward 300 basis point scenario can not be computed.

Market Value of Equity Modeling

The Company also utilizes the
market value of equity as a measurement tool in managing
interest rate sensitivity. The market value of equity measures
the degree to which the market values of the Company’s
assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments will
change given a change in interest rates. ALPC guidelines limit
the change in market value of equity in a 200 basis point
parallel rate shock to 15 percent of the base case.
Given the low level of current rates, the down 200 basis point
scenario cannot be computed. The up 200 basis point
scenario was a 2.5 percent decrease at December 31, 2002,
compared with a 6.6 percent decrease at December 31,
2001. ALPC reviews other down rate scenarios to evaluate the
impact of falling rates. The down 100 basis point scenario
was a 1.0 percent decrease at December 31, 2002, and a
1.8 percent increase at December 31, 2001. The overall
sensitivity was relatively neutral.

The valuation analysis is dependent upon certain
key assumptions about the nature of indeterminate maturity of
assets and liabilities. Management estimates the average life
and rate characteristics of asset and liability accounts based
upon historical analysis and management’s expectation of
rate behavior. These assumptions are validated on a periodic
basis. A sensitivity analysis is provided to key variables of
the valuation analysis. The results are reviewed by ALPC monthly
and are used to guide hedging strategies. The results of the
valuation analysis as of December 31, 2002, were well
within policy guidelines.

Use of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate
Risk

In the ordinary course of
business, the Company enters into derivative transactions to
manage interest rate and prepayment risk and to accommodate the
business requirements of its customers. To manage its interest
rate risk, the Company may enter into interest rate swap
agreements and interest rate options such as caps and floors.
Interest rate swaps involve the exchange of fixed-rate and
variable-rate payments without the exchange of the underlying
notional amount on which the interest payments are calculated.
Interest rate caps protect against rising interest rates while
interest rate floors protect against declining interest rates.
In connection with its mortgage banking operations, the Company
enters into forward commitments to sell mortgage loans related
to fixed-rate mortgage loans held for sale and fixed-rate
mortgage loan commitments.

The Company actively trades foreign exchange
contracts to meet customer business needs and acts as an
intermediary for interest rate swaps and options on behalf of
customers. The Company minimizes its market and liquidity risks
by taking substantively similar offsetting positions. The
Company does not utilize derivative instruments for speculative
purposes.

Derivative instruments are also subject to credit
risk associated with counterparties to the derivative contracts.
Credit risk associated with derivatives is measured based on the
replacement cost should the counterparties with contracts in a
gain position to the Company fail to perform under the terms of
the contract. The Company manages this risk through
diversification of its derivative positions among various
counterparties, requiring collateral to support certain credit
exposures, entering into master netting agreements in certain
cases, and having a portion of its derivatives in
exchange-traded instruments. Because exchange-traded instruments
conform to standard terms and are subject to policies set by the
exchange involved, including counterparty approval, margin and
security deposit requirements, the credit risk is
substantially reduced.

Refer to Notes 1 and 21 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for significant accounting
policies and additional information regarding the
Company’s use of derivatives.

Table 17 summarizes information on
derivative positions as of December 31, 2002.

Market Risk Management

In addition to interest rate risk, the
Company is exposed to other forms of market risk as a
consequence of conducting normal trading activities. Business
activities that contribute to market risk include, among other
things, market making, underwriting, proprietary trading and
foreign exchange positions. Value at Risk (“VaR”) is a
key measure of market risk for the Company. Theoretically, VaR
represents the maximum amount that the Company has placed at
risk of loss, with a ninety-ninth percentile degree of
confidence, to adverse market movements in the course of its
risk taking activities.

VaR modeling of trading activities is subject to
certain limitations. Additionally, it should be recognized that
there are assumptions and estimates associated with VaR modeling
and actual results could differ from those assumptions and
estimates. The Company mitigates these uncertainties through
regular monitoring of trading activities by management and other
risk management practices including stop-loss and position
limits related to its trading activities. Stress-test models are
used to provide management with perspectives on market events
that VaR models do not capture.

The Company establishes market risk limits,
subject to approval by the Company’s Board of
Directors. The Company’s VaR limit was $40 million at
December 31, 2002 and 2001. The market valuation risk
inherent in its customer-based derivative trading, mortgage
banking pipeline, broker-dealer activities (including equities,

U.S. Bancorp  47


fixed-income, and high-yield securities) and
foreign exchange, as estimated by the VaR analysis, was
$8.8 million at December 31, 2002, and
$10.9 million at December 31, 2001.

Liquidity Risk Management

ALPC establishes policies, as well as
analyzes and manages liquidity, to ensure that adequate funds
are available to meet normal operating requirements in addition
to unexpected customer demands for funds, such as high levels of
deposit withdrawals or loan demand, in a timely and
cost-effective manner. The most important factor in the
preservation of liquidity is maintaining public confidence that
facilitates the retention and growth of a large, stable supply
of core deposits and wholesale funds. Ultimately, public
confidence is generated through profitable operations, sound
credit quality and a strong capital position. The Company’s
performance in these areas has enabled it to develop a large and
reliable base of core funding within its market areas and in
domestic and global capital markets. Liquidity management is
viewed from a long-term and short-term perspective, as well as
from an asset and liability perspective. Management monitors
liquidity through a regular review of maturity profiles, funding
sources, and loan and deposit forecasts to minimize funding risk.

The Company maintains strategic liquidity and
contingency plans that are subject to the availability of asset
liquidity in the balance sheet. Monthly, ALPC reviews the
Company’s ability to meet funding requirements due to
adverse business events. These funding needs are then matched
with specific asset-based sources to ensure sufficient funds are
available. Also, strategic liquidity policies require
diversification of wholesale funding sources to avoid
concentrations in any one market source. Subsidiary banks are
members of various Federal Home Loan Banks that provide a source
of funding through FHLB advances. The Company maintains a Grand
Cayman branch for issuing eurodollar time deposits. The Company
also establishes relationships with dealers to issue national
market retail and institutional savings certificates and
short-and medium-term bank notes. Also, the Company’s
subsidiary banks have significant correspondent banking networks
and corporate accounts. Accordingly, it has access to national
fed funds, funding through repurchase agreements and sources of
more stable, regionally based certificates of deposit.

The Company’s ability to raise negotiated
funding at competitive prices is influenced by rating
agencies’ views of the Company’s credit quality,
liquidity, capital and earnings. The debt ratings noted in
Table 18 reflect the rating agencies’ recognition of
the strong, consistent financial performance of the Company and
the quality of the balance sheet.

The parent company’s routine funding
requirements consist primarily of operating expenses, dividends
to shareholders, debt service and funds used for acquisitions.
The parent company obtains funding to meet its obligations from
dividends collected from its subsidiaries and the issuance of
debt securities.

At December 31, 2002, parent company
long-term debt outstanding was $5.7 billion, compared with
$6.1 billion at December 31, 2001. The decrease in
long-term debt in 2002 was driven by the issuance of
$2.1 billion of fixed- and variable-rate medium-term notes,
which was partially offset by medium-term note maturities of
$1.2 billion and the repurchase on August 6, 2002, of
$1.1 billion accreted value of the Company’s convertible
senior notes. Total parent company debt scheduled to mature in
2003 is $1.5 billion. These debt obligations are expected
to be met through medium-term note issuances and dividends from
subsidiaries, as well as from parent company cash and cash
equivalents. Federal banking laws regulate the amount of
dividends that may be paid by banking subsidiaries without prior
approval. The amount of dividends available to the parent
company from its banking subsidiaries was approximately
$614 million at December 31, 2002. For further
information, see Note 24 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Asset securitization and conduits
represent a source of funding the Company’s growth through
off-balance sheet structures. The Company sponsors two
off-balance sheet conduits to which it transfers high-grade
assets: a commercial loan conduit and an investment securities
conduit. These conduits are funded by issuing commercial paper.
The commercial loan conduit holds primarily high credit quality
commercial loans and held assets of $4.2 billion at
December 31, 2002, and $6.9 billion in assets at
December 31, 2001. The investment securities conduit holds
high-grade investment securities and held assets of
$9.5 billion at December 31, 2002, and
$9.8 billion in assets at December 31, 2001. These
investment securities include primarily (i) private label
asset-backed securities, which are insurance “wrapped”
by AAA/ Aaa-rated mono-line insurance companies and
(ii) government agency mortgage-backed securities and
collateralized mortgage obligations. The commercial loan conduit
had commercial paper liabilities of $4.2 billion at
December 31, 2002, and $6.9 billion at December 31,
2001. The investment securities conduit had commercial paper
liabilities of $9.5 billion at December 31, 2002, and
$9.8 billion at December 31, 2001. The Company
benefits by transferring commercial loans and investment
securities into conduits that provide diversification of funding
sources in a capital-efficient manner and generate income.

The Company provides liquidity facilities to both
conduits. In addition, the Company retains the credit risk of
the loans transferred to the commercial loan conduit through a
credit enhancement agreement. Utilization of the liquidity
facilities would be triggered by the conduits’ inability to
issue commercial paper to fund their assets. The credit
enhancement provided to the commercial loan conduit represents a
recourse obligation under which the Company would be required to
repurchase loans sold to the conduit if certain credit-related
events of the underlying assets occur. The recorded fair value
of the Company’s liability for the recourse obligation and
for both liquidity facilities was $56.1 million at
December 31, 2002, and was included in other liabilities.
Changes in fair value of these liabilities are recorded in the
income statement as other income or expense. In addition, the
Company recorded at fair value its retained residual interest in
both the commercial loan and investment securities conduits of
$28.6 million and of $93.4 million, respectively, at
December 31, 2002. The Company recorded revenue of
$132.2 million from the conduits in 2002 and
$132.7 million in 2001, including fees for servicing,
management, administration and accretion income from retained
interests.

At December 31, 2002, the Company had two
asset-backed securitizations to fund indirect automobile loans
and an unsecured small business credit product. The indirect
automobile securitization held $156.1 million in assets at
December 31, 2002, compared with $431.5 million at
December 31, 2001. The Company recognized income from an
interest-only strip and servicing fees from this securitization
of $2.8 million during 2002 and $6.1 million during
2001. The indirect automobile securitization held average assets
of $276.9 million in 2002 and $655.3 million in 2001.
In January 2003, the Company exercised a cleanup call
option on the indirect automobile loan securitization. The
remaining assets from the securitization were recorded on the
Company’s balance sheet at fair value.

The unsecured small business credit
securitization held $652.4 million in assets at
December 31, 2002, of which the Company retained
$150.1 million of subordinated securities,
transferor’s interests of $16.3 million and a residual
interest-only strip of $53.3 million. This compared with
$750.0 million in assets at December 31, 2001, of
which the Company retained $175.3 million of subordinated
securities, transferor’s interests of $18.8 million
and a residual interest-only strip of $57.3 million. The
qualifying special purpose entity issued asset-backed variable
funding notes in various tranches. The Company provides credit
enhancement in the form of subordinated securities and reserve
accounts. The Company’s risk, primarily from losses in the
underlying assets, was considered in determining the fair value
of the Company’s retained interests in this securitization.
The Company recognized income from subordinated securities,

Table 19

Contractual Obligations

U.S. Bancorp  49


an interest-only strip and servicing fees from
this securitization of $52.8 million in 2002 and $5.2
million in 2001. The unsecured small business credit
securitization held average assets of $700.6 million in
2002 and $123.0 million in 2001.

The corporate and purchasing card securitization
matured in February 2002. At maturity, $420.0 million
of receivables were transferred from the trust to the Company
and recorded at fair value at that time. The Company recognized
servicing income of $.5 million in 2002 and
$4.2 million in 2001 from this securitization.

During 2002, the Company securitized
$144.4 million of highly rated fixed rate municipal bonds.
Each municipal bond is sold into a separate trust that is funded
by variable rate certificates that reprice weekly. The Company
retains a residual interest in each structure that is accounted
for as a trading asset and is recorded at fair value. The
purpose of the arrangements is to meet our customer demands for
variable rate tax-free investments. Income and cash flows from
these structures were not significant in 2002.

With respect to real estate and certain
equipment, the Company enters into capital or operating leases
to meet its business requirements. Certain operating lease
arrangements involve third-party lessors that acquire these
business assets through leveraged financing structures commonly
referred to as “synthetic leases.” At
December 31, 2002, synthetic lease structures held real
estate assets of $434.5 million and equipment assets of
$45.5 million, compared with $372.7 million and
$41.6 million, respectively, at December 31, 2001. The
Company provides guarantees to the lender in the event of
default by the leveraged financing structures or in the event
that the Company does not exercise its option to purchase the
property at the end of the lease term and the fair value of the
assets is less than the purchase price. The maximum end-of-term
guarantee, if the fair value of the assets is less than the
purchase price, was $403.0 million at December 31,
2002, and $346.3 million at December 31, 2001. The
Company performs an evaluation for possible declines in fair
value of these assets on an annual basis and is not aware of any
material declines in value of these assets.

Credit, liquidity, operational and legal
structural risks exist due to the nature and complexity of asset
securitizations and other off-balance sheet structures. ALPC
regularly monitors the performance of each off-balance sheet
structure in an effort to minimize these risks and ensure
compliance with the requirements of the structures. The Company
utilizes its credit risk management systems to evaluate the
credit quality of underlying assets and regularly forecasts cash
flows to evaluate any potential impairment of retained
interests. Also, regulatory guidelines require consideration of
asset securitizations in the determination of risk-based capital
ratios. The Company does not rely significantly on off-balance
sheet arrangements for liquidity or capital resources.

In January 2003, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued Interpretation No. 46
(“FIN 46”), “Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities” (“VIEs”), an interpretation of
Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, “Consolidated
Financial Statements,” to improve financial reporting of
special purpose and other entities. The Company is in the
process of determining whether its off-balance sheet structures
are subject to the provisions of FIN 46. Because the loan
and investment conduits and the asset-backed securitizations are
qualified special purpose entities (“QSPEs”), which
are exempted from consolidation, the Company does not believe
the QSPE structures will require consolidation in its financial
statements. The Company believes it is reasonably possible that
synthetic leases will be consolidated under the provisions of
FIN 46. At this time, the Company does not believe that the
adoption of FIN 46 will have a material adverse impact on
the Company’s financial statements.

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT

The Company is committed to managing capital for
shareholder benefit while providing sound protection to its
depositors and to its creditors. The Company continually
assesses its business risks and capital position. The Company
also manages its capital to exceed regulatory capital
requirements for well-capitalized bank holding companies. To
achieve these capital goals, the Company employs a variety of
capital management tools including dividends, common share
repurchases, and the issuance of subordinated debt and other
capital instruments. Total shareholders’ equity was
$18.1 billion at December 31, 2002, compared with
$16.5 billion at December 31, 2001. The increase was
primarily the result of corporate earnings, including merger and
restructuring-related items, offset by dividends, share
buybacks, the effect of a change in accounting principles and
acquisitions.

On March 12, 2002, the Company increased its
dividend rate per common share by 4.0 percent, from
$.1875 per quarter to $.1950 per quarter. On
February 27, 2001, the Company increased its dividend rate
per common share by 15.4 percent, from $.1625 per
quarter to $.1875 per quarter. Excluding merger and
restructuring-related charges, the dividend payout ratio for
2002 decreased to 42.5 percent, compared with a payout
ratio of 57.0 percent in 2001.

On July 17, 2001, the Company’s Board
of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to
56.4 million shares of the Company’s common stock in
connection with the July 24, 2001 acquisition of NOVA.
During 2001, the Company repurchased 19.7 million shares of
common stock in both public and private transactions in
connection with

50 U.S. Bancorp


this authorization. On December 18, 2001,
the Board of Directors approved an authorization to repurchase
an additional 100 million shares of common stock through
2003. During the first quarter of 2002, the Company repurchased
40.0 million shares of common stock in both public and
private transactions related to these authorizations, completing
the July 17, 2001 authorization. In 2002, the Company
purchased 5.2 million shares of common stock under the
December 2001 plan. There are approximately
91.5 million shares remaining to be purchased under this
authorization. For a complete analysis of activities impacting
shareholders’ equity and capital management programs, refer
to Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Banking regulators define minimum capital
requirements for banks and financial services holding companies.
These requirements are expressed in the form of a minimum
tier 1 capital ratio, total risk-based capital ratio, and
tier 1 leverage ratio. The minimum required level for these
ratios is 4.0 percent, 8.0 percent, and
4.0 percent, respectively. The Company targets its
regulatory capital levels, at both the bank and bank holding
company level, to exceed the “well capitalized”
threshold for these ratios of 6.0 percent,
10.0 percent, and 5.0 percent, respectively. As of
December 31, 2002, the Company’s tier 1 capital,
total risk-based capital, and tier 1 leverage ratio were
7.8 percent, 12.2 percent, and 7.5 percent,
respectively. These ratios compare to 7.7 percent,
11.7 percent, and 7.7 percent, respectively, as of
December 31, 2001. The increase in the total risk-based
capital ratio was primarily related to the issuance of
$1.0 billion of subordinated debt in 2002. All regulatory
ratios, at both the bank and bank holding company level,
continue to be in excess of stated “well capitalized”
requirements. Table 20 provides a summary of tier 1
and total risk-based capital ratios as of December 31,
2002, and 2001, as defined by the regulatory agencies.

The Company uses tangible common equity expressed
as a percent of tangible common assets as an additional measure
of its capital. At December 31, 2002, the Company’s
tangible common equity ratio was 5.6 percent, compared with
5.7 percent at year-end 2001.

FOURTH QUARTER SUMMARY

In the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company had
net income of $849.8 million ($.44 per diluted share), compared
with $695.4 million ($.36 per diluted share) in the fourth
quarter of 2001. The Company reported operating earnings (net
income excluding merger and restructuring-related items)
of $920.1 million ($.48 per diluted share) in the
fourth quarter of 2002, compared with operating earnings of
$785.2 million ($.40 per diluted share) in the fourth
quarter of 2001. The Company’s results for the fourth
quarter of 2002 improved over the same period of 2001, primarily
due to strong growth in consumer banking and payment services
revenue, offset somewhat by lower investment banking activity.
The fourth quarter of 2002 results included $152.7 million
of significant income items, which were

    accordance with regulatory accounting principles as disclosed in
    the subsidiaries’ regulatory reports.

offset by $161.0 million of noteworthy
expense items and asset write-downs. Notable favorable
items in the fourth quarter included gains on the sale of
securities of $106.2 million, an increase of
$84.2 million over the fourth quarter of 2001, and a
$46.5 million gain on the sale of a co-branded credit card
portfolio. Offsetting these favorable items were the recognition
of $54.1 million of MSR impairment, an increase of
$26.8 million over the fourth quarter of 2001, a
$50.0 million litigation charge, including investment
banking regulatory matters at Piper, incremental personnel costs
of $31.4 million for rationalizing the Company’s
post-integration technology, operations, and support functions,
and a $25.5 million leasing residual impairment.

Fourth quarter net interest income, on a
taxable-equivalent basis, was $1,775.0 million, compared
with $1,674.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2001.
Average earning assets for the fourth quarter of 2002 increased
over the fourth quarter of 2001 by $6.9 million
(4.7 percent), primarily driven by increases in the
investment portfolio, loans held for sale and retail loan
growth, partially offset by a decline in commercial and
commercial real estate loans. The net interest margin in the
fourth quarter of 2002 was 4.63 percent, compared with
4.57 percent in the fourth quarter of 2001. The improvement
in the net interest margin in the fourth quarter of 2002 over
the fourth quarter of 2001 reflected higher net free funds, the
funding benefits of the declining interest rate environment, a
more favorable funding mix and improving spreads due to product
repricing dynamics, and a shift in mix toward retail loans,
partially offset by lower yields on the
investment portfolio.

The provision for credit losses for the fourth
quarter of 2002 was $349.0 million, an increase of
$83.2 million over the fourth quarter of 2001. This higher
level of provision for credit losses reflected an increase in
nonperforming assets and net charge-offs year-over-year
reflecting continued weakness in certain industry sectors and
the impact of the weak economy on highly leveraged enterprise
value financings.

Fourth quarter 2002 noninterest income was
$1,546.1 million, an increase of $211.9 million
(15.9 percent) over the same quarter of 2001. The growth in
noninterest income over the fourth quarter of 2001 was driven by
net securities gains, growth in core banking product revenues of
$60.8 million (4.6 percent), a $46.5 million gain
on the sale of a co-branded credit card portfolio, a reduction
in equity investment losses of $29.0 million relative to
the fourth quarter of 2001, and acquisitions, including Leader
and the Bay View branches, which contributed approximately

Basis (a)

(a)

The Company analyzes its performance on a net
    income basis in accordance with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States, as well as on an operating basis
    before merger and restructuring-related items and cumulative
    effect of change in accounting principles referred to as
    “operating earnings.” Operating earnings are presented
    as supplemental information to enhance the reader’s
    understanding of, and highlight trends in, the Company’s
    financial results excluding the impact of merger and
    restructuring- related items of specific business acquisitions
    and restructuring activities and cumulative effect of change in
    accounting principles. Operating earnings should not be viewed
    as a substitute for net income and earnings per share as
    determined in accordance with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States. Merger and restructuring-related
    items excluded from net income to derive operating earnings may
    be significant and may not be comparable to other
    companies.

favorable variance. Credit and debit card
revenue, corporate payment products revenue and ATM processing
services revenue in the Payment Services line of business were
higher in the fourth quarter of 2002, primarily reflecting
growth in sales and card usage. Merchant processing services
increased year-over-year, primarily due to higher charge volume,
offset by slightly lower processing rates. Deposit service
charges increased primarily due to fee enhancements and new
accounts within the Consumer Banking line of business. Cash
management fees revenue grew primarily due to growth in core
business, product enhancements and lower earning credit rates to
customers. Mortgage banking revenue was higher due to the
acquisition of Leader in April 2002. Mortgage originations
and sales and loan servicing revenue continued to be strong
through the fourth quarter of 2002. Offsetting these favorable
variances was a decline in capital markets-related revenue
reflecting softness in the equity capital markets. Other fee
income was higher in the fourth quarter of 2002 primarily due to
gains on the sale of a co-branded credit card portfolio and a
reduction in the level of equity investment losses relative to
2001.

Fourth quarter of 2002 noninterest expense,
before merger and restructuring-related charges, totaled
$1,551.2 million, an increase of $47.3 million
(3.1 percent) over the fourth quarter of 2001. The increase
in expense year-over-year was primarily due to a
$50.0 million litigation charge for investment banking
regulatory matters at Piper, an increase in MSR impairment, the
impact of recent acquisitions, including Leader and the branches
of Bay View, and a charge for the realignment of the
Company’s businesses post-integration. Offsetting these
increases in expense were the impact of adopting new accounting
standards related to business combinations and the amortization
of intangibles, lower capital markets-related expense and lower
core banking expenses, primarily the result of integration cost
savings.

LINE OF BUSINESS FINANCIAL REVIEW

Within the Company, financial performance is
measured by major lines of business, which include Wholesale
Banking, Consumer Banking, Private Client, Trust and Asset
Management, Payment Services, Capital Markets, and Treasury and
Corporate Support. These operating segments are components of
the Company about which financial information is available and
is evaluated regularly in deciding how to allocate resources and
assess performance.

Basis for Financial Presentation

Business line results are derived from
the Company’s business unit profitability reporting systems
by specifically attributing managed balance sheet assets,
deposits and other liabilities and their related income or
expense. Funds transfer-pricing methodologies are utilized to
allocate a cost of funds used or credit for funds provided to
all business line assets and liabilities using a matched funding
concept. Also, the business unit is allocated the
taxable-equivalent benefit of tax-exempt products. Noninterest
income and expenses directly managed by each business line,
including fees, service charges, salaries and benefits, and
other direct costs are accounted for within each segment’s
financial results in a manner similar to the consolidated
financial statements. Occupancy costs are allocated based on
utilization of facilities by the lines of business. Noninterest
expenses incurred by centrally managed operations or business
lines that directly support another business line’s
operations are not charged to the applicable business line.
Goodwill and other intangible assets are assigned to the lines
of business based on the mix of business of the acquired entity.
To enhance analysis of core business line results, the
amortization of goodwill for all prior periods is reported
within Treasury and Corporate Support. The provision for credit
losses for each business unit is based on its net charge-offs
adjusted for changes in the allowance for credit losses,
reflecting improvement or deterioration in the risk profile of
the business lines’ loan portfolios. The difference between
the provision for credit losses determined in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
recognized by the Company on a consolidated basis and the
provision recorded by the business lines is recorded in Treasury
and Corporate Support. Income taxes are assessed to each line of
business at a standard tax rate with the residual tax expense or
benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate
included in Treasury and Corporate Support. Merger and
restructuring-related charges and cumulative effects of changes
in accounting principles are not identified by or allocated to
lines of business. Within the Company, capital levels are
evaluated and managed centrally; however, capital is allocated
to the operating segments to support evaluation of business
performance. Capital allocations to the business lines are based
on the amount of goodwill and other intangibles, the extent of
off-balance sheet managed assets and lending commitments and the
ratio of on-balance sheet assets relative to the total Company.
Certain lines of business, such as trust, asset management and
capital markets, have no significant balance sheet components.
For these business units, capital is allocated taking into
consideration fiduciary and operational risk, capital levels of
independent organizations operating similar businesses, and
regulatory requirements.

Designations, assignments and allocations may
change from time to time as management systems are enhanced,
methods of evaluating performance or product lines change or
business segments are realigned to better respond to our diverse
customer base. During 2002, certain organization and methodology
changes were made and, accordingly,

U.S. Bancorp  53


2001 results were restated and presented on a
comparable basis.

The Company’s basis of financial
presentation differed significantly in 2000 due to
organizational changes in connection with the Firstar/USBM
merger. Therefore, the presentation of comparative business line
results for 2000 is not practical at this time.

Wholesale Banking

offers lending, depository, treasury
management and other financial services to middle market, large
corporate and public sector clients. Wholesale Banking
contributed $1,372.7 million of the Company’s net
operating earnings in 2002 and $708.4 million in 2001. The
significant increase in operating earnings in 2002, compared
with 2001 was primarily driven by a lower provision for credit
losses.

Total net revenue decreased 1.2 percent in
2002, compared with 2001. Net interest income, on a
taxable-equivalent basis, decreased 6.7 percent, compared
with 2001, as average loans declined $6.8 billion in 2002,
compared with 2001. The impact of declining average loans on net
interest income was offset somewhat by improving spreads and a
decrease in the funding cost related to non-earning assets. The
decrease in net interest income also reflected the adverse
impact of declining interest rates on the funding benefits of
customer deposits, partially offset by growth in average
deposits of 23.6 percent in 2002, compared with 2001.
Additionally, a decline in required capital for Wholesale
Banking, driven by lower commercial loan balances and unfunded
commitments, reduced the related earnings credit in 2002,
compared with 2001. The decline in commercial loans was due in
part to weak

customer loan demand resulting from the current
economic environment, in addition to the Company’s
decisions in 2001 to tighten credit availability to certain
types of lending, industries and customers, and reductions due
to asset workout strategies. Also contributing to the decline
were the transfers of high credit quality commercial loans to
the loan conduit reducing average commercial loans by
$721 million in 2002. Noninterest income increased
17.5 percent in 2002 to $739.5 million in 2002,
reflecting core growth in cash management-related fees driven by
lower earnings credit rates and new account growth, an increase
in fee income related to the loan conduit and growth in
commercial leasing income and international fee income.

Noninterest expense was $416.6 million in
2002, compared with $419.2 million in 2001. The
$2.6 million decrease was primarily due to the decline in
personnel costs resulting from integration cost savings, in
addition to lower intangible amortization costs, partially
offset by increases in equipment financing related write-downs
and loan workout expenses.

During 2002 and 2001, the provision for credit
losses was $163.9 million and $1,238.4 million,
respectively. Included in 2001 was a significant charge taken
after extensive reviews of the Company’s commercial loan
portfolio in light of the world events that occurred in the
third quarter of 2001, declining economic conditions, and
company-specific trends. This action reflected management’s
expectations at the time of a prolonged economic slowdown and
recovery. In addition, net charge-offs were relatively higher in
2001 due to specific actions taken by management in response to
changes in economic conditions. The

U.S. Bancorp  55


improvement in provision for credit losses
reflected a reduction in net charge-offs, the impact of
reductions in total loan commitments and an improvement in the
projected loss ratios for commercial loan risk rating categories
that has occurred. These trends were attributable to the
improvement in credit quality driven by the Company’s asset
workout strategies, reductions in commitments to certain
industries and customers and lower net charge-offs. Despite an
improvement in risk ratings, nonperforming assets within the
Wholesale Banking business line continues to be at elevated
levels reflecting stress in several industry sectors increasing
to $1.0 billion at December 31, 2002, from
$738.7 million a year ago. Refer to the “Corporate
Risk Profile” section for further information on factors
impacting the credit quality of the loan portfolios.

Consumer Banking

delivers products and services to the
broad consumer market and small businesses through banking
offices, telemarketing, on-line services, direct mail and
automated teller machines (“ATMs”). It encompasses
community banking, metropolitan banking, small business banking,
consumer lending, mortgage banking, workplace banking, student
banking, 24-hour banking and investment product and insurance
sales. Consumer Banking contributed $1,469.7 million of the
Company’s net operating earnings in 2002 and
$1,330.8 million in 2001, a 10.4 percent increase.

Total net revenue increased 5.9 percent from
2001. Fee-based revenue grew by 18.3 percent in 2002 while
net interest income increased 1.1 percent in 2002. The
increase in net interest income in 2002 was due to average loan
growth, improved spreads on retail loans and residential real
estate loans, slightly lower non-earning asset balances and
growth in noninterest-bearing deposit balances and the related
funding benefit. Partially offsetting the increase in net
interest income was the impact of declining interest rates on
the funding benefit of consumer deposits. The increase in
average loan balances of 4.3 percent reflected core retail
loan growth of 12.6 percent in 2002 offset by a decline of
4.1 percent in commercial and commercial real estate loans.
The change in average deposits included core growth in
noninterest-bearing, interest checking and savings account
balances, offset by a reduction in balances associated with time
deposits. The decline in lower margin time deposits primarily
reflected a shift in product mix towards savings products.
Fee-based revenue growth in 2002 was driven by increases in
deposit service charge revenue, mortgage banking production and
servicing revenue, investment product revenue, securities gains
and lower end-of-term lease residual losses partially offset by
lower trust and investment management fees. The growth in
mortgage banking servicing and production revenue was partially
attributable to the acquisition of Leader in the second quarter
of 2002, which contributed $48.3 million in 2002, compared
with 2001. The additional growth in mortgage banking servicing
and production revenue, net interest income from higher average
loans held for sale and the increase in securities gains offset
the increased MSR impairments recognized in 2002.

Noninterest expense was $2,034.1 million in
2002, compared with $1,864.9 million in 2001. The increase in
noninterest expense in 2002 was attributable to the Leader
acquisition of $34.5 million and recognition of higher
MSR impairments in 2002 of $186.0 million, compared
with $60.8 million in 2001, partially offset by expense
control initiatives.

The provision for credit losses decreased
$122.3 million (22.2 percent) in 2002, compared with
2001. The decrease in the provision primarily reflected
improvement in the Community Banking commercial loan portfolio,
including lower net charge-offs, reductions in loan commitments
and improvement in loss ratios on risk rated loan commitments.
The change in the provision also reflected an improvement in
retail loss ratios due to enhancements in collection efforts and
lower delinquency levels.

Private Client, Trust and Asset Management

provides mutual fund processing
services, trust, private banking and financial advisory services
through four businesses, including: the Private Client Group,
Corporate Trust, Institutional Trust and Custody, and Fund
Services, LLC. The business segment also offers investment
management services to several client segments, including mutual
funds, institutional customers, and private asset management.
Private Client, Trust and Asset Management contributed
$446.8 million of the Company’s net operating earnings
in 2002, an increase of 1.5 percent, compared with 2001.

Total net revenue was $1,195.4 million in
2002, essentially flat, compared with 2001. Net interest income
increased .8 percent, compared with 2001. The increase in
net interest income in 2002 is due to core growth of
10.6 percent in retail loans, and lower non-earning asset
balances and related funding costs partially offset by the
impact of declining rates on the funding benefit of deposits.
Noninterest income decreased .3 percent, compared with
2001. Core account growth was approximately 2.3 percent in
2002 contributing $20.3 million. This growth was offset by a
decrease in the value of assets under management driven by
adverse capital market conditions relative to 2001. Noninterest
expense decreased $2.9 million (.6 percent), compared
with 2001 primarily attributable to a reduction in personnel
costs.

The provision for credit losses decreased
$7.0 million (27.6 percent) in 2002, compared with the
same period of a year ago. Net charges-offs were $1.4 million
higher in 2002, compared with 2001. The improvement in the

56 U.S. Bancorp


provision for credit losses reflected lower
projected loss ratios during 2002 based on recent experience as
compared with 2001, as well as a reduction in commercial loan
commitments in 2002 offset by the increase in net charge-offs.

Payment Services

includes consumer and business credit
cards, corporate and purchasing card services, consumer lines of
credit, ATM processing, merchant processing and debit cards.
Payment Services contributed $722.8 million of the
Company’s net operating earnings in 2002, a
38.6 percent increase over 2001. The business unit’s
financial results were, in part, driven by the impact of the
NOVA acquisition completed during the third quarter of 2001.

Total net revenue was $2,379.5 million in
2002, representing a 26.0 percent increase over 2001. Net
interest income increased 13.5 percent, while fee-based
income increased 32.2 percent over 2001. Excluding the
impact of NOVA, total net revenue increased approximately
12.7 percent in 2002, compared with 2001 primarily due to
growth in noninterest income of 16.2 percent. Net interest
income, excluding NOVA, was up 7.3 percent in 2002,
primarily due to an increase in average loans and lower funding
costs on the noninterest-bearing corporate card loan portfolio.
Noninterest income, excluding NOVA, was up 16.2 percent in 2002,
primarily due to increases in credit and debit card revenue,
corporate payment product revenue, ATM servicing revenues and
the sales of two co-branded credit card portfolios.

Total revenue growth was partially offset by an
increase in noninterest expense of $219.4 million
(37.9 percent), primarily due to the NOVA acquisition.
Excluding the impact of the NOVA acquisition, noninterest
expense for the segment was $8.1 million (2.1 percent)
lower in 2002, compared with 2001, primarily due to personnel
and other operating expense cost saves resulting from
integration activities. The provision for credit losses
decreased $44.5 million (9.1 percent), compared with
2001. The decrease in provision was primarily a reflection of
the improvement in projected loss rates due to enhancements in
collection efforts partially offset by an increase in net
charge-offs of $24.7 million in 2002, compared with 2001.

Capital Markets

engages in equity and fixed income
trading activities, offers investment banking and underwriting
services for corporate and public sector customers and provides
financial advisory services and securities, mutual funds,
annuities and insurance products to consumers and regionally
based businesses through a network of brokerage offices. Capital
Markets contributed $1.1 million of the Company’s net
operating earnings in 2002, a 97.2 percent decline,
compared with 2001. The unfavorable variance in net operating
income from 2001 was due to a decline in fees related to
trading, investment product fees and commissions, investment
banking fees and mark-to-market valuation adjustments reflecting
the recent adverse capital markets conditions. Capital markets
activities continued to experience weak sales volumes and lower
levels of investment banking and merger and acquisition
transactions. Management anticipates continued softness in sales
activities and related revenue growth throughout the next
several quarters. Also contributing to the unfavorable variances
was a litigation charge, including a $25.0 million
settlement for investment banking regulatory matters at Piper
and a $7.5 million liability for funding independent
analyst research for its customers. Given continued adverse
market conditions, the Capital Markets line of business
continued to realign its business activities in 2002 to improve
its operating model and rationalize the distribution network.

Treasury and Corporate Support

includes the Company’s investment
portfolios, funding, capital management and asset securitization
activities, interest rate risk management, the net effect of
transfer pricing related to average balances, and the change in
residual allocations associated with the provision for loan
losses. It also includes business activities managed on a
corporate basis, including enterprise-wide operations and
administrative support functions. Treasury and Corporate Support
recorded net operating losses of $475.4 million in 2002, a
2.9 percent improvement, compared with 2001.

During 2002, total net revenue was
$921.1 million, compared with $569.1 million in 2001. The
$352.0 million increase was primarily attributable to an
increase in net interest income of $469.6 million. The
increase in net interest income was primarily due to an increase
in average investments of $6.9 billion from a year ago and the
benefit of changes in the mix of funding during the declining
rate environment. Noninterest income decreased
$117.6 million in 2002 primarily due to a decline in
securities gains of $97.6 million and a reduction in the
level of equity investment losses relative to 2001.

Noninterest expense was $1,473.0 million in
2002, compared with $1,549.5 million in 2001, a decrease of
4.9 percent. Adjusting for the adoption of SFAS 142 in
2002, noninterest expense excluding goodwill amortization
increased by $174.6 million (13.4 percent) in 2002,
compared with 2001. The increase was primarily the result of
higher costs associated with corporate performance based
compensation due to the improved Company performance in 2002,
compared with 2001, in addition to personnel and related costs
for post integration rationalization of technology, operations
and support functions.

The provision for credit losses for this business
unit represents the residual aggregate of the credit losses
allocated to the reportable business units and the

U.S. Bancorp  57


Company’s recorded provision determined in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States. The provision for credit losses reflected within
the other business units is based on its net charge-offs
adjusting for changes in the allowance for credit losses
necessary to reflect improvement or deterioration in the risk
profile of its specific loan portfolios. Historical loss factors
are applied to commercial loan commitments stratified by risk
rating plus the required amounts for homogeneous loan portfolios
based on twelve month projected losses in computing the quarter
end business unit allowance. The change in the managerial
allowance for credit losses for the business units is reflected
within the applicable business unit’s provision for credit
losses. The provision for credit losses was a loss of
$293.8 million in 2002, compared with a net recovery of
$157.0 million in 2001. The increase in the provision for
credit losses in 2002 over 2001 reflected the continued elevated
levels of net charge-offs and nonperforming assets on a
consolidated level, despite the improving mix of risk ratings in
the other reportable business units. Improvements in the level
of credit risk and mix of risk classifications within the
portfolios of the other business units were driven by reductions
in higher risk loan commitments due to the Company’s
workout strategies. Refer to the “Corporate Risk
Profile” section for further information on provision for
credit losses, nonperforming assets and factors considered by
the Company in assessing the credit quality of the loan
portfolio and establishing the allowance for credit losses.

ACCOUNTING CHANGES

Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements discusses new accounting policies adopted
by the Company during 2002 and the expected impact of accounting
policies recently issued or proposed but not yet required to be
adopted. To the extent the adoption of new accounting standards
affects the Company’s financial condition, results of
operations or liquidity, the impacts are discussed in the
applicable section(s) of the Management’s Discussion and
Analysis and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The accounting and reporting policies of the
Company comply with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States and conform to general practices within the
banking industry. The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to make estimates and assumptions. The
financial position and results of operations can be affected by
these estimates and assumptions, which are integral to
understanding reported results. Critical accounting policies are
those policies that management believes are the most important
to the portrayal of the Company’s financial condition and
results, and require management to make estimates that are
difficult, subjective or complex. Most accounting policies are
not considered by management to be critical accounting policies.
Several factors are considered in determining whether or not a
policy is critical in the preparation of financial statements.
These factors include, among other things, whether the estimates
are significant to the financial statements, the nature of the
estimates, the ability to readily validate the estimates with
other information including third parties or available prices,
and sensitivity of the estimates to changes in economic
conditions and whether alternative accounting methods may be
utilized under generally accepted accounting principles.
Management has discussed the development and the selection of
critical accounting policies with the Company’s Audit
Committee.

Significant accounting policies are discussed in
Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Those policies considered to be critical accounting policies are
described below.

Allowance for Credit Losses

The allowance for credit losses is
established to provide for probable losses inherent in the
Company’s credit portfolio. The methods utilized to
estimate the allowance for credit losses, key assumptions and
quantitative and qualitative information considered by
management in determining the adequacy of the allowance for
credit losses are discussed in the “Credit Risk
Management” section.

Management’s evaluation of the adequacy of
the allowance for credit losses is the most critical of
accounting estimates for a banking institution. It is a highly
subjective process impacted by many factors as discussed
throughout the Management’s Discussion and Analysis section
of the Annual Report. Although risk management practices,
methodologies and other tools are utilized to determine each
element of the allowance, degrees of imprecision exist in these
measurement tools due, in part, to subjective judgments involved
and an inherent lagging of credit quality measurements relative
to the stage of the business cycle. Even determining the stage
of the business cycle is highly subjective. As discussed in the
“Analysis and Determination of Allowance for Credit
Losses” section, management considers the effect of
imprecision and many other factors in determining the allowance
for credit losses by establishing an “allowance for other
factors” that is not specifically allocated to a category
of loans. If not considered, inherent losses in the portfolio
related to imprecision and other subjective factors could have a
dramatic adverse impact on the liquidity and financial viability
of a bank.

58 U.S. Bancorp


Given the many subjective factors affecting the
credit portfolio, changes in the allowance for other factors may
not directly coincide with changes in the risk ratings of the
credit portfolio reflected in the risk rating process. This is,
in part, due to the timing of the risk rating process in
relation to changes in the business cycle, the exposure and mix
of loans within risk rating categories, levels of nonperforming
loans, and the timing of charge-offs and recoveries. For
example, the amount of loans within specific risk ratings may
change, providing a leading indicator of improving credit
quality, while nonperforming loans and net charge-offs continue
at elevated levels. Because the allowance specifically allocated
to commercial loans is primarily driven by risk ratings and loss
ratios determined through migration analysis and historical
performance, the amount of the allowance for commercial and
commercial real estate loans might decline. However, it is
likely that management would maintain an adequate allowance for
credit losses by increasing the allowance for other factors at a
stage in the business cycle that is uncertain and when
nonperforming asset levels remain elevated. Management believes
these conditions existed at December 31, 2002.

Sensitivity analysis to the many factors
impacting the allowance for credit losses is difficult. Some
factors are quantifiable while other factors require qualitative
judgment. Management conducts analysis with respect to the
accuracy of risk ratings and the volatility of inherent loss
rates applied to risk categories and utilizes the results of
this analysis to determine retail loss projections. This
analysis is then considered in determining the level of the
allowance for credit losses. Refer to the “Analysis and
Determination of the Allowance for Credit Losses” section
for further information.

Asset Impairment

In
the ordinary course of business, the Company evaluates the
carrying value of its assets for potential impairment.
Generally, potential impairment is determined based on a
comparison of fair value to the carrying value. The
determination of fair value can be highly subjective, especially
for assets that are not actively traded or when market-based
prices are not available. The Company estimates fair value based
on the present value of estimated future cash flows. The initial
valuation and subsequent impairment tests may require the use of
significant management estimates. Additionally, determining the
amount, if any, of an impairment may require an assessment of
whether or not a decline in an asset’s estimated fair value
below the recorded value is temporary in nature. While
impairment assessments impact most asset categories, the
following areas are considered to be critical accounting matters
in relation to the financial statements.

Mortgage Servicing Rights

Mortgage servicing rights
(“MSRs”) are capitalized as separate assets when loans
are sold and servicing is retained. The total cost of loans sold
is allocated between the loans sold and the servicing assets
retained based on their relative fair values. MSRs that are
purchased from others are initially recorded at cost. The
carrying value of the MSRs is amortized in proportion to and
over the period of, estimated net servicing revenue and recorded
in noninterest expense as amortization of intangible assets. The
carrying value of these assets is periodically reviewed for
impairment using a lower of carrying value or fair value
methodology. For purposes of measuring impairment, the servicing
rights are stratified based on the underlying loan type and note
rate and the carrying value for each stratum is compared to fair
value based on a discounted cash flow analysis, utilizing
current prepayment speeds and discount rates. Events that may
significantly affect the estimates used are changes in interest
rates and the related impact on mortgage loan prepayment speeds
and the payment performance of the underlying loans. If the
carrying value is less than fair value, impairment is recognized
through a valuation allowance for each impaired stratum and
recorded as amortization of intangible assets. The changes in
the fair value of MSRs at December 31, 2002, to immediate
25 and 50 basis point adverse changes in interest rates would be
approximately $81 million and $145 million,
respectively. An upward movement in interest rates at
December 31, 2002, of 25 and 50 basis points would increase
the value of the MSRs by approximately $88 million and
$169 million, respectively. Refer to Note 11 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information regarding MSRs.

Goodwill and Other Intangibles

The Company records all assets and
liabilities acquired in purchase acquisitions, including
goodwill and other intangibles, at fair value as required by
SFAS 141. Goodwill and indefinite-lived assets are no longer
amortized but are subject, at a minimum, to annual tests for
impairment. Other intangible assets are amortized over their
estimated useful lives using straight-line and accelerated
methods, and are subject to impairment if events or
circumstances indicate a possible inability to realize the
carrying amount. The initial goodwill and other intangibles
recorded and subsequent impairment analysis requires management
to make subjective judgments concerning estimates of how the
acquired asset will perform in the future using a discounted
cash flow analysis. Additionally, estimated cash flows may
extend beyond ten years and, by their nature, are difficult to
determine over an extended timeframe. Events and factors that
may significantly affect the estimates include, among others,
competitive forces, customer behaviors and attrition, changes in
revenue growth trends, cost structures and technology, and
changes in discount rates and specific

U.S. Bancorp  59


industry or market sector conditions. In
determining the reasonableness of cash flow estimates, the
Company reviews historical performance of the underlying asset
or similar assets in an effort to improve assumptions utilized
in its estimates. In assessing the fair value of reportable
operating segments, the Company may consider other information
to validate the reasonableness of its valuations including
public market comparables, multiples of recent mergers and
acquisitions of similar businesses and third-party assessments.
Refer to Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information regarding intangible
assets.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Under the supervision and with the participation
of the Company’s management, including its principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, the Company
has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of
its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rule 15d-14(c) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934)
as of a date within 90 days prior to the filing date of this
report. Based upon this evaluation, the principal executive
officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as
of such date, the Company’s disclosure controls and
procedures were effective in making them aware on a timely basis
of the material information relating to the Company required to
be included in the Company’s periodic filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.

There were no significant changes made in the
Company’s internal controls during the period covered by
this report or, to the Company’s knowledge, in other
factors that could significantly affect these controls
subsequent to the date of their evaluation.

Statements of U.S. Bancorp

Responsibility for the financial statements and
other information presented throughout the Annual Report on
Form 10-K rests with the management of U.S. Bancorp.
The Company believes that the consolidated financial statements
have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States and present fairly the
substance of transactions based on the circumstances and
management’s best estimates and judgment. All financial
information throughout the Annual Report on Form 10-K is
consistent with that in the financial statements.

In meeting its responsibilities for the
reliability of the financial statements, the Company depends on
its system of internal controls. The system is designed to
provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and
transactions are executed in accordance with the appropriate
corporate authorization and recorded properly to permit the
preparation of the financial statements. To test compliance, the
Company carries out an extensive audit program. This program
includes a review for compliance with written policies and
procedures and a comprehensive review of the adequacy and
effectiveness of the internal control systems. Although control
procedures are designed and tested, it must be recognized that
there are limits inherent in all systems of internal accounting
control and, as such, errors and irregularities may nevertheless
occur. Also, estimates and judgments are required to assess and
balance the relative cost and expected benefits of the controls.
The Company believes that its system of internal controls
provides reasonable assurance that errors or irregularities that
could be material to the financial statements are prevented or
would be detected within a timely period by employees in the
normal course of performing their assigned functions.

The Board of Directors of the Company has an
Audit Committee composed of directors who are not officers or
employees of U.S. Bancorp. The committee meets periodically
with management, the internal auditors and the independent
accountants to consider audit results and to discuss internal
accounting control, auditing and financial reporting matters.

The Company’s independent accountants,
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, have been engaged to render an
independent professional opinion on the financial statements and
to assist in carrying out certain aspects of the audit program
described above. Their opinion on the financial statements is
based on procedures conducted in accordance with auditing
standards generally accepted in the United States and forms the
basis for their report as to the fair presentation, in the
financial statements, of the Company’s financial position,
operating results and cash flows.

Report of

Independent Accountants

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of
U.S. Bancorp:

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated
balance sheet and the related consolidated statements of income,
shareholders’ equity and cash flows present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of U.S. Bancorp
and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2002, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company’s management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
statements in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America, which require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Note 12 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements, in 2002 the Company adopted
the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.”

Note 1

Significant Accounting Policies

U.S. Bancorp and its subsidiaries (the
“Company”) comprise the organization created by the
acquisition by Firstar Corporation (“Firstar”) of the
former U.S. Bancorp (“USBM”). The new Company
retained the U.S. Bancorp name. The Company is a
multi-state financial services holding company headquartered in
Minneapolis, Minnesota. The Company provides a full range of
financial services including lending and depository services
through banking offices principally in 24 states. The
Company also engages in credit card, merchant, and
ATM processing, mortgage banking, insurance, trust and
investment management, brokerage, leasing and investment banking
activities principally in domestic markets.

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of the Company and its
subsidiaries. The consolidation eliminates all significant
intercompany accounts and transactions. Certain items in prior
periods have been reclassified to conform to the
current presentation.

Uses of Estimates

The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
accompanying notes. Actual experience could differ from those
estimates.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS

Within the Company, financial performance is
measured by major lines of business based on the products and
services provided to customers through its distribution
channels. The Company has six reportable operating segments:

Wholesale Banking

offers lending, depository, treasury
management and other financial services to middle market, large
corporate, financial institution and public sector clients.

Consumer Banking

delivers products and services to the
broad consumer market and small businesses through banking
offices, telemarketing, on-line services, direct mail and
automated teller machines (“ATMs”).

Private Client, Trust and Asset Management

provides mutual fund processing
services, trust, private banking, financial advisory and
investment management services to affluent individuals,
businesses, institutions and mutual funds.

Payment Services

specializes in credit and debit card
products, corporate and purchasing card services and ATM and
merchant processing. Customized products and services, coupled
with cutting-edge technology are provided to consumer and
business customers, government clients, correspondent financial
institutions, merchants and co-brand partners.

Capital Markets

provides financial advisory services
and securities, mutual funds, annuities and insurance products
to consumers and businesses, and engages in equity and fixed
income trading activities and investment banking
and underwriting services for corporate and public
sector customers.

Treasury and Corporate Support

includes the Company’s investment
and residential mortgage portfolios, funding, capital management
and asset securitization activities, interest rate risk
management, the net effect of transfer pricing related to loan
and deposit balances, and the change in residual allocations
associated with the provision for loan losses. It also includes
business activities managed on a corporate basis, including
income and expense of enterprise-wide operations and
administrative support functions.

Segment Results

Accounting policies for the lines of
business are the same as those used in preparation of the
consolidated financial statements with respect to activities
specifically attributable to each business line. However, the
preparation of business line results requires management to
establish methodologies to allocate funding costs and benefits,
expenses and other financial elements to each line of business.
For details of these methodologies and segment results, see
“Basis for Financial Presentation” and Table 22
“Line of Business Financial Performance” included in
Management’s Discussion and Analysis which is incorporated
by reference into these Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

SECURITIES

Trading Securities

Debt and equity securities held for
resale are classified as trading securities and reported at fair
value. Realized and unrealized gains or losses are determined on
a trade date basis and reported in noninterest income.

Available-for-sale Securities

These securities are not trading
securities but may be sold before maturity in response to
changes in the Company’s interest rate risk profile or
demand for collateralized deposits by public entities.
Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with
unrealized net gains or losses reported within other
comprehensive income in shareholders’ equity. When sold,
the amortized cost of the specific securities is used to compute
the gain or loss.

Held-to-maturity Securities

Debt securities for which the Company
has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are
reported at historical cost adjusted for amortization of
premiums and accretion of discounts.

EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN OPERATING
ENTITIES

Equity investments in public entities in which
ownership is less than 20 percent are accounted for as
available-for-sale securities and carried at fair value. Similar
investments in private entities are accounted for using the cost
method. Investments in entities where ownership interest is
between 20 percent and 50 percent are accounted for
using the equity method with the exception of limited
partnerships and limited liability companies where an ownership
interest of greater than 5 percent requires the use of the
equity method. If the Company has a voting interest greater than
50 percent, the consolidation method is used. All equity
investments are evaluated for impairment at least annually and
more frequently if certain criteria are met.

LOANS

Loans are reported net of unearned income.
Interest income is accrued on the unpaid principal balances as
earned. Loan and commitment fees and certain direct loan
origination costs are deferred and recognized over the life of
the loan and/or commitment period as yield adjustments.

Commitments to Extend Credit

Unfunded residential mortgage loan
commitments entered into in connection with mortgage banking
activities are considered derivatives and recorded on the
balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value recorded
in income. All other unfunded loan commitments are generally
related to providing credit facilities to customers of the bank
and are not actively traded financial instruments. These
unfunded commitments are disclosed as off-balance sheet
financial instruments in Note 23 in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Allowance for Credit Losses

Management determines the adequacy of
the allowance based on evaluations of the loan portfolio, recent
loss experience, and other pertinent factors, including economic
conditions. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it
requires estimates, including amounts of future cash collections
expected on nonaccrual loans, that may be susceptible to
significant change. The allowance for credit losses relating to
impaired loans is based on the loans’ observable market
price, the collateral for certain collateral-dependent loans, or
the discounted cash flows using the loan’s effective
interest rate.

The Company determines the amount of the
allowance required for certain sectors based on relative risk
characteristics of the loan portfolio. The allowance recorded
for commercial loans is based on quarterly reviews of individual
credit relationships and an analysis of the migration of
commercial loans and actual loss experience. The allowance
recorded for homogeneous consumer loans is based on an analysis
of product mix, risk characteristics of the portfolio,
bankruptcy experiences, and historical losses, adjusted for
current trends, for each homogenous category or group of loans.
The allowance is increased through provisions charged to
operating earnings and reduced by net charge-offs.

The Company also assesses the credit risk
associated with off-balance sheet loan commitments and letters
of credit and determines the appropriate amount of credit loss
liability that should be recorded. The liability for off-balance
sheet credit exposure related to loan commitments is included in
the allowance for credit losses.

Nonaccrual Loans

Generally commercial loans (including
impaired loans) are placed on nonaccrual status when the
collection of interest or principal has become 90 days past
due or is otherwise considered doubtful. When a loan is placed
on nonaccrual status, unpaid interest is reversed. Future
interest payments are generally applied against principal.
Revolving consumer lines and credit cards are charged off by
180 days past due and closed-end consumer loans other than
loans secured by 1-4 family properties are charged off at
120 days past due and are, therefore, not placed on
nonaccrual status.

Impaired Loans

A
loan is considered to be impaired when, based on current
information and events, it is probable that the Company will be
unable to collect all amounts due (both interest and principal)
according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement.

Restructured Loans

In cases where a borrower experiences
financial difficulties and the Company makes certain
concessionary modifications to contractual terms, the loan is
classified as a restructured loan. Loans restructured at a rate
equal to or greater than that of a new loan with comparable risk
at the time the contract is modified may be excluded from
restructured loans in the calendar years subsequent to the
restructuring if they are in compliance with the modified terms.

U.S. Bancorp  67


Generally, a nonaccrual loan that is restructured
remains on nonaccrual for a period of six months to demonstrate
that the borrower can meet the restructured terms. However,
performance prior to the restructuring, or significant events
that coincide with the restructuring, are considered in
assessing whether the borrower can meet the new terms and may
result in the loan being returned to accrual status at the time
of restructuring or after a shorter performance period. If the
borrower’s ability to meet the revised payment schedule is
uncertain, the loan remains classified as a nonaccrual loan.

Leases

The Company
engages in both direct and leveraged lease financing. The net
investment in direct financing leases is the sum of all minimum
lease payments and estimated residual values, less unearned
income. Unearned income is added to interest income over the
terms of the leases to produce a level yield.

The investment in leveraged leases is the sum of
all lease payments (less nonrecourse debt payments) plus
estimated residual values, less unearned income. Income from
leveraged leases is recognized over the term of the leases based
on the unrecovered equity investment.

Residual values on leased assets are reviewed
regularly for other than temporary impairment. Valuations for
retail automobile leases are based on independent assessments of
expected used car sales prices at the end-of-term. Impairment
tests are conducted based on these valuations considering the
probability of the lessee returning the asset to the Company,
re-marketing efforts and ancillary fees and costs. Valuations
for commercial leases are based upon external or internal
management appraisals. When there is other than temporary
impairment in the estimated fair value of the Company’s
interest in the residual value of a leased asset, the carrying
value is reduced to the estimated fair value with the writedown
recognized in the current period in commercial products revenue
or other noninterest income.

Loans Held for Sale

Loans held for sale (“LHFS”)
represent mortgage loan originations intended to be sold in the
secondary market and other loans that management has an active
plan to sell. LHFS are carried at the lower of cost or market
value as determined on an aggregate basis by type of loan. In
the event management decides to sell loans receivable, the loans
are transferred at the lower of cost or fair value. The
Interagency Guidance on Certain Loans Held for Sale, dated
March 26, 2001, requires loans transferred to LHFS to be
marked-to-market (“MTM”) at the time of transfer. MTM
losses related to the sale/ transfer of non-homogeneous loans
that are predominantly credit-related, are reflected in
charge-offs. With respect to homogeneous loans, the amount of
“probable” credit loss determined in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5
(“SFAS 5”), “Accounting for
Contingencies,” methodologies utilized to determine the
specific allowance allocation for the portfolio is also included
in charge-offs. Any incremental loss determined in accordance
with MTM accounting, that includes consideration of other
factors such as estimates of future losses, is reported
separately from charge-offs as a reduction to the allowance for
credit losses. Subsequent decreases in fair value are recognized
in noninterest income.

Other Real Estate

Other real estate (“ORE”),
which is included in other assets, is property acquired through
foreclosure or other proceedings. ORE is carried at fair value,
less estimated selling costs. The property is evaluated
regularly and any decreases in the carrying amount are included
in noninterest expense.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

In the ordinary course of business, the Company
enters into derivative transactions to manage its interest rate
and prepayment risk and to accommodate the business requirements
of its customers. All derivative instruments are recorded as
either assets or liabilities at fair value. Subsequent changes
in a derivative’s fair value are recognized currently in
earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met.

All derivative instruments that qualify for hedge
accounting are recorded at fair value and classified either as a
hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability
(“fair value” hedge) or as a hedge of the variability
of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized
asset or liability or a forecasted transaction (“cash
flow” hedge). Changes in the fair value of a derivative
that is highly effective and designated as a fair value hedge
and the offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged item
are recorded in income. Changes in the fair value of a
derivative that is highly effective and designated as a cash
flow hedge are recognized in other comprehensive income until
income from the cash flows of the hedged item is recognized. The
Company performs an assessment, both at the inception of the
hedge and on a quarterly basis thereafter, when required, to
determine whether these derivatives are highly effective in
offsetting changes in the value of the hedged items. Any change
in fair value resulting from hedge ineffectiveness is
immediately recorded in noninterest income.

If a derivative designated as a hedge is
terminated or ceases to be highly effective, the gain or loss is
amortized to earnings over the remaining life of the hedged
asset or liability (fair value hedge) or over the same period(s)
that the forecasted hedged transactions impact earnings (cash
flow hedge). If the hedged item is disposed of, or the
forecasted transaction is no longer probable, the derivative is
recorded at fair value with any resulting gain or loss

68 U.S. Bancorp


included in the gain or loss from the disposition
of the hedged item or, in the case of a forecasted transaction
that is no longer probable, included in earnings immediately.

OTHER SIGNIFICANT POLICIES

Premises and Equipment

Premises and equipment are stated at
cost less accumulated depreciation and depreciated primarily on
a straight-line basis over the estimated life of the assets.
Estimated useful lives range up to 40 years for buildings
and from 3 to 20 years for furniture and equipment.

Capital leases, less accumulated amortization,
are included in premises and equipment. The lease obligations
are included in long-term debt. Capitalized leases are amortized
on a straight-line basis over the lease term and the
amortization is included in depreciation expense.

Mortgage Servicing Rights

Mortgage servicing rights
(“MSRs”) are capitalized as separate assets when loans
are sold and servicing is retained. The total cost of loans sold
is allocated between the loans sold and the servicing assets
retained based on their relative fair values. MSRs that are
purchased from others are initially recorded at cost. The
carrying value of the MSRs is amortized in proportion to, and
over the period of, estimated net servicing revenue and recorded
in noninterest expense as amortization of intangible assets. The
carrying value of these assets is periodically reviewed for
impairment using a lower of carrying value or fair value
methodology. For purposes of measuring impairment, the servicing
rights are stratified based on the underlying loan type and note
rate and the carrying value of each stratum is compared to fair
value based on a discounted cash flow analysis, utilizing
current prepayment speeds and discount rates. Events that may
significantly affect the estimates used are changes in interest
rates and the related impact on mortgage loan prepayment speeds
and the payment performance of the underlying loans. If the
carrying value is less than fair value, impairment is recognized
through a valuation allowance for each impaired stratum and
recorded as amortization of intangible assets.

Intangible Assets

The price paid over the net fair value
of the acquired businesses (“goodwill”) is not
amortized. Other intangible assets are amortized over their
estimated useful lives, using straight-line and accelerated
methods. The recoverability of goodwill and other intangible
assets is evaluated annually, at a minimum, or on an interim
basis if events or circumstances indicate a possible inability
to realize the carrying amount. The evaluation includes
assessing the estimated fair value of the intangible asset based
on market prices for similar assets, where available, and the
present value of the estimated future cash flows associated with
the intangible asset.

Income Taxes

Deferred taxes are recorded to reflect
the tax consequences on future years of differences between the
tax bases of assets and liabilities and the financial reporting
amounts at each year-end.

Statement of Cash Flows

For purposes of reporting cash flows,
cash and cash equivalents include cash and money market
investments, defined as interest-bearing amounts due from banks,
federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to
resell.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company grants stock options for a
fixed number of shares to employees and directors with an
exercise price equal to the fair value of the shares at the date
of grant. The Company accounts for stock option grants under the
intrinsic value method in accordance with Accounting Principles
Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees,” (“APB 25”) and accordingly recognizes
no compensation expense for the stock option grants. Refer
to Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for information regarding the proforma impact to the
Company’s earnings if the fair value accounting method was
utilized.

Per Share Calculations

Earnings per share is calculated by
dividing net income (less preferred stock dividends) by the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the
year. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting
income and outstanding shares, assuming conversion of all
potentially dilutive securities, using the treasury stock
method. All per share amounts have been restated for stock
splits.

Note 2

Accounting Changes

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities

In January 2003, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation No. 46
(“FIN 46”), “Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities” (“VIEs”), an interpretation of
Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, “Consolidated
Financial Statements,” to improve financial reporting of
special purpose and other entities. In accordance with the
interpretation, business enterprises that represent the primary
beneficiary of another entity by retaining a controlling
financial interest in that entity’s assets, liabilities,
and results of operating activities must consolidate the entity
in their financial statements. Prior to the issuance of
FIN 46, consolidation generally occurred when an enterprise
controlled another entity through voting interests. Certain VIEs
that are qualifying special purpose entities (“QSPEs”)
subject to the reporting requirements of SFAS 140,
“Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets
and Extinguishment of Liabilities,” will not be required to
be consolidated under the provisions of FIN 46. The
consolidation provisions of FIN 46 apply to

U.S. Bancorp  69


VIEs created or entered into after
January 31, 2003, and for pre-existing VIEs in the first
reporting period beginning after June 15, 2003. If
applicable, transition rules allow the restatement
of financial statements or prospective application with a
cumulative effect adjustment. In addition, FIN 46 expands
the disclosure requirements for the beneficiary of a significant
or a majority of the variable interests to provide information
regarding the nature, purpose and financial characteristics of
the entities.

The Company has various relationships with
special purpose entities (“SPEs”). For details of the
Company’s involvement with SPEs, refer to Note 9 of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company is
in the process of determining whether its off-balance sheet
structures are subject to the provisions of FIN 46. Because
the loan and investment conduits and the asset-backed
securitizations are QSPEs, which are exempted from
consolidation, the Company does not believe the conduits or
securitizations will require consolidation in its financial
statements. Refer to Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information on conduits and
securitizations. The Company believes it is reasonably possible
that synthetic leases will be consolidated under the provisions
of FIN 46. At this time, the Company does not believe that
the adoption of FIN 46 will have a material adverse impact
on the Company’s financial statements.

Stock-Based Compensation

In December 2002, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 148 (“SFAS 148”),
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation— Transition
and Disclosure,” an amendment of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123. SFAS 148 provides
alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the
fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee
compensation. In addition, SFAS 148 requires prominent
disclosures in interim as well as annual financial statements
about the method of accounting for stock-based employee
compensation and the effect of the method used on reported net
income. SFAS 148 is effective for fiscal years ended after
December 15, 2002. The Company plans to continue to account
for stock-based employee compensation under the intrinsic value
based method and to provide disclosure of the impact of the fair
value based method on reported income. Employee stock options
have characteristics that are significantly different from those
of traded options, including vesting provisions and trading
limitations that impact their liquidity. Therefore, the existing
option pricing models, such as Black-Scholes, do not necessarily
provide a reliable measure of the fair value of employee stock
options. Refer to Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for proforma disclosure of the impact of
stock options utilizing the Black-Scholes valuation method.

Guarantees

In
November 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
Interpretation No. 45 (“FIN 45”),
“Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements
for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of
Others,” to clarify accounting and disclosure requirements
relating to a guarantor’s issuance of certain types of
guarantees. FIN 45 requires entities to disclose additional
information about certain guarantees, or groups of similar
guarantees, even if the likelihood of the guarantor’s
having to make any payments under the guarantee is remote. The
disclosure provisions are effective for financial statements for
fiscal years ended after December 15, 2002. For certain
guarantees, the interpretation also requires that guarantors
recognize a liability equal to the fair value of the guarantee
upon its issuance. This initial recognition and measurement
provision is to be applied only on a prospective basis to
guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The
Company does not expect the recognition and measurement
provision to have a material impact on the Company’s
financial statements and has provided additional disclosures
required by FIN 45 in the financial statements. Refer to
Note 23 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
for further information on guarantees.

Business Combinations and Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets

In June 2001, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 141
(“SFAS 141”), “Business Combinations,”
and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142
(“SFAS 142”), “Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets.” SFAS 141 mandates that the purchase method of
accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after
June 30, 2001, and establishes specific criteria for the
recognition of intangible assets separately from goodwill.
SFAS 142 addresses the accounting for goodwill and
intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition. The Company
adopted SFAS 142 on January 1, 2002. The most
significant changes made by SFAS 142 are that goodwill and
indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized and
are to be tested for impairment at least annually. Impairment
charges from the initial impairment test were recognized as a
“cumulative effect of change in accounting principles”
in the income statement. The amortization provisions of
SFAS 142 apply to goodwill and intangible assets acquired
after June 30, 2001. With respect to goodwill and
intangible assets acquired prior to July 1, 2001, the
amortization provisions of SFAS 142 were effective upon
adoption of SFAS 142.

Applying the provisions of SFAS 141 to
recent acquisitions and the provisions of SFAS 142 to
purchase

70 U.S. Bancorp


acquisitions completed prior to July 1,
2001, increased after-tax income for the year ending
December 31, 2002, by $205.6 million, or $.11 per
diluted share. During the first quarter of 2002, the Company
completed its initial impairment test as required by
SFAS 142. As a result of this initial impairment test, the
Company recognized an after-tax goodwill impairment charge of
$37.2 million as a “cumulative effect of change in
accounting principles” in the income statement in the first
quarter of 2002. The impairment was primarily related to the
purchase of a transportation leasing company in 1998 by the
equipment leasing business. Banking regulations exclude
100 percent of goodwill from the determination of capital
adequacy; therefore, the impact of this impairment on the
Company’s capital adequacy was not significant.

Acquisitions of Certain Financial Institutions

In October 2002, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 147 (“SFAS 147”),
“Acquisitions of Certain Financial Institutions,” an
amendment of Statements of Financial Accounting Standards
Nos. 72 and No. 144 and Financial Accounting Standards
Board Interpretation No. 9. In accordance with
SFAS 147, the acquisition of all or a part of a financial
institution that meets the definition of a business is to be
accounted for utilizing the purchase method in accordance with
SFAS 141. In addition, SFAS 147 provides that
long-term customer-relationship intangible assets, except for
servicing assets, recognized in the acquisition of a financial
institution, should be evaluated for impairment under the
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets.” SFAS 147 applies to acquisitions
completed on or after October 1, 2002. Adopting the
standard is not expected to have a material impact on the
Company.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 133 (“SFAS 133”),
“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities,” as amended, establishes accounting and
reporting standards for all derivative instruments and criteria
for designation and effectiveness of hedging activities.
SFAS 133 requires that an entity recognize all derivatives
as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure
those instruments at fair value. The changes in the fair value
of the derivatives are recognized currently in earnings unless
specific hedge accounting criteria are met. If the derivative
qualifies as a hedge, the accounting treatment varies based on
the type of risk being hedged. On January 1, 2001, the
Company adopted SFAS 133. Transition adjustments related to
adoption resulted in an after-tax loss of approximately
$4.1 million recorded in net income and an after-tax
increase of $5.2 million to other comprehensive income. The
transition adjustments related to adoption were not material to
the Company’s financial statements, and as such, were not
separately reported in the consolidated statement of income.

Note 3

Subsequent Event

On February 19, 2003, the Company announced
that its Board of Directors approved a plan to effect a spin-off
of its capital markets business unit, including investment
banking and brokerage activities primarily conducted by its
wholly-owned subsidiary, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray Inc. In
2002, the capital markets business unit had average assets of
$3.0 billion, generated revenues of $737.3 million
(5.8 percent of total revenues) and contributed $1.1
million of net income, representing less than 1 percent of
the Company’s consolidated net income. This distribution
does not include brokerage, financial advisory or asset
management services offered to customers through the retail
brokerage platform of U.S. Bank National Association, U.S.
Bancorp Investments, Inc. or U.S. Bancorp Asset Management, Inc.
The spin-off would be effected through a dividend of 100% of the
Company’s ownership interest in the capital markets
business, and the Company plans to retain $215 million of
subordinated debt of the new company. The distribution is
subject to certain conditions including SEC registration,
regulatory review and approval and a determination that the
distribution will be tax-free to the Company and its
shareholders. While expected to be completed in the third
quarter of 2003, the Company has no obligation to consummate the
distribution, whether or not these conditions are satisfied.

Note 4

Business Combinations

On February 27, 2001, Firstar and USBM
merged in a pooling-of-interests transaction and accordingly all
financial information has been restated to include the
historical information of both companies. Each share of Firstar
stock was exchanged for one share of the Company’s common
stock while each share of USBM stock was exchanged for
1.265 shares of the Company’s common stock. The new
Company retained the U.S. Bancorp name.

On July 24, 2001, the Company acquired NOVA
Corporation (“NOVA”), a merchant processor, in a stock
and cash transaction valued at approximately $2.1 billion.
The transaction represented total assets acquired of $2.9
billion and total liabilities assumed of $773 million.
Included in total assets were merchant contracts and other
intangibles of $650 million and the excess of purchase
price over the fair value of identifiable net assets
(“goodwill”) of $1.6 billion. The goodwill
reflected NOVA’s leadership position in the merchant
processing market and its ability to provide a technologically
superior product that is enhanced by a high level of customer
service. The Company believes

U.S. Bancorp  71


that these factors, among others, will allow NOVA
to generate sufficient positive cash flows from new business in
future periods to support the goodwill recorded in connection
with the acquisition.

On December 31, 2002, the Company acquired
the corporate trust business of State Street Bank and Trust
Company (“State Street Corporate Trust”) in a cash
transaction valued at $725 million. State Street Corporate
Trust was a leading provider, particularly in the Northeast, of
corporate trust and agency services to a variety of
municipalities, corporations, government agencies and other
financial institutions serving approximately 20,000 client
issuances representing over $689 billion of assets under
administration. With this acquisition, the Company is among the
nation’s leading providers of a full range of corporate
trust products and services. The transaction represented total
assets acquired of $681 million and total liabilities of
$39 million at the closing date. Included in total assets
were contract and other intangibles with a fair value of
$225 million and goodwill of $444 million. The
goodwill reflected the strategic value of the combined
organization’s leadership position in the corporate trust
business and processing economies of scale resulting from the
transaction. As part of the purchase price, $75 million was
placed in escrow for up to eighteen months with payment
contingent on the successful transition of business
relationships. Concurrent with the system conversion expected in
2003, certain State Street Corporate Trust assets under
administration will be transferred to the Company or its
affiliated mutual funds.

In addition to these mergers and business
acquisitions, the Company completed several strategic
acquisitions to enhance its presence in certain markets and
businesses.

The following table summarizes acquisitions by
the Company completed since January 1, 2000, treating
Firstar as the original acquiring company:

(a) Assets acquired do not include
purchase accounting adjustments.

Separate results of operations as originally
reported on a condensed basis of Firstar and USBM, for the
period prior to the merger, were as follows:

Refer to Note 12 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information
regarding goodwill and other intangible assets.

Note 5

Merger and Restructuring-Related Items

The Company recorded pre-tax merger and
restructuring-related charges of $324.1 million,
$1,266.4 million, and $348.7 million in 2002, 2001,
and 2000, respectively. In 2002, merger-related items were
primarily incurred in connection with the Firstar/USBM merger,
the NOVA acquisition and the Company’s various other
acquisitions primarily including BayView and State Street
Corporate Trust. In 2001, merger-related items included costs
associated with integrating USBM, NOVA, Mercantile and other
smaller acquisitions noted below and in Note 4 —
Business Combinations. In response to significant changes in the
securities markets during 2001, including increased volatility,
declines in equity valuations and the increasingly competitive
environment for the securities industry, the Company incurred a
charge to restructure its subsidiary, U.S. Bancorp Piper
Jaffray Inc. (“Piper”).

72 U.S. Bancorp


The components of the merger and
restructuring-related items are shown below:

(a)

In 2002, “Other” primarily included
    merger and restructuring-related items pertaining to the Bay
    View acquisition, State Street Corporate Trust and the Lyon
    Financial acquisition. In 2001 and 2000, “Other”
    primarily included the 1998 acquisition of the former Firstar
    Corporation by Star Banc. Star Banc was renamed Firstar
    Corporation.

The Company determines merger and
restructuring-related items and related accruals based on its
integration strategy and formulated plans. These plans are
established as of the acquisition date and are regularly
evaluated during the integration process.

Severance and employee-related charges include
the cost of severance, other benefits and outplacement costs
associated with the termination of employees primarily in branch
offices and centralized corporate support and data processing
functions. The severance amounts are determined based on the
Company’s existing severance pay programs and are paid out
over a benefit period of up to two years from the time of
termination. The total number of employees included in severance
amounts were approximately 2,860 for USBM, 400 for NOVA, 300 for
the Piper Restructuring and 2,400 for Mercantile (expense
primarily recognized in 1999 and 2000). In 2002, the Company
recognized additional severance costs of $13.1 million in
connection with the USBM merger offset by net curtailment and
settlement gains of $9.0 million related to changes in
certain nonqualified pension plans. Changes in severance costs
for USBM and NOVA primarily reflected a change in estimate in
the liability given the mix of employees terminated. Severance
and employee-related costs for identified groups of acquired
employees are included in the determination of goodwill at
closing. Severance and employee-related costs are recorded as
incurred for groups of employees not specifically identified at
the time of closing or acquired in business combinations
accounted for as “poolings.”

Systems conversion and integration costs are
recorded as incurred and are associated with the preparation and
mailing of numerous customer communications for the acquisitions
and conversion of customer accounts, printing and distribution
of training materials and policy and procedure manuals, outside
consulting fees, and other

U.S. Bancorp  73


expenses related to systems conversions and the
integration of acquired branches and operations.

Asset write-downs and lease terminations
represent lease termination costs and impairment of assets for
redundant office space, branches that will be vacated and
equipment disposed of as part of the integration plan. These
costs are recognized in the accounting period that contract
terminations occur or the asset becomes impaired and is
abandoned. In 2002, this category included $38.2 million of
signage write-offs, $26.9 million of software and equipment
write-offs, $32.0 million of lease and contract
cancellations and $6.9 million of leasehold and other
related items associated with the Firstar/USBM merger. In 2001,
asset write-downs and lease terminations included
$45.7 million of lease and contract cancellation costs,
$36.2 million of software and equipment write-offs and
$48.5 million of other assets deemed to be worthless due to
integration decisions in connection with the merger.

In connection with certain mergers, the Company
has made charitable contributions to reaffirm a commitment to
its markets or as part of specific conditions necessary to
achieve regulatory approval. These contributions were funded up
front and represent costs that would not have been incurred had
the merger not occurred. Charitable contributions are charged to
merger and restructuring expenses or considered in determining
the acquisition cost at the applicable closing date.

Balance sheet restructurings primarily represent
gains or losses incurred by the Company related to the disposal
of certain businesses, products, or customer and business
relationships that no longer align with the long-term strategy
of the Company. It may also include charges to realign risk
management practices related to certain credit portfolios.
During 2002, the Company recognized asset gains related to the
sale of a non-strategic investment in a sub-prime lending
business of $28.7 million and a mark-to-market recovery of
$10.1 million associated with the liquidation of
U.S. Bancorp Libra’s investment portfolio. During
2001, balance sheet restructuring costs incurred in connection
with the Firstar/USBM merger of $457.6 million were
comprised of a $201.3 million provision associated with the
Company’s integration of certain small business products
and management’s decision to discontinue an unsecured small
business product of USBM; $90.0 million of charge-offs to align
risk management practices, align charge-off policies and to
expedite the Company’s transition out of a specific segment
of the health care industry; and $76.6 million of losses
related to the sales of two higher credit risk retail loan
portfolios of USBM. Also, the amount included $89.7 million
related to the Company’s decision to discontinue a
high-yield investment banking business, to restructure a
co-branding credit card relationship of USBM, and for the
planned disposition of certain equity investments that no longer
aligned with the long-term strategy of the Company. The
alignment of risk management practices included a write-down of
several large commercial loans originally held separately by
both Firstar and USBM, primarily to allow the Company to exit or
reduce these credits to conform with the credit risk exposure
policy of the combined entity.

Other merger-related items in 2002 of
$7.2 million primarily represents changes to conform
accounting policies implemented at the time of systems
conversions related to the Firstar/USBM merger and other
acquired entities. In 2001, other merger-related charges of
$108.1 million primarily included $69.1 million and
$24.2 million of investment banking fees, legal fees and
stock registration fees associated with the Firstar/USBM merger
and the acquisition of NOVA, respectively. Also, it included
$10.0 million of goodwill impairment related to the Piper
Restructuring and $4.8 million of other costs.

74 U.S. Bancorp


The following table presents a summary of
activity with respect to the merger and restructuring-related
accruals:

(a)

In 2002, “Other” primarily included
    merger and restructuring-related items pertaining to the Bay
    View acquisition, State Street Corporate Trust and the Lyon
    Financial acquisition. In 2001 and 2000, “Other”
    primarily included the 1998 acquisition of the former Firstar
    Corporation by Star Banc. Star Banc was renamed Firstar
    Corporation.

The adequacy of the accrued liabilities is
reviewed regularly taking into consideration actual and
projected payments. Adjustments are made to increase or decrease
these accruals as needed. Reversals of expenses can reflect a
lower utilization of benefits by affected staff, changes in
initial assumptions as a result of subsequent mergers and
alterations of business plans.

The following table presents a summary of
activity with respect to the Firstar/USBM merger:

The components of the merger and
restructuring-related accruals for all acquisitions were as
follows:

U.S. Bancorp  75


The merger and restructuring-related accrual by
significant acquisition or business restructuring was as follows:

At December 31, 2002, the integration of
Firstar and USBM was substantially completed, and no additional
merger and restructuring related charges are expected going
forward. Severance costs will continue to be paid through the
period provided for in the Company’s severance plans. The
integration of merchant processing platforms and business
processes of U.S. Bank National Association and NOVA will
continue through late 2003. In connection with the NOVA
acquisition, management estimates the Company will incur pre-tax
merger-related charges of approximately $36.9 million in
2003. In addition, the Company anticipates additional pre-tax
merger-related expenses in 2003 of $14.7 million related to
the Bay View acquisition, $8.6 million related to the State
Street Corporate Trust acquisition, and $7.2 million as a
result of other smaller acquisitions.

At December 31, 2001, the business unit
restructuring of Piper was substantially completed, with lease
cancellation liabilities to be paid through 2003.

Note 8

Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses

The composition of the loan portfolio at
December 31 was as follows:

During the third quarter of 2002,
reclassifications between loan categories occurred in connection
with conforming loan classifications at the time of system
conversions. Prior quarters were not restated, as it was
impractical to determine the extent of reclassification for all
periods presented. Reclassifications included approximately
$1.2 billion from the commercial loans category to the
commercial real estate loan category ($.5 billion) and the
residential mortgages category ($.7 billion).

Loans are presented net of unearned interest and
deferred fees and costs which amounted to $1.8 billion and
$2.1 billion at December 31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. The Company had loans of $26.1 billion at
December 31, 2002, and $28.0 billion at
December 31, 2001, pledged at the Federal Home Loan Bank.
Loans of $12.7 billion at December 31, 2002, and
$7.2 billion at December 31, 2001, were pledged at the
Federal Reserve Bank.

The Company primarily lends to borrowers in the
24 states where it has banking offices. Collateral for
commercial loans may include marketable securities, accounts
receivable, inventory and equipment. For details of the
Company’s commercial portfolio by industry group and
geography as of December 31, 2002, and 2001, see
Table 8 included in Management’s Discussion and
Analysis which is incorporated by reference into these Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

For detail of the Company’s commercial real
estate portfolio by property type and geography as of
December 31, 2002, and 2001, see Table 9 included in
Management’s Discussion and Analysis which is incorporated
by reference into these Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements. Such loans are collateralized by the related
property.

U.S. Bancorp  77


The following table lists information related to
nonperforming loans as of December 31:

Activity in the allowance for credit losses was
as follows:

(a)

In 2001, $382.2 million of the provision
    for credit losses was incurred in connection with the
    Firstar/USBM merger.

A portion of the allowance for credit losses is
allocated to loans deemed impaired. All impaired loans are
included in non-performing assets. A summary of these loans and
their related allowance for loan losses is as follows:

Commitments to lend additional funds to customers
whose loans were classified as nonaccrual or restructured at
December 31, 2002, totaled $123.9 million. During 2002
there were $1.4 million of loans that were restructured at
market interest rates and returned to an accruing status.

The allowance for credit losses includes credit
loss liability related to off-balance sheet loan commitments. At
December 31, 2002, the allowance for credit losses includes
an estimated $131.4 million credit loss liability related
to the Company’s $58.3 billion of commercial
off-balance sheet loan commitments and letters of credit.

Note 9

Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets
    and Extinguishments of Liabilities

FINANCIAL ASSET SALES

When the Company sells financial assets, it may
retain interest-only strips, servicing rights, residual rights
to a cash reserve account and/or other retained interests in the
sold financial assets. The gain or loss on sale depends in part
on the previous carrying amount of the financial assets involved
in the transfer and is allocated between the assets sold and the
retained interests based on their relative fair values at the
date of transfer. Quoted market prices are used to determine
retained interest fair values when readily available. Since
quotes are generally not available for retained interests, the
Company estimates fair value based

78 U.S. Bancorp


on the present value of future expected cash
flows using management’s best estimates of the key
assumptions including credit losses, prepayment speeds, forward
yield curves and discount rates commensurate with the risks
involved. Retained interests and liabilities are recorded at
fair value using a discounted cash flow methodology at inception
and are evaluated at least quarterly thereafter.

Conduits and Securitizations

The Company sponsors two off-balance
sheet conduits to which it transfers high-grade assets: a
commercial loan conduit and an investment securities conduit.
These conduits are funded by issuing commercial paper. The
commercial loan conduit holds primarily high credit quality
commercial loans and held assets of $4.2 billion at
December 31, 2002, and $6.9 billion in assets at
December 31, 2001. The investment securities conduit holds
high-grade investment securities and held assets of
$9.5 billion at December 31, 2002, and
$9.8 billion in assets at December 31, 2001. These
investment securities include primarily (i) private label
asset-backed securities, which are insurance “wrapped”
by AAA/ Aaa-rated mono-line insurance companies and
(ii) government agency mortgage-backed securities and
collateralized mortgage obligations. The commercial loan conduit
had commercial paper liabilities of $4.2 billion at
December 31, 2002, and $6.9 billion at December 31,
2001. The investment securities conduit had commercial paper
liabilities of $9.5 billion at December 31, 2002, and
$9.8 billion at December 31, 2001. The Company
benefits by transferring commercial loans and investment
securities into conduits that provide diversification of funding
sources in a capital-efficient manner and generate income.

The Company provides liquidity facilities to both
conduits. In addition, the Company retains the credit risk of
the loans transferred to the commercial loan conduit through a
credit enhancement agreement. Utilization of the liquidity
facilities would be triggered by the conduits’ inability to
issue commercial paper to fund their assets. The credit
enhancement provided to the commercial loan conduit represents a
recourse obligation under which the Company would be required to
repurchase loans sold to the conduit if certain credit-related
events of the underlying assets occur. The recorded fair value
of the Company’s liability for the recourse obligation and
for both liquidity facilities was $56.1 million at
December 31, 2002, and was included in other liabilities.
Changes in fair value of these liabilities are recorded in the
income statement as other income or expense. In addition, the
Company recorded at fair value its retained residual interest in
both the commercial loan and investment securities conduits of
$28.6 million and of $93.4 million, respectively, at
December 31, 2002. The Company recorded revenue of
$132.2 million from the conduits in 2002 and
$132.7 million in 2001, including fees for servicing,
management, administration and accretion income from retained
interests.

At December 31, 2002, the Company had two
asset-backed securitizations to fund indirect automobile loans
and an unsecured small business credit product. The indirect
automobile securitization held $156.1 million in assets at
December 31, 2002, compared with $431.5 million at
December 31, 2001. The Company recognized income from an
interest-only strip and servicing fees from this securitization
of $2.8 million during 2002 and $6.1 million during
2001. The indirect automobile securitization held average assets
of $276.9 million in 2002 and $655.3 million in 2001.
In January 2003, the Company exercised a cleanup call
option on the indirect automobile loan securitization. The
remaining assets from the securitization were recorded on the
Company’s balance sheet at fair value.

The unsecured small business credit
securitization held $652.4 million in assets at
December 31, 2002, of which the Company retained
$150.1 million of subordinated securities,
transferor’s interests of $16.3 million and a residual
interest-only strip of $53.3 million. This compared with
$750.0 million in assets at December 31, 2001, of
which the Company retained $175.3 million of subordinated
securities, transferor’s interests of $18.8 million
and a residual interest-only strip of $57.3 million. The
qualifying special purpose entity issued asset-backed variable
funding notes in various tranches in November 2001 which
generated a loss on sale of $64.7 million. The Company
provides credit enhancement in the form of subordinated
securities and reserve accounts. The Company’s risk,
primarily from losses in the underlying assets, was considered
in determining the fair value of the Company’s retained
interests in this securitization. The Company recognized income
from subordinated securities, an interest-only strip and
servicing fees from this securitization of $52.8 million in
2002 and $5.2 million in 2001. The unsecured small business
credit securitization held average assets of $700.6 million
in 2002 and $122.1 million in 2001.

The corporate and purchasing card securitization
matured in February 2002. At maturity, $420.0 million
of receivables were transferred from the trust to the Company
and recorded at fair value at that time. The Company recognized
servicing income of $.5 million in 2002 and
$4.2 million in 2001 from this securitization.

During 2002, the Company securitized
$144.4 million of highly rated fixed rate municipal bonds.
Each municipal bond was sold into a separate trust that was
funded by variable rate certificates that reprice weekly. The
Company retained a residual interest in each structure that was
accounted for as a trading asset and is recorded at fair value.
The purpose of the arrangements was to meet our

U.S. Bancorp  79


customer demands for variable rate tax-free
investments. Income and cash flows from these structures were
not significant in 2002.

Small Business Administration Programs

For the year ended December 31,
2002, the Company did not sell any U.S. government guaranteed
portions of loans originated under Small Business Administration
(“SBA”) programs. For the year ended December 31,
2001, the Company sold $147.5 million of these loans
recognizing a pre-tax gain on sale of $6.3 million.
Generally, these loans are sold with recourse; however, the SBA
guaranty substantially eliminates the Company’s risk. The
Company continues to own the non-guaranteed portion of these
loans. The Company continues to service the loans and is
required under the SBA programs to retain specified yield
amounts. A portion of the yield is recognized as servicing fee
income as it occurs and the remainder is capitalized as an
excess servicing asset and is included in the gain on sale
calculation.

Servicing Asset Position

No valuation allowances were required during 2002
or 2001 on servicing assets. Servicing assets are reported in
aggregate but measured on a transaction specific basis. Market
values were determined using discounted cash flows, utilizing
the assumptions noted in the table below.

Key economic assumptions used in measuring
servicing assets at the date of securitization resulting from
securitizations completed during the year were as follows:

(a)

The Company uses a prepayment vector based on
    loan seasoning for valuation. The given speed is the effective
    prepayment speed that yields the same weighted average life
    calculated using the prepayment vector.

Sensitivity Analysis

At December 31, 2002, key
economic assumptions and the sensitivity of the current fair
value of residual cash flows to immediate 10 percent and 20
percent adverse changes in those assumptions were as follows:

(a)

For the SBA loans, the Company uses prepayment
    vectors based on loan seasoning for valuation. The given speed
    is the effective prepayment speed that yields the same weighted
    average life calculated using the prepayment vector.

(b)

For the small business receivables a monthly
    principal payment rate assumption is used to value the residual
    interests.

(c)

Credit losses are zero for the commercial loan
    conduit as removal of assets provisions are designed to cause
    the removal of assets from the conduit prior to losses being
    incurred.

(d)

Credit losses are zero for the investment
    securities conduit as the investments are all AAA rated or
    insured investments.

(e)

SBA loan credit losses are covered by the
    appropriate SBA loan program and are not included in retained
    interests. Principal reductions caused by defaults are included
    in the prepayment assumption.

(f)

The commercial loan conduit is match funded.
    Therefore, interest rate movements create no material impact to
    the value of the residual interest.

(g)

For the small business receivables interest
    income is based on Prime+ contractual spread. Obligations are
    based on LIBOR.

(h)

The investment securities conduit is mostly
    match funded. Therefore, interest rate movements create no
    material impact to the value of the residual interest.

(i)

The Company exercised a cleanup call option on
    the indirect automobile securitization in January
    2003.

These sensitivities are hypothetical and should
be used with caution. As the figures indicate, changes in fair
value based on a 10 percent variation in assumptions
generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the
change in the assumptions to the change in fair value may not be
linear. Also, in this table the effect of a variation in a
particular assumption on the fair value of the retained interest
is calculated without changing any other

80 U.S. Bancorp


assumptions; in reality, changes in one factor
may result in changes in another (for example, increases in
market interest rates may result in lower prepayments and
increased credit losses), which might magnify or counteract the
sensitivities.

Cash Flow Information

The table below summarizes certain
cash flows received from and paid to conduit or structured
entities for the loan sales described above:

(a)

Current system constraints make it impractical
    to collect information on gross cash flows between the Company
    and the commercial loan conduit for 2002 and 2001.

(b)

The corporate card and small business credit
    securitizations are revolving transactions where proceeds are
    reinvested until their legal terminations.

Other Information

Quantitative information related to
loan sales and managed assets was as follows:

Mortgage Servicing Rights

Changes in mortgage servicing rights are
summarized as follows:

The Company serviced $43.1 billion and
$22.0 billion of mortgage loans for other investors as of
December 31, 2002, and December 31, 2001, respectively.

The fair value of mortgage servicing rights
(“MSRs”) was $655 million at December 31,
2002, and $360 million at December 31, 2001. At
December 31, 2002, the reduction in the current fair value
of MSRs to immediate 25 and 50 basis point adverse interest
rate changes would be approximately $81 million and
$145 million, respectively. An upward movement in interest
rates of 25 and 50 basis points would increase the value of MSRs
by approximately $88 million and $169 million,
respectively. The Company utilizes the investment portfolio as
an economic hedge to this possible adverse interest rate change.
The Company also, from time to time, purchases principal-only
securities that act as a partial economic hedge.

Note 12

Intangible Assets

The Company adopted SFAS 142 on
January 1, 2002. The most significant changes made by
SFAS 142 are that goodwill and other indefinite lived
intangible assets are no longer amortized and will be tested for
impairment at least annually. The amortization provisions of
SFAS 142 apply to goodwill and intangible assets acquired
after June 30, 2001. With respect to goodwill and
intangible assets acquired prior to July 1, 2001, the
amortization provisions of SFAS 142 were effective upon
adoption of SFAS 142.

Prior to the adoption of SFAS 142, the
Company evaluated goodwill for impairment under a projected
undiscounted cash flow model. As a result of the initial
impairment test from the adoption of SFAS 142, the Company
recognized an impairment loss of $58.8 million resulting in
an after-tax loss of $37.2 million in the first quarter of
2002. The impairment was primarily related to the purchase of a
transportation leasing company in 1998 by the equipment leasing
business. This charge was recognized as a “cumulative
effect of change in accounting principles” in the income
statement. The fair value of that reporting unit was estimated
using the present value of future expected cash flows.

82 U.S. Bancorp


Net income and earnings per share adjusted for
the exclusion of amortization expense (net of tax) and asset
impairments related to goodwill are as follows:

Applying the provisions of SFAS 141 to
recent acquisitions and the provisions of SFAS 142 to
purchase acquisitions completed prior to July 1, 2001,
increased after-tax income for the year ending December 31,
2002, by $205.6 million, or $.11 per diluted share.

The following table reflects the changes in the
carrying value of goodwill for the year ended December 31,
2002:

Goodwill acquired in 2002 in Wholesale Banking
included $25 million from an earn-out provision related to
the acquisition of Oliver-Allen Corporation. The Company
recorded $427 million of goodwill related to the Bay View
acquisition in November of 2002, $15 million related to
Wholesale Banking and $412 million related to Consumer
Banking. Also included in the goodwill acquired in Consumer
Banking was $17 million related to the purchase of Leader
in April of 2002. Private Client, Trust and Asset Management
acquired $444 million of goodwill related to the
acquisition of State Street Bank Corporate Trust in December of
2002.

Amortizable intangible assets consisted of the
following:

Long-Term Debt

Long-term debt (debt with original maturities of
more than one year) at December 31 consisted of the following:

In August 2002, the Company repurchased for cash
approximately $1.1 billion accreted value of its
convertible senior notes due in 2021 (the “CZARS”), in
accordance with the terms of the indenture governing the CZARS.
Approximately $57 million in accreted value of the CZARS
remains outstanding.

In February 2002, the Company’s subsidiary
U.S. Bank National Association issued $1.0 billion of
fixed-rate subordinated notes due August 4, 2014. The
interest rate is 6.30% per annum.

Medium-term notes (“MTNs”) outstanding
at December 31, 2002, mature from February 2003 through
August 2007. The MTNs bear fixed or floating interest rates
ranging from 1.55 percent to 7.50 percent. The
weighted-average interest rate of MTNs at December 31,
2002, was 3.69 percent.

Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”)
advances outstanding at December 31, 2002, mature from
January 2003 through October 2026. The advances bear fixed or
floating interest rates ranging from .50 percent to
8.25 percent. The Company has an arrangement with the FHLB
whereby based on collateral available (residential and
commercial mortgages), the Company could have borrowed an
additional $5.5 billion at December 31, 2002. The
weighted-average interest rate of FHLB advances at
December 31, 2002, was 2.65 percent.

Bank notes outstanding at December 31, 2002,
mature from January 2003 through November 2005. The Bank

Company-obligated Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Securities
    of Subsidiary Trusts Holding Solely the Junior
    Subordinated Debentures of the Parent Company

The Company has issued $2.9 billion of
company-obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of
subsidiary trusts holding solely the junior subordinated
debentures of the parent company (“Trust Preferred
Securities”) through nine separate issuances by nine wholly
owned subsidiary grantor trusts (“Trusts”). The Trust
Preferred Securities accrue and pay distributions periodically
at specified rates as provided in the indentures. The Trusts
used the net proceeds from the offerings to purchase a like
amount of junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures
(the “Debentures”) of the Company. The Debentures are
the sole assets of the Trusts and are eliminated, along with
the related income statement effects, in the consolidated
financial statements.

The Company’s obligations under the
Debentures and related documents, taken together, constitute a
full and unconditional guarantee by the Company of the
obligations of the Trusts. The guarantee covers the
distributions and payments on liquidation or redemption of the
Trust Preferred Securities, but only to the extent of funds
held by the Trusts.

The Trust Preferred Securities are mandatorily
redeemable upon the maturity of the Debentures, or upon earlier
redemption as provided in the indentures. The Company has the
right to redeem retail Debentures in whole or in part on
or after specific dates, at a redemption price specified in
the indentures plus any accrued but unpaid interest to the
redemption date. The Company has the right to redeem
institutional Debentures in whole, (but not in part), on or
after specific dates, at a redemption price specified in the
indentures plus any accrued but unpaid interest to the
redemption date. The Trust Preferred Securities are redeemable
in whole or in part in 2003, 2006 and 2007 in the amounts of
$350 million, $2,250 million and $300 million,
respectively.

The Trust Preferred Securities qualify as
tier I capital of the Company for regulatory capital
purposes. The Company used the proceeds from the sales of the
Debentures for general corporate purposes.

Shareholders’ Equity

At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Company
had authority to issue 4 billion shares of common stock and
10 million shares of preferred stock. The Company had
1,917.0 million and 1,951.7 million shares of common
stock outstanding at December 31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. At December 31, 2002, the Company had
272.9 million shares of common stock reserved for future
issuances. These shares are primarily reserved for stock option
plans, dividend reinvestment plans and deferred compensation
plans.

The Company has a Preferred Share Purchase Rights
Plan intended to preserve the long-term value of the Company by
discouraging a hostile takeover of the Company. Under the plan,
each share of common stock carries a right to purchase one
one-thousandth of a share of preferred stock. The rights become
exercisable in certain limited circumstances involving a
potential business combination transaction or an acquisition of
shares of the Company and are exercisable at a price of $100 per
right, subject to adjustment. Following certain other events,
each right entitles its holder to purchase for $100 an amount
of common stock of the Company, or, in certain
circumstances, securities of the acquirer, having a then-current
market value of twice the exercise price of the right. The
dilutive effect of the rights on the acquiring company is
intended to encourage it to negotiate with the Company’s
Board of Directors prior to attempting a takeover. If the Board
of Directors believes a proposed acquisition is in the best
interests of the Company and its shareholders, the Board may
amend the plan or redeem the rights for a nominal amount in
order to permit the acquisition to be completed without
interference from the plan. Until a right is exercised, the
holder of a right has no rights as a shareholder of the Company.
The rights expire on February 27, 2011.

The Company issued 1.0 million shares and
57.2 million shares of common stock with an aggregate value
of $21.6 million and $1.9 billion in connection with
purchase acquisitions during 2002 and 2001, respectively.

On July 17, 2001, the Company’s Board
of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to
56.4 million shares of the Company’s common stock to
replace shares issued in connection with the acquisition of
NOVA. On December 18, 2001, the Board of Directors approved
an authorization to repurchase an additional 100 million
shares of outstanding common stock throughout 2003. Under these
programs the Company has repurchased 45.3 million and
19.7 million shares of common stock for
$1,040.4 million and $467.9 million in 2002 and 2001,
respectively. The July 17, 2001, authorization has been
effectively completed.

Note 18

Employee Benefits

Retirement Plans

Pension benefits are provided to
substantially all employees based on years of service and
employees’ compensation while employed with the Company.
Employees are fully vested after five years of service. The
Company’s funding policy is to contribute amounts to its
plans sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirements of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, plus such
additional amounts as the Company determines to be appropriate.
During 2002, the Company made a $150 million dollar
contribution to the qualified pension plan, in accordance with
this policy. The actuarial cost method used to compute the
pension liabilities and expense is the projected unit credit
method. Prior to their acquisition dates, employees of certain
acquired companies were covered by separate, noncontributory
pension plans that provided benefits based on years of service
and compensation. Generally, the Company merges plans of
acquired companies into its existing pension plans when
it becomes practicable.

As a result of the Firstar/USBM merger, the
Company maintained two different qualified pension plans, with
three different pension benefit structures during 2001: the
former USBM’s cash balance pension benefit structure, a
final average pay benefit structure for the former Firstar
organization, and a cash balance pension benefit structure
related to the Mercantile acquisition. The two pension plans
were merged as of January 1, 2002 under a new final average
pay benefit structure; however, the benefit structure of the new
plan does not become effective for the Mercantile acquisition
until January 1, 2003. Under the new plan’s benefit
structure, a participant’s future retirement benefits are
based on a participant’s highest five year average annual
compensation during his or her last 10 years before
retirement or termination from the Company. Generally, under the
two previous cash balance pension benefit structures the
participant’s earned retirement benefits based on their
average compensation over their career. Retirement benefits
under the former Firstar benefit structure were earned based on
final average pay and years of service, similar to the new plan.
Plan assets primarily consist of various equity mutual funds and
other miscellaneous assets.

In light of continued deterioration of the equity
market conditions during the second quarter and third quarter of
2002, the company decided to remeasure its pension plan assets
and liabilities effective July 1, 2002, using current,
updated information with respect to the estimated long-term rate
of return on pension assets, the discount rate, participant
census data and other relevant factors.

During 2002, the Company also maintained several
unfunded, nonqualified, supplemental executive retirement
programs that provided additional defined pension benefits for
senior managers and executive employees. Effective
January 1, 2002, substantially all of these programs were
merged into one nonqualified retirement plan. Because the
non-qualified plan was unfunded, the aggregate accumulated
benefit obligation exceeded the assets. A supplemental executive
retirement plan of USBM was frozen for substantially all
participants as of September 30, 2001 but with service
credit running through December 31, 2001. The assumptions
used in computing the present value of the accumulated benefit
obligation, the projected benefit obligation and net pension
expense are substantially consistent with those assumptions used
for the funded qualified plans. The Company has recognized
curtailment gains of $11.7 million in 2002 in connection
with changes to nonqualified pension plans.

Post-Retirement Medical Plans

In addition to providing pension
benefits, the Company provides health care and death benefits to
certain retired employees through several retiree medical
programs. As a result of the Firstar/USBM merger, there were
three major retiree medical programs in place during 2001 with
various terms and subsidy schedules. Effective January 1,
2002, the Company adopted one retiree medical program for all
future retirees. For certain eligible employees, the provisions
of the USBM retiree medical plan and the Mercantile retiree
medical plan will remain in place until December 31, 2002.
Generally, all employees may become eligible for retiree health
care benefits by meeting defined age and service requirements.
The Company may also subsidize the cost of coverage for
employees meeting certain age and service requirements. The
medical plan contains other cost-sharing features such as
deductibles and coinsurance. The estimated cost of these retiree
benefit payments is accrued during the employees’ active
service.

U.S. Bancorp  89


The Company uses a measurement date of
September 30 for its retirement plans. At the measurement
date, plan assets are determined based on the fair value
generally representing observable market prices. The projected
benefit obligation is determined based on the present value of
projected benefit distributions at an assumed
discount rate. Information presented in the four tables
below reflects a measurement date of September 30.

The following table sets forth the components of
net periodic benefit cost for the retirement plans:

The following table summarizes benefit obligation
and plan asset activity for the retirement plans:

The following table sets forth the
weighted-average plan assumptions and other data:

(a)

In connection with the Firstar/USBM merger,
    the asset management practices and investment strategies of the
    plan were conformed. At December 31, 2001, the investment
    asset allocation was weighted toward equities and diversified by
    industry and companies with varying market capitalization
    levels. This allocation is still in place at December 31,
    2002.

(b)

The pre-65 and post-65 rates are assumed
    to decrease gradually to 5.5% and 6.0% respectively by 2011 and
    remain at these levels thereafter.

The Firstar plan had no assets as of
    December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000.

The following table provides information for
pension plans with benefit obligations in excess of plan assets:

Employee Investment Plan

The Company has defined contribution
retirement savings plans which allow qualified employees, at
their option, to make contributions up to certain percentages of
pre-tax base salary through salary deductions under
Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Employee
contributions are invested, at the employees’ direction,
among a variety of investment alternatives. Employee
contributions are 100 percent matched by the Company, up to
the first four percent of an employee’s compensation. The
Company’s matching contribution vests immediately; however,
a participant must be employed on December 31st to receive
that year’s matching contribution. Although the matching
contribution is initially invested in the Company’s common
stock, effective in 2002 an employee will be allowed to reinvest
the matching contributions among various investment
alternatives. Total expense was $59.5 million,
$53.7 million and $53.6 million in 2002, 2001 and
2000, respectively.

Note 19

Stock Options and Compensation Plans

As part of its employee and director compensation
programs, the Company may grant certain stock awards under the
provisions of the existing stock option and compensation plans.
The Company has stock options outstanding under various plans at
December 31, 2002, including plans assumed in acquisitions.
The plans provide for grants of options to purchase shares of
common stock generally at the stock’s fair market value at
the date of grant. In addition, the plans provide for grants of
shares of common stock which are subject to restriction on
transfer and to forfeiture if certain vesting requirements are
not met.

With respect to stock option and stock
compensation plans, the Company has elected to follow
APB 25 in accounting for its employee stock incentive and
purchase plans. Under APB 25, because the exercise price of
the Company’s employee stock options equals the market
price of the underlying stock on the date of grant, no
compensation expense is recognized. On the date exercised, if
new shares are issued, the option proceeds equal to the par
value of the shares are credited to common stock and additional
proceeds are credited to capital surplus. If treasury shares are
issued, the option proceeds equal to the average treasury share
price are credited to treasury stock and additional proceeds are
credited to capital surplus.

Option grants are generally exercisable up to ten
years from the date of grant and vest over three to five years.
Restricted shares vest over three to seven years. Compensation
expense for restricted stock is based on the market price of the
Company stock at the time of the grant and amortized on a
straight-line basis over the vesting

U.S. Bancorp  91


period. Compensation expense related to the
restricted stock was $18.7 million, $71.9 million and
$43.4 million in 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively.

Stock incentive plans of acquired companies are
generally terminated at the merger closing dates. Option holders
under such plans receive the Company’s common stock, or
options to buy the Company’s stock, based on the conversion
terms of the various merger agreements. The historical option
information presented below has been restated to reflect the
options originally granted under acquired companies’ plans.

At December 31, 2002, there were
36.4 million shares (subject to adjustment for forfeitures)
available for grant under various plans.

The following is a summary of stock options
outstanding and exercised under various stock options plans of
the Company:

Additional information regarding options
outstanding as of December 31, 2002, is as follows:

Pro forma information regarding net
income and earnings per share is required under Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard No. 123
(“SFAS 123”), “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation” and has been determined as if the Company
accounted for its employee stock option plans under the fair
value method of SFAS 123. The fair value of options was
estimated at the grant date using a Black-Scholes option pricing
model. Option valuation models require use of highly subjective
assumptions. Also, employee stock options have characteristics
that are significantly different from those of traded options,
including vesting provisions and trading limitations that impact
their liquidity. Because employee stock options have differing
characteristics and changes in the subjective input assumptions
can materially affect the fair value estimate, the Black-Scholes
valuation model does not necessarily provide a reliable measure
of the fair value of employee stock options.

The pro forma disclosures include options granted
through December 31, 2002, and are not likely to be

expense, net income and earnings per share adjusted for the
impact of following SFAS 123 for stock-based compensation.

The Company has established a valuation allowance
to offset deferred tax assets related to state net operating
loss carryforwards of approximately $553 million, which expire
at various times through 2016.

Certain events covered by Internal Revenue Code
section 593(e), which was not repealed, will trigger a
recapture of base year reserves of acquired thrift institutions.
The base year reserves of acquired thrift institutions would be
recaptured if an entity ceases to

qualify as a bank for federal income tax
purposes. The base year reserves of thrift institutions also
remain subject to income tax penalty provisions that, in
general, require recapture upon certain stock redemptions of,
and excess distributions to, stockholders. At December 31,
2002, retained earnings included approximately
$101.8 million of base year reserves for which no deferred
federal income tax liability has been recognized.

Derivative Instruments

In the ordinary course of business, the Company
enters into derivative transactions to manage its interest rate
and prepayment risk and to accommodate the business requirements
of its customers. The Company does not enter into derivative
transactions for speculative purposes. Refer to Note 1
“Significant Accounting Policies” in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the
Company’s accounting policies for derivative instruments.

Consolidated Financial Statements.

ASSET AND LIABILITY MANAGEMENT
POSITIONS

Cash Flow Hedges

The
Company has $15.9 billion of designated cash flow hedges at
December 31, 2002. These derivatives are interest rate
swaps that are hedges of the forecasted cash flows from the
underlying variable-rate LIBOR loans and floating-rate debt. All
cash flow hedges are highly effective for the year ended
December 31, 2002, and the change in fair value attributed
to hedge ineffectiveness was not material.

At December 31, 2002 and 2001, accumulated other
comprehensive income included a deferred after-tax net gain of
$309.9 million and $98.3 million, respectively,
related to derivatives used to hedge cash flows. The unrealized
gain will be reflected in earnings when the related cash flows
or hedged transactions occur and will offset the related
performance of the hedged items. The occurrence of these related
cash flows and hedged transactions remains probable. The
estimated amount of after-tax gain to be reclassified from
accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings during 2003
is $61.0 million, which includes gains related to hedges
that were terminated early when the forecasted transactions are
still probable.

Fair Value Hedges

The Company has $12.3 billion of
designated fair value hedges at December 31, 2002. These
derivatives are primarily interest rate contracts that hedge the
change in fair value related to interest rate changes of
underlying fixed-rate debt, trust preferred stock, and deposit
obligations. In addition, the Company uses forward commitments
to sell residential mortgages loans to hedge its interest rate
risk related to residential mortgage loans held for sale. The
Company commits to sell the loans at specified prices in a
future period, typically within 90 days. The Company is
exposed to interest rate risk during the period between issuing
a loan commitment and the sale of the loan into the secondary
market.

All fair value hedges are considered highly
effective for the year ended December 31, 2002. The change
in fair value attributed to hedge ineffectiveness was a gain of
$39.4 million related to the Company’s mortgage loans
held for sale and its 2002 production volume of
$23.2 billion.

Other Asset and Liability Management
Derivative Positions

The Company has
derivative positions that are used for interest rate risk and
other risk management purposes but are not designated as cash
flow hedges or fair value hedges in accordance with the
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedge Activities.” At December 31, 2002, the Company
had $3.0 billion forward commitments to sell residential
mortgage loans to hedge the Company’s interest rate risk
related to $2.9 billion of unfunded residential mortgage
loan commitments. Gains and losses on mortgage banking
derivatives and the unfunded loan commitments are included in
mortgage banking revenue on the income statement.

CUSTOMER-RELATED POSITIONS

The Company acts as a seller and buyer of
interest rate contracts and foreign exchange rate contracts on
behalf of customers. At December 31, 2002, the Company had
$15.9 billion of aggregate customer derivative positions,
including $8.9 billion of interest rate swaps, caps and
floors and $7.0 billion of foreign exchange rate contracts.
The Company minimizes its market and liquidity risks by taking
substantially similar offsetting positions. Gains or losses on
customer-related transactions were not significant for the year
ended December 31, 2002.

Note 22

Fair Values of Financial Instruments

Due to the nature of its business and its
customers’ needs, the Company offers a large number of
financial instruments, most of which are not actively traded.
When market quotes are unavailable, valuation techniques
including discounted cash flow calculations and pricing models
or services are used. The Company also uses various aggregation
methods and assumptions, such as the discount rate and cash flow
timing and amounts. As a result, the fair value estimates can
neither be substantiated by independent market comparisons, nor
realized by the immediate sale or settlement of the financial
instrument. Also, the estimates reflect a point in time and
could change significantly based on changes in economic factors,
such as interest rates. Furthermore, the disclosure of certain
financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities are not
required. Finally, the fair value disclosure is not intended to
estimate a market value of the Company as a whole. A summary of
the Company’s valuation techniques and assumptions follows.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The carrying value of cash, amounts
due from banks, federal funds sold and securities purchased
under resale agreements was assumed to approximate fair value.

Securities

Generally, trading securities and
investment securities were valued using available market quotes.
In some instances, for securities that are not widely traded,
market quotes for comparable securities were used.

Loans

The loan
portfolio consists of both floating and fixed-rate loans, the
fair value of which was estimated using discounted cash flow
analyses and other valuation techniques. To calculate discounted
cash flows, the loans were aggregated into pools of similar
types and expected repayment terms. The expected cash flows of
loans considered historical prepayment experiences and estimated
credit losses for nonperforming loans and were discounted using
current rates offered to borrowers of similar
credit characteristics.

Deposit Liabilities

The fair value of demand deposits,
savings accounts and certain money market deposits is equal to
the amount payable on demand at year-end. The fair value of
fixed-rate certificates of deposit was estimated by discounting
the contractual cash flow using the discount rates implied by
the high-grade corporate bond yield curve.

Short-term Borrowings

Federal funds purchased, securities
sold under agreements to repurchase and other short-term funds
borrowed are at floating rates or have short-term maturities.
Their carrying value is assumed to approximate their fair value.

Long-term Debt and Company-obligated
Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Securities of Subsidiary Trusts
Holding Solely the Junior Subordinated Debentures of the Parent
Company

The estimated fair value of
medium-term notes, bank notes, Federal Home Loan Bank advances,
capital lease obligations and mortgage note obligations
estimated fair value was determined using a discounted cash flow
analysis based on current market rates of similar maturity debt
securities to discount cash flows. Other long-term debt
instruments and company-obligated mandatorily redeemable
preferred securities of subsidiary trusts holding solely the
junior subordinated debentures of the parent company were valued
using available market quotes.

Interest Rate Swaps, Basis Swaps and Options

The interest rate options and swap
cash flows were estimated using a third-party pricing model and
discounted based on appropriate LIBOR, eurodollar futures, swap
and treasury note yield curves.

Loan Commitments, Letters of Credit and
Guarantees

The fair value of
commitments, letters of credit and guarantees represents the
estimated costs to terminate or otherwise settle the obligations
with a third-party. Residential mortgage commitments are
actively traded and the fair value is estimated using available
market quotes. Other loan commitments, letters of credit and
guarantees are not actively traded. Substantially all of these
commitments have floating rates and do not expose the Company to
interest rate risk assuming no premium or discount was ascribed
to loan commitments because funding could occur at market rates.
The Company estimates the fair value of loan commitments,
letters of credit and guarantees based on the related amount of
unamortized deferred commitment fees adjusted for the probable
losses for these arrangements.

96 U.S. Bancorp


The estimated fair values of the Company’s
financial instruments at December 31 are shown in the table
below.

The fair value of unfunded commitments, standby
letters of credit and other guarantees is approximately equal to
their carrying value. The carrying value of unfunded commitments
and standby letters of credit is $240 million. The carrying
value of other guarantees is $162 million.

Note 23

Commitments and Contingent Liabilities

COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT

Commitments to extend credit are legally binding
and generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination
clauses. The contractual amount represents the Company’s
exposure to credit loss, in the event of default by the
borrower. The Company manages this credit risk by using the same
credit policies it applies to loans. Collateral is obtained to
secure commitments based on management’s credit assessment
of the borrower. The collateral may include marketable
securities, receivables, inventory, equipment and real estate.
Since the Company expects many of the commitments to expire
without being drawn, total commitment amounts do not necessarily
represent the Company’s future liquidity requirements. In
addition, the commitments include consumer credit lines that are
cancelable upon notification to the consumer.

LETTERS OF CREDIT

Standby letters of credit are conditional
commitments the Company issues to guarantee the performance of a
customer to a third-party. The guarantees frequently support
public and private borrowing arrangements, including commercial
paper issuances, bond financings and other similar transactions.
The Company issues commercial letters of credit on behalf of
customers to ensure payment or collection in connection with
trade transactions. In the event of a customer’s
nonperformance, the Company’s credit loss exposure is the
same as in any extension of credit, up to the letter’s
contractual amount. Management assesses the borrower’s
credit to determine the necessary collateral, which may include
marketable securities, real estate, accounts receivable and
inventory. Since the conditions requiring the Company to fund
letters of credit may not occur, the Company expects its
liquidity requirements to be less than the total outstanding

U.S. Bancorp  97


commitments. The maximum potential future
payments guaranteed by the Company under standby letter of
credit arrangements at December 31, 2002, is approximately
$9.1 billion with a weighted average term of approximately
25 months.

The contract or notional amounts of commitments
to extend credit and letters of credit at December 31,
2002, were as follows:

LEASE COMMITMENTS

Rental expense for operating leases amounted to
$148.0 million in 2002, $165.2 million in 2001 and
$219.3 million in 2000. Future minimum payments, net of
sublease rentals, under capitalized leases and noncancelable
operating leases with initial or remaining terms of one year or
more, consisted of the following at December 31, 2002:

GUARANTEES

Guarantees are contingent commitments issued by
the Company to customers or other third parties. The
Company’s guarantees primarily include parent guarantees
related to subsidiaries’ third-party borrowing
arrangements; third-party performance guarantees inherent in the
Company’s business operations such as indemnified
securities lending programs and merchant charge-backs
guarantees; indemnification or buy-back provisions related to
certain asset sales; synthetic lease guarantees; and contingent
consideration arrangements related to acquisitions. For certain
guarantees, the Company has recorded a liability related to the
potential obligation, or has access to collateral to support the
guarantee or through the exercise of other recourse provisions
can offset some or all of the maximum potential future payments
made under these guarantees.

Third-Party Borrowing Arrangements

The Company provides guarantees to
third parties as a part of certain subsidiaries’ borrowing
arrangements, primarily representing guaranteed operating or
capital lease payments or other debt obligations with maturity
dates extending through 2014. The maximum potential future
payments guaranteed by the Company under these arrangements is
approximately $1.5 billion at December 31, 2002. The
Company’s recorded liabilities as of December 31, 2002
include $32.4 million representing outstanding amounts owed
to these third parties and required to be recorded on balance
sheet in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. The guaranteed operating lease payments are also
included in the disclosed minimum lease obligations.

Commitments from Securities Lending

The Company participates in securities
lending activities by acting as the customer’s agent
involving the loan or sale of securities. The Company
indemnifies customers for the difference between the market
value of the securities lent and the market value of the
collateral received. Cash collateralizes these transactions. The
maximum potential future payments guaranteed by the Company
under these arrangements is approximately $9.7 billion at
December 31, 2002, and represents the market value of the
securities lent to third parties. At December 31, 2002, the
Company held assets with a market value of $10.0 billion as
collateral for these arrangements.

Asset Sales

The
Company has provided guarantees to certain third parties in
connection with the sale of certain assets, primarily loan
portfolios and low income housing tax credits. These guarantees
are generally in the form of asset buy-back or make-whole
provisions that are triggered upon a credit event or a change in
the tax-qualifying status of the related projects, as
applicable, and remain in effect until the loans are collected
or final tax credits are realized, respectively. The maximum
potential future payments guaranteed by the Company under these
arrangements is

98 U.S. Bancorp


approximately $1.4 billion at
December 31, 2002 and represents the total proceeds
received from the buyer in these transactions where the buy-back
or make-whole provisions have not yet expired. Recourse
available to the Company includes guarantees from the Small
Business Administration (for SBA loans sold), recourse to the
correspondent that originated the loan or to the private
mortgage issuer, the right to collect payments from the debtors,
and/or the right to liquidate the underlying collateral, if any,
and retain the proceeds. Based on its established loan-to-value
guidelines, the Company believes the recourse available is
sufficient to recover future payments, if any, under the loan
buy back guarantees.

Synthetic Leases

Certain of the Company’s
operating lease arrangements involve third party lessors that
acquire business assets through leveraged financing structures
commonly referred to as “synthetic leases.” The
Company provides guarantees to the lender in the event of
default by the leveraged financing structures or in the event
that the Company does not exercise its option to purchase the
property at the end of the lease term and the fair value of the
assets is less than the purchase price. The maximum potential
future payments guaranteed by the Company under these
arrangements was approximately $403.0 million at
December 31, 2002. Based on the estimated fair value of
assets held by the structures, the liability for this guarantee
was not significant at December 31, 2002. The minimum lease
payments under these operating leases are included in the
Company’s disclosure of minimum lease payment obligations.

Merchant Processing

The Company, through its subsidiary
NOVA Information Systems, Inc., provides merchant processing
services. Under the rules of credit card associations, a
merchant processor retains a contingent liability for credit
card transactions processed. This contingent liability arises in
the event of a billing dispute between the merchant and a
cardholder that is ultimately resolved in the cardholder’s
favor. In this situation, the transaction is “charged
back” to the merchant and the disputed amount is credited
or otherwise refunded to the cardholder. If the Company is
unable to collect this amount from the merchant, it bears the
loss for the amount of the refund paid to the cardholder.

A cardholder, through its issuing bank, generally
has until the later of up to four months after the date the
transaction is processed or the receipt of the product or
service to present a chargeback to the Company as the merchant
processor. The absolute maximum potential liability is estimated
to be the total volume of credit card transactions that meet the
associations’ requirements to be valid chargeback
transactions at any given time. Management estimates that the
maximum potential exposure for chargebacks would approximate the
total amount of merchant transactions processed through the
credit card associations for the last four months. For the last
four months of 2002, this amount totaled approximately
$34.2 billion. In most cases, this contingent liability is
unlikely to arise, as most products and services are delivered
when purchased and amounts are refunded when items are returned
to merchants. However, where the product or service is not
provided until a future date (“future delivery”), the
potential for this contingent liability increases. To mitigate
this risk, the Company may require the merchant to make an
escrow deposit, may place maximum volume limitations on future
delivery transactions processed by the merchant at any point in
time, or may require various credit policy enhancements
(including letters of credit and bank guarantees). Also,
merchant processing contracts may include event triggers to
provide the Company more financial and operational control in
the event of financial deterioration of the merchant. At
December 31, 2002, the Company held as collateral
$24.3 million of merchant escrow deposits.

The Company currently processes card transactions
for several of the largest airlines in the United States. In the
event of liquidation of these airlines, the Company could become
financially liable for refunding tickets purchased through the
credit card associations under the chargeback provisions.
Chargeback risk related to an airline is evaluated in a manner
similar to credit risk assessments and merchant processing
contracts consider the potential risk of default. At
December 31, 2002, the value of future delivery airline
tickets purchased was approximately $1.0 billion and the
Company held collateral of $144.3 million in escrow
deposits and lines of credit related to airline customer
transactions.

In the normal course of business, the Company has
unresolved chargebacks that are in process of resolution. The
Company assesses the likelihood of its potential liability based
on the extent and nature of unresolved chargebacks and its
historical experience loss experience. At December 31,
2002, the Company recorded a liability for potential losses of
$16.0 million.

Contingent Consideration Arrangements

The Company has contingent payment
obligations related to certain business combination
transactions. Payments are guaranteed as long as certain
post-acquisition performance-based criteria are met. At
December 31, 2002, the maximum potential future payments
guaranteed by the Company under these arrangements is
approximately $78.7 million and primarily represents
contingent payments related to the acquisition of the Corporate
Trust business of State Street Bank on December 31, 2002
and are payable within 12 to 18 months.

U.S. Bancorp  99


Other Guarantees

The
Company provides liquidity and credit enhancement facilities to
two Company-sponsored conduits, as more fully described in
Note 9 — Accounting for Transfers and Servicing
of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities. Although
management believes a draw against these facilities is remote,
the maximum potential future payments guaranteed by the Company
under these arrangements is approximately $13.7 billion.
The recorded fair value of the Company’s liability for the
credit enhancement recourse obligation and liquidity facilities
was $56.1 million at December 31, 2002 and is included
in other liabilities.

The Company guarantees payments to certain
certificate holders of Company-sponsored investment trusts with
varying termination dates extending through September 1,
2004. The maximum potential future payments guaranteed by the
Company under these arrangements is approximately
$61.1 million. The Company has a recorded liability of
$56.0 million at December 31, 2002, holds
$17.3 million in cash collateral and has other contractual
sources of recourse available to it including guarantees from
third parties and the underlying assets held by the investment
trusts.

OTHER CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

In connection with the industry-wide
investigations of research analyst independence issues, the
Company’s brokerage and investment banking business line
recognized a $50.0 million litigation charge in 2002 which
included a settlement with certain governmental and regulatory
agencies of $25.0 million for investment banking regulatory
matters and $7.5 million for funding independent analyst
research for its customers.

The Company is subject to various other
litigation, investigations and legal and administrative cases
and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of its
businesses. Due to their complex nature, it may be years before
some matters are resolved. While it is impossible to ascertain
the ultimate resolution or range of financial liability with
respect to these contingent matters, the Company believes that
the aggregate amount of such liabilities, will not have a
material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of
operations or cash flows of the Company.

Condensed Statement of Cash Flows

Transfer of funds (dividends, loans or advances)
from bank subsidiaries to the Company is restricted. Federal law
prohibits loans unless they are secured and generally limits any
loan to the Company or individual affiliate to 10 percent
of the bank’s equity. In aggregate, loans to the Company
and all affiliates cannot exceed 20 percent of the
bank’s equity.

Dividend payments to the Company by its
subsidiary banks are subject to regulatory review and statutory
limitations and, in some instances, regulatory approval. The
approval of the Comptroller of the Currency is required if total
dividends by a national bank in any calendar year exceed the
bank’s net income for that year combined with its retained
net income for the preceding two calendar years or if the
bank’s retained earnings are less than zero. Furthermore,
dividends are restricted by the Comptroller of the
Currency’s minimum capital constraints for all national
banks. Within these guidelines, all bank subsidiaries have the
ability to pay dividends without prior regulatory approval. The
amount of dividends available to the parent company from the
bank subsidiaries at December 31, 2002, was approximately
$614 million.

General Business Description

U.S. Bancorp is a multi-state
financial services holding company headquartered in Minneapolis,
Minnesota and was created by the acquisition by Firstar
Corporation of the former U.S. Bancorp of Minneapolis,
Minnesota. The merger was completed on February 27, 2001,
and the combined company retained the U.S. Bancorp name.
U.S. Bancorp was incorporated in Delaware in 1929 and
operates as a financial holding company and a bank holding
company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956.
U.S. Bancorp provides a full range of financial services,
including lending and depository services, cash management,
foreign exchange and trust and investment management services.
It also engages in credit card services, merchant and automated
teller machine (“ATM”) processing, mortgage banking,
insurance, brokerage, leasing and investment banking.

U.S. Bancorp’s banking subsidiaries are
engaged in the general banking business, principally in domestic
markets. The subsidiaries range in size from $376 million
to $122 billion in deposits and provide a wide range of
products and services to individuals, businesses, institutional
organizations, governmental entities and other financial
institutions. Commercial and consumer lending services are
principally offered to customers within the Company’s
domestic markets, to domestic customers with foreign operations
and within certain niche national venues. Lending services
include traditional credit products as well as credit card
services, financing and import/export trade, asset-backed
lending, agricultural finance and other products. Leasing
products are offered through non-bank subsidiaries. Depository
services include checking accounts, savings accounts and time
certificate contracts. Ancillary services such as foreign
exchange, treasury management and receivable lock-box collection
are provided to corporate customers. U.S. Bancorp’s
bank and trust subsidiaries provide a full range of fiduciary
services for individuals, estates, foundations, business
corporations and charitable organizations.

Banking and investment services are provided
through a network of 2,142 banking offices principally operating
in 24 states in the Midwest and West. The Company operates
a network of 4,604 branded ATMs and provides 24-hour, seven
days-a-week telephone customer service. Mortgage banking
services are provided through banking offices and loan
production offices throughout the Company’s markets.

The Company is one of the largest providers of
Visa® corporate and purchasing card services and corporate
trust services in the United States. Its wholly owned subsidiary
NOVA Information Systems, Inc. provides merchant processing
services directly to merchants and through a network of banking
affiliations.

U.S. Bancorp’s other non-banking
subsidiaries offer a variety of products and services to the
Company’s customers. Its wholly owned subsidiary
U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray Inc. engages in equity and fixed
income trading activities and offers investment banking and
underwriting services to corporate and public sector customers.
This non-bank subsidiary also provides brokerage products,
including securities, mutual funds and annuities, and insurance
products to consumers and regionally based businesses through a
network of 109 brokerage offices.

On a full-time equivalent basis, employment
during 2002 averaged a total of 51,673 employees.

Competition

The
commercial banking business is highly competitive. Subsidiary
banks compete with other commercial banks and with other
financial institutions, including savings and loan associations,
mutual savings banks, finance companies, mortgage banking
companies, credit unions and investment companies. In recent
years, competition has increased from institutions not subject
to the same regulatory restrictions as domestic banks and bank
holding companies.

Government Policies

The operations of the Company’s
various operating units are affected by state and federal
legislative changes and by policies of various regulatory
authorities, including those of the numerous states in which
they operate, the United States and foreign governments. These
policies include, for example, statutory maximum legal lending
rates, domestic monetary policies of the Board of Governors of
the Federal Reserve System, United States fiscal policy,
international currency regulations and monetary policies, U.S.
Patriot Act and capital adequacy and liquidity constraints
imposed by bank regulatory agencies.

Supervision and Regulation

As a registered bank holding company
and financial holding company under the Bank Holding Company
Act, as amended by the Graham-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999,
U.S. Bancorp is subject to the supervision of, and
regulation by, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System.

Under the Bank Holding Company Act, a financial
holding company may engage in banking, managing or controlling
banks, furnishing or performing services for banks it controls,
and conducting other financial activities. U.S. Bancorp
must obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board
before acquiring more than 5 percent of the outstanding shares
of another bank or bank holding company, and must provide notice
to, and in some situations obtain the prior approval of, the
Federal Reserve Board in connection with engaging in, or
acquiring more than 5 percent of the outstanding shares of
a company engaged in, a new financial activity.

Under the Bank Holding Company Act, as amended by
the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act
of 1994, U.S. Bancorp may acquire banks throughout

U.S. Bancorp  111


the United States, subject only to state or
federal deposit caps and state minimum age requirements.

National banks are subject to the supervision of,
and are examined by, the Comptroller of the Currency. All
subsidiary banks of the Company are members of the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation and are subject to examination by
the FDIC. In practice, the primary federal regulator makes
regular examinations of each subsidiary bank subject to its
regulatory review or participates in joint examinations with
other federal regulators. Areas subject to regulation by federal
authorities include the allowance for credit losses,
investments, loans, mergers, issuance of securities, payment of
dividends, establishment of branches and other aspects of
operations.

Properties

U.S. Bancorp and its significant
subsidiaries occupy headquarter offices under a long-term lease
in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The Company also leases seven
freestanding operations centers in St. Paul, Portland,
Milwaukee and Denver. The Company owns five principal operations
centers in Cincinnati, St. Louis, Fargo and Milwaukee. At
December 31, 2002, the Company’s subsidiaries owned
and operated a total of 1,385 facilities and leased an
additional 1,478 facilities, all of which are well maintained.
The Company believes its current facilities are adequate to meet
its needs. Additional information with respect to premises and
equipment is presented in Notes 10 and 23 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Equity Compensation Plan Information

The following table summarizes
information regarding equity compensation plans in effect as of
December 31, 2002.

(a)

    Executive Stock Incentive Plan and the U.S. Bancorp 1991
    Executive Stock Incentive Plan. Excludes 87,093,223 shares
    underlying outstanding stock options and warrants assumed by
    U.S. Bancorp in connection with acquisitions by U.S. Bancorp. Of
    the excluded shares, 73,117,792 underlie stock options granted
    under equity compensation plans of the former U.S. Bancorp that
    were approved by the shareholders of the former U.S.
    Bancorp.

(b)

All of the identified shares underlie stock
    options granted to a broad-based employee population pursuant to
    the U.S. Bancorp 2001 Employee Stock Incentive plan, the Firstar
    Corporation 1999 Employee Stock Incentive Plan, the Firstar
    Corporation 1998 Employee Stock Incentive Plan, the Star Banc
    Corporation 1996 Starshare Stock Incentive Plan for Employees
    and the Star Banc Corporation Starshare 1993 Stock Option Plan
    for Employees. Under the terms of the Starshare 1993 Stock
    Option Plan for Employees, any options outstanding under that
    plan as of January 28, 2003 terminated on that date, and no
    future options will be granted under that plan.

(c)

No shares are available for the granting of
    future awards under the U.S. Bancorp 1998 Executive Stock
    Incentive Plan or the U.S. Bancorp 1991 Executive Stock
    Incentive plan. The 36,441,843 shares available under the U.S.
    Bancorp 2001 Stock Incentive Plan may become the subject of
    future awards in the form of stock options, stock appreciation
    rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance
    awards or other stock-based awards, except that only 8,746,029
    of these shares are available for future grants of awards other
    than stock options or stock appreciation rights.

Under the U.S. Bancorp 2001 Employee Stock
Incentive Plan (“2001 Plan”), 11,600,000 shares have
been authorized for issuance pursuant to the grant of
nonqualified stock options to any full-time or part-time
employee actively employed by U.S. Bancorp on the grant date,
other than individuals eligible to participate in any of the
Company’s executive stock incentive plans or in U.S.
Bancorp Piper Jaffray Inc.’s annual option plan. As of
December 31, 2002, options to purchase an aggregate of
8,054,500 were outstanding under the plan. All options under the
plan were granted on February 27, 2001.

As of December 31, 2002, options to purchase
an aggregate of 3,250,230 shares of the Company’s common
stock were outstanding under the Firstar Corporation 1999
Employee Stock Incentive Plan (“1999 Plan”). Under
this plan, stock options were granted to each full-time or
part-time employee actively employed by Firstar Corporation on
the grant date, other than managers who participated in an
executive stock incentive plan.

As of December 31, 2002, options to purchase
an aggregate of 4,377,150 shares of the Company’s common
stock were outstanding under the Firstar Corporation 1998
Employee Stock Incentive Plan (“1998 Plan”). Under
this plan, stock options were granted to each full-time or
part-time employee actively employed by Firstar Corporation on
the grant date, other than managers who participated in an
executive stock incentive plan.

As of December 31, 2002, options to purchase
an aggregate of 601,086 shares of the Company’s common
stock were outstanding under the Star Banc Corporation 1996
Starshare Stock Incentive Plan for Employees (“1996
Plan”). Under the plan, stock options were granted to each
employee of Star Banc Corporation, a predecessor company, other
than managers who participated in an executive stock incentive
plan.

No future options will be granted under any of
these plans. Under all of the plans, the exercise price of the
options equals the fair market value of the underlying common
stock on the grant date. All options granted under

112 U.S. Bancorp


the plan have a term of 10 years from the
grant date and become exercisable over a period of time set
forth in the plan or determined by the committee administering
the plan. Options granted under the plan are nontransferable
and, during the optionee’s lifetime, are exercisable only
by the optionee.

If an optionee is terminated as a result of his
or her gross misconduct or offense, all options terminate
immediately, whether or not vested. Under the 2001 Plan, the
1999 Plan and the 1998 Plan, in the event an optionee is
terminated immediately following a change in control (as defined
in the plans) of U.S. Bancorp, and the termination is due to
business needs resulting from the change in control and not as a
result of the optionee’s performance or conduct, all of the
optionee’s outstanding options will become immediately
vested and exercisable as of the date of such termination. Under
the 1996 Plan, all outstanding options vest and become
exercisable immediately following a change in control.

If the outstanding shares of common stock of
U.S. Bancorp are changed into or exchanged for a different
number or kind of shares of stock or other securities as a
result of a reorganization, recapitalization, stock dividend,
stock split, combination of shares, reclassification, merger,
consolidation or similar event, the number of shares underlying
outstanding options also may be adjusted. The plans may be
terminated, amended or modified by the Board of Directors at any
time.

Change in Certifying Accountants

In response to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
of 2002, the Audit Committee determined on November 8,
2002, to segregate the internal and external auditing functions
performed for U.S. Bancorp in fiscal year 2002 by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and appointed Ernst & Young
LLP to become the Company’s external auditors following the
filing of the Company’s 2002 Annual Report on
Form 10-K during the first quarter of 2003.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP completed the audit of the
Company’s financial statements for the year ended
December 31, 2002, and will continue to provide internal
audit services under the direction of the Company’s
internal audit team.

No report of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP on the
financial statements of U.S. Bancorp for the past two fiscal
years contained an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion,
or was qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or
accounting principles. During the Company’s two most recent
fiscal years, there were no disagreements with
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP on any matter of accounting
principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or
auditing scope or procedure which, if not resolved to the
satisfaction of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, would have caused it
to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in
connection with its reports on the financial statements for such
years. U.S. Bancorp believes that during the most two
recent fiscal years, there were no “reportable
events,” as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of
Regulation S-K of the Securities and Exchange Commission.

During the Company’s two most recent fiscal
years, the Company did not consult with Ernst & Young LLP on
any items regarding the application of accounting principles,
the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the
Company’s financial statements, or the subject matter of a
disagreement or reportable event (as described in Regulation S-K
Item 304(a)(2)).

U.S. Bancorp reported the change in accountants
on Form 8-K on November 14, 2002. The Form 8-K
contained a letter from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, addressed to
the Securities and Exchange Commission, stating that it agreed
with the statements concerning PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP in
such Form 8-K.
