letter to shareholders

the
year 2006 was a year of challenge, change and achievement for u.s. bancorp, and one of
positive results.

FELLOW SHAREHOLDERS:

Achieving record net income

U.S. Bancorp reported record net income for 2006. Net income increased to $4.8 billion, or
$2.61 per diluted common share, compared with $4.5 billion, or $2.42 per diluted common share in
2005. Once again, we achieved industry-leading profitability metrics with a return on average
assets of 2.23 percent and return on average common equity of 23.6 percent.

We are pleased with the financial results, particularly given the challenging economic
environment that our company, and the banking industry as a whole, have faced during this past
year. Although the growth in diluted earnings per common share for 2006 of 7.9 percent was lower
than it has been
in the past few years, we believe the emphasis we have placed on growing our fee-based
businesses, stabilizing net interest margin, maintaining high credit quality and our disciplined
expense control significantly lessened the impact of a disadvantageous yield curve, heightened
competition and excess liquidity that the market offered.

During 2006, U.S. Bancorp continued generating increased earnings from non-interest income,
reducing vulnerability to rate fluctuations, and we continued taking risk out of the portfolio. In
addition, we affirmed U.S. Bank as a leader in corporate trust, with strategic acquisitions of a
number of corporate and institutional trust businesses.

Over the past year, we have become even more convinced that our strategy of investing in
high-value, high-return fee-based businesses is the right one. The revenue stream and the
competitive advantage have been particularly beneficial as the industry has wrestled with the
flattened yield curve. To that end, we acquired additional card portfolios and expanded our
merchant acquiring and processing business in Western Europe and Canada.

Preparing U.S. Bancorp
for future growth

We are excited about the transitioning to a new CEO, and elsewhere on these pages you will
see information regarding U.S. Bancorp succession planning. We have worked closely together since
1993 in building the new U.S. Bancorp, and we intend to continue on the successful path which has
led us to achieving the positive results you’ll read about in this report.

The long-term goals of our company have not changed. Tactics may change as circumstances do, but
the underlying goals and guiding principles remain. Chief among these is our steadfast commitment
to our shareholders. That includes producing a minimum return on average common equity of 20
percent, targeting an 80 percent return of earnings to shareholders and growing earnings per share
by ten percent over the long term.

We are also committed to developing skilled leadership for the future, investing for growth in our
businesses, staying ahead of the ever-advancing technological curve and continuing to expand our
reach. These goals, combined with disciplined financial management and the flexibility and
readiness to seize an opportunity, give us a true sense of confidence in the bright future of this
company.

We want to thank our 50,000 employees who delivered on our promises to customers and whose
performance made possible our positive results. We are particularly proud that

U.S. Banker

magazine
has ranked U.S. Bancorp number one in the nation for its team of women in executive positions at
the company. The “Top Banking Team” award was announced in the October 2006 issue of the magazine.

New board member

In October 2006, we were pleased to welcome Olivia F. Kirtley to the board of directors. Ms.
Kirtley serves on the company’s governance and audit committees. Her extensive experience in those
areas makes her a valuable addition to our board. Ms. Kirtley, a Certified Public Accountant, is a
business consultant on strategic and corporate governance issues and previously served as vice
president of finance and chief financial officer of Vermont American Corporation, a global
manufacturer. Prior to joining Vermont American, she was with the accounting firm of Ernst & Young.

Managing U.S. Bancorp to create

shareholder value

During the fourth quarter of 2006 we announced a 21 percent increase in the dividend rate on
U.S. Bancorp common stock. This increased dividend payout allows our superior, industry-leading
profitability to be transferred to our shareholders, while allowing us the financial flexibility we
need to support balance sheet growth, capital expenditures and small cash acquisitions.

The dividend action continues 35 consecutive years of increasing our dividend. Since 1993, our
dividend has shown a compound annual growth rate of 20.8 percent, ranking number one among our peer
banking companies. U.S. Bancorp has paid a dividend for 144 consecutive years.

We value and appreciate your investment in U.S. Bancorp. From the hiring and development of
talented, dedicated employees to providing outstanding customer service to our strategic direction
and our everyday management, we work to increase the value of your investment in this company. It’s
the reason we come to work each day.

Sincerely,

Richard K. Davis

CEO of U.S. Bancorp. Richard will retain his title of president in addition to his new title of

wholesale banking

continued demand for corporate and commercial loans in 2006, stabilized net interest margin and
exceptional leveraging of cross - sell opportunities position us well .

We believe that key indicators in the commercial sector are positive; however, challenges of
competitive credit and deposit pricing continued. The credit profile of our company remains
excellent as we maintain our disciplined underwriting standards and focus on quality loans. Loans
in the Wholesale Banking business line grew five percent in 2006. Although we may experience some
increase in charge-offs in coming quarters, they should remain manageable. If interest rates hold
steady, we would expect to see continued loan growth and profitability.

During the year, we took a number of actions to further strengthen our commercial and corporate
banking industry position. We added new expertise at the senior levels in Corporate Banking and
Commercial Real Estate and in our food and agribusiness specialized lending division. We opened new
Commercial Real Estate offices in Atlanta, Boston, Houston and Philadelphia, bringing our number of
CRE offices to 31 across the country, and opened a new foreign exchange office in Los Angeles,
joining those already in Milwaukee, Minneapolis, Portland, St. Louis and Seattle. We launched a
number of new products and expanded several existing services to provide customer efficiency, fraud
protection, treasury management, and market entry into electronic records management.

federal, state, city, county, special districts and authorities for more than a century and
currently has more than 5,000 government relationships across the country.

payment services

this growing business is a strong driver of non - interest income and plays a crucial part in our
plans for the future. our expertise, strategic expansion and superlative processing capabilities
are commanding competitive advantages.

Our Payment Services line of business is a primary contributor to our growing percentage of
fee-based income and contributes nearly a quarter of our total revenue. In a challenging rate
environment such as we have seen in 2006, our fee-based revenue is a bold illustration of the
benefits of a diversified business mix. U.S. Bancorp has the skill, scale and infrastructure to
make the most of its payment and processing services.

We have invested heavily in the technology to support our delivery systems and our expansion of
Payment Services. Payment Services is supported through a rich portfolio of products and processing
solutions; retail payment solutions for debit, credit and gift cards; ATM processing and servicing;
and specialized programs for financial institutions, the U.S. government, and hospitality and
healthcare providers.

Payment Services is a business based on economies of scale, and we have been an active acquirer in
this area, making 30 strategic payments business acquisitions since the year 2000. Each has been a
purposeful expansion of distribution or product enhancement, and each added to scale and
efficiency, solidifying our leadership position in the industry. NOVA Information Systems, Inc., a
subsidiary of U.S. Bancorp, is the nation’s third-largest payments processor. U.S. Bank is the
processor for over 10 percent of all ATMs in the United States.

GROWING SHARE AND SCALE

U.S. Bancorp invests heavily in technology, new products and distribution channels to support the
development and delivery of our services to customers. We also invest in the acquisition of
high-value, high-return businesses that will increase performance, revenue and earnings. This is
especially true in our Corporate and Institutional Trust businesses, where recent business
acquisitions have solidified our leadership position, diversified our geographic presence and
increased market share and scale.

In 2006, we continued these strategic acquisitions, enhancing our Corporate Trust and Institutional
Trust and Custody capabilities through acquisitions from Wachovia, SunTrust and LaSalle Bank, the
United States subsidiary of ABN AMRO Bank N.V. These acquisitions complement our existing
businesses, and are following the same successful integration and customer retention paths as our
12 previous similar acquisitions over the past few years.

U.S. Bank is now the number one ABF/MBS/CDO trustee in the nation, number two for new tax-exempt

consumer banking

our
continued investment in convenience, customer service and accessibility helps make u.s. bank the
bank of choice among consumers. in 2006, we made two small but high - value acquisitions and
launched “power banking.”

In 2006 we made two strategic acquisitions that expanded our market share in the western part of
our franchise - purchasing 23 new branch locations in western Colorado and Denver and doubling our
branch presence in Montana. Together, these transactions expand U.S. Bank’s distribution in rapidly
growing and demographically attractive markets in western Colorado, add to our base in Denver and
boost our Montana franchise significantly.

Reaching a major milestone, we opened our 500th in-store banking office in November. We operate the
third-largest in-store branch network in the nation, and our in-store business model has been very
successful for us, our customers and our retail partners.

We introduced an innovative online tool for U.S. branch bankers to design custom solutions for our
customers. “My Choice Banking,” currently offered at more than 400 branches, allows customers to
make the most advantageous banking choices in the context of their total financial picture,
addressing both current and future needs.

In Small Business Banking, we increased SBA loan total by 38 percent in 2006, according to the
Small Business Administration (SBA), providing 4,703 SBA guaranteed loans to small businesses, a
U.S. Bank record. U.S. Bank ranks second among SBA bank lenders in loan dollar volume.

FORTIFYING POSITIONS OF STRENGTH

U.S. Bank inaugurated its “power bank” sales and customer service initiative in the St. Louis
market in 2006 with plans to roll it out to other key markets over the next several years. The
initiative is designed to solidify our leadership position in markets where U.S. Bank is dominant,
protecting market share. Key elements of the initiative are more aggressive marketing, extended
branch hours, heavier branch staffing, and customer amenities, including children’s entertainment
areas, coin counters and more.

We have seen good results from the St. Louis launch, and we anticipate the same increased traffic,
account opening and elevated customer satisfaction scores in the other targeted markets as well.
It’s another way we are investing in our Consumer Banking business and enhancing the customer
experience at U.S. Bank.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis

OVERVIEW

In 2006, U.S. Bancorp and its subsidiaries (the
“Company”) demonstrated its financial strength and
shareholder focus despite a particularly challenging economic
environment for the banking industry. While credit quality
within the industry continued to be relatively strong, the flat
yield curve throughout most of the year, excess liquidity in the
markets and competitiveness for credit relationships have
created significant pressures on net interest margins for most
banks. The Company achieved record earnings in 2006 and grew
earnings per common share, on a diluted basis, by
7.9 percent through its focus on organic growth, investing
in business initiatives that strengthen its presence and product
offerings for customers, and acquiring fee-based businesses with
operating scale. This strategic focus over the past several
years has created a well diversified business generating strong
fee-based revenues that represented over 50 percent of
total net revenue in 2006. As a result, the Company’s
fee-based revenue grew 11.1 percent over 2005, with growth
in most product categories. Fee income growth was led by trust
and investment management fees and revenues generated by payment
processing businesses. In addition, average loans outstanding
rose 6.8 percent year-over-year despite very competitive
credit pricing. The Company’s performance was also driven
by the continued strong credit quality of the Company’s
loan portfolios. During the year nonperforming assets declined
8.9 percent from a year ago and total net charge-offs
decreased to .39 percent of average loans outstanding in
2006, compared with .52 percent in 2005. Finally, the
Company’s efficiency ratio (the ratio of noninterest
expense to taxable-equivalent net revenue excluding net
securities gains or losses) was 45.4 percent in 2006,
compared with 44.3 percent in 2005, and continues to be a
leader in the banking industry. The Company’s ability to
effectively manage its cost structure has provided a strategic
advantage in this highly competitive environment. As a result of
these factors, the Company achieved a return on average common
equity of 23.6 percent in 2006.

The Company’s strong performance is also reflected in its
capital levels and the favorable credit ratings assigned by
various credit rating agencies. Equity capital of the Company
continued to be strong at 5.5 percent of tangible assets at
December 31, 2006, compared with 5.9 percent at
December 31, 2005. The Company’s regulatory
Tier 1 capital ratio increased to 8.8 percent at
December 31, 2006, compared with 8.2 percent at
December 31, 2005. In 2006, the Company’s credit
ratings were upgraded by Standard & Poor’s Ratings
Services and Dominion Bond Rating Service. Credit ratings
assigned by various credit rating agencies reflect the rating
agencies’ recognition of the Company’s sector-leading
earnings performance and credit risk profile.

In concert with this financial performance, the Company achieved
its objective of returning at least 80 percent of earnings
to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases
by returning 112 percent of 2006 earnings to shareholders.
In December 2006, the Company increased its cash dividend
resulting in a 21.2 percent increase from the dividend rate
of the fourth quarter of 2005. Throughout 2006, the Company
continued to repurchase common shares under share repurchase
programs announced in December 2004 and August 2006.

In 2007, the Company’s financial and strategic objectives
are unchanged from those goals that have enabled it to deliver
industry leading financial performance. The Company desires to
achieve 10 percent long-term growth in earnings per common
share and a return on common equity of at least 20 percent.
The Company will continue to focus on effectively managing
credit quality and maintaining an acceptable level of credit and
earnings volatility. The Company intends to achieve these
financial objectives by providing high-quality customer service
and continuing to make strategic investments in businesses that
diversify and generate fee-based revenues, enhance the
Company’s distribution network or expand its product
offerings. Finally, the Company continues to target an
80 percent return of earnings to its shareholders through
dividends or shares repurchased.

Earnings Summary

The
Company reported net income of $4.8 billion in 2006, or
$2.61 per diluted common share, compared with
$4.5 billion, or $2.42 per diluted common share, in
2005. Return on average assets and return on average common
equity were 2.23 percent and 23.6 percent,
respectively, in 2006, compared with returns of
2.21 percent and 22.5 percent, respectively, in 2005.

Total net revenue, on a taxable-equivalent basis for 2006 was
$503 million (3.8 percent) higher than 2005 despite
the adverse impact of rising rates on product margins generally
experienced by the banking industry. The increase in net revenue
was comprised of a 13.3 percent increase in noninterest
income, partially offset by a 4.2 percent decline in net
interest income. Noninterest income growth was driven by higher
fee-based revenues from organic business growth, expansion in
trust and payment processing businesses, higher trading income,
and gains in 2006 from the initial public offering and
subsequent sale of the equity interest in a card association and
the sale of a 401(k) defined contribution recordkeeping
business. These favorable changes in fee-based revenues

were partially offset by lower mortgage banking revenue


U.S. BANCORP


principally due to the impact of adopting the fair value method
of accounting under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 156 “Accounting for Servicing of Financial
Assets” (“SFAS 156”) in the first quarter of
2006. In addition, noninterest income included a
$120 million favorable change in net securities gains
(losses) as compared with 2005. The decline in net interest
income reflected growth in average earning assets, more than
offset by lower net interest margins. In 2006, average earning
assets increased $7.8 billion (4.4 percent), compared
with 2005, primarily due to growth in total average loans,
partially offset by a decrease in investment securities. The net
interest margin in 2006 was 3.65 percent, compared with
3.97 percent in 2005. The year-over-year decline in net
interest margin reflected the competitive lending environment
and the impact of a flatter yield curve compared to a year ago.
The net interest margin also declined due to funding incremental
asset growth with higher cost wholesale funding, share
repurchases and asset/liability decisions designed to reduce the
Company’s interest rate sensitivity position. These adverse
factors impacting the net interest margin were offset somewhat
by the margin benefit of net free funds in a rising rate
environment and higher loan fees.

Total noninterest expense in 2006 increased $317 million
(5.4 percent), compared with 2005, primarily

reflecting incremental operating and business integration costs
associated with recent acquisitions, increased pension costs and
higher expenses related to certain tax-advantaged investments.
This increase was partially offset by lower intangible expense
and debt prepayment charges in 2006 compared with a year ago.
The decline in intangible expense from 2005 was primarily due to
the adoption of SFAS 156. The efficiency ratio was
45.4 percent in 2006, compared with 44.3 percent in
2005.

The provision for credit losses was $544 million for 2006,
a decrease of $122 million (18.3 percent) from 2005,
principally due to strong credit quality reflected in the
relatively low level of nonperforming assets and declining net
charge-offs compared with 2005. Net charge-offs were
$544 million in 2006, compared with $685 million in
2005. The decline in net charge-offs from a year ago was
principally due to the impact of changes in bankruptcy
legislation enacted in the fourth quarter of 2005.

STATEMENT OF INCOME ANALYSIS

Net Interest Income

Net
interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, was
$6.8 billion in 2006, $7.1 billion in 2005 and
$7.1 billion in 2004. The $298 million decline in net
interest income in 2006 reflected compression of the net
interest margin, somewhat offset by growth in average earning
assets. Average earning assets were $186.2 billion for
2006, compared with $178.4 billion and $168.1 billion
for 2005 and 2004, respectively. The $7.8 billion
(4.4 percent) increase in average earning assets for 2006,
compared with 2005, was primarily driven by growth in total
average loans of 6.8 percent, partially offset by a
decrease in average investment securities of 5.1 percent
from a year ago. The net interest margin in 2006 was
3.65 percent, compared with 3.97 percent and
4.25 percent in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The
32 basis point decline in 2006 net interest margin,
compared with 2005, reflected the competitive lending
environment and the impact of a flatter yield curve from a year
ago. Compared with 2005, credit spreads tightened by
approximately 17 basis points in 2006 across most lending
products due to competitive pricing and a change in mix
reflecting growth in lower-spread, fixed-rate credit products.
The net interest margin also declined due to funding incremental
asset growth with higher cost wholesale funding, share
repurchases, and asset/liability decisions. An increase in the
margin benefit of net free funds and loan fees partially offset
these factors. Beginning in the third quarter of 2006, the
Federal Reserve Bank paused from its policies of increasing
interest rates and tightening the money supply that began in
mid-2004. As of December 31, 2006, the yield curve was
relatively flat and the current consensus in the market is that
it will remain flat or slightly inverted throughout much of
2007. This market condition will continue to be challenging for
the banking industry. If the Federal Reserve Bank leaves rates
unchanged over the next several quarters, the Company expects
its net interest margin to remain relatively stable as asset
repricing occurs and funding costs moderate. Net interest income
growth is primarily expected to be driven by earning asset
growth during this timeframe.

Average loans in 2006 were $9.0 billion (6.8 percent)
higher than 2005, driven by growth in residential mortgages,
commercial loans and retail loans of $3.0 billion
(16.7 percent), $2.8 billion (6.6 percent) and
$2.4 billion

(5.5 percent), respectively. The growth in residential
mortgages was due to increased retention of loans throughout
2005, primarily related to adjustable-rate residential
mortgages. However during the first quarter of 2006, the Company
began selling an increased proportion of its residential
mortgage loan production and anticipates that residential
mortgage loan balances will grow only moderately in future
periods. Slower growth rates of commercial and retail loans
reflected the competitive market conditions for credit lending
and excess liquidity available to many business customers in
2006. Total average commercial real estate loans increased only
2.8 percent relative to 2005, reflecting customer
refinancing activities given liquidity available in the
financial markets, a decision by the Company to reduce
condominium construction financing and an economic slowdown in
residential homebuilding during 2006.

Average investment securities were $2.1 billion
(5.1 percent) lower in 2006, compared with 2005. The
decrease principally reflected asset/liability management
decisions to reduce the focus on residential mortgage-backed
assets given the changing interest rate environment and mix of
loan growth experienced during the year. Additionally, the
Company reclassified approximately $.5 billion of
principal-only securities to its trading account effective
January 1, 2006, in connection with the adoption of
SFAS 156. Refer to the “Interest Rate Risk
Management” section for further information on the
sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates.

Average noninterest-bearing deposits in 2006 were
$474 million (1.6 percent) lower than 2005. The
year-over-year decrease reflected a decline in personal and
business demand deposits, partially offset by higher corporate
trust deposits related to recent acquisitions. The change in
demand balances reflected a migration of customer accounts to
interest-bearing products given the rising interest rate
environment. The decline in business customer balances also
reflected customer utilization of excess liquidity to fund their
business growth.

Average total savings products declined $2.1 billion
(3.6 percent) in 2006, compared with 2005, due to
reductions in average money market savings and other savings
accounts, partially offset by an increase in interest checking
balances. Average money market savings balances declined
year-over-year by $2.6 billion (9.0 percent),
primarily due to a decline in branch-based balances. The decline
was partially offset by an increase in balances held by
broker-dealers. The overall year-over-year decrease in average
money market savings balances was primarily the result of the
Company’s deposit pricing decisions for money

market products in relation to other fixed-rate deposit products
offered. During 2006, a portion of branch-based money market
savings account balances migrated to fixed-rate time
certificates to take advantage of higher interest rates for
these products.

Average time certificates of deposit less than $100,000 were
$562 million (4.3 percent) higher in 2006, compared
with 2005. Average time deposits greater than $100,000 grew
$1.6 billion (7.7 percent) in 2006, compared with
2005. This growth was primarily driven by the migration of money
market balances within the Consumer Banking and Wealth
Management business lines, as customers migrated balances to
higher rate deposits.

The decline in net interest income in 2005, compared with 2004,
reflected growth in average earning assets, more than offset by
a lower net interest margin. The $10.3 billion
(6.1 percent) increase in average earning assets for 2005,
compared with 2004, was primarily driven by increases in
residential mortgages, commercial loans and retail loans. The
28 basis point decline in 2005 net interest margin,
compared with 2004, reflected the competitive lending
environment and the impact of changes in the yield curve. The
net interest margin was also adversely impacted by share
repurchases, funding incremental growth of earning assets with
higher cost wholesale funding, and asset/liability decisions
designed to reduce the Company’s rate sensitivity position
including issuing longer-term fixed-rate debt and reducing the
Company’s net receive-fixed interest rate swap positions.
Slightly higher loan fees and the increasing margin benefit of
deposits and net free funds partially offset these factors.

Average loans in 2005 were higher by $11.0 billion
(9.1 percent), compared with 2004, primarily driven by
growth in residential mortgages, commercial loans and retail
loans. Average investment securities were $906 million
(2.1 percent) lower in 2005, compared with 2004,
principally reflecting maturities and prepayments utilized to
fund earning asset growth and the net impact of repositioning
the investment portfolio as part of asset/liability risk
management decisions. Average noninterest-bearing deposits in
2005 were $587 million (2.0 percent) lower than in
2004. The year-over-year change in the average balances of
noninterest-bearing deposits was impacted by product changes in
the Consumer Banking business line. In late 2004, the Company
migrated approximately $1.3 billion of noninterest-bearing
deposit balances to interest checking accounts as an enhancement
to its Silver Elite Checking product. Average total savings
products declined $1.7 billion (2.9 percent)
year-over-year, compared with 2004, due to reductions in average
money market savings account balances and savings accounts,
partially offset by higher interest checking balances due to
strong new account growth, as well as the $1.3 billion
migration of the Silver Elite Checking product. Average money
market savings account balances declined from 2004 to 2005 by
$3.5 billion (10.8 percent), with declines in both the
branches and other business lines. The decline was primarily the
result of deposit pricing by the Company for money market
products in relation to other fixed-rate deposit products
offered. A portion of the money market savings balances migrated
to time deposits greater than $100,000 as rates increased on the
time deposit products. Average time deposits greater than
$100,000 grew $7.0 billion (51.0 percent) in 2005,
compared with 2004, most notably in corporate banking, as
customers migrated balances to higher rate deposits.

Provision for Credit Losses

The provision for credit
losses is recorded to bring the allowance for credit losses to a
level deemed appropriate by management based on factors
discussed in the “Analysis and Determination of Allowance
for Credit Losses” section.

The provision for credit losses was $544 million in 2006,
compared with $666 million and $669 million in 2005
and 2004, respectively.

The $122 million (18.3 percent) decrease in the
provision for credit losses in 2006 reflected stable credit
quality in 2006 and the adverse impact in the fourth quarter of
2005 on net charge-offs from changes in bankruptcy law in 2005.
Nonperforming loans, principally reflecting changes in the
quality of commercial loans, declined $74 million from
December 31, 2005. However, accruing loans ninety days past
due and restructured loans that continue to accrue interest
increased by $186 million from a year ago. Net charge-offs
declined $141 million from 2005, principally due to the
impact of changes in bankruptcy laws that went into effect
during the fourth quarter of 2005. In 2005, approximately
$64 million of incremental net charge-offs occurred due to
the change in bankruptcy laws and a separate policy change
related to overdraft balances. As a result of these changes,
bankruptcy charge-offs were lower in 2006 while customers
experiencing credit deterioration migrated further through
contractual delinquencies and bankruptcy levels increased from
past bankruptcy reform.

The $3 million (.4 percent) decline in the provision
for credit losses in 2005 reflected improving levels of
nonperforming loans, resulting in lower net charge-offs in 2005.
Nonperforming loans, principally reflecting changes in the
quality of commercial and commercial real estate loans, declined
$96 million from December 31, 2004. Net charge-offs
declined $82 million from 2004, the result of lower gross
charge-offs within the commercial and commercial real estate
portfolios. The improvement in commercial and commercial real
estate gross charge-offs was partially offset by the impact of
bankruptcy legislation enacted in the fourth quarter of 2005 and
lower commercial

and commercial real estate recoveries. Refer to “Corporate
Risk Profile” for further information on the provision for
credit losses, net charge-offs, nonperforming assets and other
factors considered by the Company in assessing the credit
quality of the loan portfolio and establishing the allowance for
credit losses.

Noninterest Income

Noninterest income in 2006
was $6.8 billion, compared with $6.0 billion in 2005
and $5.5 billion in 2004. The $801 million
(13.3 percent) increase in 2006 over 2005, was driven by
organic business growth, expansion in trust and payment
processing businesses, higher trading income related to gains on
certain interest rate swaps, equity gains from the initial
public offering and subsequent sale of the equity interest in a
card association during 2006 and a current year gain on the sale
of a 401(k) defined contribution recordkeeping business. These
favorable changes were partially offset by lower mortgage
banking revenue, principally due to the impact of adopting
SFAS 156 effective in the first quarter of 2006. In
addition, there was a $120 million favorable change in net
securities gains (losses) as compared with 2005.

The growth in credit and debit card revenue of 12.2 percent
was principally driven by higher customer transaction sales
volumes and fees related to cash advances, balance transfers and
over-limit positions. The corporate payment products revenue
growth of 14.1 percent reflected organic growth in sales
volumes and card usage, enhancements in product pricing and
acquired business expansion. ATM processing services revenue was
6.1 percent higher primarily due to the acquisition of an
ATM business in May 2005. Merchant processing services revenue
was 25.1 percent higher in 2006, compared with 2005,
reflecting an increase in sales volume driven by acquisitions,
higher same store sales, new merchant signings and associated
equipment fees. Trust and investment management fees increased
22.4 percent primarily due to organic customer account
growth, improving asset management fees given favorable equity
market conditions, and incremental revenue generated by recent
acquisitions of corporate and institutional trust businesses.
Deposit service charges were 10.2 percent higher
year-over-year due to increased transaction-related fees and the
impact of net new checking accounts. Mortgage banking revenue
declined $240 million in 2006, compared with 2005. The
decline was primarily due to a reduction of $210 million
related to the adoption of SFAS 156 and lower mortgage loan
production offset somewhat by higher mortgage servicing
revenues. Other income increased by $220 million
(37.1 percent) from 2005, primarily due to gains of
$67 million from the initial public offering and subsequent
sale of equity interests in a cardholder association and a
$52 million gain on the sale of a 401(k) defined
contribution recordkeeping business during 2006. In addition,
other income was higher due to trading income of
$50 million related to certain interest rate swaps, lower

end-of

-term lease
residual losses, incremental student loan sales gains and the
receipt of a favorable settlement of $10 million in the
merchant processing business. In light of recent developments
with respect to the application of accounting rules related to
derivatives, the Company conducted reviews of all its
derivatives utilized for hedging purposes. As a result of these
reviews, the Company identified certain interest rate swaps and
forward commitments designated as accounting hedges that either
did not have adequate documentation at the date of inception or
misapplied the “short-cut” method under Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, “Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”
(“SFAS 133”). As such, the Company determined
that changes in the market values of these derivatives, since
their inception, should have been recorded as trading income
despite the fact that these derivatives effectively reduced the
economic risks of the underlying assets or liabilities. The
annual impact to net income of these errors was .3 percent
and .7 percent for the years ended December 31, 2005
and 2004, respectively. The Company evaluated the impact of
these hedge accounting practices on its financial statements for

all quarterly and annual periods presented and concluded that
the impact of these errors was not material to each of these
financial statements. As a result, the cumulative impact of
these accounting differences was recorded during 2006 resulting
in $50 million of trading gains in other noninterest income.

The $526 million (9.5 percent) increase in noninterest
income in 2005, compared with 2004, was driven by strong organic
growth in most fee income categories, particularly payment
processing revenues and deposit service charges. The growth in
credit and debit card revenue was principally driven by higher
customer transaction volumes and rate changes. The corporate
payment products revenue growth reflected growth in sales, card
usage, rate changes and the acquisition of a small aviation card
business. ATM processing services revenue was higher due to an
ATM business acquisition in May of 2005. Merchant processing
services revenue was higher, reflecting an increase in merchant
sales volume and business expansion in European markets. The
increase in trust and investment management fees was primarily
attributed to improved equity market conditions and account
growth. Deposit service charges grew due to increased
transaction-related fees and new account growth in the branches.
The growth in mortgage banking revenue was due to origination
fees and gains from higher production volumes and increased
servicing income. Other income increased primarily due to higher
income from equity investments and the cash surrender value of
insurance products relative to 2004. Partially offsetting these
positive variances were decreases in treasury management fees
and commercial products revenue. The decrease in treasury
management fees was due to higher earnings credits on
customers’ compensating balances, partially offset by
growth in treasury management-related service activities.
Commercial products revenue declined due to reductions in
non-yield loan fees, syndications and fees for letters of credit.

Noninterest Expense

Noninterest expense in 2006
was $6.2 billion, compared with $5.9 billion and
$5.8 billion in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The
Company’s efficiency ratio increased to 45.4 percent
in 2006 from 44.3 percent in 2005. The change in the
efficiency ratio and the $317 million (5.4 percent)
increase in noninterest expenses in 2006, compared with 2005,
was primarily driven by incremental operating and business
integration costs associated with recent acquisitions, increased
pension costs and higher expense related to certain
tax-advantaged investments. This was partially offset by a
reduction in intangible expense and lower debt prepayment
charges in 2006.

Compensation expense was 5.5 percent higher year-over-year
primarily due to the corporate and institutional trust and
payments processing acquisitions and other growth initiatives
undertaken by the Company. Employee benefits increased
11.6 percent, year-over-year, primarily as a result of
higher pension expense. Net occupancy and equipment expense
increased 3.0 percent primarily due to business expansion.
Professional services expense was 19.9 percent higher
primarily due to revenue enhancement-related business
initiatives, including establishing a bank charter in Ireland to
support pan-European payment processing, and legal costs.
Technology and communications expense rose 8.4 percent,
reflecting higher outside data processing expense principally
associated with expanding a prepaid gift card program and the
corporate and institutional trust acquisitions. In connection
with the adoption of SFAS 156, the impact of eliminating
amortization of mortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”) and
related impairments or reparations of these servicing rights
decreased intangible expenses in 2006 by approximately
$144 million compared with 2005. Debt prepayment charges
declined $21 million (38.9 percent) from 2005 and were
related to longer-term callable debt that was prepaid by the
Company as part of asset/liability decisions to improve funding
costs and reposition the Company’s interest rate risk
position. Other expense increased 23.0 percent

primarily due to increased investments in tax-advantaged
projects and business integration costs relative to a year ago.

The $78 million (1.3 percent) increase in noninterest
expenses in 2005, compared with 2004, was primarily driven by
expenses related to business investments, acquired businesses,
and production-based incentives, offset by a $99 million
favorable change in MSR amortization and a $101 million
decrease in debt prepayment charges. Compensation expense was
higher year-over-year principally due to business expansion,
including in-store branches, expanding the Company’s
payment processing businesses and other product sales
initiatives. Employee benefits increased primarily as a result
of higher pension expense, medical costs, payroll taxes and
other benefits. Professional services expense rose due to
increases in legal and other professional services related to
business initiatives, technology development and integration
costs of specific payment processing businesses. Marketing and
business development expense increased due to marketing
initiatives, principally related to brand awareness and credit
card and prepaid gift card programs. Technology and
communications expense was higher, reflecting depreciation of
technology investments, network costs associated with the
expansion of the payment processing businesses, and higher
outside data processing expense associated with expanding a
prepaid gift card program. Other expense declined primarily due
to lower operating and fraud losses and insurance costs,
partially offset by increased investments in affordable housing
and other tax-advantaged projects and higher merchant processing
costs due to the expansion of the payment processing businesses
relative to 2004.

Pension Plans

Because of
the long-term nature of pension plans, the administration and
accounting for pensions is complex and can be impacted by
several factors, including investment and funding policies,
accounting methods and the plans’ actuarial assumptions.
The Company and its Compensation Committee have an established
process for evaluating the plans, their performance and
significant plan assumptions, including the assumed discount
rate and the long-term rate of return (“LTROR”).
Annually the Company’s Compensation Committee, assisted by
outside consultants, evaluates plan objectives, funding policies
and investment policies considering its long-term investment
time horizon and asset allocation strategies. Note 16 of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements provides further
information on funding practices, investment policies and asset
allocation strategies.

Periodic pension expense (or income) includes service costs,
interest costs based on the assumed discount rate, the expected
return on plan assets based on an actuarially derived
market-related value and amortization of actuarial gains and
losses. The Company’s pension accounting policy follows
generally accepted accounting standards and reflects the
long-term nature of benefit obligations and the investment
horizon of plan assets. This accounting guidance has the effect
of reducing earnings volatility related to short-term changes in
interest rates and market valuations. Actuarial gains and losses
include the impact of plan amendments and various unrecognized
gains and losses related to differences in actual plan
experience compared with actuarial assumptions, which are
deferred and amortized over the future service periods of active
employees. The actuarially derived market-related value utilized
to determine the expected return on plan assets is based on fair
value adjusted for the difference between expected returns and
actual performance of plan assets. The unrealized difference
between actual experience and expected returns is included in
the actuarially derived market-related value ratably over a
five-year period. At September 30, 2006, this accumulated
unrecognized gain approximated $249 million, compared with
$206 million at September 30, 2005. The impact on
pension expense of the unrecognized asset gains will
incrementally decrease pension costs in each year from 2007 to
2011, by approximately $18 million, $24 million,
$16 million, $12 million and $3 million,
respectively. This assumes that the performance of plan assets
in 2007 and beyond equals the assumed LTROR. Actual results will
vary depending on the performance of plan assets and changes to
assumptions required in the future. Refer to Note 1 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further
discussion of the Company’s accounting policies for pension
plans.

In 2006, the Company recognized a pension cost of
$81 million compared with a pension cost of
$33 million and $9 million in 2005 and 2004,
respectively. The $48 million increase in pension costs in
2006 was driven by recognition of net deferred actuarial losses
and the impact of a lower discount rate. In 2005, pension costs
increased by $24 million, compared with 2004, also driven
by recognition of deferred actuarial losses and the impact of a
lower discount rate.

In 2007, the Company anticipates that pension costs will
decrease by approximately $27 million. The decrease will be
primarily driven by utilizing a higher discount rate given the
rising interest rate environment and amortization of
unrecognized actuarial gains from prior years, accounting for
approximately $13 million and $14 million of the
anticipated decrease, respectively.

Due to the complexity of forecasting pension plan activities,

the information provided in the sensitivity analysis.

Income Tax Expense

The
provision for income taxes was $2,112 million (an effective
rate of 30.8 percent) in 2006, compared with
$2,082 million (an effective rate of 31.7 percent) in
2005 and $2,009 million (an effective rate of
32.5 percent) in 2004. The decrease in the effective tax
rate from 2005 primarily reflected higher tax exempt income from
investment securities and insurance products as well as
incremental tax credits from affordable housing and other
tax-advantaged investments.

Included in 2006 was a reduction of income tax expense of
$61 million related to the resolution of federal income tax
examinations covering substantially all of the Company’s
legal entities for all years through 2004 and $22 million
related to certain state examinations. Included in the
determination of income taxes for 2005 and 2004 were reductions
of income tax expense of $94 million and $106 million,
respectively, related to the resolution of income tax
examinations. The Company anticipates that its effective tax
rate for the foreseeable future will approximate 32 percent
of pretax earnings.

For further information on income taxes, refer to Note 18
of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

LOAN PORTFOLIO DISTRIBUTION


U.S. BANCORP


BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS

Average earning assets were $186.2 billion in 2006,
compared with $178.4 billion in 2005. The increase in
average earning assets of $7.8 billion (4.4 percent)
was primarily driven by growth in total average loans, partially
offset by a decrease in investment securities. The change in
average earning assets was principally funded by increases in
wholesale funding.

For average balance information, refer to Consolidated Daily
Average Balance Sheet and Related Yields and Rates on
pages 106 and 107.

Loans

The Company’s
loan portfolio was $143.6 billion at December 31,
2006, an increase of $7.1 billion (5.2 percent) from
December 31, 2005. The increase was driven by growth in
commercial loans (7.6 percent), retail loans
(7.1 percent), residential mortgages (2.7 percent) and
commercial real estate loans (.6 percent). Table 6
provides a summary of the loan distribution by product type,
while Table 10 provides a summary of selected loan maturity
distribution by loan category. Average total loans increased
$9.0 billion (6.8 percent) in 2006, compared with
2005. The increase was due to growth in most loan categories.

Commercial

Commercial
loans, including lease financing, increased $3.2 billion
(7.6 percent) as of December 31, 2006, compared with
December 31, 2005. The increase was driven by new customer
relationships, revolving credit line utilization by business
customers and growth in corporate payment card and commercial
leasing balances. Additionally, loans to financial institutions
increased 10.6 percent from a year ago. Average commercial
loans increased $2.8 billion (6.6 percent) in 2006,
compared with 2005, primarily due to an increase in commercial
loan demand driven by general economic conditions in 2006.

Table 7 provides a summary of commercial loans by industry
and geographical locations.

Commercial Real Estate

The
Company’s portfolio of commercial real estate loans, which
includes commercial mortgages and construction loans, increased
$.2 billion

Table 7

Table 8

COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE BY
    PROPERTY TYPE AND GEOGRAPHY

(.6 percent) at December 31, 2006, compared with
December 31, 2005. Construction and development loans
increased $.7 billion (9.1 percent) despite developers
beginning to slow homebuilding and managing their inventories of
residential homes in response to softening market conditions.
Additionally, the Company made a decision to reduce financing
activities for the construction of condominiums and similar
housing projects. Commercial mortgages outstanding decreased
$.6 billion (2.8 percent) reflecting reductions in
traditional commercial real estate mortgages due to customer
refinancing activities, given liquidity available in the
financial markets. Average commercial real estate loans
increased $.8 billion (2.8 percent) in 2006, compared
with 2005, primarily driven by growth in construction and
development loans. Table 8 provides a summary of commercial
real estate by property type and geographical locations.

The Company maintains the real estate construction designation
until the completion of the construction phase and, if retained,
the loan is reclassified to the commercial mortgage category.
Approximately $161 million of construction loans were
permanently financed and reclassified to the commercial mortgage
loan category in 2006. At December 31, 2006,
$233 million of tax-exempt industrial development loans
were secured by real estate. The Company’s commercial real
estate mortgages and construction loans had unfunded commitments
of $8.9 billion at December 31, 2006, compared with
$9.8 billion at December 31, 2005. The Company also
finances the operations of real estate developers and other
entities with operations related to real estate. These loans are
not secured directly by real estate and are subject to terms and
conditions similar to commercial loans. These loans were
included in the commercial loan category and totaled
$1.7 billion at December 31, 2006.

Residential Mortgages

Residential mortgages held in
the loan portfolio at December 31, 2006, increased
$.6 billion (2.7 percent) from December 31, 2005.
The growth was the result of an increase in consumer finance
originations, partially offset by the Company’s decision in
early 2006 to resume packaging and selling a majority of its
residential mortgage loan production in the secondary markets.
Average residential mortgages increased $3.0 billion


U.S. BANCORP


Table 9

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES AND
    RETAIL LOANS BY GEOGRAPHY

(16.7 percent) in 2006, compared with 2005. During 2005,
the Company was retaining a substantial portion of its
adjustable-rate residential mortgage loan production in
connection with asset/liability management decisions to reduce
its risk to rising interest rates. Average residential mortgage
loan balances increased as a result of the timing of these
asset/liability decisions.

Retail

Total retail loans
outstanding, which include credit card, retail leasing, home
equity and second mortgages and other retail loans, increased
$3.2 billion (7.1 percent) at December 31, 2006,
compared with December 31, 2005. The increase was primarily
driven by growth in credit card and other retail loans, both of
which increased by $1.5 billion during 2006. The increases
in these loan

categories were offset somewhat by a slight reduction in retail
leasing balances of $.4 billion during the year. Average
retail loans increased $2.4 billion (5.5 percent) in
2006, principally reflecting growth in credit card and
installment loans. Credit card growth was driven by balance
transfers, balance growth within co-branded card contracts and
affinity programs. Of the total retail loans and residential
mortgages outstanding, approximately 81.0 percent were to
customers located in the Company’s primary banking regions.
Table 9 provides a geographic summary of residential mortgages
and retail loans outstanding as of December 31, 2006.

Loans Held for Sale

At
December 31, 2006, loans held for sale, consisting of

December 31, 2005. The increase in loans held for sale was
principally due to an increase in residential mortgage balances.
Average loans held for sale were $3.7 billion in 2006,
compared with $3.3 billion in 2005.

Investment Securities

The
Company uses its investment securities portfolio for several
purposes. It serves as a vehicle to manage interest rate risk,
generates interest and dividend income from the investment of
excess funds depending on loan demand, provides liquidity and is
used as collateral for public deposits and wholesale funding
sources. While it is the Company’s intent to hold its
investment securities indefinitely, the Company may take actions
in response to structural changes in the balance sheet and
related interest rate risk and to meet liquidity requirements.

At December 31, 2006, investment securities, both
available-for-sale and

held-to

-maturity,
totaled $40.1 billion, compared with $39.8 billion at
December 31, 2005. The $.3 billion (.9 percent)
increase primarily reflected securities purchases of
$7.5 billion, partially offset by maturities and
prepayments. Additionally, the Company reclassified
$.5 billion of principal-only securities to the trading
account effective January 1, 2006, in connection with the
adoption of SFAS 156. At December 31, 2006,
approximately 37 percent of the investment securities
portfolio represented adjustable-rate financial instruments,
compared with 41 percent at December 31, 2005.
Adjustable-rate financial instruments include variable-rate
collateralized mortgage obligations, mortgage-backed securities,
agency securities, adjustable-rate money market accounts and
asset-backed securities. The decline in the percentage of
adjustable-rate securities reflects decisions to purchase higher
yielding fixed-rate municipal bonds and certain preferred
corporate debt instruments. Average investment securities were
$2.1 billion (5.1 percent) lower in 2006, compared
with 2005. The decline principally reflected asset/liability
management decisions to reduce the focus on residential
mortgage-backed assets given the changing mix of the
Company’s loan growth.

The weighted-average yield of the available-for-sale portfolio
was 5.32 percent at December 31, 2006, compared with
4.89 percent at December 31, 2005. The average
maturity of the available-for-sale portfolio increased to
6.6 years at December 31, 2006, up from 6.1 years
at December 31, 2005. The relative mix of the type of
investment securities maintained in the portfolio is provided in
Table 11. At December 31, 2006, the available-for-sale
portfolio included a $600 million net unrealized loss,
compared with a net unrealized loss of $662 million at
December 31, 2005.

Deposits

Total deposits
were $124.9 billion at December 31, 2006, compared
with $124.7 billion at December 31, 2005, reflecting
increases in interest checking and time certificates of deposits
less than $100,000, partially offset by decreases in
noninterest-bearing deposits, savings accounts, money market
savings and balances from time deposits greater than $100,000.
Average total deposits decreased $.4 billion
(.3 percent) from 2005, reflecting a decline in average
noninterest-bearing deposits, money market savings, and other
savings accounts. The decreases in these categories were
partially offset by higher average interest checking and
fixed-rate time certificate balances as branch-based customer
balances migrated from lower rate saving products to products
with higher interest rate offerings.

Noninterest-bearing deposits at December 31, 2006,
decreased $.1 billion (.3 percent) from
December 31, 2005. The decrease was primarily attributed to
a decline in business demand deposits as these customers reduced
excess liquidity to fund business growth. The change also
reflected a migration of customers to interest-bearing products,
given rising interest rates. Average noninterest-bearing
deposits in 2006 decreased $.5 billion (1.6 percent),
compared with 2005, due to similar factors.

Interest-bearing savings deposits decreased $.3 billion
(.6 percent) at December 31, 2006, compared with
December 31, 2005. The decline in these deposit balances
was primarily related to reductions in money market savings and
savings account balances, partially offset by an increase in
interest checking accounts. The $1.7 billion
(6.1 percent) decrease in money market savings account
balances reflected the Company’s deposit pricing decisions
for money market products in relation to other fixed-rate
deposit products offered. A portion of branch-based money market
savings accounts migrated to fixed-rate time certificates in
response to higher interest rates for these products. The
$1.7 billion (7.1 percent) increase in interest
checking account balances was due to an increase in trust and
custody and government balances, partially offset by decreases
in private banking balances. Average interest-bearing savings
deposits in 2006 decreased $2.1 billion (3.6 percent),
compared with 2005, primarily driven by a reduction in money
market savings account balances of $2.6 billion
(9.0 percent), partially offset by higher interest checking
account balances of $.8 billion (3.4 percent).

Interest-bearing time deposits at December 31, 2006,
increased $.6 billion (1.7 percent), compared with
December 31, 2005, primarily driven by an increase in time
certificates of deposit less than $100,000. The increase in time
certificates of deposit less than $100,000 was due to the
migration of a portion of customer noninterest-bearing and money
market savings account balances to fixed-rate deposits. Average
time deposits greater than $100,000 increased $1.6 billion
(7.7 percent) and average time certificates of deposit less
than $100,000 increased $.6 billion (4.3 percent) in
2006, compared with 2005.

DEPOSITS

The composition of deposits was as follows:

The maturity of time certificates of deposit less than $100,000
and time deposits greater than $100,000 was as follows:

Time deposits greater than $100,000 are largely viewed as
purchased funds and are managed to levels deemed appropriate
given alternative funding sources.

Borrowings

The Company
utilizes both short-term and long-term borrowings to fund
earning asset growth in excess of deposit growth. Short-term
borrowings, which include federal funds purchased, commercial
paper, securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other
short-term borrowings, were $26.9 billion at
December 31, 2006, compared with $20.2 billion at
December 31, 2005. Short-term funding is managed within
approved liquidity policies. The increase of $6.7 billion
in short-term borrowings reflected wholesale funding associated
with the Company’s earning asset growth and asset/liability
management activities.

Long-term debt was $37.6 billion at December 31, 2006,
compared with $37.1 billion at December 31, 2005,
reflecting the issuances of $5.5 billion of medium-term and
bank notes, $2.5 billion of convertible senior debentures,
$2.5 billion of junior subordinated debentures and the
addition of $3.1 billion of Federal Home Loan Bank
(“FHLB”) advances. These additions were partially
offset by $7.6 billion of medium-term and bank note
maturities, and $3.4 billion of convertible senior
debenture repayments. In addition, the Company elected to redeem
$1.9 billion of junior subordinated debentures in
connection with asset/liability and interest rate risk
management decisions. Refer to Note 12 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information
regarding long-term debt and the “Liquidity Risk
Management” section for discussion of liquidity management
of the Company.

CORPORATE RISK PROFILE

Overview

Managing risks is
an essential part of successfully operating a financial services
company. The most prominent risk exposures are credit, residual
value, operational, interest rate, market and liquidity risk.
Credit risk is the risk of not collecting the interest and/or
the principal balance of a loan or investment when it is due.
Residual value risk is the potential reduction in the

end-of

-term value of
leased assets or the residual cash flows related to asset
securitization and other off-balance sheet structures.
Operational risk includes risks related to fraud, legal and
compliance risk, processing errors, technology, breaches of
internal controls and business continuation and disaster
recovery risk. Interest rate risk is the potential reduction of
net interest income as a result of changes in interest rates,
which can affect the repricing of assets and liabilities


U.S. BANCORP


differently, as well as their market value. Market risk arises
from fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and
equity prices that may result in changes in the values of
financial instruments, such as trading and available-for-sale
securities that are accounted for on a

mark-to

-market basis.
Liquidity risk is the possible inability to fund obligations to
depositors, investors or borrowers. In addition, corporate
strategic decisions, as well as the risks described above, could
give rise to reputation risk. Reputation risk is the risk that
negative publicity or press, whether true or not, could result
in costly litigation or cause a decline in the Company’s
stock value, customer base or revenue.

Credit Risk Management

The
Company’s strategy for credit risk management includes
well-defined, centralized credit policies, uniform underwriting
criteria, and ongoing risk monitoring and review processes for
all commercial and consumer credit exposures. The strategy also
emphasizes diversification on a geographic, industry and
customer level, regular credit examinations and management
reviews of loans exhibiting deterioration of credit quality. The
credit risk management strategy also includes a credit risk
assessment process, independent of business line managers, that
performs assessments of compliance with commercial and consumer
credit policies, risk ratings, and other critical credit
information. The Company strives to identify potential problem
loans early, record any necessary charge-offs promptly and
maintain adequate reserve levels for probable loan losses
inherent in the portfolio. Commercial banking operations rely on
prudent credit policies and procedures and individual lender and
business line manager accountability. Lenders are assigned
lending authority based on their level of experience and
customer service requirements. Credit officers reporting to an
independent credit administration function have higher levels of
lending authority and support the business units in their credit
decision process. Loan decisions are documented as to the
borrower’s business, purpose of the loan, evaluation of the
repayment source and the associated risks, evaluation of
collateral, covenants and monitoring requirements, and risk
rating rationale. The Company utilizes a credit risk rating
system to measure the credit quality of individual commercial
loans including the probability of default of an obligor and the
loss given default of credit facilities. The Company uses the
risk rating system for regulatory reporting, determining the
frequency of review of the credit exposures, and evaluation and
determination of the specific allowance for commercial credit
losses. The Company regularly forecasts potential changes in
risk ratings, nonperforming status and potential for loss and
the estimated impact on the allowance for credit losses. In the
Company’s retail banking operations, standard credit
scoring systems are used to assess credit risks of consumer,
small business and small-ticket leasing customers and to price
consumer products accordingly. The Company conducts the
underwriting and collections of its retail products in loan
underwriting and servicing centers specializing in certain
retail products. Forecasts of delinquency levels, bankruptcies
and losses in conjunction with projection of estimated losses by
delinquency categories and vintage information are regularly
prepared and are used to evaluate underwriting and collection
and determine the specific allowance for credit losses for these
products. Because business processes and credit risks associated
with unfunded credit commitments are essentially the same as for
loans, the Company utilizes similar processes to estimate its
liability for unfunded credit commitments. The Company also
engages in non-lending activities that may give rise to credit
risk, including interest rate swap and option contracts for
balance sheet hedging purposes, foreign exchange transactions,
deposit overdrafts and interest rate swap contracts for
customers, and settlement risk, including Automated Clearing
House transactions, and the processing of credit card
transactions for merchants. These activities are also subject to
credit review, analysis and approval processes.

risk, the Company considers changes, if any, in underwriting
activities, the loan portfolio composition (including product
mix and geographic, industry or customer-specific
concentrations), trends in loan performance, the level of
allowance coverage relative to similar banking institutions and
macroeconomic factors.

Since mid-2003, economic conditions have steadily improved as
evidenced by stronger earnings across many corporate sectors,
higher equity valuations, and stronger retail sales and consumer
spending. In late 2003, unemployment rates stabilized and began
to decline from a high of 6.13 percent in the third quarter
of that year. However, the banking industry continued to have
elevated levels of nonperforming assets and net charge-offs in
2003 compared with the late 1990’s.

Economic conditions have steadily improved during the timeframe
from 2004 through 2006, as reflected in strong expansion of the
gross domestic product index, lower unemployment rates,
expanding retail sales levels, favorable trends related to
corporate profits and consumer spending for retail goods and
services. Beginning in mid-2004 through the second quarter of
2006, the Federal Reserve Bank pursued a measured approach to
increasing short-term rates in an effort to prevent an
acceleration of inflation and maintain a moderate rate of
economic growth. The rising interest rate environment has caused
some softening of residential home and condominium sales.
Nationwide sales of condominium units reached a peak in mid-2005
and

U.S. BANCORP



have declined since that timeframe. With respect to residential
homes, inventory levels approximated a 7 month supply at
the end of 2006, up from 4.5 months in the third quarter of
2005. Median home prices, which peaked in mid-2006, have
declined somewhat across most domestic markets with more severe
price reductions in the Northeast and Southeast regions. Since
the second quarter of 2006, retail sales have slowed somewhat
and industrial production declined moderately in the fourth
quarter of 2006. Beginning in the third quarter of 2006, the
Federal Reserve Bank paused from its approach of increasing
interest rates and tightening the money supply as growth in
inflationary indices began to moderate.

In addition to economic factors, changes in regulations and
legislation can have an impact on the credit performance of the
loan portfolios. Beginning in 2005, the Company implemented
higher minimum balance payment requirements for its credit card
customers in response to industry guidance issued by the banking
regulatory agencies. This industry guidance was provided to
minimize the likelihood that minimum balance payments would not
be sufficient to cover interest, fees and a portion of the
principal balance of a credit card loan resulting in negative
amortization, or increasing account balances. Also, new
bankruptcy legislation was enacted in October 2005, making it
more difficult for borrowers to have their debts forgiven during
bankruptcy proceedings. As a result of the changes in bankruptcy
laws, the levels of consumer and business bankruptcy filings
increased dramatically in the fourth quarter of 2005 and
declined in early 2006 to levels that were a third of average
bankruptcy filings during 2004 and early 2005. While consumer
bankruptcies have begun to increase somewhat, bankruptcy filings
in the fourth quarter of 2006 approximated only fifty percent of
pre-2005 levels. Going forward, the lending industry may
experience increasing levels of nonperforming loans,
restructured loans and delinquencies due to changing collections
strategies for consumer credit.

Credit Diversification

The Company manages its
credit risk, in part, through diversification of its loan
portfolio. As part of its normal business activities, it offers
a broad array of traditional commercial lending products and
specialized products such as asset-based lending, commercial
lease financing, agricultural credit, warehouse mortgage
lending, commercial real estate, health care and correspondent
banking. The Company also offers an array of retail lending
products including credit cards, retail leases, home equity,
revolving credit, lending to students and other consumer loans.
These retail credit products are primarily offered through the
branch office network, home mortgage and loan production
offices, indirect distribution channels, such as automobile
dealers and a consumer finance division. The Company monitors
and manages the portfolio diversification by industry, customer
and geography. Table 6 provides information with respect to the
overall product diversification and changes in the mix during
2006.

The commercial portfolio reflects the Company’s focus on
serving small business customers, middle market and larger
corporate businesses throughout its

24-state

banking
region, as well as large national customers. Table 7 provides a
summary of the significant industry groups and geographic
locations of commercial loans outstanding at December 31,
2006 and 2005. The commercial loan portfolio is diversified
among various industries with somewhat higher concentrations in
consumer products and services, financial services, commercial
services and supplies, capital goods (including manufacturing
and commercial construction-related businesses), property
management and development and agricultural industries.
Additionally, the commercial portfolio is diversified across the
Company’s geographical markets with 79.2 percent of
total commercial loans within the

24-state

banking
region. Credit relationships outside of the Company’s
banking region are reflected within the corporate banking,
mortgage banking, auto dealer and leasing businesses focusing on
large national customers and specifically targeted industries.
Loans to mortgage banking customers are primarily warehouse
lines which are collateralized with the underlying mortgages.
The Company regularly monitors its mortgage collateral position
to manage its risk exposure.

The commercial real estate portfolio reflects the Company’s
focus on serving business owners within its footprint as well as
regional and national investment-based real estate. At
December 31, 2006, the Company had commercial real estate
loans of $28.6 billion, or 19.9 percent of total
loans, compared with $28.5 billion at December 31,
2005. Within commercial real estate loans, different property
types have varying degrees of credit risk. Table 8 provides a
summary of the significant property types and geographical
locations of commercial real estate loans outstanding at
December 31, 2006 and 2005. At December 31, 2006,
approximately 35.0 percent of the commercial real estate
loan portfolio represented business owner-occupied properties
that tend to exhibit credit risk characteristics similar to the
middle market commercial loan portfolio. Generally, the
investment-based real estate mortgages are diversified among
various property types with somewhat higher concentrations in
office and retail properties. While investment-based commercial
real estate continues to perform with relatively strong
occupancy levels and cash flows, these categories of loans can
be adversely impacted during a rising rate environment. During
the year, the Company began to reduce the level of its
construction financing of condominium projects given the
deterioration in unit pricing in several regions of the country.
Included in


U.S. BANCORP


commercial real estate at year end 2006 was approximately
$.7 billion in loans related to land held for development
and $2.2 billion of loans related to residential and
commercial acquisition and development properties. These loans
are subject to quarterly monitoring for changes in local market
conditions due to a higher credit risk profile. Acquisition and
development loans continued to perform well, despite a slow down
in the housing market and softening of demand. The commercial
real estate portfolio is diversified across the Company’s
geographical markets with 92.0 percent of total commercial
real estate loans outstanding at December 31, 2006, within
the

24-state

banking
region.

Residential mortgages represent an important financial product
for consumer customers of the Company and are originated through
the Company’s branches, loan production offices, a
wholesale network of originators and a consumer finance
division. With respect to residential mortgages originated
through these channels, the Company may either retain the loans
on its balance sheet or sell its interest in the balances into
the secondary market while retaining the servicing rights and
customer relationships. Utilizing the secondary markets enables
the Company to effectively reduce its credit and other
asset/liability risks. For residential mortgages that are
retained in the Company’s portfolio, credit risk is also
diversified by geography and by monitoring loan-to-values during
the underwriting process.

The following table provides summary information of the

loan-to

-values of
residential mortgages by distribution channel and type at
December 31, 2006:

Within the consumer finance division approximately
$2.8 billion, or 35.1 percent of that division,
represents loans to customers that may be defined as sub-prime
borrowers. Of these loans, 34.8 percent had a loan-to-value
of less than or equal to 80 percent of the origination amount,
while 24.2 percent had loan-to-values of over
80 percent through 90 percent and 39.1 percent had
loan-to-values of over 90 percent through 100 percent.

The following table provides further information for the
consumer finance division:

The Company does not have any residential mortgages whose
payment schedule would cause balances to increase over time.

The retail loan portfolio principally reflects the
Company’s focus on consumers within its footprint of
branches and certain niche lending activities that are
nationally focused. Within the Company’s retail loan
portfolio approximately 82.7 percent of the credit card
balances relate to bank branch, co-branded and affinity programs
that generally experience better credit quality performance than
portfolios generated through national direct mail programs. At
December 31, 2006, approximately 80.8 percent of the
student loan portfolio is federally guaranteed through various
programs reducing its risk profile.

Table 9 provides a geographical summary of the residential
mortgage and retail loan portfolios.

Loan Delinquencies

Trends in delinquency
ratios represent an indicator, among other considerations, of
credit risk within the Company’s loan portfolios. The
entire balance of an account is considered delinquent if the
minimum payment contractually required to be made is not
received by the specified date on the billing statement. The
Company measures delinquencies, both including and excluding
nonperforming loans, to enable comparability with other
companies. Advances made pursuant to servicing agreements to

    amounts, the ratio of residential mortgages 90 days or
    more past due was 3.11 percent, 4.35 percent,
    5.19 percent, and 6.07 percent at December 31,
    2006, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Information prior to

(“GNMA”) mortgage pools whose repayments of principal
and interest are substantially insured by the Federal Housing
Administration or guaranteed by the Department of Veterans
Affairs are excluded from delinquency statistics. In addition,
under certain situations, a retail customer’s account may
be re-aged to remove it from delinquent status. Generally, the
intent of a re-aged account is to assist customers who have
recently overcome temporary financial difficulties, and have
demonstrated both the ability and willingness to resume regular
payments. To qualify for re-aging, the account must have been
open for at least one year and cannot have been re-aged during
the preceding 365 days. An account may not be re-aged more
than two times in a five year period. To qualify for re-aging,
the customer must also have made three regular minimum monthly
payments within the last 90 days. In addition, the Company
may re-age the retail account of a customer who has experienced
longer-term financial difficulties and apply modified,
concessionary terms and conditions to the account. Such
additional re-ages are limited to one in a five year period,
must meet the qualifications for re-aging described above. All
re-aging strategies must be independently approved by the
Company’s credit administration function and are limited to
credit card and credit line accounts. Commercial loans are not
subject to

re-aging

policies.

Accruing loans 90 days or more past due totaled
$349 million at December 31, 2006, compared with
$253 million at December 31, 2005, and
$294 million at December 31, 2004. The increase in 90
day delinquent loans from December 31, 2005, to
December 31, 2006, was primarily driven by the impact of
the bankruptcy legislation in 2005. These loans were not
included in nonperforming assets and continue to accrue interest
because they are adequately secured by collateral, and/or are in
the process of collection and are reasonably expected to result
in repayment or restoration to current status. The ratio of
90 day delinquent loans to total loans was .24 percent
at December 31, 2006, compared with .19 percent at
December 31, 2005.

To monitor credit risk associated with retail loans, the Company
also monitors delinquency ratios in the various stages of
collection including nonperforming status.

Within the consumer finance division approximately
$105 million and $50 million of these delinquent and
nonperforming residential mortgages and other retail loans,
respectively, were to customers that may be defined as sub-prime
borrowers.

Nonperforming Assets

The level of
nonperforming assets represents another indicator of the
potential for future credit losses. Nonperforming assets include
nonaccrual loans, restructured loans not performing in
accordance with modified terms, other real estate and other
nonperforming assets owned by the Company. Interest payments
collected from assets on nonaccrual status are typically applied
against the principal balance and not recorded as income. At
December 31, 2006, total nonperforming assets were
$587 million, compared with $644 million at year-end
2005 and $748 million at year-end 2004. The ratio of total
nonperforming assets to total loans and other real estate
decreased to .41 percent at December 31, 2006,
compared with .47 percent and .60 percent at the end
of 2005 and 2004, respectively. The $57 million decrease in
total nonperforming assets in 2006 principally reflected
decreases in nonperforming commercial, residential mortgages and
retail loans, partially offset by a $24 million increase in
other real estate as a result of taking ownership of more
residential properties. The decrease in nonperforming commercial
loans in 2006 was broad-based across many industry sectors
within the commercial loan portfolio including agriculture,
commercial supplies, consumer-related sectors, manufacturing and
transportation. Some deterioration in credit quality was
experienced within the home improvement, furnishing and building
sectors during the year. The reduction in nonperforming
commercial real estate loans during 2006 extended across most
property types and was driven by refinancing of commercial real
estate mortgages given the extent of liquidity available in the
market. Nonperforming loans related to construction financing
have increased somewhat during the year. Nonperforming retail
loans decreased from a year ago, primarily due to the run-off of
nonaccrual accounts from a discontinued workout program for
customers having financial difficulties meeting recent minimum
balance payment requirements. Under this program, retail
customers that met certain criteria had the terms of their
credit card and other loan agreements modified to allow
amortization of their balances over a period of up to
60 months. Residential mortgage loans on nonaccrual status
decreased during 2006. As a percentage of ending loan balances,
nonperforming residential mortgages declined to .17 percent
at December 31, 2006 compared with .23 percent at
December 31, 2005.

The $104 million decrease in total nonperforming assets in
2005, as compared with 2004, reflected decreases in
nonperforming commercial and commercial real estate loans,
partially offset by increases in nonperforming residential
mortgages and retail loans. The decrease in nonperforming
commercial loans in 2005 was also broad-based across most
industry sectors within the commercial loan portfolio including
capital goods, customer-related sectors, manufacturing and
certain segments of transportation. The increase in
nonperforming retail loans during 2005 was directly related to
the workout program, discussed above, for customers having
financial difficulties meeting recent minimum balance payment
requirements.

Included in nonperforming loans were restructured loans of
$38 million and $75 million at December 31, 2006
and 2005, respectively. At December 31, 2006, the Company
had no commitments to lend additional funds under restructured
loans, compared with $9 million at December 31, 2005.

Restructured Loans Accruing Interest

On a case-by-case basis,
management determines whether an account that experiences
financial difficulties should be modified as to its interest
rate or repayment terms to maximize the Company’s
collection of its balance. Loans restructured at a rate equal to
or greater than that of a new loan with comparable risk at the
time the contract is modified are excluded from restructured
loans once repayment performance, in accordance with the
modified agreement, has been demonstrated over several payment
cycles. Loans that have interest rates reduced below comparable
market rates remain classified as restructured loans; however,
interest income is accrued at the reduced rate as long as the
customer complies with the revised terms and conditions.

NET CHARGE-OFFS AS A PERCENT
    OF AVERAGE LOANS OUTSTANDING

reflecting the impact of the Company implementing higher minimum
balance payment requirements for credit card customers in
response to industry guidance issued by the banking regulatory
agencies.

Analysis of Loan Net Charge-Offs

Total loan net charge-offs were
$544 million in 2006, compared with $685 million in
2005 and $767 million in 2004. The ratio of total loan net
charge-offs to average loans was .39 percent in 2006,
compared with .52 percent in 2005 and .64 percent in
2004. The overall level of net charge-offs in 2006 and 2005
reflected improving economic conditions and the Company’s
efforts to reduce the overall risk profile of the portfolio
through ongoing improvement in collection efforts underwriting
and risk management. These factors have resulted in improved
credit quality and lower gross charge-offs over the past three
years.

Commercial and commercial real estate loan net charge-offs for
2006 were $88 million (.12 percent of average loans
outstanding), compared with $90 million (.13 percent
of average loans outstanding) in 2005 and $196 million
(.29 percent of average loans outstanding) in 2004. The
year-over-year improvement in net charge-offs reflected lower
gross charge-offs, partially offset by a lower level of
recoveries. The Company expects commercial net charge-offs to
increase somewhat over the next several quarters due to higher
gross charge-offs from cyclical low levels and lower commercial
loan recoveries at this stage of the economic cycle. The
decrease in commercial and commercial real estate loan net
charge-offs in 2005 compared with 2004, was broad-based and
extended across most industries within the commercial loan
portfolio.

Retail loan net charge-offs in 2006 were $415 million
(.92 percent of average loans outstanding), compared with
$559 million (1.30 percent of average loans
outstanding) in 2005 and $542 million (1.36 percent of
average loans outstanding) in 2004. The decrease in retail loan
net charge-offs in 2006, compared with 2005, reflected the
impact of the bankruptcy legislation enacted in the fourth
quarter of 2005 and improved retail portfolio performance. The
Company anticipates charge-offs will return to more normalized
levels in future quarters. Higher amounts of retail loan net
charge-offs in 2005, compared with 2004, reflected the
bankruptcy legislation enacted in the fourth quarter of 2005.

The Company’s retail lending business utilizes several
distinct business processes and channels to originate retail
credit, including traditional branch credit, indirect lending
and a consumer finance division. Each distinct underwriting and
origination activity manages unique credit risk characteristics
and prices its loan production commensurate with the differing
risk profiles. Within Consumer Banking, U.S. Bank Consumer
Finance (“USBCF”) participates in substantially all
facets of the Company’s consumer lending activities. USBCF
specializes in serving channel-specific and alternative lending
markets in residential mortgages, home equity and installment
loan financing. USBCF manages loans originated through a broker
network, correspondent relationships and U.S. Bank branch
offices. Generally, loans managed by the Company’s consumer
finance division exhibit higher credit risk characteristics, but
are priced commensurate with the differing risk profile.

The following table provides an analysis of net charge-offs as a
percent of average loans outstanding managed by

Analysis and Determination of the Allowance for Credit
Losses

The allowance for
loan losses provides coverage for probable and estimable losses
inherent in the Company’s loan and lease portfolio.
Management evaluates the allowance each quarter to determine
that it is adequate to cover these inherent losses. The
evaluation of each element and the overall allowance is based on
a continuing assessment of problem loans, recent loss experience
and other factors, including regulatory guidance and economic
conditions. Because business processes and credit risks
associated with unfunded credit commitments are essentially the
same as for loans, the Company utilizes similar processes to
estimate its liability for unfunded credit commitments, which is
included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Both the allowance for loan losses and the liability for
unfunded credit commitments are included in the Company’s
analysis of credit losses.

At December 31, 2006, the allowance for credit losses was
$2,256 million (1.57 percent of loans), compared with
an allowance of $2,251 million (1.65 percent of loans)
at December 31, 2005, and $2,269 million
(1.82 percent of loans) at December 31, 2004. The
ratio of the allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans
was 480 percent at December 31, 2006, compared with
414 percent and 355 percent at December 31, 2005
and 2004, respectively. The ratio of the allowance for credit
losses to loan net charge-offs at December 31, 2006, was
415 percent, compared with 329 percent and
296 percent at December 31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. Management determined that the allowance for
credit losses was adequate at December 31, 2006.

Several factors were taken into consideration in evaluating the
allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2006, including
the risk profile of the portfolios and loan net charge-offs
during the period, the level of nonperforming assets, accruing
loans 90 days or more past due, delinquency ratios and
changes in restructured loan balances compared with
December 31, 2005. Management also considered the
uncertainty related to certain industry sectors, and the extent
of credit exposure to specific borrowers within the portfolio.
In addition, concentration risks associated with commercial real
estate and the mix of loans, including credit cards, loans
originated through the consumer finance division and residential
mortgages balances, and their relative credit risks were
evaluated. Finally, the Company considered current economic
conditions that might impact the portfolio. Management
determines the allowance that is required for specific loan
categories based on relative risk characteristics of the loan
portfolio. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its methods
for determining the allowance for each element of the portfolio
and makes enhancements considered appropriate. Table 17 shows
the amount of the allowance for credit losses by portfolio
category.

The allowance recorded for commercial and commercial real estate
loans is based, in part, on a regular review of individual
credit relationships. The Company’s risk rating process is
an integral component of the methodology utilized to determine
these elements of the allowance for credit losses. An allowance
for credit losses is established for pools of commercial and
commercial real estate loans and unfunded commitments based on
the risk ratings assigned. An analysis of the migration of
commercial and commercial real estate loans and actual loss
experience throughout the business cycle is conducted quarterly
to assess the exposure for credits with similar risk
characteristics. In addition to its risk rating process, the
Company separately analyzes the carrying value of impaired


U.S. BANCORP


Table 16

SUMMARY OF ALLOWANCE FOR
    CREDIT LOSSES

loans to determine whether the carrying value is less than or
equal to the appraised collateral value or the present value of
expected cash flows. Based on this analysis, an allowance for
credit losses may be specifically established for impaired
loans. The allowance established for commercial and commercial
real estate loan portfolios, including impaired commercial and
commercial real estate loans, was $955 million at
December 31, 2006, compared with

U.S. BANCORP



$929 million and $941 million at December 31,
2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in the allowance for
commercial and commercial real estate loans of $26 million at
December 31, 2006, compared with December 31, 2005,
reflected the impact of growth in the portfolios and a
$81 million increase related to changes in risk
classifications, offset somewhat by a $55 million reduction
related to changes in loss severity rates.

The allowance recorded for the residential mortgages and retail
loan portfolios is based on an analysis of product mix, credit
scoring and risk composition of the portfolio, loss and
bankruptcy experiences, economic conditions and historical and
expected delinquency and charge-off statistics for each
homogenous group of loans. Based on this information and
analysis, an allowance was established approximating a rolling
twelve-month estimate of net charge-offs. The allowance
established for residential mortgages was $58 million at
December 31, 2006, compared with $39 million and
$33 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. The increase in the allowance for the residential
mortgage portfolio year-over-year was primarily due to higher
loss rates, higher delinquencies and the seasoning of the
portfolio during 2006. The allowance established for retail
loans was $542 million at December 31, 2006, compared
with $558 million and $610 million at
December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decline in
the allowance for the retail portfolio in 2006 reflected
improved credit quality favorably impacting inherent loss ratios
and declining delinquency trends, partially offset by the impact
of portfolio growth.

Regardless of the extent of the Company’s analysis of
customer performance, portfolio trends or risk management
processes, certain inherent but undetected losses are probable
within the loan portfolios. This is due to several factors,
including inherent delays in obtaining information regarding a
customer’s financial condition or changes in their unique
business conditions, the judgmental nature of individual loan
evaluations, collateral assessments and the interpretation of
economic trends. Volatility of economic or customer-specific
conditions affecting the identification and estimation of losses
from larger non-homogeneous credits and the sensitivity of
assumptions utilized to establish allowances for homogeneous
groups of loans, loan portfolio concentrations, and other
subjective considerations are among other factors. Because of
these subjective factors, the process utilized to determine each
element of the allowance for credit losses by specific loan
category has some imprecision. As such, the Company estimates a
range of inherent losses in the portfolio based on statistical
analyses and management judgment, and maintains an
“allowance available for other factors” that is
related to but not allocated to a specific loan category. A
statistical analysis attempts to measure the extent of
imprecision and other uncertainty by determining the volatility
of losses over time across loan categories. Also, management
judgmentally considers loan concentrations, risks associated
with specific industries, the stage of the business cycle,
economic conditions and other qualitative factors. Based on this
process, the amount of the allowance available for other factors
was $701 million at December 31, 2006, compared with
$725 million at December 31, 2005, and
$685 million

at December 31, 2004. At December 31, 2006,
approximately $669 million was related to estimated
imprecision or uncertainty as described above. Of this amount,
commercial and commercial real estate represented approximately
69 percent while residential and retail loans represented
approximately 31 percent. The remaining allowance available
for other factors of $32 million was related to
concentration risk, including risks associated with the
residential construction and residential mortgage markets,
relative size of the consumer finance and commercial real estate
portfolios, highly leveraged enterprise-value credits and other
qualitative factors. Given the many subjective factors affecting
the credit portfolio, changes in the allowance for other factors
may not directly coincide with changes in the risk ratings or
the credit portfolio.

Although the Company determines the amount of each element of
the allowance separately and this process is an important credit
management tool, the entire allowance for credit losses is
available for the entire loan portfolio. The actual amount of
losses incurred can vary significantly from the estimated
amounts.

Residual Value Risk Management

The Company manages its risk
to changes in the residual value of leased assets through
disciplined residual valuation setting at the inception of a
lease, diversification of its leased assets, regular residual
asset valuation reviews and monitoring of residual value gains
or losses upon the disposition of assets. Commercial lease
originations are subject to the same well-defined underwriting
standards referred to in the “Credit Risk Management”
section which includes an evaluation of the residual risk.
Retail lease residual risk is mitigated further by originating
longer-term vehicle leases and effective

end-of

-term marketing
of off-lease vehicles. Also, to reduce the financial risk of
potential changes in vehicle residual values, the Company
maintains residual value insurance. The catastrophic insurance
maintained by the Company provides for the potential recovery of
losses on individual vehicle sales in an amount equal to the
difference between: (a) 105 percent or
110 percent of the average wholesale auction price for the
vehicle at the time of sale and (b) the vehicle residual
value specified by the Automotive Lease Guide (an authoritative
industry source) at the inception of the lease. The potential
recovery is calculated for each individual vehicle sold in a
particular policy year and is reduced by any gains realized on
vehicles sold during the same period. The Company will receive
claim proceeds under this insurance program if, in the
aggregate, there is a net loss for such period. In addition, the
Company obtains separate residual value insurance for all
vehicles at lease inception where end of lease term settlement
is based solely on the residual value of the individual leased
vehicles. Under this program, the potential recovery is computed
for each individual vehicle sold and does not allow the
insurance carrier to offset individual determined losses with
gains from other leases. This individual vehicle coverage is
included in the calculation of minimum lease payments when
making the capital lease assessment. To reduce the risk
associated with collecting insurance claims, the Company
monitors the financial viability of the insurance carrier based
on insurance industry ratings and available financial
information.

Included in the retail leasing portfolio was approximately
$4.3 billion of retail leasing residuals at
December 31, 2006 and 2005. The Company monitors
concentrations of leases by manufacturer and vehicle “make
and model.” As of December 31, 2006, vehicle lease
residuals related to sport utility vehicles were
42.7 percent of the portfolio while luxury and mid-range
vehicle classes represented approximately 23.4 percent and
11.8 percent, respectively. At year-end 2006, the largest
vehicle-type concentration represented approximately
7.2 percent of the aggregate residual value of the vehicles
in the portfolio. No other vehicle-type exceeded five percent of
the aggregate residual value of the portfolio. Because retail
residual valuations tend to be less volatile for longer-term
leases, relative to the estimated residual at inception of the
lease, the Company actively manages lease origination production
to achieve a longer-term portfolio. At December 31, 2006,
the weighted-average origination term of the portfolio was
50 months. During the past several years, new vehicles
sales volumes experienced strong growth driven by manufacturer
incentives, consumer spending levels and strong economic
conditions. In 2006, sales of new cars have softened somewhat
relative to a year ago. In part, this is due to domestic
manufacturers reducing sales incentives to consumers. This
softness in new vehicle sales became more pronounced during the
latter part of 2006. Current expectations are that sales of new
vehicles will trend downward in 2007. Given that
manufacturers’ inventories of vehicles have declined
somewhat during this period, this trend in sales should provide
support of residual valuations. With respect to used vehicles,
wholesale values for automobiles during 2004 and 2005 performed
better than wholesale values for trucks resulting in car prices
becoming somewhat inflated and truck prices declining over this
period. This has led to a shift in the comparative performance
of these two segments, resulting in car values experiencing a
decrease of 2.7 percent in 2006, while truck values have
experienced an improvement of 1.1 percent over the same
timeframe. Sport utility and truck values have also recovered
somewhat due to the impact of declining gas prices from earlier
in the year. The overall stability in the used car marketplace
combined with the mix of the Company’s lease residual
portfolio have caused the

U.S. BANCORP



exposure to retail lease residual impairments to be relatively
stable relative to a year ago.

At December 31, 2006, the commercial leasing portfolio had
$636 million of residuals, compared with $678 million
at December 31, 2005. At year-end 2006, lease residuals
related to trucks and other transportation equipment were
26.4 percent of the total residual portfolio. Railcars
represented 18.6 percent of the aggregate portfolio, while
business and office equipment and aircraft were
18.3 percent and 13.5 percent, respectively. No other
significant concentrations of more than 10 percent existed
at December 31, 2006. In 2006, residual values in general
remained stable or were favorable. The transportation industry
residual values improved for marine, rail and corporate
aircraft. Commercial aircraft continues to experience lower
values due to the abundance of supply and technological
efficiencies on newer models.

Operational Risk Management

Operational risk represents
the risk of loss resulting from the Company’s operations,
including, but not limited to, the risk of fraud by employees or
persons outside the Company, the execution of unauthorized
transactions by employees, errors relating to transaction
processing and technology, breaches of the internal control
system and compliance requirements and business continuation and
disaster recovery. This risk of loss also includes the potential
legal actions that could arise as a result of an operational
deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable
regulatory standards, adverse business decisions or their
implementation, and customer attrition due to potential negative
publicity.

The Company operates in many different businesses in diverse
markets and relies on the ability of its employees and systems
to process a high number of transactions. Operational risk is
inherent in all business activities, and the management of this
risk is important to the achievement of the Company’s
objectives. In the event of a breakdown in the internal control
system, improper operation of systems or improper
employees’ actions, the Company could suffer financial
loss, face regulatory action and suffer damage to its reputation.

The Company manages operational risk through a risk management
framework and its internal control processes. Within this
framework, the Corporate Risk Committee (“Risk
Committee”) provides oversight and assesses the most
significant operational risks facing the Company within its
business lines. Under the guidance of the Risk Committee,
enterprise risk management personnel establish policies and
interact with business lines to monitor significant operating
risks on a regular basis. Business lines have direct and primary
responsibility and accountability for identifying, controlling,
and monitoring operational risks embedded in their business
activities. Business managers maintain a system of controls with
the objective of providing proper transaction authorization and
execution, proper system operations, safeguarding of assets from
misuse or theft, and ensuring the reliability of financial and
other data. Business managers ensure that the controls are
appropriate and are implemented as designed.

Each business line within the Company has designated risk
managers. These risk managers are responsible for, among other
things, coordinating the completion of ongoing risk assessments
and ensuring that operational risk management is integrated into
business decision-making activities. Business continuation and
disaster recovery planning is also critical to effectively
manage operational risks. Each business unit of the Company is
required to develop, maintain and test these plans at least
annually to ensure that recovery activities, if needed, can
support mission critical functions including technology,
networks and data centers supporting customer applications and
business operations. The Company’s internal audit function
validates the system of internal controls through risk-based,
regular and ongoing audit procedures and reports on the
effectiveness of internal controls to executive management and
the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.

Customer-related business conditions may also increase
operational risk or the level of operational losses in certain
transaction processing business units, including merchant
processing activities. Ongoing risk monitoring of customer
activities and their financial condition and operational
processes serve to mitigate customer-related operational risk.
Refer to Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for further discussion on merchant processing.

While the Company believes that it has designed effective
methods to minimize operational risks, there is no absolute
assurance that business disruption or operational losses would
not occur in the event of a disaster. On an ongoing basis,
management makes process changes and investments to enhance its
systems of internal controls and business continuity and
disaster recovery plans.

Interest Rate Risk Management

In the banking industry, changes
in interest rates is a significant risk that can impact
earnings, market valuations and safety and soundness of an
entity. To minimize the volatility of net interest income and
the market value of assets and liabilities, the Company manages
its exposure to changes in interest rates through asset and
liability management activities within guidelines established by
its Asset Liability Policy Committee (“ALPC”) and
approved by the Board of Directors. ALPC has the responsibility
for approving and ensuring compliance with ALPC management
policies, including interest rate risk exposure. The Company
uses Net Interest Income Simulation Analysis and Market Value of
Equity


U.S. BANCORP


Modeling for measuring and analyzing consolidated interest rate
risk.

Net Interest Income Simulation Analysis

One of the primary tools used to
measure interest rate risk and the effect of interest rate
changes on net interest income is simulation analysis. The
monthly analysis incorporates substantially all of the
Company’s assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet
instruments, together with forecasted changes in the balance
sheet and assumptions that reflect the current interest rate
environment. Through this simulation, management estimates the
impact on net interest income of a 200 basis point upward
or downward gradual change of market interest rates over a

one-year

period. This
represents a change, effective in the first quarter of 2006,
from a previous policy of estimating the effect of a
300 basis point upward or downward gradual change in net
interest income. The simulation also estimates the effect of
immediate and sustained parallel shifts in the yield curve of
50 basis points as well as the effect of immediate and
sustained flattening or steepening of the yield curve. This
simulation includes assumptions about how the balance sheet is
likely to be affected by changes in loan and deposit growth.
Assumptions are made to project interest rates for new loans and
deposits based on historical analysis, management’s outlook
and repricing strategies. These assumptions are validated on a
periodic basis. A sensitivity analysis is provided for key
variables of the simulation. The results are reviewed by ALPC
monthly and are used to guide asset/liability management
strategies.

The table below summarizes the interest rate risk of net
interest income based on forecasts over the succeeding
12 months. At December 31, 2006, the Company’s
overall interest rate risk position was liability sensitive to
changes in interest rates. The Company manages its interest rate
risk position by holding assets on the balance sheet with
desired interest rate risk characteristics, implementing certain
pricing strategies for loans and deposits and through the
selection of derivatives and various funding and investment
portfolio strategies. The Company manages the overall interest
rate risk profile within policy limits. ALPC policy guidelines
limit the estimated change in net interest income to
3.0 percent of forecasted net interest income over the
succeeding 12 months. At December 31, 2006 and 2005
the Company was within its policy guidelines.

Market Value of Equity Modeling

The Company also utilizes the
market value of equity as a measurement tool in managing
interest rate sensitivity. The market value of equity measures
the degree to which the market values of the Company’s
assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments will
change given a change in interest rates. ALPC guidelines limit
the change in market value of equity in a 200 basis point
parallel rate shock to 15 percent of the market value of
equity assuming interest rates at December 31, 2006. The up
200 basis point scenario resulted in a 6.7 percent
decrease in the market value of equity at December 31,
2006, compared with a 6.8 percent decrease at
December 31, 2005. The down 200 basis point scenario
resulted in a 1.8 percent decrease in the market value of
equity at December 31, 2006, compared with a
4.1 percent decrease at December 31, 2005. At
December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company was within its
policy guidelines.

The valuation analysis is dependent upon certain key assumptions
about the nature of assets and liabilities with non-contractual
maturities. Management estimates the average life and rate
characteristics of asset and liability accounts based upon
historical analysis and management’s expectation of rate
behavior. These assumptions are validated on a periodic basis. A
sensitivity analysis of key variables of the valuation analysis
is provided to ALPC monthly and is used to guide asset/liability
management strategies. The Company also uses duration of equity
as a measure of interest rate risk. The duration of equity is a
measure of the net market value sensitivity of the assets,
liabilities and derivative positions of the Company. The
duration of assets was 1.8 years at December 31, 2006,
compared with 1.6 years at December 31, 2005. The
duration of liabilities was 1.9 years at December 31, 2006,
compared with 1.6 years at December 31, 2005. At
December 31, 2006, the duration of equity was
1.6 years, compared with 1.8 years at
December 31, 2005. The duration of equity measure shows
that sensitivity of the market value of equity of the Company
was liability sensitive to changes in interest rates.

Use of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate and Other
Risks

In the ordinary
course of business, the Company enters into derivative
transactions to manage its interest rate, prepayment, credit and
foreign currency risks (“asset and liability management
positions”) and to accommodate the business requirements of
its customers (“customer-

related positions”). To manage its interest rate risk, the
Company may enter into interest rate swap agreements and
interest rate options such as caps and floors. Interest rate
swaps involve the exchange of fixed-rate and variable-rate
payments without the exchange of the underlying notional amount
on which the interest payments are calculated. Interest rate
caps protect against rising interest rates while interest rate
floors protect against declining interest rates. In connection
with its mortgage banking operations, the Company enters into
forward commitments to sell mortgage loans related to fixed-rate
mortgage loans held for sale and fixed-rate mortgage loan
commitments. The Company also acts as a seller and buyer of
interest rate contracts and foreign exchange rate contracts on
behalf of customers. The Company minimizes its market and
liquidity risks by taking similar offsetting positions.

All interest rate derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting
are recorded at fair value as other assets or liabilities on the
balance sheet and are designated as either “fair
value” or “cash flow” hedges. The Company
performs an assessment, both at inception and quarterly
thereafter, when required, to determine whether these
derivatives are highly effective in offsetting changes in the
value of the hedged items. Hedge ineffectiveness for both cash
flow and


U.S. BANCORP


fair value hedges is recorded in noninterest income. Changes in
the fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges,
and changes in the fair value of the hedged items, are recorded
in earnings. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated
as cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income
until income from the cash flows of the hedged items is
realized. Customer-related interest rate swaps, foreign exchange
rate contracts, and all other derivative contracts that do not
qualify for hedge accounting are recorded at fair value and
resulting gains or losses are recorded in trading account gains
or losses or mortgage banking revenue. Gains or losses on
customer-related derivative positions were not material in 2006.

By their nature, derivative instruments are subject to market
risk. The Company does not utilize derivative instruments for
speculative purposes. Of the Company’s $32.9 billion
of total notional amount of asset and liability management
derivative positions at December 31, 2006,
$24.1 billion was designated as either fair value or cash
flow hedges, or net investment hedges of foreign operations. The
cash flow hedge derivative positions are interest rate swaps
that hedge the forecasted cash flows from the underlying
variable-rate debt. The fair value hedges are primarily interest
rate swaps that hedge the change in fair value related to
interest rate changes of underlying fixed-rate debt and
subordinated obligations.

In addition, the Company uses forward commitments to sell
residential mortgage loans to hedge its interest rate risk
related to residential mortgage loans held for sale. The Company
commits to sell the loans at specified prices in a future
period, typically within 90 days. The Company is exposed to
interest rate risk during the period between issuing a loan
commitment and the sale of the loan into the secondary market.
Related to its mortgage banking operations, the Company held
$1.4 billion of forward commitments to sell mortgage loans
and $1.3 billion of unfunded mortgage loan commitments that
were derivatives in accordance with the provisions of the
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133,
“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedge
Activities.” The unfunded mortgage loan commitments are
reported at fair value as options in Table 18. Beginning in
March 2006, the Company entered into U.S. Treasury futures
and options on U.S. Treasury futures contracts to
economically hedge the change in fair value related to the
election of fair value measurement for its residential MSRs.

Derivative instruments are also subject to credit risk
associated with counterparties to the derivative contracts.
Credit risk associated with derivatives is measured based on the
replacement cost should the counterparties with contracts in a
gain position to the Company fail to perform under the terms of
the contract. The Company manages this risk through
diversification of its derivative positions among various
counterparties, requiring collateral agreements with
credit-rating thresholds, entering into master netting
agreements in certain cases and entering into interest rate swap
risk participation agreements. These agreements transfer the
credit risk related to interest rate swaps from the Company to
an unaffiliated third-party. The Company also provides credit
protection to third-parties with risk participation agreements,
for a fee, as part of a loan syndication transaction.

At December 31, 2006, the Company had $83 million in
accumulated other comprehensive income related to realized and
unrealized losses on derivatives classified as cash flow hedges.
Unrealized gains and losses are reflected in earnings when the
related cash flows or hedged transactions occur and offset the
related performance of the hedged items. The estimated amount to
be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into
earnings during the next 12 months is a loss of
$29 million.

The change in fair value of forward commitments attributed to
hedge ineffectiveness recorded in noninterest income was a
decrease of $3 million and $4 million in 2006 and
2005, respectively. The change in the fair value of all other
asset and liability management derivative positions attributed
to hedge ineffectiveness was not material for 2006.

The Company enters into derivatives to protect its net
investment in certain foreign operations. The Company uses
forward commitments to sell specified amounts of certain foreign
currencies to hedge its capital volatility risk associated with
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The net amount
of gains or losses included in the cumulative translation
adjustment for 2006 was not material.

Table 18 summarizes information on the Company’s derivative
positions at December 31, 2006. Refer to Notes 1 and
19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
significant accounting policies and additional information
regarding the Company’s use of derivatives.

Market Risk Management

In
addition to interest rate risk, the Company is exposed to other
forms of market risk as a consequence of conducting normal
trading activities. These trading activities principally support
the risk management processes of the Company’s customers
including their management of foreign currency and interest rate
risks. The Company also manages market risk of non-trading
business activities including its MSRs and loans held-for-sale.
Value at Risk (“VaR”) is a key measure of market risk
for the Company. Theoretically, VaR represents the maximum
amount that the Company has placed at risk of loss, with a
ninety-ninth percentile degree of confidence, to adverse market
movements in the course of its risk taking activities.

U.S. BANCORP



Table 19

DEBT RATINGS

VaR modeling of trading activities is subject to certain
limitations. Additionally, it should be recognized that there
are assumptions and estimates associated with VaR modeling, and
actual results could differ from those assumptions and
estimates. The Company mitigates these uncertainties through
regular monitoring of trading activities by management and other
risk management practices, including stop-loss and position
limits related to its trading activities. Stress-test models are
used to provide management with perspectives on market events
that VaR models do not capture.

The Company establishes market risk limits, subject to approval
by the Company’s Board of Directors. Due to the election of
fair value measurement of its residential MSRs and related
hedging strategy during the first quarter of 2006, the Company
increased its VaR limit to $40 million at March 31,
2006, compared with $20 million at December 31, 2005.
The VaR limits were $3 million and $37 million at
December 31, 2006, for trading and non-trading market risk,
respectively. The Company’s market valuation risk, as
estimated by the VaR analysis, was $1 million and
$30 million at December 31, 2006, compared with
$1 million and less than $1 million at
December 31, 2005, for trading and non-trading positions,
respectively.

Liquidity Risk Management

ALPC establishes policies, as
well as analyzes and manages liquidity, to ensure that adequate
funds are available to meet normal operating requirements in
addition to unexpected customer demands for funds, such as high
levels of deposit withdrawals or loan demand, in a timely and
cost-effective manner. The most important factor in the
preservation of liquidity is maintaining public confidence that
facilitates the retention and growth of a large, stable supply
of core deposits and wholesale funds. Ultimately, public
confidence is generated through profitable operations, sound
credit quality and a strong capital position. The Company’s
performance in these areas has enabled it to develop a large and
reliable base of core funding within its market areas and in
domestic and global capital markets. Liquidity management is
viewed from long-term and short-term perspectives, as well as
from an asset and liability perspective. Management monitors
liquidity through a regular review of maturity profiles, funding
sources, and loan and deposit forecasts to minimize funding risk.

The Company maintains strategic liquidity and contingency plans
that are subject to the availability of asset liquidity in the
balance sheet. Monthly, ALPC reviews the Company’s ability
to meet funding requirements due to adverse business events.
These funding needs are then matched with specific asset-based
sources to ensure sufficient funds are available. Also,
strategic liquidity policies require diversification of
wholesale funding sources to avoid concentrations in any one
market source. Subsidiary companies are members of various
Federal Home Loan Banks that provide a source of funding
through FHLB advances. The Company maintains a Grand Cayman
branch for issuing eurodollar time deposits. The Company also
issues commercial paper through its Canadian branch. In
addition, the Company establishes relationships with dealers to
issue national market retail and institutional savings
certificates and short- and medium-term bank notes. The
Company’s subsidiary banks also have significant
correspondent banking networks and corporate accounts.
Accordingly, the Company has access to national fed funds,
funding through repurchase agreements and sources of stable,
regionally-based certificates of deposit and commercial paper.

The Company’s ability to raise negotiated funding at
competitive prices is influenced by rating agencies’ views
of the Company’s credit quality, liquidity, capital and
earnings. On September 13, 2006, Fitch revised the
Company’s outlook to “Positive”. On
October 26, 2006, Dominion Bond Rating Service upgraded the
Company’s senior and unsecured subordinated debt ratings to
AA and

On February 14, 2007, Standard & Poor’s
Ratings Services upgraded the Company’s credit ratings to

AA/A-1+.

At
February 14, 2007, the credit ratings outlook for the
Company was considered “Positive” by Fitch and
“Stable” by Standard & Poor’s Ratings
Services, Moody’s Investors Service and Dominion Bond
Ratings Service. The debt ratings noted in Table 19 reflect
the rating agencies’ recognition of the Company’s
sector-leading core earnings performance and lower credit risk
profile.

The parent company’s routine funding requirements consist
primarily of operating expenses, dividends paid to shareholders,
debt service, repurchases of common stock and funds used for
acquisitions. The parent company obtains funding to meet its
obligations from dividends collected from its subsidiaries and
the issuance of debt securities.

At December 31, 2006, parent company long-term debt
outstanding was $11.4 billion, compared with
$10.9 billion at December 31, 2005. The
$.5 billion increase was primarily due to issuances of
$2.5 billion of junior subordinated debentures,
$2.5 billion of convertible senior debentures and
$1.5 billion of medium-term notes, offset by long-term debt
maturities and repayments during 2006. Total parent company debt
scheduled to mature in 2007 is $1.5 billion. These debt
obligations may be met through medium-term note and capital
security issuances and dividends from subsidiaries, as well as
from parent company cash and cash equivalents.

Federal banking laws regulate the amount of dividends that may
be paid by banking subsidiaries without prior approval. The
amount of dividends available to the parent company from its
banking subsidiaries after meeting the regulatory capital
requirements for well-capitalized banks was approximately
$1.1 billion at December 31, 2006. For further
information, see Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Refer to Table 20 for further information on significant
contractual obligations at December 31, 2006.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Off-balance sheet arrangements
include any contractual arrangement to which an unconsolidated
entity is a party, under which the Company has an obligation to
provide credit or liquidity enhancements or market risk support.
Off-balance sheet arrangements include certain defined
guarantees, asset securitization trusts and conduits.
Off-balance sheet arrangements also include any obligation under
a variable interest held by an unconsolidated entity that
provides financing, liquidity, credit enhancement or market risk
support.

In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into an
array of commitments to extend credit, letters of credit and
various forms of guarantees that may be considered off-balance
sheet arrangements. The nature and extent of these arrangements
are provided in Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Asset securitizations and conduits represent a source of funding
for the Company through off-balance sheet structures. Credit,
liquidity, operational and legal structural risks exist due to
the nature and complexity of asset securitizations and other
off-balance sheet structures. ALPC regularly monitors the
performance of each off-balance sheet structure in an effort to
minimize these risks and ensure compliance with the requirements
of the structures. The Company utilizes its credit risk
management systems to evaluate the credit quality of underlying
assets and regularly forecasts cash flows to evaluate any
potential impairment of retained interests. Also, regulatory
guidelines require consideration of asset securitizations in the
determination of risk-based capital ratios. The Company does not
rely significantly on off-balance sheet arrangements for
liquidity or capital resources.

The Company sponsors an off-balance sheet conduit, a qualified
special purpose entity (“QSPE”), to which it
transferred high-grade investment securities, funded by the
issuance of commercial paper. Because QSPEs are exempt from
consolidation under the provisions of Financial Accounting
Standards Board Interpretation No. 46R, “Consolidation
of Variable Interest Entities” (“FIN 46R”),
the Company does not consolidate the conduit structure in

U.S. BANCORP



Table 21

REGULATORY CAPITAL RATIOS

its financial statements. The conduit held assets of
$2.2 billion at December 31, 2006, and
$3.8 billion at December 31, 2005. These investment
securities include primarily (i) private label asset-backed
securities, which are insurance “wrapped” by AAA/
Aaa–rated mono-line insurance companies and
(ii) government agency mortgage-backed securities and
collateralized mortgage obligations. The conduit had commercial
paper liabilities of $2.2 billion at December 31,
2006, and $3.8 billion at December 31, 2005. The
Company provides a liquidity facility to the conduit.
Utilization of the liquidity facility would be triggered if the
conduit is unable to, or does not, issue commercial paper to
fund its assets. A liability for the estimate of the potential
risk of loss for the Company as the liquidity facility provider
is recorded on the balance sheet in other liabilities. The
liability is adjusted downward over time as the underlying
assets pay down with the offset recognized as other noninterest
income. The liability for the liquidity facility was
$10 million and $20 million at December 31, 2006
and 2005, respectively. In addition, the Company recorded at
fair value its retained residual interest in the investment
securities conduit of $13 million and $28 million at
December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Capital Management

The
Company is committed to managing capital for maximum shareholder
benefit and maintaining strong protection for depositors and
creditors. The Company has targeted returning 80 percent of
earnings to its common shareholders through a combination of
dividends and share repurchases. During 2006, the Company
returned 112 percent of earnings. The Company continually
assesses its business risks and capital position. The Company
also manages its capital to exceed regulatory capital
requirements for well-capitalized bank holding companies. To
achieve these capital goals, the Company employs a variety of
capital management tools including dividends, common share
repurchases, and the issuance of subordinated debt and other
capital instruments. Total shareholders’ equity was
$21.2 billion at December 31, 2006, compared with
$20.1 billion at December 31, 2005. The increase was
the result of corporate earnings and the issuance of
$1.0 billion of non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock on
March 27, 2006, partially offset by share repurchases and
dividends.

On December 12, 2006, the Company increased its dividend
rate per common share by 21.2 percent, from $.33 per
quarter to $.40 per quarter. On December 20, 2005, the
Company increased its dividend rate per common share by
10.0 percent, from $.30 per quarter to $.33 per
quarter.

On December 21, 2004, the Board of Directors approved and
announced an authorization to repurchase 150 million
shares of common stock during the next 24 months. In 2005,
the Company repurchased 62 million shares under the 2004
authorization. The average price paid for the shares repurchased
in 2005 was $29.37 per share. On August 3, 2006, the
Company announced that the Board of Directors approved an
authorization to repurchase 150 million shares of
common stock through December 31, 2008. This new
authorization replaced the December 21, 2004, share
repurchase program. During 2006, the Company repurchased
62 million shares

under the 2004 authorization and 28 million shares under
the 2006 authorization. The average price paid for all shares
repurchased in 2006 was $31.35 per share. For a complete
analysis of activities impacting shareholders’ equity and

Banking regulators define minimum capital requirements for banks
and financial services holding companies. These requirements are
expressed in the form of a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio,
total risk-based capital ratio, and Tier 1 leverage ratio.
The minimum required level for these ratios is 4.0 percent,
8.0 percent, and 4.0 percent, respectively. The
Company targets its regulatory capital levels, at both the bank
and bank holding company level, to exceed the
“well-capitalized” threshold for these ratios of
6.0 percent, 10.0 percent, and 5.0 percent,
respectively. All regulatory ratios, at both the bank and bank
holding company level, continue to be in excess of stated
“well-capitalized” requirements.

Table 21 provides a summary of capital ratios as of
December 31, 2006 and 2005, including Tier 1 and total
risk-based capital ratios, as defined by the regulatory
agencies. During 2007, the Company expects to target capital
level ratios of 8.5 percent Tier 1 capital and
12.0 percent total risk-based capital on a consolidated
basis.

FOURTH QUARTER SUMMARY

The Company reported net income of $1,194 million for the
fourth quarter of 2006, or $.66 per diluted common share,
compared with $1,143 million, or $.62 per diluted
common share, for the fourth quarter of 2005. Return on average
assets and return on average common equity were
2.18 percent and 23.2 percent, respectively, for the
fourth quarter of 2006, compared with returns of
2.18 percent and 22.6 percent, respectively, for the
fourth quarter of 2005. The Company’s results for the
fourth quarter of 2006 improved over the same period of 2005, as
net income rose by $51 million (4.5 percent),
primarily due to growth in fee-based revenues, lower credit
costs and the benefit of a reduction in the effective tax rate
from a year ago. This improvement was offset somewhat by lower
net interest income and additional operating costs of acquired
businesses. In addition, the Company’s results reflect a
$52 million gain in the fourth quarter of 2006 from the sale

of a 401(k) defined contribution recordkeeping business and a
$60 million favorable change in net securities gains
(losses) as compared with the fourth quarter of 2005.

Total net revenue, on a taxable-equivalent basis for the fourth
quarter of 2006, was $93 million (2.8 percent) higher
than the fourth quarter of 2005, primarily reflecting an
11.8 percent increase in noninterest income partially
offset by a 5.0 percent decline in net interest income.
Noninterest income growth was driven by organic business growth
and expansion in trust and payment processing businesses,
partially offset by lower mortgage banking revenue principally
due to the impact of adopting SFAS 156 in the first quarter
of 2006 and the net valuation loss on economic hedges in
relation to the value of MSRs due to relative changes in
interest rates at the end of 2006.

Fourth quarter net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent
basis was $1,695 million, compared with $1,785 million
in the fourth quarter of 2005. Average earning assets increased
$6.6 billion (3.6 percent), primarily driven by a
$7.0 billion (5.1 percent) increase in total average
loans, partially offset by a $1.2 billion
(3.0 percent) decrease in investment securities. The
positive impact to net interest income from the growth in
earning assets was more than offset by a lower net interest
margin. The net interest margin in the fourth quarter of 2006
was 3.56 percent, compared with 3.88 percent in the
fourth quarter of 2005. The decline in net interest margin
reflected the competitive lending environment and the impact of
changes in the yield curve from a year ago. Since the fourth
quarter of 2005, credit spreads have tightened by approximately
15 basis points across most lending products due to
competitive pricing and a change in mix reflecting growth in
lower-spread fixed-rate credit products and noninterest-bearing
corporate and purchasing card balances. The net interest margin
also declined due to funding incremental asset growth with
higher cost wholesale funding, share repurchases and
asset/liability decisions designed to reduce the Company’s
interest rate sensitivity position. An increase in the margin
benefit of net free funds partially offset these factors.

Noninterest income in the fourth quarter of 2006 was
$1,729 million, compared with $1,546 million in the
same period of 2005. The $183 million (11.8 percent)
increase was driven by favorable variances in the majority of
fee income categories and a favorable variance of
$60 million on net securities gains (losses). Strong growth
in fee-based revenue was partially offset by the accounting
impact of SFAS 156 on mortgage banking revenue. Credit and
debit card revenue and corporate payment products revenue were
both higher in the fourth quarter of 2006 than the fourth
quarter of 2005 by $13 million (6.6 percent) and
$15 million (11.9 percent), respectively. The strong
growth in credit and debit card revenue was primarily driven by
higher customer transaction volumes. The corporate payment
products revenue growth reflected organic growth in sales
volumes and card usage and acquired business expansion. Merchant
processing services revenue was higher in the fourth quarter of
2006 than the same quarter a year ago by $50 million
(25.8 percent), reflecting an increase in sales volume
driven by acquisitions, higher same store sales, new merchant
signings and associated equipment fees. Trust and investment
management fees increased by $61 million
(23.6 percent) year-over-year, due to recent acquisitions
of corporate and institutional trust businesses, customer
account growth and favorable equity market conditions. Deposit
service charges grew year-over-year by $21 million
(8.8 percent) due to increased transaction-related fees and
the impact of net new checking accounts. These favorable changes
in fee-based revenue were partially offset by the decline in
mortgage banking revenue of $84 million
(77.1 percent), principally driven by the adoption of the
fair value method of accounting for MSRs and economic hedging
results in the fourth quarter of 2006 due to changes in relative
interest rates at year end. Other income was higher by
$43 million (25.3 percent) as compared with the fourth
quarter of 2005, primarily due to a $52 million gain on the
sale of a 401(k) defined contribution recordkeeping business and
$6 million in trading gains related to certain interest
rate swaps that the Company determined did not qualify for hedge
accounting, partially offset by a decline in equity investment
revenue from a year ago.

Noninterest expense was $1,612 million in the fourth
quarter of 2006, an increase of $148 million
(10.1 percent) from the fourth quarter of 2005.
Compensation expense was higher year-over-year by
$20 million (3.3 percent), primarily due to the
corporate and institutional trust and payments processing
acquisitions and other growth initiatives undertaken by the
Company. Employee benefits expense remained flat from the fourth
quarter of 2005 as higher pension costs from a year ago were
offset by lower medical benefits costs due to favorable claims
experience. Professional services expense increased
$22 million (46.8 percent) due primarily to revenue
enhancement-related business initiatives, including establishing
a bank charter in Ireland to support pan-European payment
processing. Other intangibles expense increased $11 million
(13.6 percent) from the prior year due to acquisitions in
Consumer Banking, Wealth Management and Payment Services. Other
expense increased in the fourth quarter of 2006 from the same
quarter of 2005 by $69 million (32.9 percent),
primarily due to increased investments in tax-advantaged
projects and business integration costs relative to a year ago.
In addition, noninterest expense in the fourth quarter of 2006
was impacted by $22 million in charges related to the
prepayment of certain trust preferred debt securities.


U.S. BANCORP


The provision for credit losses for the fourth quarter of 2006
was $169 million, a decrease of $36 million from the
fourth quarter of 2005. The decrease in the provision for credit
losses year-over-year reflected the adverse impact in the fourth
quarter of 2005 on net charge-offs from changes in bankruptcy
law. Net charge-offs in the fourth quarter of 2006 were
$169 million, compared with net charge-offs of
$213 million during the fourth quarter of 2005.

The provision for income taxes for the fourth quarter of 2006
declined to an effective tax rate of 26.7 percent from an
effective tax rate of 30.8 percent in the fourth quarter of
2005. The reduction in the effective rate from the same quarter
of the prior year reflected incremental tax credits from
tax-advantaged investments and a reduction in tax liabilities
after the resolution of federal tax examinations for all years
through 2004 and certain state tax examinations during the
fourth quarter of 2006. The Company anticipates its effective
tax rate for the foreseeable future to approximate
32 percent.

LINE OF BUSINESS FINANCIAL REVIEW

Within the Company, financial performance is measured by major
lines of business, which include Wholesale Banking, Consumer
Banking, Wealth Management, Payment Services, and Treasury and
Corporate Support. These operating segments are components of
the Company about which financial information is available and
is evaluated regularly in deciding how to allocate resources and
assess performance.

Basis for Financial Presentation

Business line results are
derived from the Company’s business unit profitability
reporting systems by specifically attributing managed balance
sheet assets, deposits and other liabilities and their related
income or expense. Goodwill and other intangible assets are
assigned to the lines of business based on the mix of business
of the acquired entity. Within the Company, capital levels are
evaluated and managed centrally; however, capital is allocated
to the operating segments to support evaluation of business
performance. Business lines are allocated capital on a
risk-adjusted basis considering economic and regulatory capital
requirements. Generally, the determination of the amount of
capital allocated to each business line includes credit and
operational capital allocations following a Basel II
regulatory framework adjusted for regulatory Tier 1
leverage requirements. Interest income and expense is determined
based on the assets and liabilities managed by the business
line. Because funding and asset liability management is a
central function, funds transfer-pricing methodologies are
utilized to allocate a cost of funds used or credit for funds
provided to all business line assets and liabilities,
respectively, using a matched funding concept. Also, each
business unit is allocated the taxable-equivalent benefit of
tax-exempt products. The residual effect on net interest income
of asset/liability management activities is included in Treasury
and Corporate Support. Noninterest income and expenses directly
managed by each business line, including fees, service charges,
salaries and benefits, and other direct revenues and costs are
accounted for within each segment’s financial results in a
manner similar to the consolidated financial statements.
Occupancy costs are allocated based on utilization of facilities
by the lines of business. Generally, operating losses are
charged to the line of business when the loss event is realized
in a manner similar to a loan charge-off. Noninterest expenses
incurred by centrally managed operations or business lines that
directly support another business line’s operations are
charged to the applicable business line based on its utilization
of those services primarily measured by the volume of customer
activities, number of employees or other relevant factors. These
allocated expenses are reported as net shared services expense
within noninterest expense. Certain activities that do not
directly support the operations of the lines of business or for
which the line of business is not considered financially
accountable in evaluating their performance are not charged to
the lines of business. The income or expenses associated with
these corporate activities is reported within the Treasury and
Corporate Support line of business. The provision for credit
losses within the Wholesale Banking, Consumer Banking, Wealth
Management and Payment Services lines of business is based on
net charge-offs, while Treasury and Corporate Support reflects
the residual component of the Company’s total consolidated
provision for credit losses determined in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
Income taxes are assessed to each line of business at a standard
tax rate with the residual tax expense or benefit to arrive at
the consolidated effective tax rate included in Treasury and
Corporate Support.

Designations, assignments and allocations change from time to
time as management systems are enhanced, methods of evaluating
performance or product lines change or business segments are
realigned to better respond to the Company’s diverse
customer base. During 2006, certain organization and methodology
changes were made and, accordingly, 2005 results were restated
and presented on a comparable basis, including a change in the
allocation of risk adjusted capital to the business lines. Due
to organizational and methodology changes, the Company’s
basis of financial presentation differed in 2004. The
presentation of comparative business line results for 2004 is
not practical and has not been provided.

Wholesale Banking

offers
lending, equipment finance and small-ticket leasing, depository,
treasury management, capital markets, foreign exchange,
international trade services and other financial services to
middle market, large corporate, commercial real estate, and
public sector clients. Wholesale Banking contributed
$1,194 million of the Company’s net income in 2006, an
increase of $18 million (1.5 percent), compared with
2005. The increase was primarily driven by growth in total net
revenue.

Total net revenue increased $29 million (1.0 percent)
in 2006, compared with 2005. Net interest income, on a
taxable-equivalent basis, increased $20 million
(1.1 percent) in 2006, compared with 2005, driven by growth
in average loan balances of $2.4 billion (5.0 percent)
and wider spreads on total deposits due to their funding benefit
during a rising interest rate environment, partially offset by
reduced credit spreads due to competitive pricing. The increase
in average loans was primarily driven by commercial loan growth
during 2006. Commercial real estate loan growth was somewhat
slower than prior years due to the general slowdown in
homebuilding, a decision by the Company to reduce the level of
construction financing for condominium projects and the extent
of refinancing activities. The $9 million
(1.0 percent) increase in noninterest income in 2006,
compared with 2005, was due to gains from the sale of securities
acquired during a loan workout and higher commercial products
revenue, including equipment leasing residual gains, partially
offset by lower other non-yield commercial loan and letter of
credit fees due to price compression in the competitive lending
environment. The change in noninterest income also reflected
lower revenues during 2006 from equity investments.

Noninterest expense was unchanged in 2006 compared with 2005, as
slightly higher compensation expense was offset by lower net
shared services and other non-personnel expenses.

The provision for credit losses increased $3 million in
2006, compared with 2005. The unfavorable change was primarily
due to fewer commercial loan recoveries during the year. Credit
quality continued to be strong within this

Consumer Banking

delivers
products and services through banking offices, telephone
servicing and sales, on-line services, direct mail and ATMs. It
encompasses community banking, metropolitan banking, in-store
banking, small business banking, consumer lending, mortgage
banking, consumer finance, workplace banking, student banking
and

24-hour

banking.
Consumer Banking contributed $1,793 million of the
Company’s net income in 2006, an increase of
$101 million (6.0 percent), compared with 2005. While
the retail banking business grew net income 8.5 percent in
2006, the contribution of the mortgage banking business declined
25.6 percent, compared with 2005. The decline in the
mortgage banking division was driven by a lower average
warehouse portfolio and origination gains, adverse changes in
the valuation of MSRs and related economic hedges due to changes
in relative interest rates and the Company’s adoption of
SFAS 156 in early 2006.

Total net revenue declined $34 million (.6 percent) in
2006, compared with 2005. Net interest income, on a
taxable-equivalent basis, increased $93 million in 2006,
compared with 2005. The year-over-year increase in net interest
income was due to growth in average loans of 7.7 percent
and the funding benefit of deposits due to rising interest
rates. Partially offsetting these increases were reduced spreads
on commercial and retail loans due to competitive pricing within
the Company’s markets. The increase in average loan
balances reflected strong growth in residential mortgages and
more moderate growth in retail loans, commercial real estate
loans and commercial loans. Residential mortgages, including
traditional residential mortgages and first-lien home equity
loans, grew

U.S. BANCORP



16.9 percent in 2006, compared with 2005. This growth rate
reflected the Company’s retention of adjustable-rate
residential mortgages throughout 2005 given the rising rate
environment. However, during the first quarter of 2006, the
Company began to moderate the growth of the residential mortgage
portfolio by selling an increased proportion of its residential
loan production into the secondary markets. Within the retail
loan category, the Company experienced strong growth in
installment and credit card loan balances. This growth was
offset by a reduction in retail leasing balances due to pricing
competition. The year-over-year decrease in average deposits of
2.3 percent reflected a reduction in savings and
noninterest-bearing deposit products, offset somewhat by growth
in time deposits and interest checking. Average time deposit
balances grew $1.6 billion (9.4 percent) in 2006,
compared with the prior year, as a portion of
noninterest-bearing and money market balances migrated to
fixed-rate time deposit products. Average savings balances
declined $3.1 billion (12.7 percent) compared with
2005, principally related to money market accounts. Fee-based
noninterest income within Consumer Banking decreased
$127 million in 2006, compared with 2005. Within the retail
banking division, fee-based revenues grew 5.4 percent from
a year ago, driven

by growth in deposit service charges from increased
transaction-related services and net new checking accounts and
higher gains from student loan sales. Noninterest income of the
mortgage banking division decreased by $202 million from a
year ago. The reduction in mortgage banking revenue reflected
the impact of adopting a fair value accounting methodology for
MSRs as of January 1, 2006.

Noninterest expense decreased $154 million
(5.8 percent) in 2006, compared with the prior year. The
decrease was primarily related to the adoption of SFAS 156
which caused the elimination of MSR amortization from other
intangible expense. The net impact of this change reduced
noninterest expense by approximately $196 million from the
prior year. Partially offsetting this decrease were increases in
compensation and employee benefits expenses, reflecting the
impact of the net addition of 26 in-store and 27 traditional
branches at December 31, 2006, compared with
December 31, 2005, as well as higher professional services
expense due to revenue enhancement-related business initiatives
in 2006.

The provision for credit losses decreased $38 million in
2006, compared with 2005. The improvement was primarily
attributed to strong credit quality during the year. As a
percentage of average loans outstanding, net charge-offs
declined to .35 percent in 2006, compared with
..43 percent in 2005. The decline in net charge-offs was
primarily driven by a $41 million decrease in retail loan
and residential mortgage net charge-offs, primarily due to lower
bankruptcy losses. Commercial and commercial real estate loan
net charge-offs increased $2 million in 2006, compared with
2005. Nonperforming assets within Consumer Banking were
$283 million at December 31, 2006, compared with
$315 million at December 31, 2005. Nonperforming
assets as a percentage of

end-of

-period loans
were .40 percent at December 31, 2006, compared with
..47 percent at December 31, 2005. Refer to the
“Corporate Risk Profile” section for further
information on factors impacting the credit quality of the loan
portfolios.

Wealth Management

provides
trust, private banking, financial advisory, investment
management, retail brokerage services, insurance, custody and
mutual fund servicing through six businesses: Private Client
Group, Corporate Trust, U.S. Bancorp Investments and
Insurance, FAF Advisors, Institutional Trust and Custody and
Fund Services. During 2006, Wealth Management contributed
$589 million of the Company’s net income, an increase
of $110 million (23.0 percent) compared with 2005. The
growth was primarily attributed to organic customer account
growth and the impact of recent acquisitions.

Total net revenue increased $309 million
(18.8 percent) in 2006, compared with 2005. Net interest
income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, grew by 16.4 percent
from the prior year. The increase in net interest income was due
to 7.7 percent growth in average loan balances, strong
growth in total average deposits and the favorable impact of
rising interest rates on the funding benefit of customer
deposits, partially offset by a decline in credit spreads. The
increase in total deposits was attributed to growth in
noninterest-bearing deposits and time deposits principally due
to acquired businesses. Noninterest income increased
$238 million in 2006, compared with 2005, driven by organic
customer account growth during the year, increased asset
management fees given favorable equity market conditions and the
benefits of recent acquisitions of corporate and institutional
trust businesses.

Noninterest expense increased $136 million
(15.4 percent) in 2006, compared with 2005, primarily
attributed to the recent acquisitions of corporate and
institutional trust businesses.

Payment Services

includes
consumer and business credit cards, stored-value cards, debit
cards, corporate and purchasing card services, consumer lines of
credit, ATM processing and merchant processing. Payment Services
contributed $967 million of the Company’s net income
in 2006, or an increase of $238 million
(32.6 percent), compared with 2005. The increase was due to
growth in total net revenue, driven by strong loan growth,
higher transaction volumes, and a lower provision for credit
losses, partially offset by an increase in total noninterest
expense.


U.S. BANCORP


Total net revenue increased $456 million
(16.4 percent) in 2006, compared with 2005. The 2006
increase in net interest income of $61 million, compared
with the prior year, was attributed to growth in higher yielding
retail and commercial credit card loan balances, partially
offset by an increase in noninterest-bearing corporate payments
loan products and non-earning intangible assets that resulted in
higher funding expense. Noninterest income increased
$395 million in 2006, or 18.1 percent compared with
2005. The increase in fee-based revenue was driven by strong
growth in credit and debit card revenue, corporate payment
products revenue and merchant processing services revenue.
Credit and debit card revenue increased primarily due to higher
customer transaction volumes. Corporate payment products revenue
reflected organic growth in sales volumes and card usage and
acquired business expansion. Merchant processing services
revenue grew due to an increase in sales volume driven by
acquisitions, higher same store sales, new merchant signings and
associated equipment fees. Also, included in noninterest income
for 2006 was a $10 million favorable settlement award
related to the Company’s merchant processing business.

Noninterest expense increased $185 million
(14.8 percent) in 2006, compared with 2005, primarily
attributed to the acquisition of merchant acquiring and
corporate payments businesses, higher compensation and employee
benefit costs for processing activities associated with
increased transaction processing volumes and higher ATM
processing services volumes.

The provision for credit losses decreased $102 million in
2006, compared with 2005, due to lower net charge-offs. As a
percentage of average loans outstanding, net charge-offs were
2.26 percent in 2006, compared with 3.38 percent in
2005.

Treasury and Corporate Support

includes the Company’s
investment portfolios, funding, capital management and asset
securitization activities, interest rate risk management, the
net effect of transfer pricing related to average balances and
the residual aggregate of those expenses associated with
corporate activities that are managed on a consolidated basis.
In addition, prior to the adoption of SFAS 156, changes in
MSR valuations due to interest rate changes were managed at a
corporate level and, as such, reported within this business unit
in noninterest expenses. During 2006, Treasury and Corporate
Support recorded net income of $208 million, a decrease of
$205 million compared with 2005.

Total net revenue decreased $257 million
(80.6 percent) in 2006, compared with 2005, primarily due
to a $543 million decrease in net interest income,
partially offset by higher noninterest income. The decline of
net interest income reflected the impact of a flatter yield
curve and asset/liability management decisions, including
reducing the investment securities portfolio, changes in
interest rate derivative positions and the repayment and
issuance of longer-term fixed rate wholesale funding. The
increase in noninterest income was driven by gains recognized in
2006 from the initial public offering and subsequent sale of
equity interests in a card association, trading income
recognized from certain derivatives that did not qualify as
accounting hedges, a gain on sale of a 401(k) defined
contribution recordkeeping business in 2006, and net securities
losses incurred in 2005.

Noninterest expense increased $150 million in 2006,
compared with 2005. The year-over-year increase reflected higher
integration costs related to recent acquisitions, operating
costs associated with tax-advantaged investments, and
reparations related to MSR valuations during 2005.

The provision for credit losses for this business unit
represents the residual aggregate of the net credit losses
allocated to the reportable business units and the
Company’s recorded provision determined in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
Refer to the “Corporate Risk Profile” section for
further information on the provision for credit losses,
nonperforming assets and factors considered by the Company in
assessing the credit quality of the loan portfolio and
establishing the allowance for credit losses.

Income taxes are assessed to each line of business at a
managerial tax rate of 36.4 percent with the residual tax
expense or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax
rate included in Treasury and Corporate Support. The
consolidated effective tax rate of the Company was
30.8 percent in 2006, compared with 31.7 percent in
2005. The decrease in the effective tax rate from 2005 primarily
reflected higher tax exempt income from investment securities
and insurance products and incremental tax credits generated
from investments in affordable housing and similar
tax-advantaged projects.

U.S. BANCORP



CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The accounting and reporting policies of the Company comply with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
and conform to general practices within the banking industry.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions. The financial position and
results of operations can be affected by these estimates and
assumptions, which are integral to understanding the
Company’s financial statements. Critical accounting
policies are those policies that management believes are the
most important to the portrayal of the Company’s financial
condition and results, and require management to make estimates
that are difficult, subjective or complex. Most accounting
policies are not considered by management to be critical
accounting policies. Several factors are considered in
determining whether or not a policy is critical in the
preparation of financial statements. These factors include,
among other things, whether the estimates are significant to the
financial statements, the nature of the estimates, the ability
to readily validate the estimates with other information
including third-parties or available prices, and sensitivity of
the estimates to changes in economic conditions and whether
alternative accounting methods may be utilized under generally
accepted accounting principles. Management has discussed the
development and the selection of critical accounting policies
with the Company’s Audit Committee.

Significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Those policies
considered to be critical accounting policies are described
below.

Allowance for Credit Losses

The allowance for credit
losses is established to provide for probable losses inherent in
the Company’s credit portfolio. The methods utilized to
estimate the allowance for credit losses, key assumptions and
quantitative and qualitative information considered by
management in determining the adequacy of the allowance for
credit losses are discussed in the “Credit Risk
Management” section.

Management’s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance
for credit losses is often the most critical of accounting
estimates for a banking institution. It is an inherently
subjective process impacted by many factors as discussed
throughout the Management’s Discussion and Analysis section
of the Annual Report. Although risk management practices,
methodologies and other tools are utilized to determine each
element of the allowance, degrees of imprecision exist in these
measurement tools due in part to subjective judgments involved
and an inherent lagging of credit quality measurements relative
to the stage of the business cycle. Even determining the stage
of the business cycle is highly subjective. As discussed in the
“Analysis and Determination of Allowance for Credit
Losses” section, management considers the effect of
imprecision and many other factors in determining the allowance
for credit losses by establishing an “allowance available
for other factors” that is not specifically allocated to a
category of loans. If not considered, inherent losses in the
portfolio related to imprecision and other subjective factors
could have a dramatic adverse impact on the liquidity and
financial viability of a bank.

Given the many subjective factors affecting the credit
portfolio, changes in the allowance for credit losses may not
directly coincide with changes in the risk ratings of the credit
portfolio reflected in the risk rating process. This is in part
due to the timing of the risk rating process in relation to
changes in the business cycle, the exposure and mix of loans
within risk rating categories, levels of nonperforming loans and
the timing of charge-offs and recoveries. For example, the
amount of loans within specific risk ratings may change,
providing a leading indicator of improving credit quality, while
nonperforming loans and net charge-offs continue at elevated
levels. Also, inherent loss ratios, determined through migration
analysis and historical loss performance over the estimated
business cycle of a loan, may not change to the same degree as
net charge-offs. Because risk ratings and inherent loss ratios
primarily drive the allowance specifically allocated to
commercial loans, the amount of the allowance for commercial and
commercial real estate loans might decline; however, the degree
of change differs somewhat from the level of changes in
nonperforming loans and net charge-offs. Also, management would
maintain an adequate allowance for credit losses by increasing
the allowance for other factors during periods of economic
uncertainty or changes in the business cycle.

Some factors considered in determining the adequacy of the
allowance for credit losses are quantifiable while other factors
require qualitative judgment. Management conducts analysis with
respect to the accuracy of risk ratings and the volatility of
inherent losses, and utilizes this analysis along with
qualitative factors including uncertainty in the economy from
changes in unemployment rates, the level of bankruptcies,
concentration risks, including risks associated with the airline
industry sector and highly leveraged enterprise-value credits,
in determining the overall level of the allowance for credit
losses. The Company’s determination of the allowance for
commercial and commercial real estate loans is sensitive to the
assigned credit risk ratings and inherent loss rates at
December 31, 2006. In the event that 10 percent of
loans within these portfolios experienced downgrades of two risk
categories, the allowance for commercial and commercial real
estate would increase by approximately $234 million at
December 31, 2006. In the event that inherent loss or


U.S. BANCORP


estimated loss rates for these portfolios increased by
10 percent, the allowance determined for commercial and
commercial real estate would increase by approximately
$93 million at December 31, 2006. The Company’s
determination of the allowance for residential and retail loans
is sensitive to changes in estimated loss rates. In the event
that estimated loss rates increased by 10 percent, the
allowance for residential mortgages and retail loans would
increase by approximately $60 million at December 31,
2006. Because several quantitative and qualitative factors are
considered in determining the allowance for credit losses, these
sensitivity analyses do not necessarily reflect the nature and
extent of future changes in the allowance for credit losses.
They are intended to provide insights into the impact of adverse
changes in risk rating and inherent losses and do not imply any
expectation of future deterioration in the risk rating or loss
rates. Given current processes employed by the Company,
management believes the risk ratings and inherent loss rates
currently assigned are appropriate. It is possible that others,
given the same information, may at any point in time reach
different reasonable conclusions that could be significant to
the Company’s financial statements. Refer to the
“Analysis and Determination of the Allowance for Credit
Losses” section for further information.

Mortgage Servicing Rights

MSRs are capitalized as
separate assets when loans are sold and servicing is retained or
may be purchased from others. MSRs are initially recorded at
fair value, if practicable, and at each subsequent reporting
date. The Company determines the fair value by estimating the
present value of the asset’s future cash flows utilizing
market-based prepayment rates, discount rates, and other
assumptions validated through comparison to trade information,
industry surveys and independent third party appraisals. Changes
in the fair value of MSRs are recorded in earnings during the
period in which they occur. Risks inherent in the MSRs valuation
include higher than expected prepayment rates and/or delayed
receipt of cash flows. The Company utilizes futures and options
contracts to mitigate the valuation risk. The estimated
sensitivity to changes in interest rates of the fair value of
the MSRs portfolio and the related derivative instruments at
December 31, 2006, to an immediate 25 and 50 basis
point downward movement in interest rates would be a decrease of
approximately $18 million and $50 million,
respectively. An upward movement in interest rates at
December 31, 2006, of 25 and 50 basis points would
decrease the value of the MSRs and related derivative
instruments by approximately $3 million and
$36 million, respectively. Refer to Note 9 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information regarding MSRs.

Goodwill and Other Intangibles

The Company records all
assets and liabilities acquired in purchase acquisitions,
including goodwill and other intangibles, at fair value as
required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 141, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.”
Goodwill and indefinite-lived assets are no longer amortized but
are subject, at a minimum, to annual tests for impairment. Under
certain situations, interim impairment tests may be required if
events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than
not reduce the fair value of a reporting segment below its
carrying amount. Other intangible assets are amortized over
their estimated useful lives using straight-line and accelerated
methods and are subject to impairment if events or circumstances
indicate a possible inability to realize the carrying amount.

The initial recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets
and subsequent impairment analysis require management to make
subjective judgments concerning estimates of how the acquired
assets will perform in the future using valuation methods
including discounted cash flow analysis. Additionally, estimated
cash flows may extend beyond ten years and, by their nature, are
difficult to determine over an extended timeframe. Events and
factors that may significantly affect the estimates include,
among others, competitive forces, customer behaviors and
attrition, changes in revenue growth trends, cost structures,
technology, changes in discount rates and specific industry and
market conditions. In determining the reasonableness of cash
flow estimates, the Company reviews historical performance of
the underlying assets or similar assets in an effort to assess
and validate assumptions utilized in its estimates.

In assessing the fair value of reporting units, the Company may
consider the stage of the current business cycle and potential
changes in market conditions in estimating the timing and extent
of future cash flows. Also, management often utilizes other
information to validate the reasonableness of its valuations
including public market comparables, and multiples of recent
mergers and acquisitions of similar businesses. Valuation
multiples may be based on revenue,

price-to

-earnings and
tangible capital ratios of comparable public companies and
business segments. These multiples may be adjusted to consider
competitive differences including size, operating leverage and
other factors. The carrying amount of a reporting unit is
determined based on the capital required to support the
reporting unit’s activities including its tangible and
intangible assets. The determination of a reporting unit’s
capital allocation requires management judgment and considers
many factors including the regulatory capital regulations and
capital characteristics of comparable public

U.S. BANCORP



companies in relevant industry sectors. In certain
circumstances, management will engage a third-party to
independently validate its assessment of the fair value of its
business segments.

The Company’s annual assessment of potential goodwill
impairment was completed during the second quarter of 2006.
Based on the results of this assessment, no goodwill impairment
was recognized.

Income Taxes

The Company
estimates income tax expense based on amounts expected to be
owed to various tax jurisdictions. Currently, the Company files
tax returns in approximately 143 federal, state and local
domestic jurisdictions and 9 foreign jurisdictions. The
estimated income tax expense is reported in the Consolidated
Statement of Income. Accrued taxes represent the net estimated
amount due or to be received from taxing jurisdictions either
currently or in the future and are reported in other assets or
other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In
estimating accrued taxes, the Company assesses the relative
merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment considering
statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of
the tax position. Because of the complexity of tax laws and
regulations, interpretation can be difficult and subject to
legal judgment given specific facts and circumstances. It is
possible that others, given the same information, may at any
point in time reach different reasonable conclusions regarding
the estimated amounts of accrued taxes.

Changes in the estimate of accrued taxes occur periodically due
to changes in tax rates, interpretations of tax laws, the status
of examinations being conducted by various taxing authorities,
and newly enacted statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance
that impact the relative merits and risks of tax positions.
These changes, when they occur, affect accrued taxes and can be
significant to the operating results of the Company. Refer to
Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
for additional information regarding income taxes.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Under the supervision and with the participation of the
Company’s management, including its principal executive
officer and principal financial officer, the Company has
evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rules

13a-15(e)

and

15d-15(e)

under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”)).
Based upon this evaluation, the principal executive officer and
principal financial officer have concluded that, as of the end
of the period covered by this report, the Company’s
disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

During the most recently completed fiscal quarter, there was no
change made in the Company’s internal controls over
financial reporting (as defined in
Rules

13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the
Exchange Act) that has materially affected, or is reasonably
likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting.

The annual report of the Company’s management on internal
control over financial reporting is provided on page 61.
The attestation report of Ernst & Young LLP, the
Company’s independent accountants, regarding the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting is
provided on page 63.


U.S. BANCORP


Report of Management

Responsibility for the financial statements and other
information presented throughout the Annual Report on
Form

10-K

rests
with the management of U.S. Bancorp. The Company believes that
the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States and present the substance of transactions based on
the circumstances and management’s best estimates and
judgment.

In meeting its responsibilities for the reliability of the
financial statements, management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over
financial reporting as defined by
Rules

13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company’s system of
internal controls is designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of publicly filed financial statements in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States.

To test compliance, the Company carries out an extensive audit
program. This program includes a review for compliance with
written policies and procedures and a comprehensive review of
the adequacy and effectiveness of the internal control system.
Although control procedures are designed and tested, it must be
recognized that there are limits inherent in all systems of
internal control and, therefore, errors and irregularities may
nevertheless occur. Also, estimates and judgments are required
to assess and balance the relative cost and expected benefits of
the controls. Projection of any evaluation of effectiveness to
future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The Board of Directors of the Company has an Audit Committee
composed of directors who are independent of U.S. Bancorp.
The committee meets periodically with management, the internal
auditors and the independent accountants to consider audit
results and to discuss internal accounting control, auditing and
financial reporting matters.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal controls over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2006. In making this assessment, management
used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission in its Internal
Control-Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment and those
criteria, management believes that the Company designed and
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2006.

The Company’s independent accountants, Ernst & Young
LLP, have been engaged to render an independent professional
opinion on the financial statements and issue an attestation
report on management’s assessment of the Company’s
system of internal control over financial reporting. Their
opinion on the financial statements appearing on page 62
and their attestation on the system of internal controls over
financial reporting appearing on page 63 are based on
procedures conducted in accordance with auditing standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).

ended December 31, 2006. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the

U.S. BANCORP


Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of U.S. Bancorp:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
accompanying Report of Management, that U.S. Bancorp
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in
Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(the COSO criteria). U.S. Bancorp’s management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an
opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that
U.S. Bancorp maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, is fairly
stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria.
Also, in our opinion, U.S. Bancorp maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on the COSO
criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
consolidated balance sheets of U.S. Bancorp as of
December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated
statements of income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2006 and our report dated February 23,
2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
    POLICIES

U.S. Bancorp and its subsidiaries (the “Company”)
is a multi-state financial services holding company
headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The Company provides a
full range of financial services including lending and
depository services through banking offices principally in
24 states. The Company also engages in credit card,
merchant, and ATM processing, mortgage banking, insurance, trust
and investment management, brokerage, and leasing activities
principally in domestic markets.

Basis of Presentation

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company, its subsidiaries and all variable interest entities for
which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The consolidation
eliminates all significant intercompany accounts and
transactions. Certain items in prior periods have been
reclassified to conform to the current presentation.

Uses of Estimates

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in
the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual
experience could differ from those estimates.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS

Within the Company, financial performance is measured by major
lines of business based on the products and services provided to
customers through its distribution channels. The Company has
five reportable operating segments:

Wholesale Banking

offers
lending, equipment finance and small-ticket leasing, depository,
treasury management, capital markets, foreign exchange,
international trade services and other financial services to
middle market, large corporate, commercial real estate and
public sector clients.

Consumer Banking

delivers
products and services through banking offices, telephone
servicing and sales, on-line services, direct mail and ATMs. It
encompasses community banking, metropolitan banking, in-store
banking, small business banking, consumer lending, mortgage
banking, consumer finance, workplace banking, student banking
and

24-hour

banking.

Wealth Management

provides
trust, private banking, financial advisory, investment
management, retail brokerage services, insurance, custody and
mutual fund servicing through six businesses: Private Client
Group, Corporate Trust, U.S. Bancorp Investments and
Insurance, FAF Advisors, Institutional Trust and Custody and
Fund Services.

Payment Services

includes
consumer and business credit cards, stored-value cards, debit
cards, corporate and purchasing card services, consumer lines of
credit, ATM processing and merchant processing.

Treasury and Corporate Support

includes the Company’s
investment portfolios, funding, capital management and asset
securitization activities, interest rate risk management, the
net effect of transfer pricing related to average balances and
the residual aggregate of those expenses associated with
corporate activities that are managed on a consolidated basis.

Segment Results

Accounting
policies for the lines of business are the same as those used in
preparation of the consolidated financial statements with
respect to activities specifically attributable to each business
line. However, the preparation of business line results requires
management to establish methodologies to allocate funding costs
and benefits, expenses and other financial elements to each line
of business. For details of these methodologies and segment
results, see “Basis for Financial Presentation” and
Table 23 “Line of Business Financial Performance”
included in Management’s Discussion and Analysis which is
incorporated by reference into these Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

SECURITIES

Realized gains or losses on securities are determined on a trade
date basis based on the specific carrying value of the
investments being sold.

Trading Securities

Debt
and equity securities held for resale are classified as trading
securities and reported at fair value. Realized gains or losses
are reported in noninterest income.

Available-for-sale Securities

These securities are not
trading securities but may be sold before maturity in response
to changes in the Company’s interest rate risk profile,
funding needs or demand for collateralized deposits by public
entities. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair
value with unrealized net gains or losses reported within other
comprehensive income in shareholders’ equity. When sold,
the amortized cost of the specific securities is used to compute
the gain or loss. Declines in fair value that


U.S. BANCORP


are deemed other-than-temporary, if any, are reported in
noninterest income.

Held-to

-maturity
Securities

Debt securities
for which the Company has the positive intent and ability to
hold to maturity are reported at historical cost adjusted for
amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts. Declines in
fair value that are deemed other than temporary, if any, are
reported in noninterest income.

Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell and
Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase

Securities purchased under
agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements to
repurchase are generally accounted for as collateralized
financing transactions and are recorded at the amounts at which
the securities were acquired or sold, plus accrued interest. The
fair value of collateral received is continually monitored and
additional collateral obtained or requested to be returned to
the Company as deemed appropriate.

EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN OPERATING ENTITIES

Equity investments in public entities in which ownership is less
than 20 percent are accounted for as available-for-sale
securities and carried at fair value. Similar investments in
private entities are accounted for using the cost method.
Investments in entities where ownership interest is between
20 percent and 50 percent are accounted for using the
equity method with the exception of limited partnerships and
limited liability companies where an ownership interest of
greater than 5 percent requires the use of the equity
method. If the Company has a voting interest greater than
50 percent, the consolidation method is used. All equity
investments are evaluated for impairment at least annually and
more frequently if certain criteria are met.

LOANS

Loans are reported net of unearned income. Interest income is
accrued on the unpaid principal balances as earned. Loan and
commitment fees and certain direct loan origination costs are
deferred and recognized over the life of the loan and/or
commitment period as yield adjustments.

Commitments to Extend Credit

Unfunded residential mortgage
loan commitments entered into in connection with mortgage
banking activities are considered derivatives and recorded on
the balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value
recorded in income. All other unfunded loan commitments are
generally related to providing credit facilities to customers of
the bank and are not actively traded financial instruments.
These unfunded commitments are disclosed as commitments to
extend credit in Note 21 in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Allowance for Credit Losses

Management determines the
adequacy of the allowance based on evaluations of credit
relationships, the loan portfolio, recent loss experience, and
other pertinent factors, including economic conditions. This
evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates,
including amounts of future cash collections expected on
nonaccrual loans, which may be susceptible to significant
change. The allowance for credit losses relating to impaired
loans is based on the loan’s observable market price, the
collateral for certain collateral-dependent loans, or the
discounted cash flows using the loan’s effective interest
rate.

The Company determines the amount of the allowance required for
certain sectors based on relative risk characteristics of the
loan portfolio. The allowance recorded for commercial loans is
based on quarterly reviews of individual credit relationships
and an analysis of the migration of commercial loans and actual
loss experience. The allowance recorded for homogeneous consumer
loans is based on an analysis of product mix, risk
characteristics of the portfolio, bankruptcy experiences, and
historical losses, adjusted for current trends, for each
homogenous category or group of loans. The allowance is
increased through provisions charged to operating earnings and
reduced by net charge-offs.

The Company also assesses the credit risk associated with
off-balance sheet loan commitments, letters of credit, and
derivatives and determines the appropriate amount of credit loss
liability that should be recorded. The liability for off-balance
sheet credit exposure related to loan commitments and other
financial instruments is included in other liabilities.

Nonaccrual Loans

Generally
commercial loans (including impaired loans) are placed on
nonaccrual status when the collection of interest or principal
has become 90 days past due or is otherwise considered
doubtful. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, unpaid
accrued interest is reversed. Future interest payments are
generally applied against principal. Revolving consumer lines
and credit cards are charged off by 180 days past due and
closed-end consumer loans other than loans secured by 1-4 family
properties are charged off at 120 days past due and are,
therefore, generally not placed on nonaccrual status. Certain
retail customers having financial difficulties may have the
terms of their credit card and other loan agreements modified to
require only principal payments and, as such, are reported as
nonaccrual.

Impaired Loans

A loan is
considered to be impaired when, based on current information and
events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to
collect all amounts due (both interest and principal) according
to the contractual terms of the loan agreement.

U.S. BANCORP



Restructured Loans

In
cases where a borrower experiences financial difficulties and
the Company makes certain concessionary modifications to
contractual terms, the loan is classified as a restructured
loan. Loans restructured at a rate equal to or greater than that
of a new loan with comparable risk at the time the contract is
modified may be excluded from restructured loans in the calendar
years subsequent to the restructuring if they are in compliance
with the modified terms.

Generally, a nonaccrual loan that is restructured remains
classified as a nonaccrual loan for a period of six months to
demonstrate that the borrower can meet the restructured terms.
However, performance prior to the restructuring, or significant
events that coincide with the restructuring, are considered in
assessing whether the borrower can meet the new terms and may
result in the loan being returned to accrual status at the time
of restructuring or after a shorter performance period. If the
borrower’s ability to meet the revised payment schedule is
not reasonably assured, the loan remains classified as a
nonaccrual loan.

Leases

The Company engages
in both direct and leveraged lease financing. The net investment
in direct financing leases is the sum of all minimum lease
payments and estimated residual values, less unearned income.
Unearned income is added to interest income over the terms of
the leases to produce a level yield.

The investment in leveraged leases is the sum of all lease
payments (less nonrecourse debt payments) plus estimated
residual values, less unearned income. Income from leveraged
leases is recognized over the term of the leases based on the
unrecovered equity investment.

Residual values on leased assets are reviewed regularly for
other-than-temporary impairment. Residual valuations for retail
automobile leases are based on independent assessments of
expected used car sale prices at the

end-of

-term. Impairment
tests are conducted based on these valuations considering the
probability of the lessee returning the asset to the Company,
re-marketing efforts, insurance coverage and ancillary fees and
costs. Valuations for commercial leases are based upon external
or internal management appraisals. When there is

other-than-temporary

impairment in the estimated fair value of the Company’s
interest in the residual value of a leased asset, the carrying
value is reduced to the estimated fair value with the writedown
recognized in the current period.

Loans Held for Sale

Loans
held for sale (“LHFS”) represent mortgage loan
originations intended to be sold in the secondary market and
other loans that management has an active plan to sell. LHFS are
carried at the lower of cost or market value as determined on an
aggregate basis by type of loan. In the event management decides
to sell loans receivable, the loans are transferred at the lower
of cost or fair value. Loans transferred to LHFS are

marked-to

-market
(“MTM”) at the time of transfer. MTM losses related to
the sale/transfer of non-homogeneous loans that are
predominantly credit-related are reflected in charge-offs. With
respect to homogeneous loans, the amount of “probable”
credit loss determined in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 5, “Accounting for
Contingencies,” methodologies utilized to determine the
specific allowance allocation for the portfolio is also included
in charge-offs. Any incremental loss determined in accordance
with MTM accounting, that includes consideration of other
factors such as estimates of inherent losses, is reported
separately from charge-offs as a reduction to the allowance for
credit losses. Subsequent decreases in fair value are recognized
in noninterest income.

Other Real Estate

Other
real estate (“ORE”), which is included in other
assets, is property acquired through foreclosure or other
proceedings. ORE is carried at fair value, less estimated
selling costs. The property is evaluated regularly and any
decreases in the carrying amount are included in noninterest
expense.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into
derivative transactions to manage its interest rate, foreign
currency and prepayment risk and to accommodate the business
requirements of its customers. All derivative instruments are
recorded as other assets, other liabilities or short-term
borrowings at fair value. Subsequent changes in a
derivative’s fair value are recognized currently in
earnings, unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met.

All derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting are
recorded at fair value and classified either as a hedge of the
fair value of a recognized asset or liability (“fair
value” hedge) or as a hedge of the variability of cash
flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or
liability or a forecasted transaction (“cash flow”
hedge). Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly
effective and designated as a fair value hedge and the
offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged item are
recorded in income. Changes in the fair value of a derivative
that is highly effective and designated as a cash flow hedge are
recognized in other comprehensive income until income from the
cash flows of the hedged item is recognized. The Company
performs an assessment, both at the inception of the hedge and
on a quarterly basis thereafter, when required, to determine
whether these derivatives are highly effective in offsetting
changes in the value of the hedged items. Any change in fair
value resulting from hedge ineffectiveness is immediately
recorded in noninterest income.


U.S. BANCORP


If a derivative designated as a hedge is terminated or ceases to
be highly effective, the gain or loss is amortized to earnings
over the remaining life of the hedged asset or liability (fair
value hedge) or over the same period(s) that the forecasted
hedged transactions impact earnings (cash flow hedge). If the
hedged item is disposed of, or the forecasted transaction is no
longer probable, the derivative is recorded at fair value with
any resulting gain or loss included in the gain or loss from the
disposition of the hedged item or, in the case of a forecasted
transaction that is no longer probable, included in earnings
immediately.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

The Company recognizes revenue as it is earned based on
contractual terms, as transactions occur, or as services are
provided and collectibility is reasonably assured. In certain
circumstances, noninterest income is reported net of associated
expenses that are directly related to variable volume-based
sales or revenue sharing arrangements or when the Company acts
on an agency basis for others. Certain specific policies include
the following:

Credit and Debit Card Revenue

Credit and debit card revenue
includes interchange income from credit and debit cards, annual
fees, and other transaction and account management fees.
Interchange income is a fee paid by a merchant bank to the
card-issuing bank through the interchange network. Interchange
fees are set by the credit card associations and are based on
cardholder purchase volumes. The Company records interchange
income as transactions occur. Transaction and account management
fees are recognized as transactions occur or services are
provided, except for annual fees, which are recognized over the
applicable period. Volume-related payments to partners and
credit card associations and expenses for rewards programs are
also recorded within credit and debit card revenue. Payments to
partners and expenses related to rewards programs are recorded
when earned by the partner or customer.

Merchant Processing Services

Merchant processing services
revenue consists principally of transaction and account
management fees charged to merchants for the electronic
processing of transactions, net of interchange fees paid to the
credit card issuing bank, card association assessments, and
revenue sharing amounts, and are all recognized at the time the
merchant’s transactions are processed or other services are
performed. The Company may enter into revenue sharing agreements
with referral partners or in connection with purchases of
merchant contracts from sellers. The revenue sharing amounts are
determined primarily on sales volume processed or revenue
generated for a particular group of merchants. Merchant
processing revenue also includes revenues related to

point-of

-sale equipment
recorded as sales when the equipment is shipped or as earned for
equipment rentals.

Trust and Investment Management Fees

Trust and investment
management fees are recognized over the period in which services
are performed and are based on a percentage of the fair value of
the assets under management or administration, fixed based on
account type, or transaction-based fees.

Deposit Service Charges

Service charges on deposit
accounts primarily represent monthly fees based on minimum
balances or transaction-based fees. These fees are recognized as
earned or as transactions occur and services are provided.

OTHER SIGNIFICANT POLICIES

Intangible Assets

The
price paid over the net fair value of the acquired businesses
(“goodwill”) is not amortized. Other intangible assets
are amortized over their estimated useful lives, using
straight-line and accelerated methods. The recoverability of
goodwill and other intangible assets is evaluated annually, at a
minimum, or on an interim basis if events or circumstances
indicate a possible inability to realize the carrying amount.
The evaluation includes assessing the estimated fair value of
the intangible asset based on market prices for similar assets,
where available, and the present value of the estimated future
cash flows associated with the intangible asset.

Income Taxes

Deferred
taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences on future
years of differences between the tax basis of assets and
liabilities and the financial reporting amounts at each year-end.

Mortgage Servicing Rights

Mortgage servicing rights
(“MSRs”) are capitalized as separate assets when loans
are sold and servicing is retained or may be purchased from
others. MSRs are initially recorded at fair value, if
practicable, and at each subsequent reporting date. The Company
determines the fair value by estimating the present value of the
asset’s future cash flows utilizing market-based prepayment
rates, discount rates, and other assumptions validated through
comparison to trade information, industry surveys and
independent third party appraisals. Changes in the fair value of
MSRs are recorded in earnings during the period in which they
occur. Risks inherent in the MSRs valuation include higher than
expected prepayment rates and/or delayed receipt of cash flows.
The Company utilizes futures and options contracts to mitigate
the valuation risk. Fair value changes related to the MSRs and
the futures and options contracts, as well as servicing and
other related fees, are recorded in mortgage banking revenue.

U.S. BANCORP



Pensions

For purposes of
its retirement plans, the Company utilizes a measurement date of
September 30. At the measurement date, plan assets are
determined based on fair value, generally representing
observable market prices. The actuarial cost method used to
compute the pension liabilities and related expense is the
projected unit credit method. The projected benefit obligation
is principally determined based on the present value of
projected benefit distributions at an assumed discount rate. The
discount rate utilized is based on match-funding maturities and
interest payments of high quality corporate bonds available in
the market place to projected cash flows as of the measurement
date for future benefit payments. Periodic pension expense (or
income) includes service costs, interest costs based on the
assumed discount rate, the expected return on plan assets based
on an actuarially derived market-related value and amortization
of actuarial gains and losses. Pension accounting reflects the
long-term nature of benefit obligations and the investment
horizon of plan assets and can have the effect of reducing
earnings volatility related to short-term changes in interest
rates and market valuations. Actuarial gains and losses include
the impact of plan amendments and various unrecognized gains and
losses which are deferred and amortized over the future service
periods of active employees. The market-related value utilized
to determine the expected return on plan assets is based on fair
value adjusted for the difference between expected returns and
actual performance of plan assets. The unrealized difference
between actual experience and expected returns is included in
the market-related value ratably over a five-year period.
Beginning in 2006, the overfunded or underfunded status of the
plans is recorded as an asset or liability on the balance sheet,
with changes in that status recognized through other
comprehensive income.

Premises and Equipment

Premises and equipment are
stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and depreciated
primarily on a straight-line basis over the estimated life of
the assets. Estimated useful lives range up to 40 years for
newly constructed buildings and from 3 to 20 years for
furniture and equipment.

Capitalized leases, less accumulated amortization, are included
in premises and equipment. The lease obligations are included in
long-term debt. Capitalized leases are amortized on a
straight-line basis over the lease term and the amortization is
included in depreciation expense.

Statement of Cash Flows

For purposes of reporting
cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash and money
market investments, defined as interest-bearing amounts due from
banks, federal funds sold and securities purchased under
agreements to resell.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company grants
stock-based awards, including restricted stock and options to
purchase common stock of the Company. Stock option grants are
for a fixed number of shares to employees and directors with an
exercise price equal to the fair value of the shares at the date
of grant. Stock-based compensation for awards is recognized in
the Company’s results of operations on a straight-line
basis over the vesting period. The Company immediately
recognizes compensation cost of awards to employees that meet
retirement status, despite their continued active employment.
The amortization of stock-based compensation reflects estimated
forfeitures adjusted for actual forfeiture experience. As
compensation expense is recognized, a deferred tax asset is
recorded that represents an estimate of the future tax deduction
from exercise or release of restrictions. At the time
stock-based awards are exercised, cancelled, expire, or
restrictions are released, the Company may be required to
recognize an adjustment to tax expense.

Per Share Calculations

Earnings per share is
calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings
per share is calculated by adjusting income and outstanding
shares, assuming conversion of all potentially dilutive
securities, using the treasury stock method.

Note 2

ACCOUNTING CHANGES

Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
Other Postretirement Plans

In
September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 158 (“SFAS 158”),
“Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
Other Postretirement Plans — an amendment of FASB
Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)”, effective for
the Company for the year ending December 31, 2006. This
statement requires the recognition of the overfunded or
underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as
an asset or liability on the balance sheet, and the recognition
of changes in that funded status through other comprehensive
income. The adoption of SFAS 158 did not have a material
impact on the Company’s financial statements.

Fair Value Measurements

In
September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 157 (“SFAS 157”),
“Fair Value Measurements”, effective for the Company
beginning on January 1, 2008. This Statement defines fair
value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and
expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This
statement establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes
between valuations obtained from sources independent of the
entity and those from the entity’s own unobservable inputs
that are not corroborated by observable market data.
SFAS 157 expands disclosures about the use of fair value to
measure assets and liabilities


U.S. BANCORP


in interim and annual periods subsequent to initial recognition.
The disclosures focus on the inputs used to measure fair value
and for recurring fair value measurements using significant
unobservable inputs, the effect of the measurements on earnings
or changes in net assets for the period. The Company is
currently assessing the impact of this guidance on its financial
statements.

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

In June 2006, the FASB issued
Interpretation No. 48 (“FIN 48”),
“Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an
interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for
Income Taxes,” effective for the Company beginning on
January 1, 2007. FIN 48 clarifies the recognition
threshold a tax position is required to meet before being
recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 also
provides guidance on disclosure and other matters. Currently,
the Company does not expect this guidance to have a material
impact on its financial statements.

Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets

In March 2006, the FASB
issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 156,
“Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets”
(“SFAS 156”), which amends accounting and
reporting standards for servicing assets and liabilities under
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 140,
“Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets
and Extinguishments of Liabilities”. Specifically,
SFAS 156 requires that all separately recognized servicing
assets and servicing liabilities be initially measured at fair
value, if practicable. For subsequent measurement purposes,
SFAS 156 permits an entity to choose to measure servicing
assets and liabilities either based on fair value or lower of
cost or market (“LOCOM”). The Company elected to adopt
SFAS 156 effective January 1, 2006, utilizing the fair
value measurement option for MSRs and continuing the LOCOM
method for all other servicing assets and liabilities. Adopting
the fair value measurement method resulted in the Company
recording a cumulative-effect accounting adjustment to increase
beginning retained earnings by $4 million (net of tax).
Additional information regarding MSRs is disclosed in
Note 9 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities

In February 2007,
the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 159 (“SFAS 159”), “The Fair Value
Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities”,
effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2008.
This Statement provides entities with an option to report
selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value, with
the objective to reduce both the complexity in accounting for
financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by
measuring related assets and liabilities differently. The
Company is currently assessing the impact of this guidance on
its financial statements.

The weighted-average maturity of the available-for-sale
investment securities was 6.6 years at December 31,
2006, compared with 6.1 years at December 31, 2005.
The corresponding weighted-average yields were 5.32 percent
and 4.89 percent, respectively. The weighted-average
maturity of the

held-to

investment securities was 8.4 years at December 31,
2006, compared with 7.2 years at December 31, 2005.
The corresponding weighted-average yields were 6.03 percent
and 6.44 percent, respectively.

Securities carried at $35.8 billion at December 31,
2006, and $36.9 billion at December 31, 2005, were
pledged to secure public, private and trust deposits, repurchase
agreements and for other purposes required by law. Securities
sold under agreements to repurchase where the buyer/lender has
the right to sell or pledge the securities were collateralized
by securities with an amortized cost of $9.8 billion at
December 31, 2006, and $10.9 billion at
December 31, 2005, respectively.

For amortized cost, fair value and yield by maturity date of

held-to

available-for-sale securities outstanding at December 31,
2006, refer to Table 11 included in Management’s Discussion
and Analysis which is incorporated by reference into these Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements.

At December 31, 2006, certain investment securities included in
the held-to-maturity and available-for-sale categories had a
fair value that was below their amortized cost. The Company
conducts a regular assessment of its investment portfolios to
determine whether any securities are other-than-temporarily
impaired. This assessment is based on the nature of the
securities, the financial condition of the issuer, the extent
and duration of the loss and the intent and ability of the
Company, as of the reporting date, to hold these securities
either to maturity or through the expected recovery period.

Generally, the unrealized losses within each investment category
have occurred due to rising interest rates over the past few
years. The substantial portion of securities that have
unrealized losses are either government securities, issued by
government-backed agencies or privately issued securities with
high investment grade credit ratings. Unrealized losses within
other securities and investments are also the result of a modest
widening of credit spreads since the initial purchase date. In
general, the issuers of the investment securities do not have
the contractual ability to pay them off at less than par at
maturity or any earlier call date. As of the reporting date, the
Company expects to receive all contractual principal and
interest related to these securities. Because the Company has
the ability and intent to hold its investment securities until
their anticipated recovery in value or maturity, they are not
considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired as of December
31, 2006.

LOANS AND ALLOWANCE FOR
    CREDIT LOSSES

The composition of the loan portfolio at December 31 was as
follows:

Loans are presented net of unearned interest and deferred fees
and costs, which amounted to $1.3 billion at
December 31, 2006 and 2005. The Company had loans of
$44.8 billion at December 31, 2006, and
$44.1 billion at December 31, 2005, pledged at the
Federal Home Loan Bank. Loans of $16.2 billion at
December 31, 2006, and $18.1 billion at
December 31, 2005, were pledged at the Federal Reserve Bank.

The Company primarily lends to borrowers in the 24 states
in which it has banking offices. Collateral for commercial loans
may include marketable securities, accounts receivable,
inventory and equipment. For details of the Company’s
commercial portfolio by industry group and geography as of
December 31, 2006 and 2005, see Table 7 included in
Management’s Discussion and Analysis which is

nonaccrual or restructured at December 31, 2006, totaled
$23 million.

In addition to impaired commercial and commercial real estate
loans, the Company had smaller balance homogenous loans that are
accruing interest at rates considered to be below market rate.
At December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the recorded
investment in these other


U.S. BANCORP


restructured loans was $405 million, $315 million and
$227 million, respectively, with average balances of
$379 million, $278 million, and $229 million,
respectively. The Company recognized estimated interest income
on these loans of $35 million, $20 million, and
$17 million during 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the
Company had net gains on the sale of loans of $104 million,
$175 million and $171 million, respectively, which
were included in noninterest income, primarily in mortgage
banking revenue.

The Company has equity interests in two joint ventures that are
accounted for utilizing the equity method. The principal
activity of one entity is to provide commercial real estate
financing that the joint venture securitizes and sells to third
party investors. The principal activity of the other entity is
to provide senior or subordinated financing to customers for the
construction, rehabilitation or redevelopment of commercial real
estate. In connection with these joint ventures, the Company
provides warehousing lines to support the operations.
Warehousing advances to the joint ventures are made in the
ordinary course of business and repayment of these credit
facilities occurs when the securitization is completed or the
commercial real estate project is permanently refinanced by
others. At December 31, 2006, the Company had
$1.3 billion of outstanding loan balances to these joint
ventures.

ACCOUNTING FOR TRANSFERS AND
    SERVICING OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

FINANCIAL ASSET SALES

When the Company sells financial assets, it may retain
interest-only strips, servicing rights, residual rights to a
cash reserve account, and/or other retained interests in the
sold financial assets. The gain or loss on sale depends in part
on the previous carrying amount of the financial assets involved
in the transfer and is allocated between the assets sold and the
retained interests based on their relative fair values at the
date of transfer. Quoted market prices are used to determine
retained interest fair values when readily available. Since
quotes are generally not available for retained interests, the
Company estimates fair value based on the present value of
future expected cash flows using management’s best
estimates of the key assumptions including credit losses,
prepayment speeds, forward yield curves, and discount rates
commensurate with the risks involved. Retained interests and
liabilities are recorded at fair value using a discounted cash
flow methodology at inception and are evaluated at least
quarterly thereafter.

Conduit and Securitization

The Company sponsors an
off-balance sheet conduit, a qualified special purpose entity
(“QSPE”), to which it transferred high-grade
investment securities, funded by the issuance of commercial
paper. Because QSPE’s are exempt from consolidation under
the provisions of Financial Interpretation No. 46R,
“Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities
(“FIN 46R”), the Company does not consolidate the
conduit structure in its financial statements. The conduit held
assets of $2.2 billion at December 31, 2006, and
$3.8 billion at December 31, 2005. These investment
securities include primarily (i) private label asset-backed
securities, which are insurance “wrapped” by AAA/
Aaa-rated monoline insurance companies and (ii) government
agency mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage
obligations.

U.S. BANCORP



The conduit had commercial paper liabilities of
$2.2 billion at December 31, 2006, and
$3.8 billion at December 31, 2005. The Company
benefits by transferring the investment securities into a
conduit that provides diversification of funding sources in a
capital-efficient manner and the generation of income.

The Company provides a liquidity facility to the conduit.
Utilization of the liquidity facility would be triggered if the
conduit is unable to, or does not, issue commercial paper to
fund its assets. A liability for the estimate of the potential
risk of loss the Company has as the liquidity facility provider
is recorded on the balance sheet in other liabilities. The
liability is adjusted downward over time as the underlying
assets pay down with the offset recognized as other noninterest
income. The liability for the liquidity facility was
$10 million at December 31, 2006, and $20 million
at December 31, 2005. In addition, the Company recorded at
fair value its retained residual interest in the investment
securities conduit of $13 million at December 31,
2006, and $28 million at December 31, 2005. The
Company recorded $8 million from the conduit during 2006
and $17 million during 2005, for revenues related to the
conduit including fees for servicing, management,
administration, and accretion income from retained interests.

Sensitivity Analysis

At
December 31, 2006, key economic assumptions and the
sensitivity of the current fair value of residual cash flows to
immediate 10 percent and 20 percent adverse changes in
those assumptions for the investment securities conduit were as
follows:

(a)

The residual cash flow discount rate was 4.6 percent of
    December 31, 2006. The investments are all AAA/ Aaa rated
    or insured investments, therefore, credit losses are assumed to
    be zero with no impact for interest rate movements. Also,
    interest rate movements create no material impact to the value
    of the residual interest, as the investment securities conduit
    is mostly match funded.

These sensitivities are hypothetical and should be used with
caution. As the figures indicate, changes in fair value based on
a 10 percent variation in assumptions generally cannot be
extrapolated because the relationship of the change in the
assumptions to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also,
in this table the effect of a variation in a particular
assumption on the fair value of the retained interest is
calculated without changing any other assumptions; in reality,
changes in one factor may result in changes in another (for
example, increases in market interest rates may result in lower
prepayments and increased credit losses), which might magnify or
counteract the sensitivities.

Cash Flow Information

During the years ended
December 31, 2006 and 2005, the investment conduit
generated $15 million and $22 million of cash flows,
respectively, from servicing, other fees and retained interests.

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

The Company is involved in various entities that are considered
to be variable interest entities (“VIEs”) as defined
in FASB Interpretation No. 46R. Generally, a VIE is a
corporation, partnership, trust or any other legal structure
that either does not have equity investors with substantive
voting rights or has equity investors that do not provide
sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its
activities. The Company’s investments in VIEs primarily
represent private investment funds that make equity investments,
provide debt financing or partnerships to support
community-based investments in affordable housing, development
entities that provide capital for communities located in
low-income districts and historic rehabilitation projects that
may enable the Company to ensure regulatory compliance with the
Community Reinvestment Act.

With respect to these investments, the Company is required to
consolidate any VIE in which it is determined to be the primary
beneficiary. At December 31, 2006, approximately
$90 million of total assets related to various VIEs were
consolidated by the Company in its financial statements.
Creditors of these VIEs have no recourse to the general credit
of the Company. The Company is not required to consolidate other
VIEs as it is not the primary beneficiary. In such cases, the
Company does not absorb the majority of the entities’
expected losses nor does it receive a majority of the
entities’ expected residual returns. The amounts of the
Company’s investment in these unconsolidated entities
ranged from less than $1 million to $82 million with
an aggregate amount of approximately $1.7 billion at
December 31, 2006. While the Company believes potential
losses from these investments is remote, the Company’s


U.S. BANCORP


maximum exposure to these unconsolidated VIEs, including any tax
implications, was approximately $2.8 billion at
December 31, 2006, assuming that all of the separate
investments within the individual private funds are deemed
worthless and the community-based business and housing projects,
and related tax credits, completely failed and did not meet
certain government compliance requirements.

MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS

The Company’s portfolio of residential mortgages serviced
for others was $82.9 billion and $69.0 billion at
December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Effective
January 1, 2006, the Company elected to adopt SFAS 156
utilizing the fair value method for measuring residential
mortgage servicing rights. Under this method, the Company
initially records MSRs at their estimated fair value and the
related gain or loss is reported in mortgage banking revenue.
The net impact of subsequent changes in the fair value of the
MSRs and related derivatives are also recognized as part of
mortgage banking revenue. Prior to the adoption of
SFAS 156, the initial carrying value of MSRs was amortized
over the estimated life of the intangible asset and changes in
valuation, under the

lower-of

-cost-or-market
accounting method, were recognized as impairments or reparation
within other intangibles expenses.

In conjunction with its MSRs, the Company may utilize
derivatives, including U.S Treasury futures and options on
U.S. Treasury futures contracts, to manage the volatility
of changes in the fair value of MSRs. The net impact of changes
in the fair value of MSRs and the related derivatives included
in mortgage banking revenue was a net loss of $37 million
for the year ended December 31, 2006. Servicing and other
related fees included in mortgage banking revenue were
$319 million in 2006.

Changes in fair value of capitalized MSRs are summarized as
follows:

(a)

Principally reflects changes in discount rates and prepayment
    speed assumptions, primarily arising from interest rate
    changes.

(b)

Primarily represents changes due to collection/realization of
    expected cash flows over time.

U.S. BANCORP



The Company determines fair value by estimating the present
value of the asset’s future cash flows utilizing
market-based prepayment rates, discount rates, and other
assumptions validated through comparison to trade information,
industry surveys, and independent third party appraisals. Risks
inherent in the valuation of MSRs include higher than expected
prepayment rates and/or delayed receipt of cash flows. The
estimated sensitivity to changes in interest rates of the fair
value of the MSRs portfolio and the related derivative
instruments at December 31, 2006, was as follows:

The fair value of MSRs and its sensitivity to changes in
interest rates is influenced by the mix of the servicing
portfolio and characteristics of each segment of the portfolio.
The Company’s servicing portfolio consists of the distinct
portfolios of Mortgage Revenue Bond Programs (“MRBP”),
government-insured mortgages and conventional mortgages. The
MRBP division specializes in servicing loans made under state
and local housing authority programs. These programs provide
mortgages to low-income and moderate-income borrowers and are
generally government-insured programs with a favorable rate
subsidy, down payment and/or closing cost assistance. Mortgage
loans originated as part of government agency and state loan
programs tend to experience slower prepayment rates and better
cash flows than conventional mortgage loans. The servicing
portfolios are predominantly comprised of fixed-rate agency
loans (FNMA, FHLMC, GNMA, FHLB and various housing agencies)
with limited adjustable-rate or jumbo mortgage loans.

A summary of the Company’s MSRs and related characteristics
by portfolio as of December 31, 2006, was as follows:

LONG-TERM DEBT

Long-term debt (debt with original maturities of more than one
year) at December 31 consisted of the following:

(a)

Weighted average interest rates of medium-term notes, federal
    home loan bank advances and bank notes were 4.66 percent,
    5.34 percent and 4.90 percent, respectively.

(b)

Other includes debt issuance fees and unrealized gains and
    losses and deferred fees relating to derivative instruments.

Convertible senior debentures issued by the Company pay interest
on a quarterly basis until a specified period of time (five or
nine years prior to the applicable maturity date). After this
period, the Company will not pay interest on the debentures
prior to maturity. On the maturity date or on any earlier
redemption date, the holder will receive the original principal
plus accrued interest. The debentures are convertible at any
time on or prior to the maturity date. If the convertible senior
debentures are converted, holders of the debentures will
generally receive cash up to the accreted principal amount of
the debentures plus, if the market price of the Company’s
stock exceeds the conversion price in effect on the date of
conversion, a number of shares of the Company’s common
stock, or an equivalent amount of cash at the Company’s
option, as determined in accordance with specified terms. The
convertible senior debentures are callable by the Company and
putable by the investors at a price equal to 100 percent of
the accreted principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest.
During 2006, investors elected to put debentures with a
principal amount of $3.4 billion back to the Company.

During 2006, the Company issued $2.5 billion of fixed-rate
junior subordinated debentures to three separately formed
wholly-owned trusts for the purpose of issuing Company-obligated
mandatorily redeemable preferred securities at interest rates
ranging from 5.54 percent to 6.60 percent. In
addition, the Company elected to redeem $1.9 billion of
higher cost fixed-rate junior subordinated debentures that had
interest payable at rates ranging from 7.25 percent to
8.32 percent. In connection with the redemption of these
debentures, the Company recognized charges of $33 million
in 2006. Refer to Note 13, “Junior Subordinated
Debentures” for further information on the nature and terms
of these debentures.

The Company’s subsidiary, U.S. Bank National

notes to provide liquidity and support its capital requirements.
During 2006, subordinated notes of $49 million matured and
were repaid by the subsidiary.

The Company has an arrangement with the Federal Home

JUNIOR SUBORDINATED
    DEBENTURES

As of December 31, 2006, the Company sponsored and wholly owned
100 percent of the common equity of ten trusts that were formed
for the purpose of issuing Company-obligated mandatorily
redeemable preferred securities (“Trust Preferred
Securities”) to third-party investors and investing the
proceeds from the sale of the Trust Preferred Securities
solely in junior subordinated debt securities of the Company
(the “Debentures”). The Debentures held by the trusts,
which totaled $3.8 billion, are the sole assets of each
trust. The Company’s obligations under the Debentures and
related documents, taken together, constitute a full and
unconditional guarantee by the Company of the obligations of the
Trusts. The guarantee covers the distributions and payments on
liquidation or redemption of the Trust Preferred
Securities, but only to the extent of funds held by the Trusts.
The Company used the proceeds from the sales of the Debentures
for general corporate purposes.

In connection with the formation of USB Capital IX, the trust
issued redeemable Income Trust Securities (“ITS”) to
third party investors, investing the proceeds in Debentures
issued by the Company and entered into stock purchase contracts
to purchase preferred stock to be issued by the Company in the
future. Pursuant to the stock purchase contracts, the Company is
required to make contract payments of .65 percent, also
payable semi-annually, through a specified stock purchase date
expected to be April 15, 2011. Prior to the specified stock
purchase date, the Trust is required to remarket and sell the
Debentures to third party investors to generate cash proceeds to
satisfy its obligation to purchase the Company’s
Series A Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock
(“Series A Preferred Stock”) pursuant to the
stock purchase contracts. The Series A Preferred Stock,
when issued pursuant to the stock purchase contracts, is
expected to pay quarterly dividends equal to the greater of
three-month LIBOR plus 1.02 percent or 3.50 percent.
In connection with this transaction, the Company also entered
into a replacement capital covenant which restricts the
Company’s rights to repurchase the ITS and to redeem or
repurchase the Series A Preferred Stock.

The following table is a summary of the Debentures included in
long-term debt as of December 31, 2006:

(a)

The Company has the right to redeem the Debentures in whole
    or in part, on or after specific dates, at a redemption price
    specified in the indentures plus any accrued but unpaid interest
    to the redemption date.

(b)

The Company has the right to redeem the Debentures in whole,
    (but not in part), on or after specific dates, at a redemption
    price specified in the indentures plus any accrued but unpaid
    interest to the redemption date. The variable-rate Securities
    and Debentures reprice quarterly based on three-month LIBOR.

SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY

At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company had authority to
issue 4 billion shares of common stock and 50 million
shares of preferred stock. The Company had 1,765 million
and 1,815 million shares of common stock outstanding at
December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and had
433 million shares of common stock reserved for future
issuances, primarily under stock option plans and shares that
may be issued in connection with the Company’s convertible
senior debentures, at December 31, 2006. At
December 31, 2006, the Company had 40,000 shares of
preferred stock outstanding.

On March 27, 2006, the Company issued depository shares
representing an ownership interest in 40,000 shares of
Series B Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock with a
liquidation preference of $25,000 per share (the
“Series B Preferred Stock”). The Series B
Preferred Stock has no stated maturity and will not be subject
to any sinking fund or other obligation of the Company.
Dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock, if declared,
will accrue and be payable quarterly, in arrears, at a rate per
annum equal to the greater of three-month LIBOR plus
..60 percent, or 3.50 percent. On April 15, 2011,
or thereafter, the Series B Preferred Stock is redeemable
at the Company’s option, subject to the prior approval of
the Federal Reserve Board, at a redemption price equal to
$25,000 per share, plus any declared and unpaid dividends,
without accumulation of any undeclared dividends. In connection
with the issuance of the Series B Preferred Stock, the
Company also entered into a replacement capital covenant, which
restricts the Company’s rights to redeem or repurchase the
Series B Preferred Stock. Except in certain limited
circumstances, the Series B Preferred Stock does not have
any voting rights.

The Company has a preferred share purchase rights plan intended
to preserve the long-term value of the Company by discouraging a
hostile takeover of the Company. Under the plan, each share of
common stock carries a right to purchase one one-thousandth of a
share of preferred stock. The rights become exercisable in
certain limited circumstances involving a potential business
combination transaction or an acquisition of shares of the
Company and are exercisable at a price of $100 per right,
subject to adjustment. Following certain other events, each
right entitles its holder to purchase for $100 an amount of
common stock of the Company, or, in certain circumstances,
securities of the acquirer, having a then-current market value
of twice the exercise price of the right. The dilutive effect of
the rights on the acquiring company is intended to encourage it
to negotiate with the Company’s Board of Directors prior to
attempting a takeover. If the Board of Directors believes a
proposed acquisition is in the best interests of the Company and
its shareholders, the Board may amend the plan or redeem the
rights for a nominal amount in order to permit the acquisition
to be completed without interference from the plan. Until a
right is exercised, the holder of a right has no rights as a
shareholder of the Company. The rights expire on
February 27, 2011.

On December 16, 2003, the Board of Directors approved an
authorization to repurchase 150 million shares of
outstanding common stock during the following 24 months. In
2004, the Company repurchased 89 million shares of common
stock under the 2003 plan. On December 21, 2004, the Board
of Directors approved an authorization to
repurchase 150 million shares of outstanding common
stock during the following 24 months. This repurchase
program replaced the Company’s December 16, 2003,
program. In 2004, the Company repurchased 5 million shares
of common stock under this plan. During 2005, all share
repurchases were made under the 2004 plan. On August 3,
2006, the Board of Directors approved an authorization to
repurchase 150 million shares of outstanding common
stock through December 31, 2008. This new authorization
replaced the December 21, 2004, repurchase program. During
2006, the Company repurchased 62 million shares of common
stock under the 2004 authorization and 28 million shares
under the 2006 authorization.

Shareholders’ equity is affected by transactions and
valuations of asset and liability positions that require
adjustments to Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. The
reconciliation of the transactions affecting Accumulated Other
Comprehensive Income included in shareholders’ equity for
the years ended December 31, is as follows:

Regulatory Capital

The
measures used to assess capital include the capital ratios
established by bank regulatory agencies, including the specific
ratios for the “well capitalized” designation. Capital
adequacy for the Company and its banking subsidiaries is
measured based on two risk-based measures, Tier I and total
risk-based capital. Tier I capital is considered core
capital and includes common shareholders’ equity plus
qualifying preferred stock, trust preferred securities and
minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries (included in
other liabilities and subject to certain limitations), and is
adjusted for the aggregate impact of certain items included in
other comprehensive income. Total risk-based capital includes
Tier I capital and other items such as subordinated debt
and the allowance for credit losses. Both measures are stated as
a percentage of risk-adjusted assets, which are measured based
on their perceived credit risk and include certain off-balance
sheet exposures, such as unfunded loan commitments, letters of
credit, and derivative contracts. The Company is also subject to
a leverage ratio requirement, a non risk-based asset ratio,
which is defined as Tier I capital as a percentage of
average assets adjusted for goodwill and other non-qualifying
intangibles and other assets.

The following table provides the components of the
Company’s regulatory capital:

(a)

Includes the impact of items included in other comprehensive
    income, such as unrealized gains(losses) on available-for-sale
    securities, accumulated net gains on cash flow hedges, pension
    liability adjustments, etc.


U.S. BANCORP


Minority interests principally represent preferred stock of
consolidated subsidiaries. During 2006, the Company’s
primary banking subsidiary formed USB Realty Corp, a real estate
investment trust, for the purpose of issuing 5,000 shares
of Fixed-to-Floating Rate Exchangeable Non-cumulative Perpetual
Series A Preferred Stock with a liquidation preference of
$100,000 per share (“Series A Preferred
Securities”) to third party investors, and investing the
proceeds in certain assets, consisting predominately of
mortgage-backed securities from the Company. Dividends on the
Series A Preferred Securities, if declared, will accrue and
be payable quarterly, in arrears, at a rate per annum of
6.091 percent from December 22, 2006 to, but
excluding, January 15, 2012. After January 15, 2012,
the rate will be equal to three-month LIBOR for the related
dividend period plus 1.147 percent. If the Company has not
declared a dividend on the Series A Preferred Securities
before the dividend payment date for any dividend period, such
dividend shall not be cumulative and shall cease to accrue and
be payable, and the Company will have no obligation to pay
dividends accrued for such dividend period, whether or not
dividends on the Series A Preferred Securities are declared
for any future dividend period.

The Series A Preferred Securities will be redeemable, in
whole or in part, at the option of the Company on the dividend
payment date occurring in January 2012 and each fifth
anniversary thereafter, or in whole but not in part, at the
option of the Company on any dividend date before or after
January 2012 that is not a five-year date. Any redemption will
be subject to the approval of the Office of the Comptroller of
the Currency.

For a summary of the regulatory capital requirements and the
actual ratios as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, for the
Company and its bank subsidiaries, see Table 21 included in
Management’s Discussion and Analysis, which is incorporated
by reference into these Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

EARNINGS PER SHARE

The components of earnings per share were:

For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004,
options to purchase 1 million, 16 million and
36 million shares, respectively, were outstanding but not
included in the computation of diluted earnings per share
because they were antidilutive. Convertible senior debentures
that could potentially be converted into shares of the
Company’s common stock pursuant to a specified formula,
were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per
share to the extent the conversions were antidilutive.

Note 16

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

Employee Investment Plan

The Company has a defined
contribution retirement savings plan which allows qualified
employees to make contributions up to 75 percent of their
annual compensation, subject to Internal Revenue Service limits,
through salary deductions under Section 401(k) of the
Internal Revenue Code. Employee contributions are invested, at
the employees’ direction, among a variety of investment
alternatives. Employee contributions are 100 percent
matched by the Company, up to four percent of an employee’s
eligible annual compensation. The Company’s matching
contribution vests immediately; however, a participant must be
employed in an eligible position on the last business day of the
year to receive that year’s matching contribution. Although
the matching contribution is initially invested in the
Company’s common stock, an employee can reinvest the
matching contributions among various investment alternatives.
Total expense was $58 million, $53 million and
$49 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Pension Plans

Pension
benefits are provided to substantially all employees based on
years of service and employees’ compensation while employed
with the Company. Employees are fully vested after five years of
service. Prior to their acquisition dates, employees of certain
acquired companies were covered by separate, noncontributory
pension plans that provided benefits based on years of service
and compensation. Generally, the Company merges

U.S. BANCORP



plans of acquired companies into its existing pension plans when
it becomes practicable.

Under the current plan’s benefit structure, a
participant’s future retirement benefits are based on a
participant’s highest consecutive five-year average annual
compensation during his or her last 10 years before
retirement or termination from the Company. Prior to the merger
with Firstar Corporation, two of the previous companies had cash
balance pension benefit structures under which the participants
earned retirement benefits based on their average compensation
over their entire career, while the former Firstar Corporation
retirement benefit structure was based on final average pay and
years of service, similar to the current plan. Plan assets
primarily consist of various equities, equity mutual funds and
other miscellaneous assets.

In general, the Company’s pension plan objectives include
maintaining a funded status sufficient to meet participant
benefit obligations over time while reducing long-term funding
requirements and pension costs. The Company has an established
process for evaluating all the plans, their performance and
significant plan assumptions, including the assumed discount
rate and the long-term rate of return (“LTROR”).
Annually the Company’s Compensation Committee (“the
Committee”), assisted by outside consultants, evaluates
plan objectives, funding policies and plan investment policies
considering its long-term investment time horizon and asset
allocation strategies. The process also evaluates significant
plan assumptions. Although plan assumptions are established
annually, the Company may update its analysis on an interim
basis in order to be responsive to significant events that occur
during the year, such as plan mergers and amendments.

In addition to the funded qualified pension plan, the Company
maintains a non-qualified plan that is unfunded and the
aggregate accumulated benefit obligation exceeds the assets. The
assumptions used in computing the present value of the
accumulated benefit obligation, the projected benefit obligation
and net pension expense are substantially consistent with those
assumptions used for the funded qualified plan.

Funding Practices

The Company’s
funding policy is to contribute amounts to its plans sufficient
to meet the minimum funding requirements of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, plus such additional
amounts as the Company determines to be appropriate. There were
no minimum funding requirements in 2006 or 2005 and the Company
anticipates no minimum funding requirement in 2007. Any
contributions made to the plan are invested in accordance with
established investment policies and asset allocation strategies.

Investment Policies and Asset Allocation

In establishing its
investment policies and asset allocation strategies, the Company
considers expected returns and the volatility associated with
different strategies. The independent consultant performs
modeling that projects numerous outcomes using a broad range of
possible scenarios, including a mix of possible rates of
inflation and economic growth. Starting with current economic
information, the model bases its projections on past
relationships between inflation, fixed income rates and equity
returns when these types of economic conditions have existed
over the previous 30 years, both in the U.S. and in foreign
countries.

Generally, based on historical performance of the various
investment asset classes, investments in equities have
outperformed other investment classes but are subject to higher
volatility. While an asset allocation including bonds and other
assets generally has lower volatility and may provide protection
in a declining interest rate environment, it limits the pension
plan’s long-term up-side potential. Given the pension
plan’s investment horizon and the financial viability of
the Company to meet its funding objectives, the Committee has
determined that an asset allocation strategy investing in
100 percent equities diversified among various domestic
equity categories and international equities is appropriate. At
December 31, 2006 and 2005, plan assets of the qualified
retirement plans included mutual funds that have asset
management arrangements with related parties totaling
$1.2 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively.


U.S. BANCORP


The following table, which is unaudited, except for the actual
asset allocations at December 31, 2006 and 2005, provides a
summary of asset allocations adopted by the Company compared
with a typical asset allocation alternative:

(a)

The LTROR assumed for the target asset allocation strategy of
    8.9 percent is based on a range of estimates evaluated by
    the Company which were centered around the compound expected
    return of 9.8 percent reduced for estimated asset
    management and administrative fees.

In accordance with its existing practices, the independent
pension consultant utilized by the Company updated the analysis
of expected rates of return and evaluated peer group data,
market conditions and other factors relevant to determining the
LTROR assumptions for pension costs for 2006 and 2005. The
analysis performed indicated that the LTROR assumption of
8.9 percent, used in both 2006 and 2005, continued to be in
line with expected returns based on current economic conditions
and the Company expects to continue using this LTROR in 2007.
Regardless of the extent of the Company’s analysis of
alternative asset allocation strategies, economic scenarios and
possible outcomes, plan assumptions developed for the LTROR are
subject to imprecision and changes in economic factors. As a
result of the modeling imprecision and uncertainty, the Company
considers a range of potential expected rates of return,
economic conditions for several scenarios, historical
performance relative to assumed rates of return and asset
allocation and LTROR information for a peer group in
establishing its assumptions.

Postretirement Medical Plan

In addition to providing
pension benefits, the Company provides health care and death
benefits to certain retired employees through a retiree medical
program. Generally, all active employees may become eligible for
retiree health care benefits by meeting defined age and service
requirements. The Company may also subsidize the cost of
coverage for employees meeting certain age and service
requirements. The medical plan contains other cost-sharing
features such as deductibles and coinsurance. The estimated cost
of these retiree benefit payments is accrued during the
employees’ active service.

Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
Other Postretirement Plans

Effective for the year ending
December 31, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of
SFAS 158. This statement requires the recognition of the

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

As part of its employee and director compensation programs, the
Company may grant certain stock awards under the provisions of
the existing stock compensation plans, including plans assumed
in acquisitions. The plans provide for grants of options to
purchase shares of common stock at a fixed price equal to the
fair value of the underlying stock at the date of grant. Option
grants are generally exercisable up to ten years from the date
of grant. In addition, the plans provide for grants of shares of
common stock or stock units that are subject to restriction on
transfer prior to vesting. Most stock awards vest over three to
five years and are subject to forfeiture if certain vesting
requirements are not met. Stock incentive plans of acquired
companies are generally terminated at the merger closing dates.
Option holders under such plans receive the Company’s
common stock, or options to buy the Company’s stock, based
on the conversion terms of the various merger agreements. The
historical stock award information presented below has been
restated to reflect the options originally granted under
acquired companies’ plans. At December 31, 2006, there
were 14 million shares (subject to adjustment for
forfeitures) available for grant under various plans.

STOCK OPTION AWARDS

The following is a summary of stock options outstanding and
exercised under various stock options plans of the Company:

(a)

Options cancelled includes both non-vested (i.e.,
    forfeitures) and vested options.

(b)

Outstanding options include stock-based awards that may be
    forfeited in future periods, however the impact of the estimated
    forfeitures is reflected in compensation expense.

Stock-based compensation expense is based on the estimated fair
value of the award at the date of grant or modification. The
fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of
grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, requiring the


U.S. BANCORP


use of subjective assumptions. Because employee stock options
have characteristics that differ from those of traded options,
including vesting provisions and trading limitations that impact
their liquidity, the determined value used to measure
compensation expense may vary from their actual fair value. The
following table includes the weighted average estimated fair
value and assumptions utilized by the Company for newly issued
grants:

Expected stock volatility is based on several factors including
the historical volatility of the Company’s stock, implied
volatility determined from traded options and other factors. The
Company uses historical data to estimate option exercises and
employee terminations to estimate the expected life of options.
The risk-free interest rate for the expected life of the options
is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect on the
date of grant. The expected dividend yield is based on the
Company’s expected dividend yield over the life of the
options.

The aggregate fair value of option shares vested was
$81 million and $121 million for 2006 and 2005,
respectively. The intrinsic value of options exercised was
$346 million, $161 million and $198 million for
2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Cash received from option exercises under all share-based
payment arrangements was $885 million, $367 million
and $577 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The
tax benefit realized for the tax deductions from option
exercises of the share-based payment arrangements totaled
$131 million, $60 million and $74 million for
2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. To satisfy option exercises,
the Company predominantly uses treasury stock.

The total fair value of shares vested was $15 million,
$15 million, and $9 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively.

Stock-based compensation expense was $101 million,
$132 million and $176 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. At the time employee stock options expire, are
exercised or cancelled, the Company determines the tax benefit
associated with the stock award and under certain circumstances
may be required to recognize an adjustment to tax expense. On an
after-tax basis, stock-based compensation was $64 million,
$83 million and $139 million for 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. As of December 31, 2006, there was
$98 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related
to nonvested share-based arrangements granted under the plans.
That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average
period of 3 years as compensation.

INCOME TAXES

The components of income tax expense were:

A reconciliation of expected income tax expense at the federal
statutory rate of 35 percent to the Company’s
applicable income tax expense follows:

The tax effects of fair value adjustments on securities
available-for-sale, derivative instruments in cash flow hedges
and certain tax benefits related to stock options are recorded
directly to shareholders’ equity as part of other
comprehensive income.

At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company held an
aggregate net tax liability of $1.5 billion and
$2.0 billion, respectively. This net tax liability
represents an estimate of taxes to be paid during the next
twelve months or at some future date.

In preparing its tax returns, the Company is required to
interpret complex tax laws and regulations and utilize income
and cost allocation methods to determine its taxable income. On
an ongoing basis, the Company is subject to examinations by
federal and state taxing authorities that may give rise to
differing interpretations of these complex laws, regulations and
methods. Due to the nature of the examination process, it
generally takes years before these examinations are completed
and matters are resolved. Included in each of the last three
years, were reductions in income tax expense and associated
liabilities related to the resolution of various federal and
state income tax examinations. The federal income tax
examination resolutions cover substantially all of the
Company’s legal entities for the years through 2004. The
Company also resolved several state income tax examinations
which cover varying years from 1998 through 2005 in different
states. The resolution of these cycles was the result of
negotiations held between the Company and representatives of
various taxing authorities throughout the examinations.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflect the tax
effect of estimated temporary differences between the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting
purposes and the amounts used for the same items for income tax
reporting purposes.


U.S. BANCORP


The significant components of the Company’s net deferred
tax liability as of December 31 were:

The Company has established a valuation allowance to offset
deferred tax assets related to federal, state and foreign net
operating loss carryforwards which are subject to various
limitations under the respective income tax laws and some of
which may expire unused. The Company has approximately
$238 million of federal, state and foreign net operating
loss carryforwards which expire at various times through 2023.

Certain events covered by Internal Revenue Code
section 593(e), which was not repealed, will trigger a
recapture of base year reserves of acquired thrift institutions.
The base year reserves of acquired thrift institutions would be
recaptured if an entity ceases to qualify as a bank for federal
income tax purposes. The base year reserves of thrift
institutions also remain subject to income tax penalty
provisions that, in general, require recapture upon certain
stock redemptions of, and excess distributions to, stockholders.
At December 31, 2006, retained earnings included
approximately $102 million of base year reserves for which
no deferred federal income tax liability has been recognized.

Note 19

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into
derivative transactions to manage its interest rate, prepayment
and foreign currency risks and to accommodate the business
requirements of its customers. The Company does not enter into
derivative transactions for speculative purposes. Refer to
Note 1 “Significant Accounting Policies” in the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of
the Company’s accounting policies for derivative
instruments. For information related to derivative positions
held for asset and liability management purposes and
customer-related derivative positions, see Table 18
“Derivative Positions,” included in Management’s
Discussion and Analysis, which is incorporated by reference in
these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

ASSET AND LIABILITY MANAGEMENT POSITIONS

Cash Flow Hedges

The
Company has $12.3 billion of designated cash flow hedges at
December 31, 2006. These derivatives are interest rate
swaps that are hedges of the forecasted cash flows from the
underlying variable-rate debt. All cash flow hedges are highly
effective for the year ended December 31, 2006, and the
change in fair value attributed to hedge ineffectiveness was not
material.

At December 31, 2006 and 2005, accumulated other
comprehensive income included a deferred after-tax net loss of
$83 million and $11 million, respectively, related to
cash flow hedges. The unrealized loss will be reflected in
earnings when the related cash flows or hedged transactions
occur and will offset the related performance of the hedged
items. The occurrence of these related cash flows and hedged
transactions remains probable. The estimated amount of after-tax
loss to be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive
income into earnings during 2007 is $29 million. This
includes gains related to hedges that were

U.S. BANCORP



terminated early and the forecasted transactions are still
probable.

Fair Value Hedges

The
Company may use derivatives that are primarily interest rate
swaps that hedge the change in fair value related to interest
rate changes of underlying fixed-rate debt, junior subordinated
debentures and deposit obligations. In addition, the Company may
use forward commitments to sell residential mortgage loans to
hedge its interest rate risk related to residential mortgage
loans held for sale. The Company commits to sell the loans at
specified prices in a future period, typically within
90 days, and is exposed to interest rate risk during the
period between issuing a loan commitment and the sale of the
loan into the secondary market.

The Company has $5.7 billion of designated fair value hedges at
December 31, 2006. All fair value hedges are considered
highly effective for the year ended December 31, 2006. The
change in fair value attributed to hedge ineffectiveness was a
loss of $3 million for the year ended December 31,
2006.

Net Investment Hedges

The
Company enters into derivatives to protect its net investment in
certain foreign operations. The Company uses forward commitments
to sell specified amounts of certain foreign currencies and
foreign denominated debt to hedge its capital volatility risk
associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
The net amount of gains or losses included in the cumulative
translation adjustment for 2006 was not significant.

Other Derivative Positions

The Company has derivative
positions that are used for interest rate risk and other risk
management purposes but are not designated as cash flow hedges
or fair value hedges in accordance with the provisions of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133,
“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities.”

At December 31, 2006, the Company had $2.8 billion of
forward commitments to sell residential mortgage loans to
economically hedge the Company’s interest rate risk related
to $1.3 billion of unfunded residential loan commitments
and $1.8 billion of residential mortgage loans held for sale.
Gains and losses on mortgage banking derivatives and the
unfunded loan commitments are included in mortgage banking
revenue on the statement of income.

CUSTOMER-RELATED POSITIONS

The Company acts as a seller and buyer of interest rate
contracts and foreign exchange rate contracts on behalf of
customers. At December 31, 2006, the Company had
$30.0 billion of aggregate customer derivative positions,
including $25.1 billion of interest rate swaps, caps, and
floors and $4.9 billion of foreign exchange rate contracts.
The Company minimizes its market and liquidity risks by taking
similar offsetting positions. Gains or losses on
customer-related transactions were not significant for the year
ended December 31, 2006.

Note 20

FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL
    INSTRUMENTS

Due to the nature of its business and its customers’ needs,
the Company offers a large number of financial instruments, most
of which are not actively traded. When market quotes are
unavailable, valuation techniques including discounted cash flow
calculations and pricing models or services are used. The
Company also uses various aggregation methods and assumptions,
such as the discount rate and cash flow timing and amounts. As a
result, the fair value estimates can neither be substantiated by
independent market comparisons, nor realized by the immediate
sale or settlement of the financial instrument. Also, the
estimates reflect a point in time and could change significantly
based on changes in economic factors, such as interest rates.
Furthermore, the disclosure of certain financial and
nonfinancial assets and liabilities is not required. Finally,
the fair value disclosure is not intended to estimate a market
value of the Company as a whole. A summary of the Company’s
valuation techniques and assumptions follows.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The carrying value of cash,
amounts due from banks, federal funds sold and securities
purchased under resale agreements was assumed to approximate
fair value.

Securities

Investment
securities were valued using available market quotes. In some
instances, for securities that are not widely traded, market
quotes for comparable securities were used.

Loans

The loan portfolio
includes adjustable and fixed-rate loans, the fair value of
which was estimated using discounted cash flow analyses and
other valuation techniques. To calculate discounted cash flows,
the loans were aggregated into pools of similar types and
expected repayment terms. The expected cash flows of loans
considered historical prepayment experiences and estimated
credit losses for nonperforming loans and were discounted using
current rates offered to borrowers of similar credit
characteristics. The fair value of adjustable rate loans is
assumed to be equal to their par value.

Deposit Liabilities

The
fair value of demand deposits, savings accounts and certain
money market deposits is equal to the amount payable on demand
at year-end. The fair value of fixed-rate certificates of
deposit was estimated by discounting the contractual cash flow
using the discount rates implied by high-grade corporate bond
yield curves.

Short-Term Borrowings

Federal funds purchased,
securities sold under agreements to repurchase, commercial paper
and


U.S. BANCORP


other short-term funds borrowed are at floating rates or have
short-term maturities. Their par value is assumed to approximate
their fair value.

Long-Term Debt

The
estimated fair value of medium-term notes, bank notes, and
subordinated debt was determined by using discounted cash flow
analysis based on high-grade corporate bond yield curves.
Floating rate debt is assumed to be equal to par value. Capital
trust and other long-term debt instruments were valued using
market quotes.

Interest Rate Swaps, Equity Contracts and Options

The interest rate options and
swap cash flows were estimated using a third-party pricing model
and discounted based on appropriate LIBOR, eurodollar futures,
swap, treasury note yield curves and equity market prices.

Loan Commitments, Letters of Credit and Guarantees

The fair value of
commitments, letters of credit and guarantees represents the
estimated costs to terminate or otherwise settle the obligations
with a third-party. Residential mortgage commitments are
actively traded and the fair value is estimated using available
market quotes. Other loan commitments, letters of credit and
guarantees are not actively traded. Substantially all loan
commitments have floating rates and do not expose the Company to
interest rate risk assuming no premium or discount was ascribed
to loan commitments because funding could occur at market rates.
The Company estimates the fair value of loan commitments,
letters of credit and guarantees based on the related amount of
unamortized deferred commitment fees adjusted for the probable
losses for these arrangements.

The estimated fair values of the Company’s financial
instruments at December 31 are shown in the table below.

The fair value of unfunded commitments, standby letters of
credit and other guarantees is approximately equal to their
carrying value. The carrying value of unfunded commitments and
standby letters of credit was $261 million. The carrying value
of other guarantees was $75 million.

U.S. BANCORP



Note 21

GUARANTEES AND CONTINGENT
    LIABILITIES

COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT

Commitments to extend credit are legally binding and generally
have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses. The
contractual amount represents the Company’s exposure to
credit loss, in the event of default by the borrower. The
Company manages this credit risk by using the same credit
policies it applies to loans. Collateral is obtained to secure
commitments based on management’s credit assessment of the
borrower. The collateral may include marketable securities,
receivables, inventory, equipment and real estate. Since the
Company expects many of the commitments to expire without being
drawn, total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent the
Company’s future liquidity requirements. In addition, the
commitments include consumer credit lines that are cancelable
upon notification to the consumer.

LETTERS OF CREDIT

Standby letters of credit are commitments the Company issues to
guarantee the performance of a customer to a third-party. The
guarantees frequently support public and private borrowing
arrangements, including commercial paper issuances, bond
financings and other similar transactions. The Company issues
commercial letters of credit on behalf of customers to ensure
payment or collection in connection with trade transactions. In
the event of a customer’s nonperformance, the
Company’s credit loss exposure is the same as in any
extension of credit, up to the letter’s contractual amount.
Management assesses the borrower’s credit to determine the
necessary collateral, which may include marketable securities,
receivables, inventory, equipment and real estate. Since the
conditions requiring the Company to fund letters of credit may
not occur, the Company expects its liquidity requirements to be
less than the total outstanding commitments. The maximum
potential future payments guaranteed by the Company under
standby letter of credit arrangements at December 31, 2006,
were approximately $11.9 billion with a weighted-average
term of approximately 24 months. The estimated fair value
of standby letters of credit was approximately $77 million
at December 31, 2006.

The contract or notional amounts of commitments to extend credit
and letters of credit at December 31, 2006, were as follows:

(a)

Primarily cancelable at the Company’s discretion.

LEASE COMMITMENTS

Rental expense for operating leases amounted to
$193 million in 2006, $192 million in 2005 and
$187 million in 2004. Future minimum payments, net of
sublease rentals, under capitalized leases and noncancelable
operating leases with initial or remaining terms of one year or
more, consisted of the following at December 31, 2006:

GUARANTEES

Guarantees are contingent commitments issued by the Company to
customers or other third-parties. The Company’s guarantees
primarily include parent guarantees related to
subsidiaries’ third-party borrowing arrangements;
third-party performance guarantees inherent in the
Company’s business operations such as indemnified
securities lending programs and merchant charge-back guarantees;
indemnification or buy-back provisions related to certain asset
sales; and contingent consideration arrangements related to
acquisitions. For certain guarantees, the Company has recorded a
liability related to the potential obligation, or has access to
collateral to support the guarantee or through the exercise of
other recourse provisions can offset some or all of the maximum
potential future payments made under these guarantees.


U.S. BANCORP


Third-Party Borrowing Arrangements

The Company provides
guarantees to third-parties as a part of certain
subsidiaries’ borrowing arrangements, primarily
representing guaranteed operating or capital lease payments or
other debt obligations with maturity dates extending through
2013. The maximum potential future payments guaranteed by the
Company under these arrangements were approximately
$444 million at December 31, 2006. The Company’s
recorded liabilities as of December 31, 2006, included
$5 million representing outstanding amounts owed to these
third-parties and required to be recorded on the Company’s
balance sheet in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States.

Commitments from Securities Lending

The Company participates in
securities lending activities by acting as the customer’s
agent involving the loan of securities. The Company indemnifies
customers for the difference between the market value of the
securities lent and the market value of the collateral received.
Cash collateralizes these transactions. The maximum potential
future payments guaranteed by the Company under these
arrangements were approximately $13.8 billion at
December 31, 2006, and represented the market value of the
securities lent to third-parties. At December 31, 2006, the
Company held assets with a market value of $14.2 billion as
collateral for these arrangements.

Assets Sales

The Company
has provided guarantees to certain third-parties in connection
with the sale of certain assets, primarily loan portfolios and
low-income housing tax credits. These guarantees are generally
in the form of asset buy-back or make-whole provisions that are
triggered upon a credit event or a change in the tax-qualifying
status of the related projects, as applicable, and remain in
effect until the loans are collected or final tax credits are
realized, respectively. The maximum potential future payments
guaranteed by the Company under these arrangements were
approximately $489 million at December 31, 2006, and
represented the proceeds or the guaranteed portion received from
the buyer in these transactions where the buy-back or make-whole
provisions have not yet expired. Recourse available to the
Company includes guarantees from the Small Business
Administration (for SBA loans sold), recourse against the
correspondent that originated the loan or to the private
mortgage issuer, the right to collect payments from the debtors,
and/or the right to liquidate the underlying collateral, if any,
and retain the proceeds. Based on its established

loan-to

-value
guidelines, the Company believes the recourse available is
sufficient to recover future payments, if any, under the loan
buy-back guarantees.

Merchant Processing

The
Company, through its subsidiaries, provides merchant processing
services. Under the rules of credit card associations, a
merchant processor retains a contingent liability for credit
card transactions processed. This contingent liability arises in
the event of a billing dispute between the merchant and a
cardholder that is ultimately resolved in the cardholder’s
favor. In this situation, the transaction is
“charged-back” to the merchant and the disputed amount
is credited or otherwise refunded to the cardholder. If the
Company is unable to collect this amount from the merchant, it
bears the loss for the amount of the refund paid to the
cardholder.

A cardholder, through its issuing bank, generally has until the
latter of up to four months after the date the transaction is
processed or the receipt of the product or service to present a
charge-back to the Company as the merchant processor. The
absolute maximum potential liability is estimated to be the
total volume of credit card transactions that meet the
associations’ requirements to be valid charge-back
transactions at any given time. Management estimates that the
maximum potential exposure for charge-backs would approximate
the total amount of merchant transactions processed through the
credit card associations for the last four months. For the last
four months this amount totaled approximately
$64.9 billion. In most cases, this contingent liability is
unlikely to arise, as most products and services are delivered
when purchased and amounts are refunded when items are returned
to merchants. However, where the product or service is not
provided until a future date (“future delivery”), the
potential for this contingent liability increases. To mitigate
this risk, the Company may require the merchant to make an
escrow deposit, may place maximum volume limitations on future
delivery transactions processed by the merchant at any point in
time, or may require various credit enhancements (including
letters of credit and bank guarantees). Also, merchant
processing contracts may include event triggers to provide the
Company more financial and operational control in the event of
financial deterioration of the merchant.

The Company’s primary exposure to future delivery is
related to merchant processing for airlines, cruise lines and
large tour operators. The Company currently processes card
transactions for airlines, cruise lines and large tour operators
in the United States, Canada and Europe. In the event of
liquidation of these merchants, the Company could become
financially liable for refunding tickets purchased through the
credit card associations under the charge-back provisions.
Charge-back risk related to these merchants is evaluated in a
manner similar to credit risk assessments and, as such, merchant
processing contracts contain various provisions to protect the
Company in the event of default. At December 31, 2006, the
value of airline, cruise line and

U.S. BANCORP



large tour operator tickets purchased to be delivered at a
future date was $2.6 billion, with airline tickets
representing 90 percent of that amount. The Company held
collateral of $1.7 billion in escrow deposits, letters of
credit and indemnities from financial institutions, and liens on
various assets. With respect to future delivery risk for other
merchants, the Company held $40 million of merchant escrow
deposits as collateral. In addition to specific collateral or
other credit enhancements the Company maintains a liability for
its implied guarantees associated with future delivery. At
December 31, 2006, the liability was $30 million primarily
related to these airlines, cruise lines and large tour operators
processing arrangements.

In the normal course of business, the Company has unresolved
charge-backs that are in process of resolution. The Company
assesses the likelihood of its potential liability based on the
extent and nature of unresolved charge-backs and its historical
loss experience. At December 31, 2006, the Company had a
recorded liability for potential losses of $19 million.

Contingent Consideration Arrangements

The Company has contingent
payment obligations related to certain business combination
transactions. Payments are guaranteed as long as certain
post-acquisition performance-based criteria are met or customer
relationships are maintained. At December 31, 2006, the
maximum potential future payments required to be made by the
Company under these arrangements was approximately $34 million.
If required, the majority of these contingent payments are
payable within the next 12 months.

Minimum Revenue Guarantees

In the normal course of
business, the Company may enter into revenue share agreements
with third party business partners who generate customer
referrals or provide marketing or other services related to the
generation of revenue. In certain of these agreements, the
Company may guarantee that a minimum amount of revenue share
payments will be made to the
 third party over a specified period of time. At
December 31, 2006, the maximum potential future payments
required to be made by the Company under these agreements was
$36 million.

Other Guarantees

The
Company provides liquidity and credit enhancement facilities to
a Company-sponsored conduit, as more fully described in the
“Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements” section within
Management’s Discussion and Analysis. Although management
believes a draw against these facilities is remote, the maximum
potential future payments guaranteed by the Company under these
arrangements were approximately $2.2 billion at
December 31, 2006. The recorded fair value of the
Company’s liability for the credit enhancement liquidity
facility was $10 million at December 31, 2006, and was
included in other liabilities.

The Company has also made financial performance guarantees
related to the operations of its subsidiaries. The maximum
potential future payments guaranteed by the Company under these
arrangements were approximately $1.9 billion at
December 31, 2006.

OTHER CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

In connection with the spin-off of Piper Jaffray Companies in
2003, the Company has agreed to indemnify Piper Jaffray
Companies against losses that may result from third-party claims
relating to certain specified matters. The Company’s
indemnification obligation related to these specified matters is
capped at $18 million and can be terminated by the Company
if there is a change in control event for Piper Jaffray
Companies. Through December 31, 2006, the Company has paid
approximately $12 million to Piper Jaffray Companies under this
agreement.

The Company is subject to various other litigation,
investigations and legal and administrative cases and
proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of its businesses.
Due to their complex nature, it may be years before some matters
are resolved. While it is impossible to ascertain the ultimate
resolution or range of financial liability with respect to these
contingent matters, the Company believes that the aggregate
amount of such liabilities will not have a material adverse
effect on the financial condition, results of operations or cash
flows of the Company.

CONDENSED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS

Transfer of funds (dividends, loans or advances) from bank
subsidiaries to the Company is restricted. Federal law requires
loans to the Company or its affiliates to be secured and
generally limits loans to the Company or an individual affiliate
to 10 percent of each bank’s unimpaired capital and
surplus. In aggregate, loans to the Company and all affiliates
cannot exceed 20 percent of each bank’s unimpaired
capital and surplus.

Dividend payments to the Company by its subsidiary banks are
subject to regulatory review and statutory limitations and, in
some instances, regulatory approval. The approval of the
Comptroller of the Currency is required if total dividends by a
national bank in any calendar year exceed the bank’s net
income for that year combined with its retained net income for
the preceding two calendar years or if the bank’s retained
earnings are less than zero. Furthermore, dividends are
restricted by the Comptroller of the Currency’s minimum
capital constraints for all national banks. Within these
guidelines, all bank subsidiaries have the ability to pay
dividends without prior regulatory approval. The amount of
dividends available to the parent company from the bank
subsidiaries at December 31, 2006, was approximately
$1.1 billion.

U.S. BANCORP



General Business Description

U.S. Bancorp is a
multi-state financial holding company headquartered in
Minneapolis, Minnesota. U.S. Bancorp was incorporated in
Delaware in 1929 and operates as a financial holding company and
a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of
1956. U.S. Bancorp provides a full range of financial
services, including lending and depository services, cash
management, foreign exchange and trust and investment management
services. It also engages in credit card services, merchant and
ATM processing, mortgage banking, insurance, brokerage and
leasing.

U.S. Bancorp’s banking subsidiaries are engaged in the
general banking business, principally in domestic markets. The
subsidiaries range in size from $35 million to
$136 billion in deposits and provide a wide range of
products and services to individuals, businesses, institutional
organizations, governmental entities and other financial
institutions. Commercial and consumer lending services are
principally offered to customers within the Company’s
domestic markets, to domestic customers with foreign operations
and within certain niche national venues. Lending services
include traditional credit products as well as credit card
services, financing and import/export trade, asset-backed
lending, agricultural finance and other products. Leasing
products are offered through bank leasing subsidiaries.
Depository services include checking accounts, savings accounts
and time certificate contracts. Ancillary services such as
foreign exchange, treasury management and receivable lock-box
collection are provided to corporate customers.
U.S. Bancorp’s bank and trust subsidiaries provide a
full range of asset management and fiduciary services for
individuals, estates, foundations, business corporations and
charitable organizations.

U.S. Bancorp’s non-banking subsidiaries primarily
offer investment and insurance products to the Company’s
customers principally within its markets and mutual fund
processing services to a broad range of mutual funds.

Banking and investment services are provided through a network
of 2,472 banking offices principally operating in 24 states
in the Midwest and West. The Company operates a network of 4,841
branded ATMs and provides

24-hour,

seven day a
week telephone customer service. Mortgage banking services are
provided through banking offices and loan production offices
throughout the Company’s markets. Consumer lending products
may be originated through banking offices, indirect
correspondents, brokers or other lending sources, and a consumer
finance division. The Company is also one of the largest
providers of
Visa

®

corporate and purchasing card services and corporate trust
services in the United States. A wholly-owned subsidiary, NOVA
Information Systems, Inc. (“NOVA”), provides merchant
processing services directly to merchants and through a network
of banking affiliations. Affiliates of NOVA provide similar
merchant services in Canada and segments of Europe. These
foreign operations are not significant to the Company.

On a full-time equivalent basis, as of December 31, 2006,
U.S. Bancorp employed 50,423 people.

Competition

The commercial
banking business is highly competitive. Subsidiary banks compete
with other commercial banks and with other financial
institutions, including savings and loan associations, mutual
savings banks, finance companies, mortgage banking companies,
credit unions and investment companies. In recent years,
competition has increased from institutions not subject to the
same regulatory restrictions as domestic banks and bank holding
companies.

Government Policies

The
operations of the Company’s various operating units are
affected by state and federal legislative changes and by
policies of various regulatory authorities, including those of
the numerous states in which they operate, the United States and
foreign governments. These policies include, for example,
statutory maximum legal lending rates, domestic monetary
policies of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System, United States fiscal policy, international currency
regulations and monetary policies, U.S. Patriot Act and
capital adequacy and liquidity constraints imposed by bank
regulatory agencies.

Supervision and Regulation

As a registered bank holding
company and financial holding company under the Bank Holding
Company Act, U.S. Bancorp is subject to the supervision of,
and regulation by, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System.

Under the Bank Holding Company Act, a financial holding company
may engage in banking, managing or controlling banks, furnishing
or performing services for banks it controls, and conducting
other financial activities. U.S. Bancorp must obtain the
prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board before acquiring
more than 5 percent of the outstanding shares of another
bank or bank holding company, and must provide notice to, and in
some situations obtain the prior approval of, the Federal
Reserve Board in connection with engaging in, or acquiring more
than 5 percent of the outstanding shares of a company
engaged in, a new financial activity.

Under the Bank Holding Company Act, U.S. Bancorp may
acquire banks throughout the United States, subject only to
state or federal deposit caps and state minimum age requirements.

National banks are subject to the supervision of, and are
examined by, the Comptroller of the Currency. All subsidiary
banks of the Company are members of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation and are subject to examination by the
FDIC. In practice, the primary federal


U.S. BANCORP


regulator makes regular examinations of each subsidiary bank
subject to its regulatory review or participates in joint
examinations with other federal regulators. Areas subject to
regulation by federal authorities include the allowance for
credit losses, investments, loans, mergers, issuance of
securities, payment of dividends, establishment of branches and
other aspects of operations.

Risk Factors

There are a
number of factors, including those specified below, that may
adversely affect the Company’s business, financial results
or stock price. Additional risks that the Company currently does
not know about or currently views as immaterial may also impair
the Company’s business or adversely impact its financial
results or stock price.

Industry Risk Factors

The Company’s business and financial results are
significantly affected by general business and economic
conditions.

The
Company’s business activities and earnings are affected by
general business conditions in the United States and abroad.
These conditions include short-term and long-term interest
rates, inflation, monetary supply, fluctuations in both debt and
equity capital markets, and the strength of the United States
economy and the local economies in which the Company operates.
For example, an economic downturn, an increase in unemployment,
or other events that affect household and/or corporate incomes
could result in a deterioration of credit quality, a change in
the allowance for credit losses, or reduced demand for credit or
fee-based products and services. Changes in the financial
performance and condition of the Company’s borrowers could
negatively affect repayment of those borrowers’ loans. In
addition, changes in securities market conditions and monetary
fluctuations could adversely affect the availability and terms
of funding necessary to meet the Company’s liquidity needs.

Changes in the domestic interest rate environment could
reduce the Company’s net interest income.

The operations of
financial institutions such as the Company are dependent to a
large degree on net interest income, which is the difference
between interest income from loans and investments and interest
expense on deposits and borrowings. An institution’s net
interest income is significantly affected by market rates of
interest, which in turn are affected by prevailing economic
conditions, by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal
government and by the policies of various regulatory agencies.
Like all financial institutions, the Company’s balance
sheet is affected by fluctuations in interest rates. Volatility
in interest rates can also result in the flow of funds away from
financial institutions into direct investments. Direct
investments, such as U.S. Government and corporate
securities and other investment vehicles (including mutual
funds) generally pay higher rates of return than financial
institutions, because of the absence of federal insurance
premiums and reserve requirements.

Changes in the laws, regulations and policies governing
financial services companies could alter the Company’s
business environment and adversely affect operations.

The Board of Governors of
the Federal Reserve System regulates the supply of money and
credit in the United States. Its fiscal and monetary policies
determine in a large part the Company’s cost of funds for
lending and investing and the return that can be earned on those
loans and investments, both of which affect the Company’s
net interest margin. Federal Reserve Board policies can also
materially affect the value of financial instruments that the
Company holds, such as debt securities and mortgage servicing
rights.

The Company and its bank subsidiaries are heavily regulated at
the federal and state levels. This regulation is to protect
depositors, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking
system as a whole. Congress and state legislatures and federal
and state agencies continually review banking laws, regulations
and policies for possible changes. Changes in statutes,
regulations or policies could affect the Company in substantial
and unpredictable ways, including limiting the types of
financial services and products that the Company offers and/or
increasing the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial
services and products. The Company cannot predict whether any of
this potential legislation will be enacted, and if enacted, the
effect that it or any regulations would have on the
Company’s financial condition or results of operations.

The financial services industry is highly competitive, and
competitive pressures could intensify and adversely affect the
Company’s financial results.

The Company operates in a
highly competitive industry that could become even more
competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and
technological changes and continued consolidation. The Company
competes with other commercial banks, savings and loan
associations, mutual savings banks, finance companies, mortgage
banking companies, credit unions and investment companies. In
addition, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it
possible for non-banks to offer products and services
traditionally provided by banks. Many of the Company’s
competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and some have
lower cost structures. Also, the potential need to adapt to
industry changes in information technology systems, on which the
Company and financial services industry are highly dependent,
could present operational issues and require capital spending.

Changes in consumer use of banks and changes in consumer
spending and saving habits could adversely affect the
Company’s financial results.

Technology and other
changes now allow many consumers to complete financial
transactions without using banks. For example,

U.S. BANCORP



consumers can pay bills and transfer funds directly without
going through a bank. This “disintermediation” could
result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of
customer deposits and income generated from those deposits. In
addition, changes in consumer spending and saving habits could
adversely affect the Company’s operations, and the Company
may be unable to timely develop competitive new products and
services in response to these changes that are accepted by new
and existing customers.

Acts or threats of terrorism and political or military
actions taken by the United States or other governments could
adversely affect general economic or industry conditions.

Geopolitical conditions
may also affect the Company’s earnings. Acts or threats or
terrorism and political or military actions taken by the United
States or other governments in response to terrorism, or similar
activity, could adversely affect general economic or industry
conditions.

Company Risk Factors

The Company’s allowance for loan losses may not be
adequate to cover actual losses.

Like all financial
institutions, the Company maintains an allowance for loan losses
to provide for loan defaults and non-performance. The
Company’s allowance for loan losses is based on its
historical loss experience as well as an evaluation of the risks
associated with its loan portfolio, including the size and
composition of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions
and geographic concentrations within the portfolio. The
Company’s allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to
cover actual loan losses, and future provisions for loan losses
could materially and adversely affect its financial results.

The Company may suffer losses in its loan portfolio
despite its underwriting practices.

The Company seeks to
mitigate the risks inherent in its loan portfolio by adhering to
specific underwriting practices. These practices often include:
analysis of a borrower’s credit history, financial
statements, tax returns and cash flow projections; valuation of
collateral based on reports of independent appraisers; and
verification of liquid assets. Although the Company believes
that its underwriting criteria are appropriate for the various
kinds of loans it makes, the Company may incur losses on loans
that meet these criteria.

Maintaining or increasing the Company’s market share
may depend on lowering prices and market acceptance of new
products and services.

The Company’s
success depends, in part, on its ability to adapt its products
and services to evolving industry standards. There is increasing
pressure to provide products and services at lower prices. Lower
prices can reduce the Company’s net interest margin and
revenues from its fee-based products and services. In addition,
the widespread adoption of new technologies, including internet
services, could require the Company to make substantial
expenditures to modify or adapt the Company’s existing
products and services. Also, these and other capital investments
in the Company’s businesses may not produce expected growth
in earnings anticipated at the time of the expenditure. The
Company might not be successful in introducing new products and
services, achieving market acceptance of its products and
services, or developing and maintaining loyal customers.

Because the nature of the financial services business
involves a high volume of transactions, the Company faces
significant operational risks.

The Company operates in
many different businesses in diverse markets and relies on the
ability of its employees and systems to process a high number of
transactions. Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting
from the Company’s operations, including, but not limited
to, the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside of the
Company, the execution of unauthorized transactions by
employees, errors relating to transaction processing and
technology, breaches of the internal control system and
compliance requirements and business continuation and disaster
recovery. This risk of loss also includes the potential legal
actions that could arise as a result of an operational
deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable
regulatory standards, adverse business decisions or their
implementation, and customer attrition due to potential negative
publicity. In the event of a breakdown in the internal control
system, improper operation of systems or improper employee
actions, the Company could suffer financial loss, face
regulatory action and suffer damage to its reputation.

The change in residual value of leased assets may have an
adverse impact on the Company’s financial results.

The Company engages in
leasing activities and is subject to the risk that the residual
value of the property under lease will be less than the
Company’s recorded asset value. Adverse changes in the
residual value of leased assets can have a negative impact on
the Company’s financial results. The risk of changes in the
realized value of the leased assets compared to recorded
residual values depends on many factors outside of the
Company’s control, including supply and demand for the
assets, collecting insurance claims, condition of the assets at
the end of the lease term, and other economic factors.

Negative publicity could damage the Company’s
reputation and adversely impact its business and financial
results.

Reputation risk,
or the risk to the Company’s earnings and capital from
negative publicity, is inherent in the Company’s business.
Negative publicity can result from the Company’s actual or
alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending
practices, corporate governance


U.S. BANCORP


and acquisitions, and actions taken by government regulators and
community organizations in response to those activities.
Negative publicity can adversely affect the Company’s
ability to keep and attract customers and can expose the Company
to litigation and regulatory action. Because most of the
Company’s businesses operate under the
“U.S. Bank” brand, actual or alleged conduct by
one business can result in negative publicity about other
businesses the Company operates. Although the Company takes
steps to minimize reputation risk in dealing with customers and
other constituencies, the Company, as a large diversified
financial services company with a high industry profile, is
inherently exposed to this risk.

The Company’s reported financial results depend on
management’s selection of accounting methods and certain
assumptions and estimates.

The Company’s
accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how the
Company records and reports its financial condition and results
of operations. The Company’s management must exercise
judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting
policies and methods so they comply with generally accepted
accounting principles and reflect management’s judgment of
the most appropriate manner to report the Company’s
financial condition and results. In some cases, management must
select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more
alternatives, any of which might be reasonable under the
circumstances, yet might result in the Company’s reporting
materially different results than would have been reported under
a different alternative.

Certain accounting policies are critical to presenting the
Company’s financial condition and results. They require
management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments
about matters that are uncertain. Materially different amounts
could be reported under different conditions or using different
assumptions or estimates. These critical accounting policies
include: the allowance for credit losses; the valuation of
mortgage servicing rights; the valuation of goodwill and other
intangible assets; and income taxes. Because of the uncertainty
of estimates involved in these matters, the Company may be
required to do one or more of the following: significantly
increase the allowance for credit losses and/or sustain credit
losses that are significantly higher than the reserve provided;
recognize significant impairment on its goodwill and other
intangible asset balances; or significantly increase its accrued
taxes liability.

For more information, refer to “Critical Accounting
Policies” in this Annual Report and
Form

10-K.

Changes in accounting standards could materially impact
the Company’s financial statements.

From time to time, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board changes the financial
accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation
of the Company’s financial statements. These changes can be
hard to predict and can materially impact how the Company
records and reports its financial condition and results of
operations. In some cases, the Company could be required to
apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in the
Company’s restating prior period financial statements.

Acquisitions may not produce revenue enhancements or cost
savings at levels or within timeframes originally anticipated
and may result in unforeseen integration difficulties.

The Company regularly
explores opportunities to acquire financial services businesses
or assets and may also consider opportunities to acquire other
banks or financial institutions. The Company cannot predict the
number, size or timing of acquisitions.

Difficulty in integrating an acquired business or company may
cause the Company not to realize expected revenue increases,
cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence,
and/or other projected benefits from the acquisition. The
integration could result in higher than expected deposit
attrition (run-off), loss of key employees, disruption of the
Company’s business or the business of the acquired company,
or otherwise adversely affect the Company’s ability to
maintain relationships with customers and employees or achieve
the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. Also, the negative
effect of any divestitures required by regulatory authorities in
acquisitions or business combinations may be greater than
expected.

The Company must generally receive federal regulatory approval
before it can acquire a bank or bank holding company. In
determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition,
federal bank regulators will consider, among other factors, the
effect of the acquisition on the competition, financial
condition, and future prospects. The regulators also review
current and projected capital ratios and levels, the competence,
experience, and integrity of management and its record of
compliance with laws and regulations, the convenience and needs
of the communities to be served (including the acquiring
institution’s record of compliance under the Community
Reinvestment Act) and the effectiveness of the acquiring
institution in combating money laundering activities. In
addition, the Company cannot be certain when or if, or on what
terms and conditions, any required regulatory approvals will be
granted. The Company may be required to sell banks or branches
as a condition to receiving regulatory approval.

If new laws were enacted that restrict the ability of the
Company and its subsidiaries to share information about
customers, the Company’s financial results could be
negatively affected.

The
Company’s business model depends on sharing information
among the family of

U.S. BANCORP



companies owned by U.S. Bancorp to better satisfy the
Company’s customer needs. Laws that restrict the ability of
the companies owned by U.S. Bancorp to share information
about customers could negatively affect the Company’s
revenue and profit.

The Company’s business could suffer if the Company
fails to attract and retain skilled people.

The Company’s
success depends, in large part, on its ability to attract and
retain key people. Competition for the best people in most
activities the Company engages in can be intense. The Company
may not be able to hire the best people or to keep them.

The Company relies on other companies to provide key
components of the Company’s business infrastructure.

Third party vendors
provide key components of the Company’s business
infrastructure such as internet connections, network access and
mutual fund distribution. While the Company has selected these
third party vendors carefully, it does not control their
actions. Any problems caused by these third parties, including
as a result of their not providing the Company their services
for any reason or their performing their services poorly, could
adversely affect the Company’s ability to deliver products
and services to the Company’s customers and otherwise to
conduct its business. Replacing these third party vendors could
also entail significant delay and expense.

Significant legal actions could subject the Company to
substantial uninsured liabilities.

The Company is from time
to time subject to claims related to its operations. These
claims and legal actions, including supervisory actions by the
Company’s regulators, could involve large monetary claims
and significant defense costs. To protect itself from the cost
of these claims, the Company maintains insurance coverage in
amounts and with deductibles that it believes are appropriate
for its operations. However, the Company’s insurance
coverage may not cover all claims against the Company or
continue to be available to the Company at a reasonable cost. As
a result, the Company may be exposed to substantial uninsured
liabilities, which could adversely affect the Company’s
results of operations and financial condition.

The Company is exposed to risk of environmental liability
when it takes title to properties.

In the course of the
Company’s business, the Company may foreclose on and take
title to real estate. As a result, the Company could be subject
to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties.
The Company may be held liable to a governmental entity or to
third parties for property damage, personal injury,
investigation and

clean-up

costs incurred
by these parties in connection with environmental contamination
or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic
substances or chemical releases at a property. The costs
associated with investigation or remediation activities could be
substantial. In addition, if the Company is the owner or former
owner of a contaminated site, it may be subject to common law
claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting
from environmental contamination emanating from the property. If
the Company becomes subject to significant environmental
liabilities, its financial condition and results of operations
could be adversely affected.

A natural disaster could harm the Company’s business.

Natural disasters could
harm the Company’s operations through interference with
communications, including the interruption or loss of the
Company’s websites, which would prevent the Company from
gathering deposits, originating loans and processing and
controlling its flow of business, as well as through the
destruction of facilities and the Company’s operational,
financial and management information systems.

The Company faces systems failure risks as well as
security risks, including “hacking” and “identity
theft.”

The computer
systems and network infrastructure the Company and others use
could be vulnerable to unforeseen problems. These problems may
arise in both our internally developed systems and the systems
of our third-party service providers. Our operations are
dependent upon our ability to protect computer equipment against
damage from fire, power loss or telecommunication failure. Any
damage or failure that causes an interruption in our operations
could adversely affect our business and financial results. In
addition, our computer systems and network infrastructure
present security risks, and could be susceptible to hacking or
identity theft.

The Company relies on dividends from its subsidiaries for
its liquidity needs.

The
Company is a separate and distinct legal entity from its bank
subsidiaries and non-bank subsidiaries. The Company receives
substantially all of its cash from dividends paid by its
subsidiaries. These dividends are the principal source of funds
to pay dividends on the Company’s stock and interest and
principal on its debt. Various federal and state laws and
regulations limit the amount of dividends that our bank
subsidiaries and certain of our non-bank subsidiaries may pay to
the Company. Also, the Company’s right to participate in a
distribution of assets upon a subsidiary’s liquidation or
reorganization is subject to prior claims of the
subsidiary’s creditors.

The Company has non-banking businesses that are subject to
various risks and uncertainties.

The Company is a
diversified financial services company, and the Company’s
business model is based on a mix of businesses that provide


U.S. BANCORP


a broad range of products and services delivered through
multiple distribution channels. In addition to banking, the
Company provides payment services, investments, mortgages and
corporate and personal trust services. Although the Company
believes its diversity helps lessen the effect of downturns in
any one segment of its industry, it also means the
Company’s earnings could be subject to various specific
risks and uncertainties related to these non-banking businesses.

The Company’s stock price can be volatile.

The Company’s stock
price can fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors,
including: actual or anticipated variations in the
Company’s quarterly operating results; recommendations by
securities analysts; significant acquisitions or business
combinations; strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital
commitments by or involving the Company or the Company’s
competitors; operating and stock price performance of other
companies that investors deem comparable to the Company; new
technology used or services offered by the Company’s
competitors; news reports relating to trends, concerns and other
issues in the financial services industry; and changes in
government regulations.

General market fluctuations, industry factors and general
economic and political conditions and events, including
terrorist attacks, economic slowdowns or recessions, interest
rate changes, credit loss trends or currency fluctuations, could
also cause the Company’s stock price to decrease regardless
of the Company’s operating results.

Properties

U.S. Bancorp and its
significant subsidiaries occupy headquarter offices under a
long-term lease in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The Company also
leases eight freestanding operations centers in Cincinnati,
Denver, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, Portland and St. Paul. The
Company owns nine principal operations centers in Cincinnati,
Coeur d’Alene, Fargo, Milwaukee, Owensboro, Portland,
St. Louis and St. Paul. At December 31, 2006, the
Company’s subsidiaries owned and operated a total of 1,466
facilities and leased an additional 1,439 facilities, all of
which are well maintained. The Company believes its current
facilities are adequate to meet its needs. Additional
information with respect to premises and equipment is presented
in Notes 8 and 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

CAPITAL COVENANTS

The Company has entered into several transactions involving the
issuance of capital securities (“Capital Securities”)
by Delaware statutory trusts formed by the Company (the
“Trusts”), the issuance by the Company of preferred
stock (“Preferred Stock”) or the issuance by an
indirect subsidiary of U.S. Bank National Association of
preferred stock exchangeable for the Company’s Preferred
Stock under certain circumstances (“Exchangeable Preferred
Stock”). Simultaneously with the closing of each of those
transactions, the Company entered into a replacement capital
covenant (each, a “Replacement Capital Covenant” and
collectively, the “Replacement Capital Covenants”) for
the benefit of persons that buy, hold or sell a specified series
of long-term indebtedness of the Company or U.S. Bank National
Association (the “Covered Debt”). Each of the
Replacement Capital Covenants provides that neither the Company
nor any of its subsidiaries (including any of the Trusts) will
repay, redeem or purchase any of the Preferred Stock,
Exchangeable Preferred Stock or the Capital Securities and the
securities held by the Trust (the “Other Securities”),
as applicable, on or before the date specified in the applicable
Replacement Capital Covenant, with certain limited exceptions,
except to the extent that, during the 180 days prior to the
date of that repayment, redemption or purchase, the Company has
received proceeds from the sale of qualifying securities that
(i) have equity-like characteristics that are the same as, or
more equity-like than, the applicable characteristics of the
Preferred Stock, the Exchangeable Preferred Stock, the Capital
Securities or Other Securities, as applicable, at the time of
repayment, redemption or purchase, and (ii) the Company has
obtained

U.S. BANCORP



the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board, if such
approval is then required by the Federal Reserve Board or, in
the case of the Exchangeable Preferred Stock, the approval of
the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The Company will
provide a copy of any Replacement Capital Covenant to a holder
of the relevant Covered Debt upon request made to the Investor
Relations contact listed inside the back cover of this Annual
Report and
Form

10-K.

The following table identifies the (i) closing date for each
transaction, (ii) issuer, (iii) series of Capital Securities,
Preferred Stock or Exchangeable Preferred Stock issued in the
relevant transaction, (iv) Other Securities, if any, and (v)
applicable Covered Debt.

(a)

USB Realty Corp. is an indirect subsidiary of U.S. Bank
    National Association.

(b)

Under certain circumstances, upon the direction of the Office
    of the Comptroller of the Currency, each share of USB Realty
    Corp.’s Series A Preferred Stock will be automatically
    exchanged for one share of the U.S. Bancorp’s Series C
    Non-cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock.
