Forward-Looking Statements

This Annual Report and Form 10-K contains
forward-looking statements. Statements that are not historical or current
facts, including statements about beliefs and expectations, are
forward-looking statements. These statements often include the words “may,”
“could,” “would,” “should,” “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “estimates,”
“intends,” “plans,” “targets,” “potentially,” “probably,” “projects,” “outlook”
or similar expressions. These forward-looking statements cover, among other
things, anticipated future revenue and expenses and the future prospects of
U.S. Bancorp. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and
uncertainties, and important factors could cause actual results to differ
materially from those anticipated, including the following, in addition to
those contained in U.S. Bancorp’s reports on file with the
SEC: (i) general economic or industry conditions could be less favorable than
expected, resulting in a deterioration in
credit quality, a change in the allowance for credit losses, or a reduced
demand for credit or fee-based
products and services; (ii) changes in the domestic interest rate environment
could reduce net interest income and could increase credit losses; (iii)
inflation, changes in securities market conditions and monetary
fluctuations could adversely affect the value or credit quality of our assets,
or the availability and terms of funding necessary to meet our liquidity needs;
(iv) changes in the extensive laws, regulations and policies
governing financial services companies could alter our business environment or
affect operations; (v) the potential need to adapt to industry changes in
information technology systems, on which we are highly dependent,
could present operational issues or require significant capital spending; (vi)
competitive pressures could intensify and affect our profitability, including
as a result of continued industry consolidation, the increased
availability of financial services from non-banks, technological developments
or bank regulatory reform; (vii) changes in consumer spending and savings
habits could adversely affect our results of operations; (viii)
changes in the financial performance and condition of our borrowers could
negatively affect repayment of such borrowers’ loans; (ix) acquisitions may not
produce revenue enhancements or cost savings at levels or
within time frames originally anticipated, or may result in unforeseen
integration difficulties; (x) capital investments in our businesses may not
produce expected growth in earnings anticipated at the time of the
expenditure; and (xi) acts or threats of terrorism, and/or political and
military actions taken by the U.S. or other governments in response to acts or
threats of terrorism or otherwise could adversely affect general economic
or industry conditions. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date
they are made, and U.S. Bancorp undertakes no obligation to update them in
light of new information or future events.


“We are pleased to tell you
that in 2003, we reported
record earnings and also
achieved the financial results
to which we had committed.”

f e l l o w

s h a r e h o l d e r s :

delivered strong financial results in 2003, the
culmination of five years of transformation and
integration, during which we forged a company
uniquely positioned to generate consistent earnings
and revenue growth.

•

Earnings per share increased 17.6% over 2002

•

Record net income increased 17.8% over 2002

•

Industry-leading Return on Assets of 1.99%

•

Growing U.S. Bancorp.

With virtually all
integration and merger-related activities behind us,
we are now focused solely on growing U.S. Bancorp
by leveraging the breadth and depth of the powerful
franchise we have built. Our five-year transformation
allowed us to gain access to high-growth markets,
to solidify strong regional positions and to build a
national platform. During our integration process,
we accelerated our cost control leadership. We are
now extending that cost and execution leadership,
as well as making significant strategic investments
in our highest-potential businesses, and reaffirming
our focus on delivering high-quality service.

Achieving our goals to build a stronger
corporation.

I am pleased to tell you that
U.S. Bancorp accomplished the performance,
credit quality and other goals we had previously
committed to achieving. We met financial
objectives — in particular, revenue growth,
expense management, net interest margin and
earnings per share.

In addition, and perhaps most importantly, we
continue to show improvement in overall credit
quality, a direct result of all we have done in the
past two years to reduce this corporation’s risk
profile. We also completed the spin-off of Piper
Jaffray, further reducing risk and volatility in our
business. Finally, we began a major expansion of
our distribution channels in fast-growing markets
within our franchise through the previously
announced in-store branch partnerships with
Safeway/Vons, Smith’s and Publix.

140 years of creating value for
shareholders.

We have targeted returning
80 percent of our earnings to shareholders through
a combination of dividends and share repurchases.

The 17 percent common stock dividend increase
approved by our Board of Directors and announced
in December 2003 is a continuation of a long
history of paying significant dividends, as well
as a reflection of the Board’s confidence in this
corporation’s future success.

U.S. Bancorp, through its predecessor companies,
has increased its dividend in each of the past
32 years and has paid a dividend for 140
consecutive years.

In addition to the common stock dividend discussed above, as part of the
December 2003 spin-off of
Piper Jaffray, U.S. Bancorp distributed common shares of the new Piper Jaffray
Companies in the
form of a special dividend to eligible U.S. Bancorp shareholders.

Also in December 2003, our Board of Directors approved authorization to
repurchase 150 million
shares of outstanding U.S. Bancorp common stock during the next two years.

These specific steps were undertaken to increase the value of your shares; in
addition, we manage
this corporation with the long-term value of your investment as our paramount
objective. It’s the
reason we come to work each day.

Sincerely,

Jerry A. Grundhofer

Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

U.S. Bancorp

c o r p o r a t e

g o v e r n a n c e

Good corporate governance promotes ethical
business practices, demands meticulous accounting
policies and procedures and includes a structure
with effective checks and balances. Corporate
governance is vital to the continued success of
U.S. Bancorp and the entire financial services
industry. Our ethical standards have rewarded
us with an enviable reputation in today’s
marketplace — a marketplace where trust is
hard to earn. Our shareholders, customers,
communities and employees demand — and
deserve — to do business with companies
they can trust. U.S. Bancorp operates with
uncompromising honesty and integrity. Our
Board of Directors has had a Corporate
Governance Committee for many years. We have
implemented Corporate Governance Guidelines
in response to today’s heightened concern. Our
Corporate Governance Guidelines are available
for you to view on our Internet web site at
usbank.com. Following are some of the important
elements of our Corporate Governance practices.

Independent oversight.

Each of our Audit
Committee, Compensation Committee and
Governance Committee is composed entirely of
independent outside directors. In fact, following
our annual meeting, our Chairman, President and
Chief Executive Officer will be the only member
of our Board of Directors who is not independent.
In addition, our Board of Directors and the
committees of the Board meet in “executive
session” without management in attendance at
every meeting. The presiding director at every
executive session of the Board is an independent
director. The Board and each committee also have
express authority to engage outside advisors to
provide additional independent expertise for their
deliberations.

Board of Directors’ focus on
U.S. Bancorp.

To ensure that our directors
are able to focus effectively on our business,
we limit the number of other public company
boards a director may serve on to three. The
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
of U.S. Bancorp serves on only two other public
company boards. Audit Committee members
may serve on no more than three other public
company audit committees, and the chairman
of the Audit Committee serves on no other
audit committees.

Board of Directors’ knowledge and
expertise.

All of our directors are skilled
business leaders. Directors are encouraged to
attend continuing director education seminars in
order to keep a sharp focus on current good
governance practices. In addition, the Board and
each committee may use outside advisors to add expertise on specific
issues. Our directors have full and

unrestricted access to our management and
employees. Additionally, key members of
management attend Board meetings from time to
time to present information about the results,
plans and operations of their business segments.
The Board and each committee perform annual
self-evaluations in order to assess their
performance and to ensure that the Board
and committee structure is providing effective
oversight of corporate management. You may
review the charters of each of our Board
committees on our Internet web site at
usbank.com.

Management’s ownership commitment.

We understand clearly that U.S. Bancorp
shareholders are the primary beneficiaries of
management’s actions. All U.S. Bancorp executive
officers and directors own shares of company
stock, and in order to tightly align management’s
interests with those of our shareholders, we have
established stock ownership guidelines for our
executive officers.

Disclosure controls.

We have established
rigorous procedures to ensure that we provide
complete and accurate disclosure in our publicly
filed documents. We have also established a
telephone hotline for employees to anonymously
submit any concern they may have regarding
corporate controls or ethical breaches.
Management investigates all complaints and
directs to our Audit Committee any issues
relating to concerns about our financial
statements or public disclosures.

U.S. Bancorp Code of Ethics and
Business Conduct.

Each year, we reiterate
the vital importance of our Code of Ethics and
Business Conduct. The Code applies to directors,
officers and all employees, who must certify
annually their compliance with the standards of
the Code. The content of the Code is based not
solely on what we have the right to do, but, even
more importantly, on what is the right thing to
do. Our standards are higher than any legal
minimum because our business is built on trust.
You may review our Code of Ethics and Business
Conduct on our Internet web site at usbank.com.

Communications with our Board of
Directors.

Shareholders can communicate with
our Board of Directors by sending a letter
addressed to the Board of Directors, the
independent outside directors or specified
individual directors, to:

Great service is more than our goal; it’s the way we
do business. Every U.S. Bancorp employee in every
U.S. Bancorp line of business is committed to
providing responsive, prompt and helpful service -
every transaction, every relationship, every day.
And our exclusive Five Star Service Guarantee
backs up our promise to deliver the outstanding
service our customers expect and deserve.

Five Star Service Guarantee ensures highest level of service.

Exceptional service is the single most important thing U.S. Bank offers our
customers.
We make a promise to deliver the highest level of customer service and we
boldly back
up this pledge with the U.S. Bank Five Star Service Guarantee, which ensures
the core
service standards most important to our customers — such as availability,
accuracy,
timeliness and responsiveness — are met and exceeded. Every U.S. Bank customer
is
covered by one or more guarantees. If we fall short in keeping our service
guarantees,
and our customer tells us they did not get the service they expected and
deserved, we
pay the customer for the inconvenience.

Taking ownership of our business one employee at a time.

Each line of business has developed and adapted its own Five Star Service
Guarantee,
defining the quality standards that are expected and demanded of every employee — standards
that are based on meeting the diverse financial needs of all our customers.
U.S. Bank has created an environment in which employees understand how their
individual service and sales performance contributes to revenue growth and


shareholder value. It is an environment where employees take ownership of their
business, where they are held accountable for the company’s success and where
they
are compensated for measurable performance results.

Service is foundation of success.

U.S. Bank employees are recognized
and rewarded for their outstanding service. Our Pay for Performance
compensation
program rewards employees financially and personally for their achievements in
meeting service and sales goals and for their contributions to company
earnings.
Customized line of business incentive programs drive employees to generate
revenue while fulfilling customers’ needs. Each quarter, 20 selected employees
who exemplify our high service standards are inducted into the prestigious
Circle of Service Excellence.

The Service Advantage puts customers at center of everything
we do.

To deepen our commitment to superior service, in 2003, we launched
The Service Advantage, an innovative internal initiative designed to increase
customer
access and convenience; simplify customer issue solutions; make quality service
central
to hiring, orientation and training; and improve the common customer
experience.
Our Service Council is the driving force behind The Service Advantage; it is
comprised
of senior managers from every line of business who identify areas of
improvement,
analyze customer satisfaction measurements and implement resolutions that
create
greater customer satisfaction and loyalty. We are enhancing existing and
creating new
internal service techniques and processes, as well, so that our frontline
employees have
the tools and support they need to better meet customer expectations. By the
end of
first quarter 2004, every U.S. Bank employee will have received personalized
training
on the core principles of The Service Advantage.

Distribution channels deliver anytime access.

Our distribution
channels — including 2,243 branch banking offices in 24 states, 4,425 U.S. Bank
ATMs, 24-hour call center service, U.S. Bank Internet Banking and specialized
trust, brokerage and home mortgage offices — form the foundation of our
powerful
presence in many of the country’s high-growth, diversified markets. Our growing
branch network operates in three strategically segmented formats. Community
Banking delivers our full range of products and services in smaller, non-urban
communities through the local office. Metropolitan Banking serves branch
customers
in larger and urban locations as a separate line of business through
partnerships with
all businesses of the bank. Our highly successful In-store Banking operates
branches
inside grocery stores, colleges and universities, workplaces, retirement
centers and
other high-traffic locations.


Expanding in-store banking office distribution.

In 2003,
we began a major expansion of our in-store network — the third largest
in the country — by partnering with supermarket retailers Safeway Inc.,
Publix and Smith’s Food & Drug Stores. Beginning with six new
Nashville Publix branches in 2003, by the end of 2004, U.S. Bank
will have opened 15 new Smith’s in-store branches in Utah, and by
the end of 2005 we will have opened a total of 163 new full-service
in-store locations in Safeway and Vons stores throughout California,
Arizona and Nevada.

Strategic investments solidify our position in high-growth
markets and businesses.

In 2003, U.S. Bank completed system conversions
resulting from the 2002 purchase and deposit assumption of 57 Bay View Bank
branches in California. This transaction strengthened the U.S. Bank geographic
footprint in California, adding to existing U.S. Bank branches to create an
integrated
network offering complete coverage of the fast-growing Greater Bay area-
San Francisco, San Jose, Alameda County, Contra Costa County, Santa Rosa,
Vallejo-Fairfield-Sonoma and Santa Cruz.

In 2003, U.S. Bank also completed system conversions resulting from the
purchase
of State Street Corporate Trust in 2002. This transaction strongly complemented
our existing corporate trust business, making U.S. Bank the leading corporate
trust
provider in New England in addition to our current lead status in the
Northwest,
West and Central regions of the country.

The sports, educational and cultural
programs of the Mathews-Dickey
Boys’ & Girls’ Club in St. Louis instill
“The Three R’s: Respect, Restraint &
Responsibility” within more than 40,000
deserving young men and women each
year. In 1982, President Ronald Reagan
recognized the Club’s neighbor-helping neighbor
concept by declaring it a
model for the country. Numerous
other government, media, sports and
civic luminaries have applauded the
44-year-old organization’s impact in
keeping more than one million youth
on the fields, in the classroom and off
the streets. We’ve enjoyed a successful
relationship with Mathews-Dickey, a
long-time client of the U.S. Bank Private
Client Group. We are proud to manage
the Endowment Fund for Mathews-
Dickey to support its youth-enrichment
programs for years to come.

U.S. Bancorp serves multiple customer segments
in our 24-state footprint through a broad, attractive
business mix with scale, resulting in competitive
advantages, operating economies, reduced risk,
diversified revenue streams and a wide range
of ways to satisfy every customer.

U.S. Bancorp has a very attractive growth franchise.

Our core
regional businesses operate in our 24-state footprint and benefit from the
geographic
density of our banking locations and franchise support in terms of cross-sell,
crossservicing
and back-office support. Our top-performing regional businesses, combined
with our specialized national-scale businesses, create a diversified and
advantaged
revenue mix of both spread and fee income from discrete sources. With
challenge,
opportunity, risk and reward spread across all geographic markets and a wide
range
of customer and business segments, we are positioned to capitalize on a
recovering
economy, while tolerating individual market or industry weaknesses.


Improving business unit trends.

We see strong business momentum in
Consumer Banking; we opened nearly a quarter of a million more checking
accounts
than were closed in 2003. A checking account is our retail customers’ primary
link
to U.S. Bank and is the basis for our 11.7 percent compound annual growth rate
in
branch-generated average low-cost core deposits. More importantly, checking is
the starting point for expanded consumer relationships, reflected in a 12
percent
compound annual growth rate in branch-generated average retail loans. Small
business loans and branch-based investment product fee income also showed
double-digit growth rates.

Our investment in distribution in high-growth markets continues, most
particularly
our current in-store branch expansion and our extension of mortgage banking
origination capabilities in western markets.

In our Wholesale Banking business, the timing of commercial loan growth is
still
uncertain; however, we expect credit improvement trends to continue, a key
driver
of future growth. Along with loan generation, our relationship managers are
putting
renewed focus on providing appropriate supplementary services and deposit
products
to our commercial customers.

Improving equity markets are driving growth in our Private Client, Trust &
Asset
Management business units, as are outstanding service and our exceptional
personal
attention to each customer. Deposits, total loans and noninterest income are on
upward trends. We strive to increase the level and breadth of services we
provide to
corporate executives, business owners, legal and healthcare professionals,
professional
athletes and non-profit organizations with their specialized and complex
financial
needs. Private Client Group earns an increasing share of wallet through expert
investment management, financial planning, personal trust and private banking
services. Institutional investment needs are met with high-performing
securities
lending, equity, fixed income and cash products.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis

OVERVIEW

In 2003, U.S. Bancorp and its subsidiaries (the
“Company”) achieved each of the goals outlined for the
year despite challenging economic conditions in early 2003. We
began the year with several specific financial objectives. The
first goal was to focus on organic revenue growth. In 2003, the
Company’s revenue growth of 3.9 percent included
3.7 percent growth in revenue from baseline business
products and services. The second goal was to continue improving
our operating leverage. During 2003, our efficiency ratio
improved to 45.6 percent compared with 48.8 percent in
2002. Third, the Company was determined to continue improving
its credit quality and reduce the overall risk profile of the
organization. Nonperforming assets have declined
16.4 percent from a year ago and total net charge-offs
decreased to 1.06 percent of average loans outstanding in
2003 compared with 1.20 percent in 2002. Finally, despite
the challenges of 2003, the Company always desires to grow
revenues faster than expenses. The Company’s results for
2003 reflect the achievement of this objective.

The Company’s strong performance is also
reflected in our capital levels and the improving outlook by our
credit rating agencies relative to a year ago. Equity capital of
the Company has increased to 6.5 percent of tangible common
equity at December 31, 2003 from 5.7 percent at
December 31, 2002. Credit ratings assigned by various
credit rating agencies reflect the favorable rating agency views
of the direction of the Company’s credit quality, risk
management, liquidity and capital management practices and our
ability to generate earnings. Each of these factors is
considered important by management and discussed further
throughout this document.

In concert with achieving our stated financial
objectives, the Company took key steps to strategically change
the risk profile of the organization and enhance shareholder
value. The Company’s financial statements reflect decisions
by the Company to spin off Piper Jaffray Companies (“Piper
Jaffray”) and to adopt the fair value method of accounting
for stock-based compensation. Additionally, in December 2003 we
announced an expanded share repurchase program and further
increased our cash dividend resulting in a 23.1 percent
increase from the dividend rate in the fourth quarter of 2002.
The tax-free distribution of Piper Jaffray strategically changed
the risk profile of the Company by reducing the earnings
volatility and business risks associated with investment banking
and resulted in the distribution to our shareholders of an
independent company with approximately $880 million of
market value shortly after the distribution.

In connection with the Piper Jaffray spin-off and
the change in our method of accounting for stock-based
compensation, the financial statements of the Company have been
restated for all prior periods. As such, historical financial
results related to Piper Jaffray have been segregated and
accounted for in the Company’s financial statements as
discontinued operations.

Earnings Summary

The
Company reported net income of $3.7 billion in 2003, or
$1.93 per diluted share, compared with $3.2 billion, or
$1.65 per diluted share, in 2002. Return on average assets and
return on average equity were 1.99 percent and
19.2 percent, respectively, in 2003, compared with returns
of 1.84 percent and 18.3 percent, respectively, in
2002. Net income in 2003 included after-tax income from
discontinued operations of $22.5 million, or $.01 per
diluted share, compared with an after-tax loss of
$22.7 million, or $.01 per diluted share, in 2002. Included
in net income for 2002 was an after-tax goodwill impairment
charge of $37.2 million, or $.02 per diluted share,
primarily related to the purchase of a transportation leasing
company in 1998 by the equipment leasing business. This charge
was taken at the time of adopting new accounting standards
related to goodwill and other intangible assets and was
recognized as a “cumulative effect of accounting
change” in the income statement. Refer to Note 2 of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further
discussion of the impact of changes in accounting principles.

In 2003, the Company had income from continuing
operations, net of tax, of $3.7 billion, or $1.92 per
diluted share, compared with $3.2 billion, or $1.68 per
diluted share, in 2002. The 14.9 percent increase in income
from continuing operations was primarily due to growth in net
revenue, lower expenses and decreased credit costs. Net income
from continuing operations included after-tax merger and
restructuring-related items of $30.4 million
($46.2 million on a pre-tax basis), compared with after-tax
merger and restructuring-related items of $209.3 million
($321.2 million on a pre-tax basis) in 2002. The
$275.0 million decline in pre-tax merger and
restructuring-related charges was primarily due to the
completion of integration activities associated with the merger
of Firstar Corporation and the former U.S. Bancorp of
Minneapolis (“USBM”) at the end of 2002. Partially
offsetting this favorable item in 2003 was a year-over-year
decrease of $55.1 million in net securities gains realized
in 2002, and a year-over-year increase in the level of mortgage
servicing rights (“MSRs”) impairment of
$22.6 million, driven by

18 U.S. Bancorp


changes in interest rates and related
prepayments. Refer to “Merger and Restructuring-Related
Items” for further discussion on merger and
restructuring-related items and the related earnings impact.

Total net revenue, on a taxable-equivalent basis,
was $12.5 billion in 2003, compared with $12.1 billion
in 2002, a year-over-year increase of $472.6 million
(3.9 percent). This growth was primarily due to organic
growth of 3.7 percent and the benefit of acquisitions,
offset somewhat by lower gains from asset sales. Revenue growth
was comprised of a 5.4 percent increase in net interest
income and a 2.0 percent net increase in noninterest
income. The

5.4 percent increase in net interest income
resulted from an increase of $13.4 billion (9.1 percent) in
average earning assets, primarily driven by increases in
investment securities, residential mortgages, retail loans and
loans held for sale, partially offset by an overall decline in
commercial loans. The impact of the increase in average earning
assets was offset in part by a lower net interest margin given
the current interest rate environment. The net interest margin
in 2003 was 4.49 percent, compared with 4.65 percent
in 2002. The decline reflected the change in asset mix among
loan products, reinvestment of loan proceeds into lower-yielding
investment securities and a reduction in the marginal benefit of
net free funds due to lower average interest rates. The
2.0 percent net increase in noninterest income was driven
by increases in payment services revenue, trust and investment
management fees, deposit service charges, treasury management
fees, mortgage banking activity, strong investment product sales
and the impact of acquisitions. Somewhat offsetting the growth
in these fee-based revenues was a year-over-year decline in net
securities gains of $55.1 million. Additionally, other
revenues for 2002 included $67.4 million of gains related
to the sales of two co-branded credit card portfolios.
Approximately $194.6 million of the increase in net revenue in
2003, compared with 2002, was due to acquisitions, including The
Leader Mortgage Company, LLC (“Leader”), the
57 branches of Bay View Bank (“Bay View”) in
northern California and the corporate trust business of State
Street Bank and Trust Company (“State Street Corporate
Trust”).

Total noninterest expense was $5.6 billion
in 2003, compared with $5.7 billion in 2002. The decrease in
total noninterest expense of $143.6 million
(2.5 percent) primarily reflected a year-over-year
reduction in merger and restructuring-related charges of
$275.0 million and cost savings related to integration
efforts. Partially offsetting this decrease in expense during
2003 was a year-over-year increase of $22.6 million in MSR
impairments coupled with the net impact of acquisitions, which
accounted for approximately $124.9 million of the expense
growth in 2003. Refer to “Acquisition and Divestiture
Activity” and “Merger and Restructuring-related
Items” for further information on the timing of
acquisitions and discussion of merger and restructuring-related
items. The efficiency ratio (the ratio of noninterest expense to
taxable-equivalent net revenue excluding net securities gains or
losses) was 45.6 percent in 2003, compared with
48.8 percent in 2002. The favorable change in the
efficiency ratio reflects the continuing improvement in the
Company’s operating leverage resulting from integrated
operating systems across all of our markets and business lines.
In 2003, all business and system integration activities were
completed including systems for our merchant processing
business, Nova Information Systems, Inc., and the recent
acquisitions of the corporate trust business of State Street
Bank and Trust Company and the 57 branches of Bay View Bank. The
Company anticipates no merger and restructuring-related charges
in 2004 relating to completed acquisitions.

The provision for credit losses was
$1,254.0 million for 2003, compared with
$1,349.0 million for 2002, a decrease of $95.0 million
(7.0 percent). Net charge-offs during 2003 were
$1,251.7 million, compared with net charge-offs of
$1,373.0 million during 2002. The decline in net
charge-offs reflects an improving economy and the Company’s
ongoing efforts to reduce the overall credit risk profile of the
organization over the past three years. Refer to “Corporate
Risk Profile” for further information on the provision for
credit losses, net charge-offs, nonperforming assets and factors
considered by the Company in assessing the credit quality of the
loan portfolio and establishing the allowance for credit losses.

Acquisition and Divestiture Activity

On December 31, 2003, the Company
announced that it had completed the tax-free distribution of
Piper Jaffray Companies representing substantially all of the
Company’s capital markets business line. The Company
distributed to our shareholders one share of Piper Jaffray
common stock for every 100 shares of U.S. Bancorp common stock,
by means of a special dividend of $685 million. This
distribution did not include brokerage, financial advisory or
asset management services offered to customers through other
business units. The Company will continue to provide asset
management services to its customers through the Private Client,
Trust and Asset Management business segment and access to
investment products and services through its extensive network
of licensed financial advisors within the retail brokerage
platform of the Consumer Banking business segment.

The following acquisition transactions were
accounted for as purchases from the date of completion. On
December 31, 2002, the Company acquired the corporate trust
business of State Street Corporate Trust in a cash transaction
valued at $725 million. State Street Corporate Trust was a
leading provider, particularly in the Northeast, of corporate
trust and agency services to a variety of municipalities,
corporations, government agencies and other financial
institutions serving approximately 20,000 client issuances
representing over $689 billion of assets under
administration. With this acquisition, the Company is among the
nation’s leading providers of a full range of corporate
trust products and services. The transaction represented total
assets acquired of $682 million and total liabilities of
$39 million at the closing date. Included in total assets
were contract and other intangibles with a fair value of $218
million and the excess of purchase price over the fair value of
identifiable net assets (“goodwill”) of

20 U.S. Bancorp


$449 million. The goodwill reflected the
strategic value of the combined organization’s leadership
position in the corporate trust business and processing
economies of scale resulting from the transaction. As part of
the purchase price, $75 million was placed in escrow for up
to eighteen months with payment contingent on the successful
transition of business relationships.

On November 1, 2002, the Company acquired 57
branches and a related operations facility in northern
California from Bay View, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bay View
Capital Corporation, in a cash transaction. The transaction
represented total assets acquired of $853 million and total
liabilities assumed (primarily retail and small business
deposits) of $3.3 billion. Included in total assets were
approximately $336 million of select loans primarily with
depository relationships, core deposit intangibles of
$56 million and goodwill of $427 million. The goodwill
reflected the strategic value of expanding the Company’s
market within the San Francisco Bay area.

On April 1, 2002, the Company acquired
Cleveland-based Leader, a wholly-owned subsidiary of First
Defiance Financial Corp., in a cash transaction. The transaction
represented total assets acquired of $531 million and total
liabilities assumed of $446 million. Included in total
assets were mortgage servicing rights and other intangibles of
$173 million and goodwill of $18 million. Leader
specializes in acquiring servicing of loans originated for state
and local housing authorities.

The following acquisitions were completed during
the year 2001. On September 7, 2001, the Company acquired
Pacific Century Bank (“Pacific Century”), which had 20
branches located in southern California and total assets of
$570 million. On July 24, 2001, the Company acquired
NOVA Corporation (“NOVA”), a merchant processor, which
had total assets of $2.9 billion.

STATEMENT OF INCOME ANALYSIS

Net Interest Income

Net interest income, on a
taxable-equivalent basis, was $7.2 billion in 2003, compared
with $6.8 billion in 2002 and $6.4 billion in 2001.
The increase in net interest income in 2003 was driven by an
increase in average earning assets, growth in average net free
funds and favorable changes in the Company’s average
funding mix. Also contributing to the year-over-year increase in
net interest income were recent acquisitions, including Leader,
State Street Corporate Trust and Bay View, which accounted for
approximately $71.9 million of the increase during 2003.
Average earning assets were $160.8 billion for 2003,
compared with $147.4 billion and $143.5 billion for
2002 and 2001, respectively. The $13.4 billion
(9.1 percent) increase in average earning assets for 2003,
compared with 2002, was primarily driven by increases in
investment securities, loans held for sale, residential
mortgages and retail loans, partially offset by a decline in
commercial loans. The net interest margin in 2003 was
4.49 percent, compared with 4.65 percent and
4.46 percent in 2002 and 2001, respectively. The 16 basis
point decline in 2003 net interest margin, compared with 2002,
primarily reflected

growth in lower-yielding investment securities as
a percent of total earning assets, changes in loan mix and a
decline in the margin benefit from net free funds due to lower
average interest rates. In addition, the net interest margin
declined year-over-year as a result of consolidating high credit
quality, low margin loans from Stellar Funding Group, Inc., a
commercial loan conduit, onto the Company’s balance sheet
in mid-2003.

Total average loans of $118.4 billion in
2003 were $3.9 billion (3.4 percent) higher, compared with
2002, reflecting growth in average residential mortgages, retail
loans and commercial real estate loans of $3.3 billion
(39.0 percent), $1.7 billion (4.6 percent) and
$1.4 billion (5.5 percent), respectively. Growth in
these categories was offset somewhat by an overall decline in
average commercial loans of $2.5 billion
(5.7 percent). The decline in commercial loans was
primarily driven by softness in commercial loan demand, modestly
offset by the consolidation of loans from Stellar Funding Group,
Inc. in mid-2003. Despite recent economic growth, the Company
anticipates that commercial loan demand will continue to be soft
in early 2004 while business customers utilize liquidity in
deposit accounts to fund business activities.

Average investment securities were
$8.4 billion (29.2 percent) higher in 2003, compared
with 2002, reflecting the reinvestment of proceeds from loan
sales, declining commercial loan balances and deposits assumed
in connection with the Bay View transaction. During 2003, the
Company sold $15.3 billion of fixed-rate securities
classified as available-for-sale as part of the Company’s
interest rate risk management practices. During early 2003,
sales of fixed-rate securities offset much of the economic
impact of changes in MSR valuations. During the course of 2003,
the Company began repositioning the investment portfolio by
reinvesting proceeds from the sale of fixed-rate securities into
floating-rate instruments.

Average interest-bearing deposits of
$84.8 billion in 2003 were higher by $8.4 billion
(11.0 percent), compared with 2002. Approximately
$3.0 billion of the year-over-year increase in average
interest-bearing deposits was due to acquisitions, while the
remaining growth was driven by increases in savings balances.
The increase in savings balances reflected product initiatives,
increasing government banking deposits and customer decisions to
maintain liquidity. The Company anticipates that the growth in

interest-bearing deposits will moderate in 2004
as the economy continues to expand.

Average net free funds increased
$3.1 billion from a year ago, including an increase in
average noninterest-bearing deposits of $3.0 billion
(10.4 percent) in 2003, compared with 2002. The increase in
noninterest-bearing deposits was primarily due to mortgage
banking activities during early 2003 and higher liquidity among
corporate customers maintained in demand deposit balances
year-over-year.

The increase in net interest income in 2002,
compared with 2001, was related to an improvement in the net
interest margin as well as growth in earning assets. The 19
basis point improvement in the 2002 net interest margin,
compared with 2001, reflected the funding benefits of the
declining interest rate environment, a more favorable funding
mix and improving spreads due to product repricing dynamics,
growth in net free funds and a shift in mix toward retail loans,
partially offset by lower yields on the investment portfolio.
The $3.9 billion (2.7 percent) increase in average
earning assets for 2002, compared with 2001, was primarily
driven by increases in the investment portfolio and retail loan
growth, partially offset by a decline in commercial and
commercial real estate loans. The $3.7 billion decrease in
total average loans for 2002, compared with 2001, reflected
strong growth in average retail loans of $3.1 billion which
was more than offset by an overall decline in average commercial
and commercial real estate loans of $6.6 billion. Average
investment securities were $6.9 billion (31.5 percent)
higher in 2002, compared with 2001, reflecting reinvestment of
proceeds from loan sales, declines in commercial and commercial
real estate loan balances and growth in deposits. Average
interest-bearing deposits of $76.4 billion in 2002 were lower by
$3.4 billion, compared with 2001. Growth in average savings
products (5.4 percent) for 2002 was more than offset by
reductions in the average balances of higher cost time
certificates of deposit (17.3 percent) and time
certificates of deposit greater than $100,000 (13.2 percent).
The decline in time certificates and time deposits greater than
$100,000 reflected funding decisions toward more favorably
priced wholesale funding sources given the rate environment and
customers’ desire to maintain liquidity. The increase in
average net free funds was driven by an increase in average
noninterest-bearing deposits of $3.6 billion
(14.4 percent) in 2002, compared with 2001.

Provision for Credit Losses

The provision for credit losses is
recorded to bring the allowance for credit losses to a level
deemed appropriate by management based on factors discussed in
the “Analysis and Determination of Allowance for Credit
Losses” section. The provision for credit losses was
$1,254.0 million in 2003, compared with
$1,349.0 million and $2,528.8 million in 2002 and
2001, respectively.

The decline in the provision for credit losses of
$95.0 million in 2003 primarily reflected an improving
credit risk profile resulting in lower nonperforming loans and
commercial and retail loan losses. The decline in nonperforming
loans and commercial loan net charge-offs was broad-based across
most industries within the commercial loan portfolio. Retail
loan delinquency ratios have also continued to improve across
most retail loan portfolios reflecting improving economic
conditions and the Company’s ongoing collection efforts and
risk management activities. These are also the principal factors
resulting in lower levels of retail net charge-offs during the
year.

The decline in the provision for credit losses of
$1,179.8 million in 2002 was primarily related to specific
credit actions taken in 2001. Included in the provision for
credit losses in 2001 was a $1,025 million incremental
provision recognized in the third quarter of 2001 and a
$160 million charge during the first quarter of 2001 in
connection with an accelerated loan workout strategy. The third
quarter of 2001 provision for credit losses was significantly
above the level anticipated earlier in that quarter and was
taken after extensive review of the Company’s commercial
loan portfolio in light of the events of September 11,
2001, declining economic conditions, and company-specific
trends. The action reflected the Company’s expectations, at
that time, of a prolonged economic slowdown and recovery. In
addition to these actions, the provision for credit losses in
2001 included a merger and restructuring-related provision of
$382.2 million. The merger and restructuring-related
provision consisted of a $201.3 million provision for
losses related to the disposition of an unsecured small business
product; a $90.0 million charge to align risk management
practices, align charge-off policies and expedite the transition
out of a specific segment of the health care industry not
meeting the lower risk appetite of the combined company; a
$76.6 million provision for losses related to the sales of
high loan-to-value home equity loans and the indirect automobile
loan portfolio of USBM; and a $14.3 million charge related
to the restructuring of a co-branding credit card relationship.
Refer to Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for further information on merger and
restructuring-related items.

Refer to “Corporate Risk Profile” for
further information on the provision for credit losses, net
charge-offs, nonperforming assets and other factors considered
by the Company in assessing the credit quality of the loan
portfolio and establishing the allowance for credit losses.

Noninterest Income

Noninterest income in 2003 was
$5.3 billion, compared with $5.2 billion in 2002 and
$4.7 billion in 2001. The increase in noninterest income of
$102.3 million (2.0 percent) in 2003, compared with
2002, was driven by strong growth in payment services revenue,
trust and investment management fees, deposit service charges,
treasury management fees, mortgage banking revenue and
investment products fees and commissions attributable to both
organic growth and acquisitions. Partially offsetting the
increase in noninterest income in 2003 was a year-over-year
decrease in net securities gains of $55.1 million.
Noninterest income in 2002 also included $67.4 million of
gains recognized in connection with the sale of
two co-branded credit card portfolios. The favorable impact
on noninterest income from acquisitions, which included Leader,
Bay View and State Street Corporate Trust, was approximately
$122.7 million during 2003.

Credit and debit card revenue, corporate payment
products revenue and ATM processing services revenue were higher
in 2003, compared with 2002, by $43.7 million
(8.5 percent), $35.6 million (10.9 percent) and
$5.3 million (3.3 percent), respectively. Although
credit and debit card revenue increased year-over-year, revenue
growth was somewhat muted due to the impact of the settlement of
the antitrust litigation brought against VISA USA and Mastercard
by Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., Sears Roebuck & Co. and other
retailers. This settlement lowered interchange rates that can be
received by members of the associations on signature debit
transactions beginning in August 2003. In 2003, the impact of
the VISA settlement was to lower debit card revenue by
$19.4 million relative to 2002. In 2004, the incremental
impact will be to lower debit card revenue by approximately
$15.0 million. This change in the interchange rate in the
third quarter of 2003, in addition to higher customer loyalty
rewards expenses, however, were more than offset by increases in
transaction volumes and other pricing enhancements. Corporate
payment products revenue and ATM processing services revenue
were higher in 2003, primarily reflecting growth in sales and
card usage during the year. Merchant processing services revenue
was lower in 2003 by $5.9 million (1.0 percent),
compared with 2002, primarily due to lower processing spreads
resulting from pricing changes that occurred in late 2002 and
changes in the mix of merchants. Merchant acquiring sales
volumes increased by 7.1 percent relative to the fourth
quarter of 2002. The Company’s mix of merchants toward
smaller retailers and specialty shops often results in a lag in
the growth of sales volumes relative to improvements experienced
at larger retailers in late 2003. Assuming economic conditions
continue to improve, management anticipates stronger merchant
processing revenue growth in 2004. The favorable variance in
trust and investment management fees in 2003 of
$61.8 million (6.9 percent), compared with 2002, was
driven by the acquisition of State Street Corporate Trust, which
contributed $83.7 million in fees during 2003. Treasury
management fees grew by $49.4 million (11.8 percent)
in 2003, compared with 2002, with the majority of the increase
occurring within the Wholesale Banking line of business. The
increase in treasury management fees during 2003 was driven by
growth in product sales, pricing enhancements and the relatively
low earnings credit rates to customers. The growth was also
driven by a change in the Federal government’s payment
methodology for treasury management services from compensating
balances, reflected in net interest income, to fees during the
third quarter of 2003. During 2003, commercial products revenue
declined $78.7 million (16.4 percent), principally
reflecting lower commercial loan conduit servicing fees
resulting, in part, from consolidating the Stellar commercial
loan conduit. Mortgage banking revenue had a year-over-year
increase of $36.9 million (11.2 percent) during 2003,
principally due to higher

mortgage originations, servicing and secondary
market sales and the acquisition of Leader, which contributed
$16.5 million of the favorable variance in 2003. Investment
products fees and commissions revenue increased in 2003 by
$12.2 million (9.2 percent), compared with 2002,
primarily due to increased retail brokerage activity given more
favorable equity capital market conditions relative to 2002.
Deposit service charges increased in 2003 by $25.5 million
(3.7 percent), compared with 2002, primarily due to net new
growth in checking accounts and fee enhancements principally
within the Consumer Banking line of business. Other noninterest
income decreased by $28.4 million (7.1 percent) from
2002, which included $67.4 million of gains on the sales of
two co-branded credit card portfolios.

In 2002, noninterest income increased
$541.3 million (11.6 percent), compared with 2001.
Increases resulting from acquisitions, including NOVA, Pacific
Century, Leader and Bay View, accounted for approximately
$301.3 million of the increase in noninterest income in
2002. Partially offsetting this favorable variance in 2002 was
$62.2 million of merger and restructuring-related gains in
connection with the sale of 14 branches representing
$771 million in deposits recognized in 2001. Refer to Note
5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further
information on merger and restructuring-related items. Credit
and debit card revenue, corporate payment products revenue and
ATM processing services revenue were higher in 2002, compared
with 2001, by $51.1 million (11.0 percent),
$28.0 million (9.4 percent) and $7.6 million
(5.0 percent), respectively, primarily reflecting growth in
sales and card usage. Merchant processing services revenue grew
by $258.4 million (83.7 percent), primarily due to the
acquisition of NOVA in July 2001. Deposit service charges
increased in 2002 by $45.4 million (7.0 percent),
primarily due to fee enhancements and new account growth. Cash
management fees and commercial products revenue grew by
$69.6 million (20.0 percent) and $41.8 million
(9.6 percent), respectively, primarily driven by changes in
the earnings credit rates for business deposits, growth in
commercial business activities, fees related to loan conduit
activities and product enhancements. Commercial product revenue
growth was offset somewhat by lease residual impairments in
2002. In addition to the impact of the acquisition of Leader,
the $96.2 million (41.1 percent) increase in mortgage
banking revenue was also due to higher levels of mortgage
originations and sales and loan servicing revenue in 2002,
compared with 2001. Investment products fees and commissions
revenues slightly increased in 2002, by $1.9 million
(1.5 percent), compared with 2001. Included in noninterest
income were net securities gains (losses) of
$299.9 million in 2002, compared with $329.1 million
in 2001, representing a decline of $29.2 million
(8.9 percent). Other fee income was higher in 2002,
compared with 2001, by $28.4 million (7.7 percent).
The change was primarily due to $67.4 million in gains from
credit card portfolio sales in 2002 and a reduction in retail
leasing residual and other asset impairments from 2001, offset
somewhat by lower official check revenue which is sensitive to
changes in interest rates.

Noninterest Expense

Noninterest expense in 2003 was
$5.6 billion, compared with $5.7 billion and
$6.1 billion in 2002 and 2001, respectively. The
Company’s efficiency ratio improved to 45.6 percent in
2003, compared with 48.8 percent in 2002 and
57.2 percent in 2001. The improved operating leverage
resulting from the decrease in noninterest expense in 2003 of
$143.6 million (2.5 percent) was primarily the result
of business initiatives, cost savings from integration
activities and lower merger and restructuring-related charges,
partially offset by an increase in MSR impairments, incremental
pension and retirement

expense of $39.9 million and expenses
related to recent acquisitions. Noninterest expense related to
merger and restructuring-related charges declined by
$275.0 million (85.6 percent) in 2003, compared with
2002. The decline in merger and restructuring-related charges
was primarily due to the completion of integration activities
associated with the merger of Firstar and USBM. During 2003,
noninterest expense included an MSR impairment of
$208.7 million, a net increase of $22.6 million,
compared with 2002. The year-over-year changes in the valuation
of MSRs were caused by fluctuations in mortgage interest rates
and related prepayment speeds due to refinancing activities.
Refer to Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for the sensitivity of the fair value of mortgage
servicing rights to future changes in interest rates. Recent
acquisitions, including Leader, Bay View and State Street
Corporate Trust, accounted for a year-over-year increase of
$124.9 million in noninterest expense.

The decline in noninterest expense of
$408.5 million (6.6 percent) in 2002, compared with
2001, was primarily the result of a reduction in merger and
restructuring-related costs of $723.6 million, the
elimination of $236.7 million of goodwill amortization in
connection with new accounting principles adopted in 2002 and a
reduction in asset write-downs of $52.6 million related to
commercial leasing partnerships and tractor/ trailer property
repossessed in 2001. Offsetting these favorable trends were
higher costs associated with acquisitions, an increase in MSR
impairments and post-integration realignment costs.
Acquisitions, including NOVA, Pacific Century, Leader and Bay
View, accounted for an increase of approximately
$317.4 million in noninterest expense during 2002,
comprised primarily of increased intangible amortization and
personnel expenses. Included in noninterest expense in 2002 was
$186.1 million in MSR impairments, compared with
$60.8 million in 2001, an increase of $125.3 million. The
increase in MSR impairments was related to increasing mortgage
prepayments driven by declining interest rates. Another
significant item impacting noninterest expense in 2002 was
$46.4 million of personnel and related costs for
post-integration rationalization of technology, operations and
certain support functions.

Pension Plans

Because of the long-term nature of
pension plans, the administration and accounting for pensions is
complex and can be impacted by several factors, including
investment and funding policies, accounting methods and the
plan’s actuarial assumptions. The Company and its
Compensation Committee have an established process for
evaluating the plans, their performance and significant plan
assumptions, including the assumed discount rate and the
long-term rate of return (“LTROR”). At least annually,
an independent consultant is engaged to assist U.S.
Bancorp’s Compensation Committee in evaluating plan
objectives, funding policies and investment policies considering
its long-term investment time horizon and asset allocation
strategies. Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements provides further information on funding practices,
investment policies and asset allocation strategies.

Periodic pension expense (or credits) includes
service costs, interest costs based on the assumed discount
rate, the expected return on plan assets based on an actuarially
derived market-related value and amortization of actuarial gains
and losses. The Company’s pension accounting policy follows
guidance outlined in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 87, “Employer’s Accounting for Pension
Plans” (“SFAS 87”), and reflects the
long-term nature of benefit obligations and the investment
horizon of plan assets. This accounting guidance has the effect
of reducing earnings volatility related to short-term changes in
interest rates and market valuations. Actuarial gains and losses
include the impact of plan amendments and various unrecognized
gains and losses which are deferred and amortized over the
future service periods of active employees. The market-related
value utilized to determine the expected return on plan assets
is based on fair value adjusted for the difference between
expected returns and actual performance of plan assets. The
unrealized difference between actual experience and expected
returns is included in the market-related value ratably over a
five-year period. At September 30, 2003, the accumulated
unrecognized loss approximated $369 million and will
ratably impact the actuarially derived market-related value of
plan assets through 2008. The impact to pension expense of the
unrecognized asset gains or losses will incrementally increase
(decrease) pension costs in each year from 2004 to 2008, by
approximately $26.5 million, $33.0 million,
$43.3 million, $10.3 million and $(7.2) million,
respectively, during that timeframe. This assumes that the
performance of plan assets equals the assumed LTROR. Actual
results will vary depending on the performance of plan assets
and changes to assumptions required in the future. Refer to
Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
for further discussion of the Company’s accounting policies
for pension plans.

In 2003, the Company recognized a pension credit
of $23.9 million compared with pension credits of
$63.8 million in 2002 and $75.3 million in 2001. The
$39.9 million increase in pension costs in 2003 was driven
by a $46.4 million reduction in the expected return on
assets and a lower discount rate utilized to determine the
projected benefit obligation given the declining rate
environment. Also, contributing to the increase in pension costs
was a one-time curtailment gain in 2002 of $9.0 million
related to a nonqualified pension plan compared with a
settlement loss of $3.5 million related to

26 U.S. Bancorp


nonqualified pension payments in 2003. Somewhat
offsetting the increase in pension costs was an expected benefit
of approximately $19.0 million associated with lower
interest costs related to cash balance accounts and actual
changes in employee demographics, such as retirement age. In
2002, pension costs increased by approximately
$11.5 million due to a $32.5 million reduction of
expected return on plan assets, utilizing a lower discount rate
to determine the projected benefit obligation given the
declining rate environment and the impact of changes in employee
demographics. Partially offsetting this increase was a one-time
curtailment gain of $9.0 million related to freezing
certain benefits of a nonqualified pension plan and a reduction
in service costs of $11.9 million related to changes in the
pension plans at the time of the plan mergers.

In 2004, the Company anticipates that pension
costs will increase by approximately $14.1 million. The
increase will be driven by a reduction in the discount rate and
amortization of the unrecognized losses offset by the expected
benefit of investment returns from the pension contributions
made in 2003.

Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements provides a summary of the significant
pension plan assumptions. Because of the subjective nature of
plan assumptions, a sensitivity analysis to hypothetical changes
in the LTROR and the discount rate is provided below:

Due to the complexity of forecasting pension plan
activities, the accounting method utilized for pension plans,
management’s ability to respond to factors impacting the
plans and the hypothetical nature of this information, the
actual changes in periodic pension costs could be significantly
different than the information provided in the sensitivity
analysis.

Merger and Restructuring-Related Items

The Company incurred merger and
restructuring-related items in each of the last three years in
conjunction with its acquisitions. Merger and
restructuring-related items included in pre-tax earnings were
$46.2 million ($30.4 million after-tax) in 2003,
compared with $321.2 million ($209.3 million
after-tax) and $1,364.8 million ($904.5 million
after-tax) for 2002 and 2001, respectively.

In 2003, the Company incurred pre-tax merger and
restructuring-related charges of approximately
$33.5 million in connection with the integration of
merchant processing platforms and business processes of U.S.
Bank National Association and NOVA. In addition, the Company
incurred pre-tax merger and restructuring-related expenses in
2003 of $12.7 million primarily for systems conversion
costs associated with the Bay View and State Street Corporate
Trust transactions. The integration of these acquisitions was
completed at the end of 2003, and the Company does not
anticipate any merger or restructuring-related expenses
in 2004 relating to completed acquisitions.

At December 31, 2002, the integration of
Firstar and USBM was completed. Total merger and
restructuring-related items associated with the Firstar/ USBM
merger were approximately $1.6 billion. Merger and
restructuring-related items in 2002 included $269.0 million
of net expense associated with the Firstar/ USBM merger and
$52.2 million associated with NOVA and other smaller
acquisitions. Merger and restructuring-related items in 2002
associated with the Firstar/ USBM merger were primarily related
to systems conversions and integration, asset write-downs and
lease terminations recognized at the completion of conversions.
Offsetting a portion of these costs in 2002 was an asset gain
related to the sale of a non-strategic investment in a sub-prime
lending business and a mark-to-market recovery associated with
the liquidation of U.S. Bancorp Libra’s investment
portfolio. The Company exited this business in 2001 and the
liquidation efforts were substantially completed in the second
quarter of 2002.

Merger and restructuring-related items in 2001
included $382.2 million in provision for credit losses, a
$62.2 million gain on the required sale of branches and
$1,044.8 million of noninterest expense. Total merger and
restructuring-related items in 2001 consisted of
$1,327.1 million related to the Firstar/ USBM merger and
$37.7 million related to NOVA and other smaller
acquisitions. With respect to the Firstar/ USBM merger, the
$1,327.1 million of merger and restructuring-related items
included $238.6 million for severance and employee-related

U.S. Bancorp  27


costs and $477.6 million of charges to exit
business lines and products, sell credit portfolios or otherwise
realign business practices in the new Company. The Company also
incurred $190.5 million related to the accelerated vesting
of certain stock options and restricted stock,
$207.1 million of systems conversion and business
integration costs, $48.7 million for lease cancellation and
other building-related costs, $226.8 million for
transaction costs, funding a charitable foundation to reaffirm a
commitment to its markets and other costs, and a
$62.2 million gain related to the required sale of branches.

Refer to Notes 3 and 5 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on
these acquired businesses and merger and restructuring-related
items.

Income Tax Expense

The provision for income taxes was
$1,941.3 million (an effective rate of 34.4 percent)
in 2003, compared with $1,707.5 million (an effective rate
of 34.6 percent) in 2002 and $818.3 million (an
effective rate of 34.9 percent) in 2001. The improvement in
the effective tax rate in 2003, compared with 2002, primarily
reflected a change in unitary state tax apportionment factors
driven by a shift in business mix as a result of the impact of
acquisitions, market demographics, the mix of product revenue
and an increase in federal and state tax credits. The
improvement in the effective tax rate in 2002, compared with
2001, was primarily driven by a change in unitary state tax
apportionment factors, a decrease in non-deductible merger and
restructuring-related charges and the change in accounting for
goodwill.

The Company’s net deferred tax liability was
$1,556.4 million at December 31, 2003, compared with
$1,329.4 million for the year ended 2002. The change in
2003 primarily relates to leasing activities and a decrease in
the net unrealized appreciation on available-for-sale securities
and financial instruments. For further information on income
taxes, refer to Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS

Average earning assets were $160.8 billion
in 2003, compared with $147.4 billion in 2002. The increase
in average earning assets of $13.4 billion
(9.1 percent) was primarily driven by growth in investment
securities,

residential mortgages, loans held for sale and
retail loans, partially offset by a decline in commercial loans.
The increase in average earning assets was funded with an
increase in average interest-bearing liabilities of
$10.3 billion, consisting principally of higher savings
products balances and more favorably priced longer-term
wholesale funding, and an increase in net free funds, including
an increase in average noninterest-bearing deposits of
$3.0 billion.

For average balance information, refer to
Consolidated Daily Average Balance Sheet and Related Yields and
Rates on pages 110 and 111.

Loans

The
Company’s total loan portfolio was $118.2 billion at
December 31, 2003, an increase of $2.0 billion
(1.7 percent) from December 31, 2002. The increase in
total loans was driven by growth in residential mortgages and
retail loans, partially offset by a decline in commercial loans
due to soft commercial loan demand. The increase in residential
mortgages reflects the Company’s decision to retain
adjustable-rate mortgage production in connection with
asset/liability management activities and strong growth in first
lien home equity loans within the branch network and consumer
finance. Table 6 provides a summary of the loan
distribution by product type. Average total loans increased
$3.9 billion (3.4 percent) in 2003, compared with
2002. The increase in total average loans in 2003, compared with
2002, was driven by similar factors discussed above including
the growth of residential mortgages, retail loans and commercial
real estate loans, partially offset by the decline in commercial
loans.

Commercial

Commercial loans, including lease
financing, totaled $38.5 billion at December 31, 2003,
compared with $41.9 billion at December 31, 2002, a
decrease of $3.4 billion (8.1 percent). Although the
consolidation of loans from the Stellar commercial loan conduit
in mid-2003 had a positive impact on commercial loan balances
year-over-year, current credit markets and soft economic
conditions during early 2003 led to the decline in total
commercial loans. Although economic growth occurred in the
second half of 2003, commercial loan demand

Table 7

Commercial Loans by Industry Group and Geography

U.S. Bancorp  29


continued to be soft through year-end given the
liquidity of commercial customers. Average commercial loans in
2003 decreased by $2.5 billion (5.7 percent). The
decline in average commercial loans for 2003 was primarily due
to the run-off of corporate loans and continued softness in loan
demand, partially offset by the consolidation of loans from the
Stellar commercial loan conduit in mid-2003. Despite recent
economic growth, the Company anticipates soft commercial loan
demand will continue in early 2004 while business customers
utilize liquidity to fund business activities.

Table 7 provides a summary of commercial
loans by industry and geographical locations.

Commercial Real Estate

The Company’s portfolio of
commercial real estate loans, which includes commercial
mortgages and construction loans, was $27.2 billion at
December 31, 2003, compared with $26.9 billion at
December 31, 2002, a slight increase of $375 million
(1.4 percent). Specifically, commercial mortgages
outstanding and real estate construction and development loans
increased modestly by $299 million (1.5 percent) and
$76 million (1.2 percent), respectively, as business
owners and real estate investors continued to take advantage of
the current interest rate environment. Average commercial real
estate loans increased by $1.4 billion (5.5 percent)
in 2003, compared with 2002, primarily driven by increased
commercial mortgage activity. Table 9 provides a summary of
commercial real estate by property type and geographical
locations.

The Company maintains the real estate
construction designation until the completion of the
construction phase and, if retained, the loan is reclassified to
the commercial mortgage category. Approximately
$1.4 billion of construction loans were permanently
financed and transferred to the commercial mortgage loan
category in 2003. At year-end 2003, $205 million of
tax-exempt industrial development loans were secured by real
estate. The Company’s commercial real estate mortgages and
construction loans had unfunded commitments of $7.3 billion
at December 31, 2003, compared with $7.9 billion at
December 31, 2002. The Company also finances the operations
of real estate developers and other entities with operations
related to real estate. These loans are not secured directly by
real estate and are subject to terms and conditions similar to
commercial loans. These loans were included in the commercial
loan category and totaled $364 million at December 31,
2003.

Residential Mortgages

Residential mortgages held in the loan
portfolio were $13.5 billion at December 31, 2003, an
increase of $3.7 billion (38.1 percent) from
December 31, 2002. The increase in residential mortgages
was primarily the result of an increase in consumer finance
originations and branch originated home equity loans with first
liens driven by refinancing activities in 2003. The increase in
residential mortgages also reflects the Company’s
asset/liability management decisions to retain adjustable-rate
mortgage loan production. This growth was partially offset by
approximately $1.0 billion in residential loan sales during
2003 primarily representing fixed-rate mortgage loans. Average
residential mortgages increased $3.3 billion
(39.0 percent) to $11.7 billion in 2003, primarily due
to the increases in first lien home equity loans and
adjustable-rate mortgages.

Retail

Total retail
loans outstanding, which include credit card, retail leasing,
home equity and second mortgages and other retail loans, were
$39.0 billion at December 31, 2003, compared with
$37.7 billion at December 31, 2002. The increase of
$1.3 billion (3.5 percent) was driven by an increase
in automobile loans, retail leasing, credit card lending and
student loans, which increased $822 million,
$349 million, $268 million and $227 million,
respectively, during 2003. This growth was partially offset by
declines in home equity and second mortgage loans as consumers
refinanced with first lien home equity products classified as
residential mortgages. Average retail loans increased
$1.7 billion (4.6 percent) to $38.2 billion in
2003, reflecting growth in retail leasing, installment loans and
home equity lines. Growth in these retail products was offset
somewhat by a 1.9 percent decline in average credit card
balances primarily due to portfolio sales in late 2002 and lower

second mortgage home equity loans. Of the total
retail loans and residential mortgages outstanding,
approximately 88.5 percent are to customers located in the
Company’s primary banking regions.

Loans Held for Sale

At December 31, 2003, loans held
for sale, consisting of residential mortgages to be sold in the
secondary markets, were $1.4 billion. The $2.7 billion
(65.5 percent) decrease from December 31, 2002,
despite strong mortgage banking activities in early 2003, was
the result of a 56.3 percent decline in mortgage production
volumes during the fourth quarter of 2003 relative to the same
period of 2002.

Investment Securities

The Company uses its investment
securities portfolio for several purposes. It serves as a
vehicle to manage interest rate and prepayment risk, generates
interest and dividend income from the investment of excess funds
depending on loan demand, provides liquidity and is used as
collateral for public deposits and wholesale funding sources.

At December 31, 2003, investment securities,
both available-for-sale and held-to-maturity, totaled
$43.3 billion, compared with $28.5 billion at December
31, 2002. The $14.8 billion (52.1 percent)
year-over-year increase reflected the reinvestment of proceeds
from loan sales and declining commercial loan balances due to
the continued softness in commercial loan demand and the
investment of cash inflows related to deposit growth. During
2003, the Company sold $15.3 billion of fixed-rate
securities as part of an economic hedge of the MSR portfolio. In
the first and second quarters of 2003, securities gains were
taken to offset impairment recognized in the MSR portfolio. When
MSR reparation occurred in the third quarter of 2003, the
Company began repositioning the investment securities portfolio
by selling fixed-rate securities with lower yields at a loss,
with the proceeds being reinvested at higher yields. At
December 31, 2003, approximately 19.5 percent of the
investment securities portfolio represented adjustable-rate
financial instruments, compared with 18.6 percent as of
December 31, 2002.

The weighted-average yield of the
available-for-sale portfolio was 4.27 percent at
December 31, 2003, compared with 4.97 percent at
December 31, 2002. The average maturity of the
available-for-sale portfolio rose to

5.1 years at December 31, 2003, up from
2.8 years at December 31, 2002. The relative mix of
the type of investment securities maintained in the portfolio is
provided in Table 10. At December 31, 2003, the
available-for-sale portfolio included a $259 million net
unrealized loss, compared with a net unrealized gain of
$714 million at December 31, 2002. The change from
2002 reflected rising interest rates in the later half of 2003
and the longer duration of the portfolio relative to a year ago.

Deposits

Total
deposits were $119.1 billion at December 31, 2003, an
increase of $3.5 billion (3.0 percent) from
December 31, 2002. The increase in total

deposits was primarily the result of increases in
all savings deposit products, partially offset by declines in
noninterest-bearing deposits, time certificates of deposit less
than $100,000 and time deposits greater than $100,000.

Noninterest-bearing deposits were
$32.5 billion at December 31, 2003, compared with
$35.1 billion at December 31, 2002, a decrease of
$2.6 billion (7.5 percent). The decrease in
noninterest-bearing deposits was primarily attributable to a
decline in deposits related to mortgage banking businesses and
lower government banking deposits relative to a year ago.
Mortgage banking declined substantially in the third quarter
directly related to the upward movement in interest rates
experienced since late June, 2003. Government banking deposits
declined primarily due to a decision by the federal government
to pay fees for cash management services rather than maintain
compensating balances. Average noninterest-bearing deposits were
$31.7 billion in 2003, an increase of $3.0 billion
(10.4 percent), compared with 2002. The increase in average
noninterest-bearing deposits was primarily the result of higher
demand deposits of mortgage and government banking customers
during the first half of 2003, customer decisions to maintain
excess liquidity in demand deposit balances, and acquisitions.

Interest-bearing savings deposits totaled
$61.1 billion at December 31, 2003, an increase of
$10.8 billion (21.5 percent) from December 31,
2002. Average interest-bearing savings deposits were
$57.0 billion in 2003, an increase of $11.2 billion
(24.5 percent), compared with 2002. The increase in
interest-bearing savings deposits from December 31, 2002,
to December 31, 2003, was primarily driven by increases in
money market accounts of $6.3 billion (22.6 percent),
along with increases in interest checking of $3.9 billion
(22.5 percent) and savings accounts of $.6 billion
(12.1 percent). The favorable change in money market
accounts was the result of product pricing initiatives on
high-impact money market products, the continued desire by
customers to maintain liquidity, specific deposit gathering
initiatives and the State Street Corporate Trust acquisition,
which contributed approximately $.6 billion of the increase
during 2003.

Interest-bearing time deposits were
$25.5 billion at December 31, 2003, compared with
$30.2 billion at December 31, 2002, a decrease of
$4.7 billion (15.5 percent). The decrease in
interest-bearing time deposits was driven by a decrease in the
higher cost time certificates of deposits less than $100,000 of
$4.3 billion (23.8 percent) and a decrease of
$381 million (3.1 percent) in time deposits greater
than $100,000. Average time deposits greater than $100,000
increased $1.0 billion (8.7 percent) and average time
certificates of deposit less than $100,000 declined
$3.8 billion (19.7 percent) during 2003. Time
certificates of deposits are largely viewed as purchased funds
and are managed to levels deemed appropriate given alternative
funding sources. The decline in time certificates of deposits
less than $100,000 from a year

ago, and on average during 2003, reflected a
shift in product mix toward savings products and funding
decisions toward more favorably priced wholesale funding
sources. The increase in average time deposits greater than
$100,000 was primarily due to a shift in short-term funding mix
to cover balance sheet growth, net of deposit growth.

Borrowings

The
Company utilizes both short-term and long-term borrowings to
fund growth of earning assets in excess of deposit growth.
Short-term borrowings, which include federal funds purchased,
securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other
short-term borrowings, were $10.9 billion at
December 31, 2003, up $3.1 billion (39.0 percent)
from $7.8 billion at year-end 2002. Short-term funding is
managed to levels deemed appropriate given alternative funding
sources. The increase in short-term borrowings reflected the
impact of funding growth in earning assets, partially offset by
the growth in deposits.

Long-term debt was $31.2 billion at
December 31, 2003, up from $28.6 billion at
December 31, 2002. The $2.6 billion (9.2 percent)
increase in long-term debt was driven by the issuance of
$11.5 billion of medium- and long-term notes and bank notes
during 2003. The issuance of long-term debt was partially offset
by maturities of $8.6 billion during 2003. Refer to Note 14
of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information regarding long-term debt and the “Liquidity
Risk Management” section for discussion of liquidity
management of the Company.

CORPORATE RISK PROFILE

Overview

Managing
risks is an essential part of successfully operating a financial
services company. The most prominent risk exposures are credit,
residual, operational, interest rate, market and liquidity risk.
Credit risk is the risk of not collecting the interest and/or
the principal balance of a loan or investment when it is due.
Residual risk is the potential reduction in the end-of-term
value of leased assets or the residual cash flows related to
asset securitization and other off-balance sheet structures.
Operational risk includes risks related to fraud, legal and
compliance risk, processing errors, technology, breaches of
internal controls and business continuation and disaster
recovery risk. Interest rate risk is the potential reduction of
net interest income as a result of changes in interest rates.
Rate movements can affect the repricing of assets and
liabilities differently, as well as their market value. Market
risk arises from fluctuations in interest rates, foreign
exchange rates, and equity prices that may result in changes in
the values of financial instruments, such as trading and
available-for-sale securities that are accounted for on a
mark-to-market basis. Liquidity risk is the possible inability
to fund obligations to depositors, investors or borrowers. In
addition, corporate strategic decisions, as well as the risks
described above, could give rise to reputation risk. Reputation
risk is the risk that negative publicity or press, whether true
or not, could result in costly litigation or cause a decline in
the Company’s stock value, customer base or revenue.

Credit Risk Management

The Company’s strategy for credit
risk management includes well-defined, centralized credit
policies, uniform underwriting criteria, and ongoing risk
monitoring and review processes for all commercial and consumer
credit exposures. The strategy also emphasizes diversification
on a geographic, industry and customer level, regular credit
examinations and management reviews of loans experiencing
deterioration of credit quality. The Company strives to identify
potential problem loans early, take any necessary charge-offs
promptly and maintain adequate reserve levels for probable loan
losses inherent in the portfolio. Commercial banking operations
rely on a strong credit culture that combines prudent credit
policies and individual lender accountability. Lenders are
assigned lending grades based on their level of experience and
customer service requirements. Lending grades represent the
level of approval authority for the amount of credit exposure
and level of risk. Credit officers reporting independently to
Credit Administration have higher levels of lending grades and
support the business units in their credit decision process.
Loan decisions are documented as to the borrower’s
business, purpose of the loan, evaluation of the repayment
source and the associated risks, evaluation of collateral,
covenants and monitoring requirements, and risk rating
rationale. The Company utilizes a credit risk rating system to
measure the credit quality of individual commercial loan
transactions. The Company uses the risk rating system for
regulatory reporting, determining the frequency of review of the
credit exposures, and evaluation and determination of the
adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. The Company
regularly forecasts potential changes in risk ratings,
nonperforming status and potential for loss and the estimated
impact on the allowance for credit losses. In the Company’s
retail banking operations, standard credit scoring systems are
used to assess consumer credit risks and to price consumer
products accordingly. The Company conducts the underwriting and
collections of its retail products in loan underwriting and
servicing centers specializing in certain retail products.
Forecasts of delinquency levels, bankruptcies and losses in
conjunction with projection of estimated losses by delinquency
categories and vintage information are regularly prepared and
are used to evaluate underwriting and collection and determine
the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses for these
products. The Company also engages in non-lending activities
that may give rise to credit risk, including interest rate swap
contracts for balance sheet hedging

34 U.S. Bancorp


purposes, foreign exchange transactions and
interest rate swap contracts for customers, settlement risk,
including Automated Clearing House transactions, and the
processing of credit card transactions for merchants. These
activities are also subject to credit review, analysis and
approval processes.

Economic Overview

In evaluating its credit risk, the
Company considers changes, if any, in underwriting activities,
the loan portfolio composition (including product mix and
geographic, industry or customer-specific concentrations),
trends in loan performance, the level of allowance coverage and
macroeconomic factors. Since late 2000, the domestic economy
experienced slower growth. During 2001, corporate earnings
weakened and credit quality indicators among certain industry
sectors deteriorated. The stagnant economic growth was evidenced
by the Federal Reserve Board’s (“FRB”) actions to
stimulate economic growth through a series of interest rate
reductions from mid-2001 through late 2002. In addition, events
of September 11, 2001, had a profound impact on credit
quality due to changes in consumer confidence and related
spending, governmental priorities and business activities. In
response to declining economic conditions, company-specific
portfolio trends, and the Firstar/ USBM merger, the Company
initiated several actions during 2001 including aligning the
risk management practices and charge-off policies of the
companies and restructuring and disposing of certain portfolios
that did not align with the credit risk profile of the combined
company. The Company also implemented accelerated loan workout
strategies for certain commercial credits and increased the
provision for credit losses above anticipated levels by
approximately $1,025 million in the third quarter of 2001.

By the end of 2002, economic conditions had
stabilized somewhat, although the banking sector continued to
experience elevated levels of nonperforming assets and net
charge-offs, especially with respect to certain industry
segments. Unemployment rates had increased slightly and consumer
spending and confidence levels had declined during that year.
Economic conditions began to improve in early to mid-2003 as
evidenced by stronger earnings across many corporate sectors,
higher equity valuations, stronger retail sales and consumer
spending, and improving economic indicators. While the economy
has begun to strengthen relative to a year ago, the banking
industry continues to have elevated levels of nonperforming
assets and net charge-offs compared with the late 1990’s.
Conditions within certain industries, including manufacturing
and airline transportation sectors, continue to lag behind the
growth in the broader economy. In addition, certain segments
within the agricultural industry have experienced deterioration
since late 2002.

Credit Diversification

The Company manages its credit
risk, in part, through diversification of its loan portfolio. As
part of its normal business activities, it offers a broad array
of traditional commercial lending products and specialized
products such as asset-based lending, commercial lease
financing, agricultural credit, warehouse mortgage lending,
commercial real estate, health care and correspondent banking.
The Company also offers an array of retail lending products
including credit cards, retail leases, home equity, revolving
credit, lending to students and other consumer loans. These
retail credit products are primarily offered through the branch
office network, specialized trust, home mortgage and loan
production offices, indirect distribution channels, such as
automobile dealers and a consumer finance division. The Company
monitors and manages the portfolio diversification by industry,
customer and geography. Table 6 provides information with
respect to the overall product diversification and changes in
the mix during 2003.

The commercial portfolio reflects the
Company’s focus on serving small business customers, middle
market and larger corporate businesses throughout its 24-state
banking region and large national customers within certain niche
industry groups. Table 7 provides a summary of the
significant industry groups and geographic locations of
commercial loans outstanding at December 31, 2003 and 2002.
The commercial loan portfolio is diversified among various
industries with somewhat higher concentrations in consumer
products and services, capital goods (including manufacturing
and commercial construction-related businesses), financial
services, commercial services and supplies, and agricultural
industries. Additionally, the commercial portfolio is
diversified across the Company’s geographical markets with
87.4 percent of total commercial loans within the 24-state
banking region. Credit relationships outside of the
Company’s banking region are typically niche businesses
including the mortgage banking and the leasing businesses. Loans
to mortgage banking customers are primarily warehouse lines
which are collateralized with the underlying mortgages. The
Company regularly monitors its mortgage collateral position to
manage its risk exposure.

Certain industry segments within the commercial
loan portfolio, including telecommunications, transportation and
manufacturing experienced economic stress since 2001.
Additionally, highly leveraged enterprise-value financings have
under-performed. Over the past several years, the
telecommunications sector has been adversely impacted by excess
capacity. As a result of credit workout initiatives, the
Company’s outstandings to this industry declined in 2003 to
only .7 percent of the commercial loan portfolio at
December 31, 2003. At December 31, 2003, the
transportation sector represented 4.6 percent of the total

U.S. Bancorp  35


commercial loan portfolio. Since 2001, the sector
has been impacted by reduced airline travel, slower economic
activity and changes in fuel prices. In general, the credit risk
profile of the trucking, railroad and shipping segments have
improved from a year ago; however, the airline segment continues
to be sluggish. At year-end 2003, the Company’s
transportation portfolio consisted of airline and airfreight
businesses (30.0 percent of the sector), trucking
businesses (48.4 percent of the sector) and the remainder
in the railroad and shipping businesses (21.6 percent of
the sector). Capital goods represented 11.9 percent of the
total commercial portfolio at December 31, 2003. Included
in this sector were approximately 34.0 percent of loans
related to building products while engineering and construction
equipment and machinery businesses were 32.5 percent and
21.3 percent, respectively. During 2003, economic
conditions improved and production levels increased resulting in
an improvement in the credit quality of the capital goods
sectors from a year ago. With respect to certain construction
and building-related businesses, the recent changes in the
interest rate environment may somewhat hamper their future
profitability. During 2003, segments of the agricultural
industry experienced deterioration in credit quality due to
depressed livestock prices and excess production within the food
processing businesses. At December 31, 2003, approximately
7.6 percent of the commercial loan portfolio was
concentrated in the agricultural sector. Within the agricultural
sector, 37.9 percent of loans were to livestock producers,
30.9 percent to crop producers, 20.4 percent to food
processors and 10.8 percent to wholesalers of agricultural
products. Wholesalers have been less affected by commodity
prices.

Within its commercial lending business, the
Company also provides financing to enable customers to grow
their businesses through acquisitions of existing businesses,
buyouts or other recapitalizations. During a business cycle with
slower economic growth, businesses with leveraged capital
structures may experience insufficient cash flows to service
their debt. The Company manages leveraged enterprise-value
financings by maintaining well-defined underwriting standards,
portfolio diversification and actively managing the customer
relationship. Regardless of these actions, leveraged
enterprise-value financings often exhibit stress during a
recession or period of slow economic growth. Given this risk
profile, the Company continued to significantly de-emphasize and
reduce the size of this portfolio during the past year. The
Company actively monitors the credit quality of these customers
and develops action plans accordingly. Such leveraged
enterprise-value financings approximated $1.8 billion in loans
outstanding at December 31, 2003, compared with
approximately $2.9 billion outstanding at December 31,
2002. The decline was primarily due to the Company’s
decision to reduce its exposure to these types of lending
arrangements through repayments, refinancing activities and loan
sales. The sector has also been reduced by charge-offs taken
during the year. The Company’s portfolio of leveraged
financings is included in Table 7 and is diversified among
industry groups similar to the total commercial loan portfolio,
except for higher concentrations in telecommunications and cable.

The commercial real estate portfolio reflects the
Company’s focus on serving business owners within its
footprint as well as regional investment-based real estate.
Table 9 provides a summary of the significant property
types and geographic locations of commercial real estate loans
outstanding at December 31, 2003 and 2002. At
December 31, 2003, approximately 29.5 percent of the
commercial real estate loan portfolio represented business
owner-occupied properties that tend to exhibit credit risk
characteristics similar to the middle market commercial loan
portfolio. Generally, the investment-based real estate mortgages
are diversified among various property types with somewhat
higher concentrations in multi-family, office and retail
properties. Additionally, the commercial real estate portfolio
is diversified across the Company’s geographical markets
with 92.8 percent of total commercial real estate loans
outstanding at December 31, 2003, within the 24-state
banking region.

Analysis of Nonperforming Assets

Nonperforming assets represents a
key indicator, among other considerations, of the potential for
future credit losses. Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual
loans, restructured loans not performing in accordance with
modified terms and other real estate and other nonperforming
assets owned by the Company. Interest payments collected from
assets on nonaccrual status are typically applied against the
principal balance and not recorded as income. At
December 31, 2003, total nonperforming assets were
$1,148.1 million, compared with $1,373.5 million at
year-end 2002 and $1,120.0 million at year-end 2001. The
ratio of total nonperforming assets to total loans and other
real estate decreased to .97 percent at December 31,
2003, compared with 1.18 percent and .98 percent at
the end of 2002 and 2001, respectively.

The $225.4 million decrease in total
nonperforming assets in 2003 reflected a decrease of
$204.9 million in nonperforming commercial and commercial
real estate loans, a decrease of $11.5 million in
nonperforming residential mortgages and a $.9 million
decrease in nonperforming retail loans. The decrease in
nonperforming assets in 2003 was broad-based across most
industry sectors within the commercial loan portfolio including
capital goods, consumer-related sectors, manufacturing,
telecommunications, and certain segments of transportation.
While airline travel has increased from a year ago, the

36 U.S. Bancorp


industry continues to be economically stressed
and has had difficulty improving cash flows from operations.
Also, certain industries continue to experience financial
stress. Certain segments of livestock producers and food
processors within the agricultural sector continue to suffer
from lower prices. Certain health care facilities providers
continue to experience operational stress leading to some
deterioration in credit quality within that sector. Also, given
the recent slowdown in refinancing activities and housing
starts, the mortgage banking and real estate development sectors
may experience increased credit risk. While nonperforming assets
declined during 2003, the amount of nonperforming assets is
still at elevated levels relative to the 1990’s reflecting
the general impact of economic conditions during the past two
years. Given the Company’s ongoing efforts to reduce the
overall risk profile of the organization and the anticipation
that the economy will continue to improve, nonperforming assets
are expected to trend lower in 2004.

The $253.5 million increase in total
nonperforming assets in 2002 reflected an increase of
$284.6 million in nonperforming commercial and commercial
real estate loans, and a $17.5 million increase in other
nonperforming assets, partially offset by a decrease of
$27.1 million in nonperforming residential mortgages and a
$21.5 million decrease in nonperforming retail loans. The
increase in

nonperforming commercial and commercial real
estate assets was principally due to the Company’s exposure
to certain communications, cable, manufacturing and highly
leveraged enterprise-value financings. Nonperforming loans in
the capital goods sector also increased in 2002.

The Company had $58.5 million and
$50.0 million of restructured loans as of December 31,
2003 and 2002, respectively. Commitments to lend additional
funds under restructured loans were $8.2 million and
$1.7 million as of December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. Restructured loans performing under the
restructured terms beyond a specific timeframe are reported as
accruing. Of the Company’s total restructured loans at
December 31, 2003, $18.0 million were reported as
accruing.

Accruing loans 90 days or more past due
totaled $329.4 million at December 31, 2003, compared
with $426.4 million at December 31, 2002, and
$462.9 million at December 31, 2001. These loans were
not included in nonperforming assets and continue to accrue
interest because they are adequately secured by collateral,
and/or are in the process of collection and are reasonably
expected to result in repayment or restoration to current
status. The ratio of delinquent loans to total loans declined to
..28 percent at December 31, 2003, compared with .37
percent at December 31, 2002. Improving economic conditions
and the Company’s continued focus on credit process are the
primary factors for the favorable change from a year ago.

To monitor credit risk associated with retail
loans, the Company monitors delinquency ratios in the various
stages of collection including nonperforming status. The
following table provides summary delinquency information for
residential mortgages and retail loans:

Delinquent Loan Ratios as a Percent of Ending Loan Balances

38 U.S. Bancorp


The decline in residential mortgage delinquencies
from December 31, 2002, to December 31, 2003,
reflected the general improvement in economic conditions,
collection efforts and the effect of portfolio growth on
delinquency ratios reported on a concurrent basis. The decline
in retail loan delinquencies from a year ago, reflected
improving economic conditions as well as ongoing collection
efforts and risk management actions taken by the Company over
the past three years.

Analysis of Loan Net Charge-Offs

Total loan net charge-offs
decreased $121.3 million to $1,251.7 million in 2003,
compared with $1,373.0 million in 2002 and
$1,546.5 million in 2001. The ratio of total loan net
charge-offs to average loans was 1.06 percent in 2003,
compared with 1.20 percent in 2002 and 1.31 percent in
2001. The improvement in net charge-offs in 2003 was due to
credit risk management initiatives taken by the Company during
the past two years that have improved the credit risk profile of
the loan portfolio. These initiatives along with better economic
conditions resulted in improving credit risk classifications and
lower levels of nonperforming assets. The level of loan net
charge-offs during 2002 reflected the impact of soft economic
conditions at that time and weakness in the communications,
transportation and manufacturing sectors, as well as the impact
of the economy on highly leveraged enterprise-value financings.
The decline during 2002 reflected net charge-offs taken in 2001
related to several credit initiatives taken by management in
that year. Due to the Company’s ongoing workout, collection
and risk management efforts and expected improvement in the
economy, net charge-offs are anticipated to trend lower in 2004.

Commercial and commercial real estate loan net
charge-offs for 2003 were $608.7 million (.89 percent
of average loans outstanding), compared with $679.9 million
(.98 percent of average loans outstanding) in 2002 and
$884.6 million (1.16 percent of average loans
outstanding) in 2001. While commercial and commercial real
estate loan net charge-offs for 2003 continue at elevated levels
compared with the late 1990’s, improvement from 2002 was
broad-based and extended across most industries within the
commercial portfolio. In addition, net charge-offs related to
the equipment-leasing portfolio declined to 1.65 percent of
average leases outstanding from 2.67 percent in 2002. In
2002, higher levels of net charge-offs related to the leasing
portfolio included airline and other transportation related
losses. The decrease in commercial and commercial real estate
loan net charge-offs in 2002, when compared with 2001, was
driven by credit actions taken in 2001. Commercial and
commercial real estate loan net charge-offs in 2001 included
approximately $312.2 million related to several factors
including: a large cattle fraud, collateral deterioration
specific to transportation equipment caused by the impact of
higher fuel prices and the weak economy, deterioration in the
manufacturing, communications and technology sectors and
specific management decisions to accelerate its workout strategy
for certain borrowers. Also included in 2001 commercial and
commercial real estate loan net charge-offs were
$95 million in merger and restructuring-related

    portion of the losses was reported separately as a reduction of
    the allowance for credit losses under “Losses from loan
    sales/transfers.” Had the entire amount of the loss been
    reported as charge-offs, total net charge-offs would have been
    $1,875.8 million (1.59 percent of average loans) for
    the year ended December 31, 2001.

charge-offs to align risk management practices
and net charge-offs of $160 million associated with an
accelerated loan workout strategy in the first quarter of 2001.

Retail loan net charge-offs in 2003 were
$616.1 million (1.61 percent of average loans
outstanding), compared with $674.0 million
(1.85 percent of average loans outstanding) in 2002 and
$649.3 million (1.94 percent of average loans
outstanding) in 2001. Lower levels of retail loan net
charge-offs in 2003, compared with 2002, were primarily due to
the implementation of uniform underwriting standards and
processes across the entire Company, improvement in ongoing
collection efforts and changes in other risk management
practices. The favorable change in credit card losses also
reflected the impact of two portfolio sales in late 2002. The
improvement in the retail loan net charge-offs in 2002, compared
with 2001, principally reflected changes in the mix of the
retail loan portfolio to auto loans and leases and home equity
products, and improvement in ongoing collection efforts as a
result of the successful completion of the integration efforts.

The Company’s retail lending business
utilizes several distinct business processes and channels to
originate retail credit including traditional branch credit,
indirect lending and a consumer finance division. Each distinct
underwriting and origination activity manages unique credit risk
characteristics and prices its loan production commensurate with
the differing risk profiles. Within Consumer Banking, U.S. Bank
Consumer Finance (“USBCF”), participates in all facets
of the Company’s consumer lending activities. The consumer
finance division specializes in serving channel-specific and
alternative lending markets in residential mortgages, home
equity and installment loan financing. The consumer finance
division manages loans originated through a broker network,
correspondent relationships and U.S. Bank branch offices.
Generally, loans managed by the Company’s consumer finance
division exhibit higher credit risk characteristics, but are
priced commensurate with the differing risk profile.

The following table provides an analysis of net
charge-offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding managed
by the consumer finance division, compared with traditional
branch-related loans:

Consumer finance category included credit
    originated and managed by USBCF, as well as home equity loans
    and second mortgages with a loan-to-value greater than
    100 percent that were originated in the branches.

Analysis and Determination of the Allowance
for Credit Losses

The allowance
for credit losses provides coverage for probable and estimable
losses inherent in the Company’s loan and lease portfolio.
Management evaluates the allowance each quarter to determine
that it is adequate to cover inherent losses. The evaluation of
each element and the overall allowance is based on a continuing
assessment of problem loans and related off-balance sheet items,
recent loss experience and other factors, including regulatory
guidance and economic conditions.

At December 31, 2003, the allowance for
credit losses was $2,368.6 million (2.00 percent of
loans). This compares with an allowance of $2,422.0 million
(2.08 percent of loans) at December 31, 2002, and
$2,457.3 million (2.15 percent of loans) at
December 31, 2001. The ratio of the allowance for credit
losses to nonperforming loans was 232 percent at year-end
2003, compared with 196 percent at year-end 2002 and
245 percent at year-end 2001. The ratio of the allowance
for credit losses to loan net charge-offs was 189 percent
at year-end 2003, compared with 176 percent at year-end
2002 and 159 percent at year-end 2001. Management
determined that the allowance for credit losses was adequate at
December 31, 2003.

Several factors were taken into consideration in
evaluating the 2003 allowance for credit losses, including
improvements in the risk profile of the portfolios and loan net
charge-offs during the period, the lower level of nonperforming
assets, the decline in accruing loans 90 days or more past
due and the improvement in all delinquency categories from
December 31, 2002. Management also

40 U.S. Bancorp


considered the uncertainty related to certain
industry sectors, including the airline transportation sector,
the extent of credit exposure to highly leveraged
enterprise-value arrangements within the portfolio and the fact
that nonperforming assets remain at elevated levels despite
recent improvements. Finally, the Company considered improving
but somewhat mixed economic trends including improving corporate
earnings, lagging unemployment rates, the level of bankruptcies
and general economic indicators.

Management determines the allowance that is
required for specific loan categories based on relative risk
characteristics of the loan portfolio. Table 15 shows the
amount of the allowance for credit losses by loan category. The
allowance recorded for commercial and commercial real estate
loans is based on a regular review of individual credit
relationships. The Company’s risk rating process is an
integral component of the methodology utilized in determining
the allowance for credit losses. An analysis of the migration of
commercial and commercial real estate loans and actual loss
experience throughout the business cycle is also conducted
quarterly to assess reserves established for credits with
similar risk characteristics. An allowance is established for
pools of commercial and commercial real estate loans based on
the risk ratings assigned. The amount is supported by the
results of the migration analysis that considers historical loss
experience by risk rating, as well as current and historical
economic conditions and industry risk factors. The Company
separately analyzes the carrying value of impaired loans to
determine whether the carrying value is less than or equal to
the appraised collateral value or the present value of expected
cash flows. Based on this analysis, an allowance for credit
losses may be specifically established for impaired loans. The
allowance established for commercial and commercial real estate
loan portfolios, including impaired commercial and commercial
real estate loans, was $1,015.0 million at
December 31, 2003, compared with $1,090.4 million and
$1,428.6 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. The decline in the allowance for commercial and
commercial real estate loans of $75.4 million reflected
improvement in the risk classifications of commercial and
commercial real estate portfolios, partially offset by higher
loss severity rates from the Company’s historical migration
analysis.

The allowance recorded for the residential
mortgages and retail loan portfolios is based on an analysis of
product mix, credit scoring and risk composition of the
portfolio, loss and bankruptcy experiences, economic conditions
and historical and expected delinquency and charge-off
statistics for each homogenous group of loans. Based on this
information and analysis, an allowance was established
approximating a rolling twelve-month estimate of net
charge-offs. The allowance established for residential mortgages
was $33.3 million at December 31, 2003,

Table 15

Elements of the Allowance for Credit Losses (a)

(a)

During 2001, the Company changed its
    methodology for determining the specific allowance for elements
    of the loan portfolio. Table 15 has been restated for 2000. Due
    to the Company’s inability to gather historical loss data
    on a combined basis for 1999, the methodologies and amounts
    assigned to each element of the loan portfolio for that year has
    not been conformed. Utilizing the prior methods, the total
    assigned to the allocated allowance for 2000 was
    $1,397.3 million and the allowance available for other
    factors portion was $389.6 million.

compared with $34.2 million and
$21.9 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. The slight decrease in the allowance for the
residential mortgage portfolio year-over-year was primarily due
to lower expected loss severity resulting from the more uniform
underwriting processes and standards associated with the
portfolio, partially offset by losses due to incremental growth
in the first lien home equity portfolio during 2003. The
allowance established for retail loans was $650.3 million
at December 31, 2003, compared with $699.7 million and
$705.3 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. The decline in the allowance for the retail
portfolio in 2003 reflected improved credit quality and
delinquency trends, partially offset by the impact of portfolio
growth and unemployment rates that continue to lag other
economic indicators.

Regardless of the extent of the Company’s
analysis of customer performance, portfolio trends or risk
management processes, certain inherent but undetected losses are
probable within the loan portfolios. This is due to several
factors, including inherent delays in obtaining information
regarding a customer’s financial condition or changes in
their unique business conditions, the judgmental nature of
individual loan evaluations, collateral assessments and the
interpretation of economic trends. Volatility of economic or
customer-specific conditions affecting the identification and
estimation of losses from larger non-homogeneous credits and the
sensitivity of assumptions utilized to establish allowances for
homogeneous groups of loans, loan portfolio concentrations, and
other subjective considerations are among other factors. Because
of the imprecision surrounding these factors, the Company
estimates a range of inherent losses based on statistical
analyses and management judgment, and maintains an
“allowance available for other factors” that is not
allocated to a specific loan category. The amount of the
allowance available for other factors was $670.0 million at
December 31, 2003, compared with $597.7 million at
December 31, 2002, and $301.5 million at
December 31, 2001.

Given the many subjective factors affecting the
credit portfolio, changes in the allowance for other factors may
not directly coincide with changes in the risk ratings of the
credit portfolio reflected in the risk rating process. This is,
in part, due to a lagging effect between changes in the business
cycle, the exposure and mix of loans within risk rating
categories, levels of nonperforming loans, and the timing of
charge-offs and recoveries. In 2001, management conducted
extensive reviews of its portfolios and enhanced its commercial
migration methods to better differentiate and weight loss
severity ratios by risk rating category to reflect the adverse
impact of loss experienced in 2001. The $326.1 million
decrease in the allowance for other factors in 2001 reflected
the impact of that change in loss severity ratios, which led the
Company to increase the allowance established for commercial
loans. In 2002, the Company reduced the level of higher risk
commercial credits and net charge-off ratios improved by 20
basis points from 2001. As a result, loss severity rates
determined through historical migration analysis had improved
somewhat relative to 2001. This led the Company to reduce the
level of the allowance specifically allocated to commercial
loans; however, nonperforming assets continued to remain at
elevated levels, economic growth continued to be soft and the
ability to further reduce higher risk credits had diminished as
refinancing opportunities had tightened. As such,
volatility of loss rates remained higher relative to prior
periods and management increased the level of the allowance for
other factors. At December 31, 2003, quantifiable factors
supporting the level of the allowance for other factors included
$23.3 million related to imprecision in risk ratings,
$184.6 million for volatility of commercial loss rates and
$199.1 million for volatility of retail loss forecasts. The
remaining allowance for other factors of $263.0 million was
related to uncertainty in the economy from lagging unemployment
rates, concentration risk, including risks associated with the
sluggish airline industry and highly leveraged enterprise-value
credits, and other qualitative factors.

Although the Company determines the amount of
each element of the allowance separately and this process is an
important credit management tool, the entire allowance for
credit losses is available for the entire loan portfolio. The
actual amount of losses incurred can vary significantly from the
recorded amounts. The Company’s methodology included
several factors intended to minimize the differences in recorded
and actual losses. These factors allowed the Company to adjust
its estimate of losses based on the most recent information
available. Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for accounting policies related to the
allowance for credit losses.

Residual Risk Management

The Company manages its risk to
changes in the value of lease residual assets through
disciplined residual valuation setting at the inception of a
lease, diversification of its leased assets, regular asset
valuation reviews and monitoring of residual value gains or
losses upon the disposition of assets. Commercial lease
originations are subject to the same well-defined underwriting
standards referred to in the “Credit Risk Management”
section which includes an evaluation of the residual risk.
Retail lease residual risk is mitigated further by originating
longer-term vehicle leases and effective end-of-term marketing
of off-lease vehicles. Also, to reduce the financial risk of
potential changes in vehicle residual values, the Company
maintains residual value insurance. The catastrophic insurance
maintained by the Company provides for the potential recovery of
losses on individual vehicle sales in an amount equal to the
difference between: (a) 105 percent or 110 percent of the
average wholesale auction price for the vehicle at the time of
sale and (b) the vehicle residual value specified by the
Automotive Lease Guide (an authoritative industry source) at the
inception of the lease. The potential recovery is calculated for
each individual vehicle sold in a particular policy year and is
reduced by any gains realized on vehicles sold during the same
period. The Company will receive claim proceeds if, in the
aggregate, there is a net loss for such period. To reduce the
risk associated with collecting insurance claims, the Company
monitors the financial viability of the insurance carrier based
on insurance industry ratings and available financial
information.

Included in the retail leasing portfolio was
approximately $3.3 billion of retail leasing residuals at
December 31, 2003, compared with $3.2 billion at
December 31, 2002. The Company monitors concentrations of
leases by manufacturer and vehicle “make and model.”
At year-end 2003, no vehicle-type concentration exceeded six
percent of the aggregate portfolio. Because retail residual
valuations tend to be less volatile for longer-term leases,
relative to the estimated residual at inception of the lease,
the Company actively manages lease origination production to
achieve a longer-term portfolio. At December 31, 2003, the
weighted-average origination term of the portfolio was
53 months. Since 1998, the used vehicle market has
experienced pricing stress. Several factors have contributed to
this business cycle. Aggressive leasing programs by automobile
manufacturers and competitors within the banking industry
included a marketing focus on monthly lease payments, enhanced
residuals at lease inception, shorter-term leases and low
mileage leases. These practices have created a cyclical
oversupply of certain off-lease vehicles causing significant
declines in used vehicle prices. Automobile manufacturers and
others have retreated somewhat from these marketing programs or
exited the leasing business. However, zero percent financing
offered with rebates continued to exert pressure on used car
pricing. Another factor impacting the used vehicle market has
been the deflation in new vehicle prices. This trend has been
driven by surplus automobile manufacturing capacity and related
production and highly competitive sales programs. Economic
factors are expected to moderate new car production. Production
levels have continued to decline from record levels in 2000.
Also, many Internet marketers failed or transformed into
distribution channels of dealers rather than direct competitors.
These trends are expected to abate the deflationary pricing
pressures of the past few years. Another factor that has slowed
the decline in residual values is the growth of
“certified” used car programs. Certified cars are low
mileage, newer model vehicles that have been inspected,
reconditioned, and usually have a warranty program. The
Company’s exposure to declining valuation should benefit
from certified car programs that receive premium pricing from
dealers at auction. Given the current economic environment, it
is difficult to assess the timing and degree of changes in
residual values that may impact financial results over the next
several quarters.

At December 31, 2003, the commercial leasing
portfolio had $816 million of residuals, compared with
$896 million at December 31, 2002. At year-end 2003,
lease residuals related to trucks and other transportation
equipment were 32 percent of the total residual portfolio.
Railcars represented 16 percent of the aggregate portfolio,
while aircraft and business and office equipment were
15 percent and 11 percent, respectively. No other
significant concentrations of more than 10 percent existed
at December 31, 2003. In 2003, reduced airline travel and
higher fuel costs adversely impacted aircraft and transportation
equipment lease residual values.

Operational Risk Management

Operational risk represents the risk
of loss resulting from the Company’s operations, including,
but not limited to, the risk of fraud by employees or persons
outside the Company, the execution of unauthorized transactions
by employees, errors relating to transaction processing and
technology, breaches of the internal control system and
compliance requirements and business continuation and disaster
recovery. This risk of loss also includes the potential legal
actions that could arise as a result of an operational
deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable
regulatory standards, adverse business decisions or their
implementation, and customer attrition due to potential negative
publicity.

The Company operates in many different businesses
in diverse markets and relies on the ability of its employees
and systems to process a high number of transactions.
Operational risk is inherent in all business activities, and the
management of this risk is important to the achievement of

44 U.S. Bancorp


the Company’s objectives. In the event of a
breakdown in the internal control system, improper operation of
systems or improper employees’ actions, the Company could
suffer financial loss, face regulatory action and suffer damage
to its reputation.

The Company manages operational risk through a
risk management framework and its internal control processes.
The framework involves the business lines, corporate risk
management personnel and executive management. Under this
framework, business lines have direct and primary responsibility
and accountability for identifying, controlling, and monitoring
operational risk. Clear structures and processes with defined
responsibilities are in place. Business managers maintain a
system of controls with the objective of providing proper
transaction authorization and execution, proper system
operations, safeguarding of assets from misuse or theft, and
ensuring the reliability of financial and other data. Business
managers ensure that the controls are appropriate and are
implemented as designed.

Each business line within the Company has
designated risk managers. These risk managers are responsible,
among other things, for coordinating the completion of ongoing
risk assessments and ensuring that operational risk management
is integrated into business decision-making activities. Business
continuation and disaster recovery planning is also critical to
effectively manage operational risks. Each business unit of the
Company is required to develop, maintain and test these plans at
least annually to ensure that recovery activities, if needed,
can support mission critical functions including technology,
networks and data centers supporting customer applications and
business operations. The Company’s internal audit function
validates the system of internal controls through risk-based,
regular and ongoing audit procedures and reports on the
effectiveness of internal controls to executive management and
the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.

Customer-related business conditions may also
increase operational risk or the level of operational losses in
certain transaction processing business units, including
merchant processing activities. Ongoing risk monitoring of
customer activities and their financial condition and
operational processes serve to mitigate customer-related
operational risk. Refer to Note 23 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on
merchant processing.

While the Company believes that it has designed
effective methods to minimize operational risks, there is no
absolute assurance that business disruption or operational
losses would not occur in the event of a disaster. On an ongoing
basis, management makes process changes and investments to
enhance its systems of internal controls and business continuity
and disaster recovery plans.

Interest Rate Risk Management

In the banking industry, a significant
risk exists related to changes in interest rates. To minimize
the volatility of net interest income and of the market value of
assets and liabilities, the Company manages its exposure to
changes in interest rates through asset and liability management
activities within guidelines established by its Asset Liability
Policy Committee (“ALPC”) and approved by the Board of
Directors. ALPC has the responsibility for approving and
ensuring compliance with ALPC management policies, including
interest rate risk exposure. The Company uses Net Interest
Income Simulation Analysis and Market Value of Equity Modeling
for measuring and analyzing consolidated interest rate risk.

Net Interest Income Simulation Analysis

One of the primary tools used to
measure interest rate risk and the effect of interest rate
changes on rate sensitive income and net interest income is
simulation analysis. The monthly analysis incorporates
substantially all of the Company’s assets and liabilities
and off-balance sheet instruments, together with forecasted
changes in the balance sheet and assumptions that reflect the
current interest rate environment. Through these simulations,
management estimates the impact on interest rate sensitive
income of a 300 basis point upward or downward gradual change of
market interest rates over a one-year period. The simulations
also estimate the effect of immediate and sustained parallel
shifts in the yield curve of 50 basis points as well as the
effect of immediate and sustained flattening or steepening of
the yield curve. These simulations include assumptions about how
the balance sheet is likely to be affected by changes in loan
and deposit growth. Assumptions are made to project interest
rates for new loans and deposits based on historical analysis,
management’s outlook and repricing strategies. These
assumptions are validated on a periodic basis. A sensitivity
analysis is provided for key variables of the simulation. The
results are reviewed by ALPC monthly and are used to

Given the current level of interest rates, a
    downward 300 basis point scenario can not be computed.

guide hedging strategies. ALPC policy guidelines
limit the estimated change in interest rate sensitive income to
5.0 percent of forecasted interest rate sensitive income
over the succeeding 12 months.

The table on page 45 summarizes the interest
rate risk of net interest income and rate sensitive income based
on forecasts over the succeeding 12 months. At December 31,
2003, the Company’s overall interest rate risk position was
substantively neutral to changes in interest rates. The Company
manages its interest rate risk position by holding assets on the
balance sheet with desired interest rate risk characteristics,
implementing certain pricing strategies for loans and deposits
and through the selection of derivatives and various funding and
investment portfolio strategies. The Company plans to continue
to manage the overall interest rate risk profile within policy
limits and towards a neutral position. At December 31, 2003
and 2002, the Company was within its policy guidelines.

Market Value of Equity Modeling

The Company also utilizes the
market value of equity as a measurement tool in managing
interest rate sensitivity. The market value of equity measures
the degree to which the market values of the Company’s
assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments will
change given a change in interest rates. ALPC guidelines limit
the change in market value of equity in a 200 basis point
parallel rate shock to 15 percent of the market value of
equity assuming interest rates at December 31, 2003. Given
the low level of current interest rates, the down 200 basis
point scenario cannot be computed. The up 200 basis point
scenario resulted in a 3.1 percent decrease in the market
value of equity at December 31, 2003, compared with a
2.5 percent decrease at December 31, 2002. ALPC
reviews other down rate scenarios to evaluate the impact of
falling interest rates. The down 100 basis point scenario
resulted in a 1.3 percent increase at December 31,
2003, and a 1.0 percent decrease at December 31, 2002.
At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company was within its
policy guidelines.

The valuation analysis is dependent upon certain
key assumptions about the nature of indeterminate maturity of
assets and liabilities. Management estimates the average life
and rate characteristics of asset and liability accounts based
upon historical analysis and management’s expectation of
rate behavior. These assumptions are validated on a periodic
basis. A sensitivity analysis of key variables of the valuation
analysis is provided to the ALPC monthly and is used to guide
hedging strategies. The results of the valuation analysis as of
December 31, 2003, were well within policy guidelines.

Use of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate
Risk

In the ordinary course of
business, the Company enters into derivative transactions to
manage its interest rate and prepayment risk (“asset and
liability management positions”) and to accommodate the
business requirements of its customers (“customer-related
positions”). To manage its interest rate risk, the Company
may enter into interest rate swap agreements and interest rate
options such as caps and floors. Interest rate swaps involve the
exchange of fixed-rate and variable-rate payments without the
exchange of the underlying notional amount on which the interest
payments are calculated. Interest rate caps protect against
rising interest rates while interest rate floors protect against
declining interest rates. In connection with its mortgage
banking operations, the Company enters into forward commitments
to sell mortgage loans related to fixed-rate mortgage loans held
for sale and fixed-rate mortgage loan commitments. The Company
also acts as a seller and buyer of interest rate contracts and
foreign exchange rate contracts on behalf of customers. The
Company minimizes its market and liquidity risks by taking
similar offsetting positions.

All interest rate derivatives that qualify for
hedge accounting are recorded at fair value as other assets or
liabilities on the balance sheet and are designated as either
“fair value” or “cash flow” hedges. The
Company performs an assessment, both at inception and quarterly
thereafter, when required, to determine whether these
derivatives are highly effective in offsetting changes in the
value of the hedged items. Hedge ineffectiveness for both cash
flow and fair value hedges is immediately recorded in
noninterest income. Changes in the fair value of derivatives
designated as fair value hedges, and changes in the fair value
of the hedged items, are recorded in earnings. Changes in the
fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are
recorded in other comprehensive income until income from the
cash flows of the hedged items is realized. Customer-related
interest rate swaps, foreign exchange rate contracts, and all
other derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge
accounting are recorded at fair value and resulting gains or
losses are recorded in trading account gains or losses or
mortgage banking revenue.

By their nature, derivative instruments are
subject to market risk. The Company does not utilize derivative
instruments for speculative purposes. Of the Company’s
$31.8 billion of total notional amount of asset and
liability management derivative positions at December 31,
2003, $29.8 billion was designated as either fair value or
cash flow hedges. The cash flow hedge positions are interest
rate swaps that hedge the forecasted cash flows from the
underlying variable-rate LIBOR loans and floating-rate debt. The
fair value hedges are primarily interest rate contracts that
hedge the change in fair value related to interest rate changes
of underlying fixed-rate debt, trust preferred securities and
deposit obligations. In addition, the Company uses forward
commitments to sell residential mortgage loans

46 U.S. Bancorp


to hedge its interest rate risk related to
residential mortgage loans held for sale. The Company commits to
sell the loans at specified prices in a future period, typically
within 90 days. The Company is exposed to interest rate
risk during the period between issuing a loan commitment and the
sale of the loan into the secondary market. Related to its
mortgage banking operations, the Company held $1.0 billion
of forward commitments to sell mortgage loans and
$1.0 billion of unfunded mortgage loan commitments that
were derivatives in accordance with the provisions of the
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133,
“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedge
Activities.” The unfunded mortgage loan commitments are
reported at fair value as options in Table 17.

Derivative instruments are also subject to credit
risk associated with counterparties to the derivative contracts.
Credit risk associated with derivatives is measured based on the
replacement cost should the counterparties with contracts in a
gain position to the Company fail to perform under the terms of
the contract. The Company manages this risk through
diversification of its derivative positions among various
counterparties, requiring collateral agreements with
credit-rating thresholds, entering into master netting
agreements in certain cases and entering into interest rate swap
risk participation agreements. These agreements are credit
derivatives that transfer the credit risk related to interest
rate swaps from the Company to an unaffiliated third-party. The
Company also provides credit protection to

third-parties with risk participation agreements,
for a fee, as part of a loan syndication transaction.

At December 31, 2003, the Company had
$174.9 million in accumulated other comprehensive income
related to unrealized gains on derivatives classified as cash
flow hedges. The unrealized gains will be reflected in earnings
when the related cash flows or hedged transactions occur and
will offset the related performance of the hedged items. The
estimated amount of gain to be reclassified from accumulated
other comprehensive income into earnings during the next 12
months is $53.1 million.

Gains or losses on customer-related derivative
positions were not material in 2003. The change in fair value of
forward commitments attributed to hedge ineffectiveness recorded
in noninterest income was a decrease of $6.8 million in
2003. The change in the fair value of all other asset and
liability management derivative positions attributed to hedge
ineffectiveness was not material in 2003.

Table 17 summarizes information on the
Company’s derivative positions at December 31, 2003.
Refer to Notes 1 and 21 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for significant accounting policies and
additional information regarding the Company’s use of
derivatives.

Market Risk Management

In addition to interest rate risk, the
Company is exposed to other forms of market risk as a
consequence of conducting normal trading activities. Business
activities that contribute to market risk include, among other
things, proprietary trading and foreign exchange positions.
Value at Risk (“VaR”) is a key measure of market risk
for the Company. Theoretically, VaR represents the maximum
amount that the Company has placed at risk of loss, with a
ninety-ninth percentile degree of confidence, to adverse market
movements in the course of its risk taking activities.

VaR modeling of trading activities is subject to
certain limitations. Additionally, it should be recognized that
there are assumptions and estimates associated with VaR modeling
and actual results could differ from those assumptions and
estimates. The Company mitigates these uncertainties through
regular monitoring of trading activities by management and other
risk management practices, including stop-loss and position
limits related to its trading activities. Stress-test models are
used to provide management with perspectives on market events
that VaR models do not capture.

The Company establishes market risk limits,
subject to approval by the Company’s Board of Directors.
The Company’s VaR limit was $40 million at
December 31, 2003 and 2002. The market valuation risk
inherent in its customer-based derivative trading, mortgage
banking pipeline and foreign exchange, as estimated by the VaR
analysis, was $1.5 million at December 31, 2003, and
$8.8 million at December 31, 2002.

Liquidity Risk Management

ALPC establishes policies, as well as
analyzes and manages liquidity, to ensure that adequate funds
are available to meet normal operating requirements in addition
to unexpected customer demands for funds, such as high levels of
deposit withdrawals or loan demand, in a timely and
cost-effective manner. The most important factor in the
preservation of liquidity is maintaining public confidence that
facilitates the retention and growth of a large, stable supply
of core deposits and wholesale funds. Ultimately, public
confidence is generated through profitable operations, sound
credit quality and a strong capital position. The Company’s
performance in these areas has enabled it to develop a large and
reliable base of core funding within its market areas and in
domestic and global capital markets. Liquidity management is
viewed from long-term and short-term perspectives, as well as
from an asset and liability perspective. Management monitors
liquidity through a regular review of maturity profiles, funding
sources, and loan and deposit forecasts to minimize funding risk.

The Company maintains strategic liquidity and
contingency plans that are subject to the availability of asset
liquidity in the balance sheet. Monthly, ALPC reviews the
Company’s ability to meet funding requirements due to
adverse business events. These funding needs are then matched
with specific asset-based sources to ensure sufficient funds are
available. Also, strategic liquidity policies require
diversification of wholesale funding sources to avoid
concentrations in any one market source. Subsidiary banks are
members of various Federal Home Loan Banks (“FHLB”)
that provide a source of funding through FHLB advances. The
Company maintains a Grand Cayman branch for issuing eurodollar
time deposits. The Company also establishes relationships with
dealers to issue national market retail and institutional
savings certificates and short- and medium-term bank notes.
Also, the Company’s subsidiary banks have significant
correspondent banking networks and corporate accounts.
Accordingly, it has access to national fed funds, funding
through repurchase agreements and sources of more stable,
regionally based certificates of deposit.

The Company’s ability to raise negotiated
funding at competitive prices is influenced by rating
agencies’ views of the Company’s credit quality,
liquidity, capital and earnings. The debt ratings noted in
Table 18 reflect the rating agencies’ recognition of
the strong, consistent financial performance of the Company and
the quality of the balance sheet. At December 31, 2003, the
credit ratings outlook for the Company was considered
“Positive” by

48 U.S. Bancorp


both Moody’s Investors Services and Fitch
and “Stable” by Standard & Poors.

The parent company’s routine funding
requirements consist primarily of operating expenses, dividends
to shareholders, debt service, repurchases of common stock and
funds used for acquisitions. The parent company obtains funding
to meet its obligations from dividends collected from its
subsidiaries and the issuance of debt securities. On
April 1, 2003, USB Capital II, a subsidiary of U.S.
Bancorp, redeemed 100 percent, or $350 million, of its
7.20 percent Trust Preferred Securities.

At December 31, 2003, parent company
long-term debt outstanding was $5.2 billion, compared with
$5.7 billion at December 31, 2002. The change in
long-term debt during 2003 was driven by medium-term note
maturities of $1.3 billion and $.3 billion of parent
company subordinated debt maturities, partially offset by the
issuance of $1.2 billion of fixed-rate medium-term notes.
Total parent company debt scheduled to mature in 2004 is
$888 million. These debt obligations may be met through
medium-term note issuances and dividends from subsidiaries, as
well as from parent company cash and cash equivalents. Federal
banking laws regulate the amount of dividends that may be paid
by banking subsidiaries without prior approval. The amount of
dividends available to the parent company from its banking
subsidiaries was approximately $828.5 million at
December 31, 2003. For further information, see
Note 24 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Refer to Table 19 for further information on
significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2003.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Off-balance sheet arrangements
include any contractual arrangement to which an unconsolidated
entity is a party, under which the Company has an obligation to
provide credit or liquidity enhancements or market risk support.
Off-balance sheet arrangements include certain defined
guarantees, asset securitization trusts and conduits.
Off-balance sheet arrangements also include any obligation under
a variable interest held by an unconsolidated entity that
provides financing, liquidity or credit enhancement or market
risk support to the Company.

In the ordinary course of business, the Company
enters into an array of commitments to extend credit, letters of
credit, lease commitments and various forms of guarantees that
may be considered off-balance sheet arrangements. The nature and
extent of these arrangements is provided in Note 23 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Asset securitization and conduits represent a
source of funding for the Company through off-balance sheet
structures. Credit, liquidity, operational and legal structural
risks exist due to the nature and complexity of asset
securitizations and other off-balance sheet structures. ALPC
regularly monitors the performance of each off-balance sheet
structure in an effort to minimize these risks and ensure
compliance with the requirements of the structures.

Contractual Obligations

(a)

In the banking industry, interest-bearing
    obligations are principally utilized to fund interest-bearing
    assets. As such, interest charges on related contractual
    obligations were excluded from reported amounts as the potential
    cash outflows would have corresponding cash inflows from
    interest-bearing assets.

(b)

Amounts only include obligations related to
    the unfunded non-qualified pension plan and post-retirement
    medical plans.

U.S. Bancorp  49


The Company utilizes its credit risk
    management systems to evaluate the credit quality of underlying
    assets and regularly forecasts cash flows to evaluate any
    potential impairment of retained interests. Also, regulatory
    guidelines require consideration of asset securitizations in the
    determination of risk-based capital ratios. The Company does not
    rely significantly on off-balance sheet arrangements for
    liquidity or capital resources.

The Company sponsors an off-balance sheet conduit
to which it transferred high-grade investment securities, funded
by the issuance of commercial paper. The conduit held assets of
$7.3 billion at December 31, 2003, and
$9.5 billion at December 31, 2002. These investment
securities include primarily (i) private label asset-backed
securities, which are insurance “wrapped” by
AAA/Aaa-rated monoline insurance companies and
(ii) government agency mortgage-backed securities and
collateralized mortgage obligations. The conduit had commercial
paper liabilities of $7.3 billion at December 31,
2003, and $9.5 billion at December 31, 2002.

The Company provides a liquidity facility to the
conduit. Utilization of the liquidity facility would be
triggered by the conduit’s inability to issue commercial
paper to fund its assets. The recorded fair value of the
Company’s liability for the liquidity facility included in
other liabilities was $47.3 million at December 31, 2003,
and $37.7 million at December 31, 2002. Changes in
fair value of these liabilities are recorded in the income
statement as other noninterest income or expense. In addition,
the Company recorded at fair value its retained residual
interest in the investment securities conduit of
$89.5 million at December 31, 2003, and
$93.4 million at December 31, 2002.

The Company also has an asset-backed
securitization to fund an unsecured small business credit
product. The unsecured small business credit securitization
trust held assets of $497.5 million at December 31,
2003, of which the Company retained $112.4 million of
subordinated securities, transferor’s interests of
$12.4 million and a residual interest-only strip of
$34.4 million. This compared with $652.4 million in
assets at December 31, 2002, of which the Company retained
$150.1 million of subordinated securities,
transferor’s interests of $16.3 million and a residual
interest-only strip of $53.3 million. The securitization
trust issued asset-backed variable funding notes in various
tranches. The Company provides credit enhancement in the form of
subordinated securities and reserve accounts. The Company’s
risk, primarily from losses in the underlying assets, was
considered in determining the fair value of the Company’s
retained interests in this securitization. The Company
recognized income from subordinated securities, an interest-only
strip and servicing fees from this securitization of
$29.8 million during 2003 and $52.8 million during
2002. The unsecured small business credit securitization held
average assets of $571.4 million in 2003 and
$700.6 million in 2002.

During 2003, the Company undertook several
actions with respect to off-balance sheet structures. In January
of 2003, the Company exercised a cleanup call option on an
indirect automobile loan securitization, with the remaining
assets from the securitization recorded on the Company’s
balance sheet at fair value. The indirect automobile
securitization held $156.1 million in assets at
December 31, 2002.

In June 2003, the Company terminated its
involvement with an operating lease arrangement involving
third-party lessors that acquired certain business assets,
including real estate, through leveraged financing structures
commonly referred to as “synthetic leases.” All assets
previously leased through the synthetic lease structures were
acquired and recorded by the Company at fair value. The
termination of the synthetic lease structures did not have a
material impact on the Company’s financial statements.

During the third quarter of 2003, the Company
elected not to reissue more than 90 percent of the
commercial paper funding of Stellar Funding Group, Inc., the
commercial loan conduit. This action caused the conduit to lose
its status as a “qualifying special purpose entity” as
defined below. As a result, the Company recorded all of
Stellar’s assets and liabilities at fair value and the
results of operations in the consolidated financial statements
of the Company. Given the floating rate nature and high credit
quality of the assets within the conduit, the impact to the
Company’s financial statements was not significant. In the
third quarter of 2003, average commercial loan balances
increased by approximately $2 billion and the resulting
increase in net interest income was offset by a similar decline
in conduit fee income within commercial products revenue. Prior
to December 31, 2003, the remaining commercial paper
borrowings held by third-party investors matured and the conduit
was legally dissolved.

In January 2003, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued Interpretation No. 46 (“FIN
46”), “Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities” (“VIEs”), an interpretation of
Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, “Consolidated
Financial Statements,” to improve financial reporting of
special purpose and other entities. The interpretation requires
the consolidation of entities in which an enterprise absorbs a
majority of the entity’s expected losses, receives a
majority of the entity’s expected residual returns, or
both, as a result of ownership, contractual or other financial
interests in the entity. Prior to the issuance of FIN 46,
consolidation generally occurred when an enterprise controlled
another entity through voting interests. Certain VIEs that are
qualifying special purpose entities (“QSPEs”) subject
to the reporting requirements of

50 U.S. Bancorp


Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 140 (“SFAS 140”), “Accounting for
Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment
of Liabilities,” will not be required to be consolidated
under the provisions of FIN 46. The consolidation
provisions of FIN 46 apply to VIEs created or entered into
after January 31, 2003. For VIEs created before
February 1, 2003, the effective date of applying the
provisions of FIN 46 for entities that have interests in
structures that are special purpose entities was for periods
ending after December 15, 2003, and for all other types of
entities was deferred to periods ending after March 15,
2004.

Because the Company’s investment securities
conduit and the asset-backed securitization are QSPEs, which are
exempt from consolidation under the provisions of FIN 46,
the consolidation of the conduit or securitizations in its
financial statements is not required at this time.

Capital Management

The Company is committed to managing
capital for maximum shareholder benefit and maintaining strong
protection for depositors and creditors. The Company continually
assesses its business risks and capital position. The Company
also manages its capital to exceed regulatory capital
requirements for well-capitalized bank holding companies. To
achieve these capital goals, the Company employs a variety of
capital management tools including dividends, common share
repurchases, and the issuance of subordinated debt and other
capital instruments. Total shareholders’ equity was
$19.2 billion at December 31, 2003, compared with
$18.4 billion at December 31, 2002. The increase was
the result of corporate earnings, offset primarily by the
payment of dividends, including the special dividend of
$685 million related to the spin-off of Piper Jaffray, and
the repurchase of common stock.

On December 16, 2003, the Company increased
its dividend rate per common share by 17.1 percent, from
$.205 per quarter to $.24 per quarter. On March 12, 2003,
the Company increased its dividend rate per common share by
5.1 percent, from $.195 per quarter to $.205 per quarter.
On March 12, 2002, the Company increased its dividend rate
per common share by 4.0 percent, from $.1875 per quarter to
$.195 per quarter.

On December 18, 2001, the Board of Directors
approved an authorization to repurchase 100 million shares
of common stock through 2003. In 2002, the Company purchased
5.2 million shares of common stock under the December 2001
plan. In 2003, the Company repurchased 7.0 million shares
of common stock under the plan, which expired in December of
2003. On December 16, 2003, the Board of Directors approved
an authorization to repurchase 150 million shares of common
stock over the following 24 months. During 2003, the
Company purchased 8.0 million shares under the December
2003 plan. There are approximately 142.0 million shares
remaining to be purchased under this authorization. The average
price paid for the 15.0 million shares repurchased during
2003 was

Regulatory Capital Ratios

(a)

These balances and ratios were prepared in
    accordance with regulatory accounting principles as disclosed in
    the subsidiaries’ regulatory reports. 2002 ratios for the
    bank subsidiaries were not restated for the adoption of
    SFAS 123.

U.S. Bancorp  51


$27.84 per share. For a complete analysis of
activities impacting shareholders’ equity and capital
management programs, refer to Note 16 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Banking regulators define minimum capital
requirements for banks and financial services holding companies.
These requirements are expressed in the form of a minimum Tier 1
capital ratio, total risk-based capital ratio, and Tier 1
leverage ratio. The minimum required level for these ratios is
4.0 percent, 8.0 percent, and 4.0 percent,
respectively. The Company targets its regulatory capital levels,
at both the bank and bank holding company level, to exceed the
“well-capitalized” threshold for these ratios of
6.0 percent, 10.0 percent, and 5.0 percent,
respectively. As of December 31, 2003, the Company’s
Tier 1 capital, total risk-based capital, and Tier 1 leverage
ratio were 9.1 percent, 13.6 percent, and
8.0 percent, respectively. These ratios compare to 8.0
percent, 12.4 percent, and 7.7 percent, respectively,
as of December 31, 2002. All regulatory ratios, at both the
bank and bank holding company level, continue to be in excess of
stated “well-capitalized” requirements.

Currently, mandatorily redeemable preferred
securities issued through subsidiary grantor trusts (“Trust
Preferred Securities”) qualify as Tier 1 capital of
the Company for regulatory purposes. Prior to the adoption of
FIN 46, the Company consolidated the grantor trusts, and
the balance sheet included the mandatorily redeemable preferred
securities of the grantor trusts. The Company has determined
that the provisions of FIN 46 may require de-consolidation
of the subsidiary grantor trusts and the junior subordinated
debentures of the Company owned by the grantor trusts would be
included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company
as long-term debt. The banking regulatory agencies have issued
guidance that would continue the current capital treatment for
Trust Preferred Securities until further notice. As of
December 31, 2003, management does not believe the adoption
of FIN 46, including the de-consolidation of Trust
Preferred Securities, if required, will have a material impact
on the Company’s results from operations, its financial
condition or regulatory capital ratios.

The Company uses tangible common equity expressed
as a percent of tangible common assets as an additional measure
of its capital. At December 31, 2003, the Company’s
tangible common equity ratio was 6.5 percent, compared with
5.7 percent at year-end 2002. Table 20 provides a
summary of capital ratios as of December 31, 2003 and 2002,
including Tier 1 and total risk-based capital ratios, as
defined by the regulatory agencies.

FOURTH QUARTER SUMMARY

The Company reported net income of
$977.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2003, or
$.50 per diluted share, compared with $819.7 million,
or $.43 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2002.
Return on average assets and return on average equity were
2.05 percent and 19.4 percent, respectively, for the
fourth quarter of 2003, compared with returns of
1.83 percent and 17.8 percent, respectively, for the
fourth quarter of 2002. The Company’s results for the
fourth quarter of 2003 improved over the fourth quarter of 2002,
primarily due to growth in net interest income and fee-based
products and services, as well as controlled operating expense
and lower credit costs. Net income from continuing operations
was $970.3 million, or $.50 per diluted share,
compared with $858.6 million, or $.45 per diluted
share for the fourth quarter of 2002, representing an
11.1 percent annual growth rate. Net income for the fourth
quarter of 2003 also included after-tax merger and
restructuring-related items of $5.0 million
($7.6 million on a pre-tax basis), compared with after-tax
merger and restructuring-related items of $69.9 million
($107.3 million on a pre-tax basis) for the fourth quarter
of 2002. The $99.7 million decline in pre-tax merger and
restructuring-related charges was primarily due to the
completion of integration activities associated with the merger
of Firstar and USBM at the end of 2002.

Total net revenue, on a taxable-equivalent basis,
was $3,113.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2003,
compared with $3,151.0 million for the fourth quarter of
2002, a decrease of $37.7 million (1.2 percent)
from a year ago. This decline primarily reflected the net
reduction in securities gains (losses) of
$106.3 million. Otherwise, favorable growth occurred in net
interest income, payment services revenue, trust and investment
management fees, treasury management fees, mortgage banking
revenue and acquisitions, including Bay View and State Street
Corporate Trust, which contributed approximately
$33.0 million of the increase in net revenue year-over-year.

Fourth quarter net interest income, on a
taxable-equivalent basis was $1,816.7 million, compared
with $1,765.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2002. The
$51.4 million (2.9 percent) increase in net interest
income was driven by an increase of $12.6 billion
(8.3 percent) in average earning assets, primarily due to
increases in investment securities, residential mortgages and
retail loans, partially offset by a decline in commercial loans
and loans held for sale related to mortgage banking activities.
The net interest margin for the fourth quarter of 2003 was
4.42 percent, compared with 4.65 percent in the fourth
quarter of 2002. The year-over-year decline in net interest
margin primarily reflected growth in lower-yielding investment
securities as a percent of total earning assets,

52 U.S. Bancorp


a change in loan mix and a decline in the
margin benefit from net free funds due to lower average interest
rates. In addition, the net interest margin declined
year-over-year as a result of consolidating high credit quality,
low margin loans from the Stellar commercial loan conduit onto
the Company’s balance sheet during the third quarter of
2003.

Fourth quarter 2003 noninterest income declined
6.4 percent from the same period of a year ago. The decline
is primarily due to a net reduction in securities gains
(losses) of $106.3 million year-over-year. In
addition, included in fourth quarter of 2002 was a
$46.5 million gain on the sale of an out-of-market credit
card portfolio. Credit and debit card revenue and corporate
payment products revenue were higher in the fourth quarter of
2003 than the fourth quarter of 2002 by $9.7 million
(6.8 percent) and $8.3 million (10.3 percent),
respectively. Although credit and debit card revenue grew
year-over-year, the growth was somewhat muted due to the impact
of the settlement of the antitrust litigation brought against
VISA USA and Mastercard by Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., Sears Roebuck
& Co. and other retailers, which lowered the interchange
rate on signature debit transactions beginning August 2003. The
year-over-year impact of the VISA settlement on credit and debit
card revenue for the quarter was a decline of approximately
$12.6 million. This change in the interchange rate, in
addition to higher customer loyalty rewards expenses, however,
was more than offset by the impact of increases in transaction
volumes and other rate adjustments. The corporate payment
products revenue growth reflected growth in sales and card
usage. Merchant processing services revenue was higher in the
fourth quarter of 2003 than the same quarter of 2002 by
$4.0 million (2.8 percent), due to an increase in
transaction volume, which was partially offset by lower
processing spreads resulting from revenue-sharing associated
with specific banking alliances and changes in the mix of
merchants. The favorable variance in trust and investment
management fees of $33.0 million (15.4 percent) in the
fourth quarter of 2003 over the same period of 2002 was
principally driven by the acquisition of State Street Corporate
Trust, which contributed approximately $21.1 million in
fees during the fourth quarter of 2003. In addition, trust and
investment management fees benefited from higher equity market
valuations and account growth year-over-year. Treasury
management fees grew by $13.7 million (13.4 percent) in the
fourth quarter of 2003 over the same period of 2002. The
increase in treasury management fees year-over-year was driven,
in part, by a change during the third quarter of

2003 in the Federal government’s payment
methodology for treasury management services from compensating
balances, reflected in net interest income, to fees. Mortgage
banking revenue increased by $3.5 million
(4.0 percent) over the same period of 2002 due to higher
loan servicing revenue, which was slightly offset by a decline
in origination and sales revenue. Offsetting these favorable
variances were declines in other income and commercial products
revenue year-over-year. Other income declined primarily due to
the sale of the credit card portfolio in the fourth quarter of
2002. Commercial products revenue declined by $9.8 million
(9.0 percent) year-over-year, principally reflecting lower
commercial loan conduit servicing fees, which resulted, in part,
from unwinding the Stellar commercial loan conduit.

Total noninterest expense was
$1,342.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2003, compared
with $1,486.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2002. The
decrease in noninterest expense of $144.2 million
(9.7 percent) was primarily due to a $99.7 million
reduction in merger and restructuring-related charges, the
favorable change in MSR impairments of $54.1 million and
cost savings from merger and restructuring-related activities.
These positive variances were partially offset by the impact of
recent acquisitions, including the branches of Bay View and
State Street Corporate Trust. The acquisitions contributed
approximately $16.0 million of expense growth to the
quarter.

The provision for credit losses was
$286.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2003 and
$349.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2002, a decrease
of $63.0 million (18.1 percent). Net charge-offs in the
fourth quarter of 2003 were $285.1 million, compared with
net charge-offs of $378.5 million during the fourth quarter
of 2002. The decline from a year ago primarily reflected lower
retail and commercial losses, the result of collection efforts
and an improving credit risk profile.

LINE OF BUSINESS FINANCIAL REVIEW

Within the Company, financial performance is
measured by major lines of business, which include Wholesale
Banking, Consumer Banking, Private Client, Trust and Asset
Management, Payment Services, and Treasury and Corporate
Support. These operating segments are components of the Company
about which financial information is available and is evaluated
regularly in deciding how to allocate resources and assess
performance.

Basis for Financial Presentation

Business line results are derived from
the Company’s business unit profitability reporting systems
by specifically attributing managed balance sheet assets,
deposits and other liabilities and their related income or
expense. Funds transfer-pricing methodologies are utilized to
allocate a cost of funds used or credit for funds provided to
all business line assets and liabilities using a matched funding
concept. Also, the business unit is allocated the
taxable-equivalent benefit of tax-exempt products. Noninterest
income and expenses directly managed by each business line,
including fees, service charges, salaries and benefits, and
other direct costs are accounted for within each segment’s
financial results in a manner similar to the consolidated
financial statements. Occupancy costs are allocated based on
utilization of facilities by the lines of business. Noninterest
expenses incurred by centrally managed operations or business
lines that directly support another business line’s
operations are not charged to the applicable business line.
Goodwill and other intangible assets are assigned to the lines
of business based on the mix of business of the acquired entity.
The provision for credit losses within the Wholesale Banking,
Consumer Banking, Private Client, Trust and Asset Management and
Payment Services lines of business is based on net charge-offs
while Treasury and Corporate Support reflects the residual
component of the Company’s total consolidated provision for
credit losses determined in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States. Income taxes
are assessed to each line of business at a standard tax rate
with the residual tax expense or benefit to arrive at the
consolidated effective tax rate included in Treasury and
Corporate Support. Merger and restructuring-related charges and
cumulative effects of changes in accounting principles are not
identified by or allocated to lines of business. Within the
Company, capital levels are evaluated and managed centrally;
however, capital is allocated to the operating segments to
support evaluation of business performance. Capital allocations
to the business lines are based on the amount of goodwill and
other intangibles, the extent of off-balance sheet managed
assets and lending commitments and the ratio of on-balance sheet
assets relative to the total Company. Certain lines of business,
such as trust, asset management and capital markets, have no
significant balance sheet components. For these business units,
capital is allocated taking into consideration fiduciary and
operational risk, capital levels of independent organizations
operating similar businesses, and regulatory requirements.

Designations, assignments and allocations may
change from time to time as management systems are enhanced,
methods of evaluating performance or product lines change or
business segments are realigned to better respond to our diverse
customer base. During 2003, certain organization and methodology
changes were made and, accordingly, 2002 results were restated
and presented on a comparable basis. Due to organizational and
methodology changes, the Company’s basis of financial
presentation differed in 2001. The presentation of comparative
business line results for 2001 is not practical and has not been
provided.

Wholesale Banking

offers lending, depository, treasury
management and other financial services to middle market, large
corporate and public sector clients. Wholesale Banking
contributed $1,195.3 million of the Company’s
operating earnings in 2003 and $1,115.7 million in 2002.
The increase in operating earnings in 2003 was driven by
slightly higher net revenue and reductions in noninterest
expense and provision for credit losses, compared with 2002.

Total net revenue increased $48.9 million
(1.9 percent) in 2003, compared with 2002. Net interest
income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, increased
1.5 percent, compared with 2002, as average deposits
increased $7.7 billion (36.5 percent) in 2003,
compared with 2002. The impact of increasing average deposits on
net interest income was offset somewhat by the adverse impact of
declining interest rates on the funding benefits of customer
deposits in addition to the declines in average loans and loan
spreads. Loan spreads declined from a year ago due, in part, to
the consolidation of high credit quality, low margin commercial
loans from the loan conduit onto the balance sheet. The decline
in average loans in 2003 was driven in part by soft customer
loan demand given the current economic environment, in addition
to the Company’s decisions in 2001 to tighten credit
availability to certain types of lending products, industries
and customers and reductions due to asset workout strategies.
Noninterest income increased 2.9 percent in 2003 to
$753.0 million, compared to 2002 noninterest income of
$731.8 million. The increase in noninterest income in 2003
was due to growth in treasury management-related fees,
international banking, syndication and customer derivative fees,
and equipment leasing revenue, partially offset by reductions in
fee income related to lower commercial loan volumes and the
consolidation of the commercial loan conduit, compared with
2002. The increase in cash management-related fees was driven by
growth in product sales, pricing enhancements and lower earnings
credit rates to customers. The growth was also driven by a
change in the Federal government’s payment methodology for
treasury management services from compensating balances,
reflected in net interest income, to fees during the third
quarter of 2003.

Noninterest expense was $350.6 million in
2003, compared with $383.5 million in 2002. The
$32.9 million decrease (8.6 percent) was primarily due
to cost savings initiatives that reduced personnel-related
costs, legal expenses and professional costs. Loan workout
expenses also declined in 2003 as the credit quality of the loan
portfolio has improved. In addition, noninterest expense for the
business segment in 2003 included $12.6 million of
equipment financing related residual value and inventory
write-downs.

The provision for credit losses was
$401.1 million and $444.5 million in 2003 and 2002,
respectively, a decline of $43.4 million
(9.8 percent). The favorable change in the provision for
credit losses for Wholesale Banking business is due to improving
net charge-offs which declined to .89 percent of average
loans in 2003 from .96 percent of average loans in 2002.
The reduction in net charge-offs was attributable to
improvements in credit quality driven by initiatives taken by
the Company during the past three years including asset workout
strategies and reductions in commitments to certain industries
and customers. Nonperforming assets within Wholesale Banking
were $744.2 million at December 31, 2003, compared
with $983.9 million at December 31, 2002. While
nonperforming asset levels continue to be elevated relative to
the 1990’s, significant improvement in credit quality has
been achieved with reductions being broad-based across most
industry sectors. The Company expects further improvements in
nonperforming asset levels through 2004. Refer to the
“Corporate Risk Profile” section for further
information on factors impacting the credit quality of the loan
portfolios.

Consumer Banking

delivers products and services to the
broad consumer market and small businesses through banking
offices, telemarketing, on-line services, direct mail and
automated teller machines (“ATMs”). It encompasses
community banking, metropolitan banking, small business banking,
including lending guaranteed by the Small Business
Administration, small-ticket leasing, consumer lending, mortgage
banking, workplace banking, student banking, 24-hour banking and
investment product and insurance sales. Consumer Banking
contributed $1,688.4 million of the Company’s
operating earnings for 2003 and $1,521.0 million for 2002,
an 11.0 percent increase over 2002. The increase in
operating earnings in 2003 was driven by higher net revenue and
reductions in provision for credit losses, offset by increases
in noninterest expense, compared with 2002.

Total net revenue increased $358.4 million
(7.3 percent) in 2003, compared with 2002. Net interest
income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, increased
$230.4 million (6.8 percent). Fee-based revenue
increased $42.4 million (3.0 percent) and securities
gains (losses) increased $85.6 million. The
year-over-year increase in net interest income was due to growth
in average loan balances and residential mortgages held for
sale, improved spreads on retail and commercial loans, lower
funding costs on non-earning asset balances, growth in
interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing deposit balances and
acquisitions. Partially offsetting these increases was the
impact of declining interest rates on the funding benefit of
consumer deposits. The increase in average loan balances of
10.1 percent reflected retail loan growth of
6.9 percent and growth in residential mortgages of
40.6 percent in 2003, compared with 2002. Residential
mortgages include first-lien home equity loans, which accounted
for 26.7 percent of the growth

U.S. Bancorp  55


in residential mortgages. Commercial and
commercial real estate loan balances increased 1.3 percent
during the same period. The year-over-year increase in average
deposits included growth in noninterest-bearing, interest
checking, savings and money market account balances, partially
offset by a reduction in balances associated with time deposits.
The decline in lower margin time deposits primarily reflected a
shift in product mix towards savings products.

Noninterest income excluding securities gains was
$1,460.1 million in 2003, $42.4 million
(3.0 percent) higher compared with 2002. This growth was
driven by mortgage banking revenue, deposit service charges,
investment products fees and commissions and acquisitions,
partially offset by higher end-of-term lease residual losses.
The year-over-year growth in mortgage banking revenue was
partially attributable to the acquisition of Leader in the
second quarter of 2002, which contributed $63.7 million in
2003, compared with $47.2 million in 2002. Securities gains
were $193.4 million in 2003, a net increase of
$85.6 million from a year ago. The Company utilizes its
investment portfolio as an economic hedge to the valuation risk
of the portfolio of mortgage servicing rights caused by
declining interest rates and related increases in mortgage
prepayments due to mortgage refinancing activity.

Noninterest expense was $2,198.2 million in
2003, compared with $2,074.7 million for 2002, an increase
of $123.5 million (6.0 percent). The year-over-year
increase in noninterest expense was attributable to an increase
in MSR amortization and impairment of $85.3 million, higher
loan origination and repossession costs and incremental
operating costs of $56.4 million related to the Bay View
Bank and Leader acquisitions.

56 U.S. Bancorp


The provision for credit losses decreased
$28.0 million in 2003, compared with 2002. The improvement
in the provision for credit losses in 2003 was primarily
attributable to lower net charge-offs. As a percentage of
average loans, net charge-offs declined to .75 percent in
2003, compared with .88 percent in 2002. The declines in
net charge-offs included the commercial, commercial real estate
and retail loan portfolios. The improvement in commercial and
commercial real estate loan net charge-offs within Consumer
Banking of $20.6 million was broad-based across most
industry and geographical regions. Retail loan net charge-offs
declined by $16.5 million primarily resulting from ongoing
collection efforts and risk management. Nonperforming assets
within Consumer Banking were $367.1 million at
December 31, 2003, compared with $345.4 million at
December 31, 2002. Refer to the “Corporate Risk
Profile” section for further information on factors
impacting the credit quality of the loan portfolios.

Private Client, Trust and Asset Management

provides trust, private banking,
financial advisory, investment management and mutual fund and
alternative investment product services through five businesses:
Private Client Group, Corporate Trust, Asset Management,
Institutional Trust and Custody and Fund Services, LLC. Private
Client, Trust and Asset Management contributed
$506.5 million of the Company’s operating earnings in
2003, and increase of 10.9 percent compared with 2002.

Total net revenue was $1,352.0 million in
2003, an increase of 10.4 percent, compared with 2002. Net
interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, increased
$60.6 million (18.8 percent) in 2003, compared with
2002. The increase in net interest income in 2003 was due to
growth in total deposits of 34.5 percent attributable to

U.S. Bancorp  57


growth in noninterest-bearing deposits, savings
products, time deposits and the State Street Corporate Trust
acquisition, partially offset by the impact of declining
interest rates on the funding benefit of deposits. The
acquisition of the corporate trust business from State Street
represented approximately $31.4 million of the 2003
increase in net interest income. Noninterest income increased
$66.9 million (7.4 percent) in 2003, compared with
2002. The acquisition of the State Street Corporate Trust
business was the primary factor for this increase, partially
offset by a year-over-year decrease in the value of assets under
management due to adverse capital market conditions in early
2003. During the second half of 2003, equity capital market
conditions improved significantly, and the line of business
experienced an increase in assets under management and related
fees.

Noninterest expense increased $53.9 million
(10.9 percent) in 2003, compared with 2002, primarily
attributable to the State Street Corporate Trust acquisition
($68.5 million), offset by cost savings from business
integration and other cost control initiatives.

The provision for credit losses decreased
$4.8 million (43.6 percent) in 2003, compared with
2002. The year-over-year decrease in the provision for credit
losses was primarily due to lower retail loan net charge-offs.

Payment Services

includes consumer and business credit
cards, corporate and purchasing card services, consumer lines of
credit, ATM processing, merchant processing and debit cards.
Payment Services contributed $732.8 million of the
Company’s operating earnings in 2003, a 4.0 percent
increase over 2002.

Total net revenue was $2,316.7 million in
2003, a 1.5 percent decrease, compared with 2002. Net
interest income decreased 7.6 percent in 2003, compared
with 2002, primarily due to a reduction in customer late fees
and lost interest revenue from the sale of two credit card
portfolios. During late 2002, the Company sold two co-branded
credit card portfolios, reducing year-over-year net interest
income for this business line by approximately
$29.3 million in 2003. Noninterest income increased
..9 percent in 2003, compared with 2002. The increase in
fee-based revenue in 2003 was driven by strong growth in credit
card and debit card revenue and corporate payment product
revenues, which was partially offset by a reduction in merchant
processing and other revenue. The growth in credit and debit
card revenue was muted somewhat by the $19.4 million impact
of the debit card antitrust settlement by VISA USA and
Mastercard which lowered interchange rates on signature debit
transactions. Merchant processing revenue declined due to lower
processing spreads resulting from changes in revenue-sharing
associated with specific banking alliances and a change in the
mix of merchants, which offset the favorable impact of increased
transaction processing volumes. Other revenue in 2002 included
$67.4 million related to the credit card portfolio sales.

Noninterest expense was $752.0 million in
2003, a decrease of $36.4 million (4.6 percent),
compared with 2002. The decrease in noninterest expense was
primarily attributable to lower fraud losses and third-party
merchant processing costs partially offset by increased
marketing costs. Personnel cost increases attributable to higher
processing volumes were more than offset by business line cost
savings.

The provision for credit losses was
$412.7 million in 2003, a decrease of $43.7 million
(9.6 percent), compared with 2002 due to lower net
charge-offs of the business line. As a percentage of average
loans, net charge-offs were 4.13 percent in 2003, compared
with 4.52 percent of average loans in 2002. The favorable
change in credit losses was due to improvements in ongoing
collection efforts, risk management and the sale of two
co-branded credit card portfolios during late 2002.

Treasury and Corporate Support

includes the Company’s investment
portfolios, funding, capital management and asset securitization
activities, interest rate risk management, the net effect of
transfer pricing related to average balances and business
activities managed on a corporate basis, including
enterprise-wide operations and administrative support functions.
Treasury and Corporate Support recorded operating losses of
$382.5 million in 2003, an increase of
6.0 percent, compared with 2002.

Total net revenue was $942.7 million in
2003, compared with total net revenue of $969.2 million in
2002. The year-over-year decline of $26.5 million
(2.7 percent) in total net revenue in 2003 was attributable
to a reduction in securities gains of $140.7 million
partially offset by increases in net interest income of
$102.8 million (17.3 percent) and noninterest income
of $11.4 million (6.2 percent). The increase in net
interest income was primarily attributable to the increase in
average investment securities of $8.4 billion. Investment
securities increased in 2003 compared with 2002, reflecting the
reinvestment of proceeds from loan sales, declines in commercial
loan balances and additional deposits assumed from acquisitions.
Noninterest expense was $1,700.4 million in 2003, compared
with $1,677.1 million in 2002. The $23.3 million
increase (1.4 percent) year-over-year was primarily the
result of higher costs associated with employee pension
benefits, corporate insurance, postage, telecommunications and
charitable contributions.

The provision for credit losses for this business
unit represents the residual aggregate of the net credit losses
allocated to the reportable business units and the
Company’s recorded provision determined in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United

States. The provision for credit losses was a net
recovery of $1.8 million in 2003, compared with a net
recovery of $26.7 million in 2002. Refer to the
“Corporate Risk Profile” section for further
information on the provision for credit losses, nonperforming
assets and factors considered by the Company in assessing the
credit quality of the loan portfolio and establishing the
allowance for credit losses.

ACCOUNTING CHANGES

Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements discusses accounting standards recently issued or
proposed but not yet required to be adopted and the expected
impact of the changes in accounting standards. To the extent the
adoption of new accounting standards affects the Company’s
financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, the
impacts are discussed in the applicable section(s) of the
Management’s Discussion and Analysis and the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

On January 8, 2004, the Company elected to
adopt the “fair value” method of accounting for
stock-based compensation. The Company implemented this
accounting change utilizing the “retroactive restatement
method,” requiring all prior periods to be restated to
recognize compensation expense for the estimated fair value of
all employee stock awards including stock options granted,
modified or settled in fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 1994.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The accounting and reporting policies of the
Company comply with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States and conform to general practices within the
banking industry. The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to make estimates and assumptions. The
financial position and results of operations can be affected by
these estimates and assumptions, which are integral to
understanding the Company’s financial statements. Critical
accounting policies are those policies that management believes
are the most important to the portrayal of the Company’s
financial condition and results, and require management to make
estimates that are difficult, subjective or complex. Most
accounting policies are not considered by management to be
critical accounting policies. Several factors are considered in
determining whether or not a policy is critical in the
preparation of financial statements. These factors include,
among other things, whether the estimates are significant to the
financial statements, the nature of the estimates, the ability
to readily validate the estimates with other information
including third-parties or available prices, and sensitivity of
the estimates to changes in economic conditions and whether
alternative accounting methods may be utilized under generally
accepted accounting principles. Management has discussed the
development and the selection of critical accounting policies
with the Company’s Audit Committee.

Significant accounting policies are discussed in
Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Those policies considered to be critical accounting policies are
described below.

Allowance for Credit Losses

The allowance for credit losses is
established to provide for probable losses inherent in the
Company’s credit portfolio. The methods utilized to
estimate the allowance for credit losses, key assumptions and
quantitative and qualitative information considered by
management in determining the adequacy of the allowance for
credit losses are discussed in the “Credit Risk
Management” section.

Management’s evaluation of the adequacy of
the allowance for credit losses is often the most critical of
accounting estimates for a banking institution. It is a highly
subjective process impacted by many factors as discussed
throughout the Management’s Discussion and Analysis section
of the Annual Report. Although risk management practices,
methodologies and other tools are utilized to determine each
element of the allowance, degrees of imprecision exist in these
measurement tools due in part to subjective judgments involved
and an inherent lagging of credit quality measurements relative
to the stage of the business cycle. Even determining the stage
of the business cycle is highly subjective. As discussed in the
“Analysis and Determination of Allowance for Credit
Losses” section, management considers the effect of
imprecision and many other factors in determining the allowance
for credit losses by establishing an “allowance for other
factors” that is not specifically allocated to a category
of loans. If not considered, inherent losses in the portfolio
related to imprecision and other subjective factors could have a
dramatic adverse impact on the liquidity and financial viability
of a bank.

Given the many subjective factors affecting the
credit portfolio, changes in the allowance for other factors may
not directly coincide with changes in the risk ratings of the
credit portfolio reflected in the risk rating process. This is
in part due to the timing of the risk rating process in relation
to changes in the business cycle, the exposure and mix of loans
within risk rating categories, levels of nonperforming loans and
the timing of charge-offs and recoveries. For example, the
amount of loans within specific risk ratings may change,
providing a leading indicator of improving credit quality, while
nonperforming loans and net charge-offs continue at elevated
levels. Because the allowance specifically allocated to
commercial loans is primarily driven by risk ratings and loss
ratios determined through migration

U.S. Bancorp  59


analysis and historical performance, the amount
of the allowance for commercial and commercial real estate loans
might decline. However, it is likely that management would
maintain an adequate allowance for credit losses by increasing
the allowance for other factors at a stage in the business cycle
that is uncertain and when nonperforming asset levels remain
elevated.

Sensitivity analysis to the many factors
impacting the allowance for credit losses is difficult. Some
factors are quantifiable while other factors require qualitative
judgment. Management conducts analysis with respect to the
accuracy of risk ratings and the volatility of inherent loss
rates applied to risk categories and utilizes the results of
this analysis to determine retail loss projections. This
analysis is then considered in determining the level of the
allowance for credit losses. Refer to the “Analysis and
Determination of the Allowance for Credit Losses” section
for further information.

Asset Impairment

In
the ordinary course of business, the Company evaluates the
carrying value of its assets for potential impairment.
Generally, potential impairment is determined based on a
comparison of fair value to the carrying value. The
determination of fair value can be highly subjective, especially
for assets that are not actively traded or when market-based
prices are not available. The Company estimates fair value based
on the present value of estimated future cash flows. The initial
valuation and subsequent impairment tests may require the use of
significant management estimates. Additionally, determining the
amount, if any, of an impairment may require an assessment of
whether or not a decline in an asset’s estimated fair value
below the recorded value is temporary in nature. While
impairment assessments impact most asset categories, the
following areas are considered to be critical accounting matters
in relation to the financial statements.

Mortgage Servicing Rights

MSRs are capitalized as separate
assets when loans are sold and servicing is retained. The total
cost of loans sold is allocated between the loans sold and the
servicing assets retained based on their relative fair values.
MSRs that are purchased from others are initially recorded at
cost. The carrying value of the MSRs is amortized in proportion
to and over the period of estimated net servicing revenue and
recorded in noninterest expense as amortization of intangible
assets. The carrying value of these assets is periodically
reviewed for impairment using a lower of carrying value or fair
value methodology. For purposes of measuring impairment, the
servicing rights are stratified based on the underlying loan
type and note rate and the carrying value for each stratum is
compared to fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis,
utilizing current prepayment speeds and discount rates. Events
that may significantly affect the estimates used are changes in
interest rates and the related impact on mortgage loan
prepayment speeds and the payment performance of the underlying
loans. If the carrying value is greater than fair value,
impairment is recognized through a valuation allowance for each
impaired stratum and recorded as amortization of intangible
assets. The changes in the fair value of MSRs at
December 31, 2003, to immediate 25 and 50 basis point
adverse changes in interest rates would be approximately
$78 million and $127 million, respectively. An upward
movement in interest rates at December 31, 2003, of 25 and
50 basis points would increase the value of the MSRs by
approximately $75 million and $133 million,
respectively. Refer to Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information regarding MSRs.

Goodwill and Other Intangibles

The Company records all assets and
liabilities acquired in purchase acquisitions, including
goodwill and other intangibles, at fair value as required by
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141,
“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” Goodwill and
indefinite-lived assets are no longer amortized but are subject,
at a minimum, to annual tests for impairment. Under certain
situations, interim impairment tests may be required if events
occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not
reduce the fair value of a reporting segment below its carrying
amount. Other intangible assets are amortized over their
estimated useful lives using straight-line and accelerated
methods and are subject to impairment if events or circumstances
indicate a possible inability to realize the carrying amount.

The initial recognition of goodwill and other
intangible assets and subsequent impairment analysis require
management to make subjective judgments concerning estimates of
how the acquired assets will perform in the future using
valuation methods including discounted cash flow analysis.
Additionally, estimated cash flows may extend beyond ten years
and, by their nature, are difficult to determine over an
extended timeframe. Events and factors that may significantly
affect the estimates include, among others, competitive forces,
customer behaviors and attrition, changes in revenue growth
trends, cost structures and technology, changes in discount
rates and specific industry and market conditions. In
determining the reasonableness of cash flow estimates, the
Company reviews historical performance of the underlying assets
or similar assets in an effort to assess and validate
assumptions utilized in its estimates.

In assessing the fair value of reporting units,
the Company may consider the stage of the current business cycle
and potential changes in market conditions in estimating the
timing and extent of future cash flows. Also, management often
utilizes other information to validate the

60 U.S. Bancorp


reasonableness of its valuations including public
market comparables, multiples of recent mergers and acquisitions
of similar businesses. Valuation multiples may be based on
revenue, price-to-earnings and tangible capital ratios of
comparable public companies and business segments. These
multiples may be adjusted to consider competitive differences
including size, operating leverage and other factors. The
carrying amount of a reporting unit is determined based on the
capital required to support the reporting unit’s activities
including its tangible and intangible assets. The determination
of a reporting unit’s capital allocation requires
management judgment and considers many factors including the
regulatory capital regulations and capital characteristics of
comparable public companies in relevant industry sectors. In
certain circumstances, management will engage a third-party to
independently validate its assessment of the fair value of its
business segments.

The Company’s annual assessment of potential
goodwill impairment was completed during the second quarter of
2003. Based on the results of this assessment, no goodwill
impairment was recognized.

DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Under the supervision and with the participation
of the Company’s management, including its principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, the Company
has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of
its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”)). Based upon
this evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal
financial officer have concluded that, as of the end of the
period covered by this report, the Company’s disclosure
controls and procedures were effective to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports
that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms.

During the most recently completed fiscal
quarter, there was no change made in the Company’s internal
controls over financial reporting (as defined in
Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act)
that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
materially affect, the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting.

Significant Accounting Policies

U.S. Bancorp and its subsidiaries (the
“Company”) is a multi-state financial services holding
company headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The Company
provides a full range of financial services including lending
and depository services through banking offices principally in
24 states. The Company also engages in credit card, merchant,
and ATM processing, mortgage banking, insurance, trust and
investment management, brokerage, and leasing activities
principally in domestic markets.

Basis of
Presentation

The consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its
subsidiaries. The consolidation eliminates all significant
intercompany accounts and transactions. Certain items in prior
periods have been reclassified to conform to the current
presentation. The consolidated financial statements have been
retroactively restated due to the adoption of the fair value
method of accounting for stock-based compensation as described
in Note 2 and to report the results of Piper Jaffray
Companies as discontinued operations as described in Note 4
of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Uses of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported
in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual
experience could differ from those estimates.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS

Within the Company, financial performance is
measured by major lines of business based on the products and
services provided to customers through its distribution
channels. The Company has five reportable operating segments:

Wholesale Banking

offers lending, depository, treasury management and other
financial services to middle market, large corporate and public
sector clients.

Consumer Banking

delivers products and services to the broad consumer market and
small businesses through banking offices, telemarketing, on-line
services, direct mail and automated teller machines
(“ATMs”).

Private Client, Trust and Asset
Management

provides trust, private
banking, financial advisory, investment management and mutual
fund processing services to affluent individuals, businesses,
institutions and mutual funds.

Payment Services

includes consumer and business credit cards, corporate and
purchasing card services, ATM processing, merchant processing
and debit cards. Customized products and services, coupled with
cutting-edge technology are provided to consumer and business
customers, government clients, correspondent financial
institutions, merchants and co-brand partners.

Treasury and Corporate
Support

includes the Company’s
investment portfolios, funding, capital management and asset
securitization activities, interest rate risk management, the
net effect of transfer pricing related to average balances, and
the change in residual allocations associated with the provision
for loan losses. It also includes business activities managed on
a corporate basis, including income and expense of
enterprise-wide operations and administrative support functions.

Segment Results

Accounting policies for the lines of business are the same as
those used in preparation of the consolidated financial
statements with respect to activities specifically attributable
to each business line. However, the preparation of business line
results requires management to establish methodologies to
allocate funding costs and benefits, expenses and other
financial elements to each line of business. For details of
these methodologies and segment results, see “Basis for
Financial Presentation” and Table 22 “Line of Business
Financial Performance” included in Management’s
Discussion and Analysis which is incorporated by reference into
these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

SECURITIES

Realized gains or losses on securities are
determined on a trade date basis based on the specific carrying
value of the investments being sold.

Trading Securities

Debt and equity securities held for resale are classified as
trading securities and reported at fair value. Realized gains or
losses are reported in noninterest income.

Available-for-sale
Securities

These securities are not
trading securities but may be sold before maturity in response
to changes in the Company’s interest rate risk profile,
funding needs or demand for collateralized deposits by public
entities. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair
value with unrealized net gains or losses reported within other
comprehensive income in shareholders’ equity. When sold,
the amortized cost of the specific securities is used to compute
the gain or loss. Declines in fair value that

66 U.S. Bancorp


are deemed other than temporary, if any, are
reported in noninterest income.

Held-to-maturity
Securities

Debt securities for which
the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to
maturity are reported at historical cost adjusted for
amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts. Declines in
fair value that are deemed other than temporary, if any, are
reported in noninterest income.

Securities Purchased Under Agreements to
Resell and Securities Sold Under Agreements to
Repurchase

Securities purchased under
agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements to
repurchase are generally accounted for as collateralized
financing transactions and are recorded at the amounts at which
the securities were acquired or sold, plus accrued interest.
Securities pledged as collateral under these financing
arrangements cannot be sold or repledged by the secured party.
The fair value of collateral received is continually monitored
and additional collateral obtained or requested to be returned
to the Company as deemed appropriate.

EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN OPERATING
ENTITIES

Equity investments in public entities in which
ownership is less than 20 percent are accounted for as
available-for-sale securities and carried at fair value. Similar
investments in private entities are accounted for using the cost
method. Investments in entities where ownership interest is
between 20 percent and 50 percent are accounted for using
the equity method with the exception of limited partnerships and
limited liability companies where an ownership interest of
greater than 5 percent requires the use of the equity
method. If the Company has a voting interest greater than
50 percent, the consolidation method is used. All equity
investments are evaluated for impairment at least annually and
more frequently if certain criteria are met.

LOANS

Loans are reported net of unearned income.
Interest income is accrued on the unpaid principal balances as
earned. Loan and commitment fees and certain direct loan
origination costs are deferred and recognized over the life of
the loan and/or commitment period as yield adjustments.

Commitments to Extend
Credit

Unfunded residential mortgage
loan commitments entered into in connection with mortgage
banking activities are considered derivatives and recorded on
the balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value
recorded in income. All other unfunded loan commitments are
generally related to providing credit facilities to customers of
the bank and are not actively traded financial instruments.
These unfunded commitments are disclosed as off-balance sheet
financial instruments in Note 23 in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Allowance for Credit
Losses

Management determines the
adequacy of the allowance based on evaluations of the loan
portfolio, recent loss experience, and other pertinent factors,
including economic conditions. This evaluation is inherently
subjective as it requires estimates, including amounts of future
cash collections expected on nonaccrual loans, which may be
susceptible to significant change. The allowance for credit
losses relating to impaired loans is based on the loan’s
observable market price, the collateral for certain
collateral-dependent loans, or the discounted cash flows using
the loan’s effective interest rate.

The Company determines the amount of the
allowance required for certain sectors based on relative risk
characteristics of the loan portfolio. The allowance recorded
for commercial loans is based on quarterly reviews of individual
credit relationships and an analysis of the migration of
commercial loans and actual loss experience. The allowance
recorded for homogeneous consumer loans is based on an analysis
of product mix, risk characteristics of the portfolio,
bankruptcy experiences, and historical losses, adjusted for
current trends, for each homogenous category or group of loans.
The allowance is increased through provisions charged to
operating earnings and reduced by net charge-offs.

The Company also assesses the credit risk
associated with off-balance sheet loan commitments and letters
of credit and determines the appropriate amount of credit loss
liability that should be recorded. The liability for off-balance
sheet credit exposure related to loan commitments is included in
the allowance for loan losses.

Nonaccrual Loans

Generally commercial loans (including impaired loans) are placed
on nonaccrual status when the collection of interest or
principal has become 90 days past due or is otherwise
considered doubtful. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status,
unpaid interest is reversed. Future interest payments are
generally applied against principal. Revolving consumer lines
and credit cards are charged off by 180 days past due and
closed-end consumer loans other than loans secured by 1-4 family
properties are charged off at 120 days past due and are,
therefore, generally not placed on nonaccrual status.

Impaired Loans

A
loan is considered to be impaired when, based on current
information and events, it is probable that the Company will be
unable to collect all amounts due (both interest and principal)
according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement.

Restructured Loans

In cases where a borrower experiences financial difficulties and
the Company makes certain concessionary modifications to
contractual terms, the loan is

U.S. Bancorp  67


classified as a restructured loan. Loans
restructured at a rate equal to or greater than that of a new
loan with comparable risk at the time the contract is modified
may be excluded from restructured loans in the calendar years
subsequent to the restructuring if they are in compliance with
the modified terms.

Generally, a nonaccrual loan that is restructured
remains on nonaccrual for a period of six months to demonstrate
that the borrower can meet the restructured terms. However,
performance prior to the restructuring, or significant events
that coincide with the restructuring, are considered in
assessing whether the borrower can meet the new terms and may
result in the loan being returned to accrual status at the time
of restructuring or after a shorter performance period. If the
borrower’s ability to meet the revised payment schedule is
not reasonably assured, the loan remains classified as a
nonaccrual loan.

Leases

The Company
engages in both direct and leveraged lease financing. The net
investment in direct financing leases is the sum of all minimum
lease payments and estimated residual values, less unearned
income. Unearned income is added to interest income over the
terms of the leases to produce a level yield.

The investment in leveraged leases is the sum of
all lease payments (less nonrecourse debt payments) plus
estimated residual values, less unearned income. Income from
leveraged leases is recognized over the term of the leases based
on the unrecovered equity investment.

Residual values on leased assets are reviewed
regularly for other than temporary impairment. Residual
valuations for retail automobile leases are based on independent
assessments of expected used car sales prices at the
end-of-term. Impairment tests are conducted based on these
valuations considering the probability of the lessee returning
the asset to the Company, re-marketing efforts, insurance
coverage and ancillary fees and costs. Valuations for commercial
leases are based upon external or internal management
appraisals. When there is other than temporary impairment in the
estimated fair value of the Company’s interest in the
residual value of a leased asset, the carrying value is reduced
to the estimated fair value with the writedown recognized in the
current period in commercial products revenue or other
noninterest income.

Loans Held for Sale

Loans held for sale (“LHFS”) represent mortgage loan
originations intended to be sold in the secondary market and
other loans that management has an active plan to sell. LHFS are
carried at the lower of cost or market value as determined on an
aggregate basis by type of loan. In the event management decides
to sell loans receivable, the loans are transferred at the lower
of cost or fair value. The Interagency Guidance on Certain Loans
Held for Sale, dated March 26, 2001, requires loans
transferred to LHFS to be marked-to-market (“MTM”) at
the time of transfer. MTM losses related to the sale/transfer of
non-homogeneous loans that are predominantly credit-related are
reflected in charge-offs. With respect to homogeneous loans, the
amount of “probable” credit loss determined in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 5 (“SFAS 5”), “Accounting for
Contingencies,” methodologies utilized to determine the
specific allowance allocation for the portfolio is also included
in charge-offs. Any incremental loss determined in accordance
with MTM accounting, that includes consideration of other
factors such as estimates of future losses, is reported
separately from charge-offs as a reduction to the allowance for
credit losses. Subsequent decreases in fair value are recognized
in noninterest income.

Other Real Estate

Other real estate (“ORE”), which is included in other
assets, is property acquired through foreclosure or other
proceedings. ORE is carried at fair value, less estimated
selling costs. The property is evaluated regularly and any
decreases in the carrying amount are included in noninterest
expense.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

In the ordinary course of business, the Company
enters into derivative transactions to manage its interest rate
and prepayment risk and to accommodate the business requirements
of its customers. All derivative instruments are recorded as
either assets or liabilities at fair value. Subsequent changes
in a derivative’s fair value are recognized currently in
earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met.

All derivative instruments that qualify for hedge
accounting are recorded at fair value and classified either as a
hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability
(“fair value” hedge) or as a hedge of the variability
of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized
asset or liability or a forecasted transaction (“cash
flow” hedge). Changes in the fair value of a derivative
that is highly effective and designated as a fair value hedge
and the offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged item
are recorded in income. Changes in the fair value of a
derivative that is highly effective and designated as a cash
flow hedge are recognized in other comprehensive income until
income from the cash flows of the hedged item is recognized. The
Company performs an assessment, both at the inception of the
hedge and on a quarterly basis thereafter, when required, to
determine whether these derivatives are highly effective in
offsetting changes in the value of the hedged items. Any change
in fair value resulting from hedge ineffectiveness is
immediately recorded in noninterest income.

68 U.S. Bancorp


If a derivative designated as a hedge is
terminated or ceases to be highly effective, the gain or loss is
amortized to earnings over the remaining life of the hedged
asset or liability (fair value hedge) or over the same period(s)
that the forecasted hedged transactions impact earnings (cash
flow hedge). If the hedged item is disposed of, or the
forecasted transaction is no longer probable, the derivative is
recorded at fair value with any resulting gain or loss included
in the gain or loss from the disposition of the hedged item or,
in the case of a forecasted transaction that is no longer
probable, included in earnings immediately.

OTHER SIGNIFICANT POLICIES

Intangible Assets

The price paid over the net fair value of the acquired
businesses (“goodwill”) is not amortized. Other
intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful
lives, using straight-line and accelerated methods. The
recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets is
evaluated annually, at a minimum, or on an interim basis if
events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to realize
the carrying amount. The evaluation includes assessing the
estimated fair value of the intangible asset based on market
prices for similar assets, where available, and the present
value of the estimated future cash flows associated with the
intangible asset.

Income Taxes

Deferred taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences on
future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and
liabilities and the financial reporting amounts at each year-end.

Mortgage Servicing
Rights

Mortgage servicing rights
(“MSRs”) are capitalized as separate intangible assets
when loans are sold and servicing is retained. The total cost of
loans sold is allocated between the loans sold and the servicing
assets retained based on their relative fair values. MSRs that
are purchased from others are initially recorded at cost. The
carrying value of the MSRs is amortized in proportion to, and
over the period of, estimated net servicing revenue and recorded
in noninterest expense as amortization of intangible assets. The
carrying value of these assets is periodically reviewed for
impairment using a lower of carrying value or fair value
methodology. For purposes of measuring impairment, the servicing
rights are stratified based on the underlying loan type and note
rate and the carrying value of each stratum is compared to fair
value based on a discounted cash flow analysis, utilizing
current prepayment speeds and discount rates. Events that may
significantly affect the estimates used are changes in interest
rates and the related impact on mortgage loan prepayment speed
and the payment performance of the underlying loans. If the
carrying value is greater than fair value, impairment is
recognized through a valuation allowance for each impaired
stratum and recorded as amortization of intangible assets. The
valuation allowance is adjusted each subsequent period to
reflect any increase or decrease in the indicated impairment.
The Company reviews mortgage servicing rights for
other-than-temporary impairment each quarter and recognizes a
direct write-down when the recoverability of a recorded
valuation allowance is determined to be remote. In determining
whether other-than-temporary impairment has taken place, the
Company considers both historical and projected trends in pay
off activity and the potential for impairment recovery. Unlike a
valuation allowance, a direct write-down permanently reduces the
carrying value of the mortgage servicing rights, precluding
subsequent reversals.

Pensions

For
purposes of its retirement plans, the Company utilizes a
measurement date of September 30. At the measurement date,
plan assets are determined based on fair value, generally
representing observable market prices. The actuarial cost method
used to compute the pension liabilities and related expense is
the projected unit credit method. In essence, the projected
benefit obligation is determined based on the present value of
projected benefit distributions at an assumed discount rate. The
discount rate utilized is based on match-funding maturities and
interest payments of high quality corporate bonds available in
the market place to projected cash flows as of the measurement
date for future benefit payments. Periodic pension expense (or
credits) includes service costs, interest costs based on the
assumed discount rate, the expected return on plan assets based
on an actuarially derived market-related value and amortization
of actuarial gains and losses. Pension accounting reflects the
long-term nature of benefit obligations and the investment
horizon of plan assets and can have the effect of reducing
earnings volatility related to short-term changes in interest
rates and market valuations. Actuarial gains and losses include
the impact of plan amendments and various unrecognized gains and
losses which are deferred and amortized over the future service
periods of active employees. The market-related value utilized
to determine the expected return on plan assets is based on fair
value adjusted for the difference between expected returns and
actual performance of plan assets. The unrealized difference
between actual experience and expected returns is included in
the market-related value ratably over a five-year period.

Premises and
Equipment

Premises and equipment are
stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and depreciated
primarily on a straight-line basis over the estimated life of
the assets. Estimated useful lives range up to 40 years for
newly constructed buildings and from 3 to 20 years for
furniture and equipment.

Capitalized leases, less accumulated
amortization, are included in premises and equipment. The lease
obligations

U.S. Bancorp  69


are included in long-term debt. Capitalized
leases are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lease
term and the amortization is included in depreciation expense.

Statement of Cash
Flows

For purposes of reporting cash
flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash and money market
investments, defined as interest-bearing amounts due from banks,
federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to
resell.

Stock-Based
Compensation

The Company grants stock
awards including restricted stock and options to purchase common
stock of the Company. Stock option grants are for a fixed number
of shares to employees and directors with an exercise price
equal to the fair value of the shares at the date of grant. The
Company recognizes stock-based compensation in its results of
operations utilizing the fair value method under Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard No. 123, “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation” (“SFAS 123”).
Stock-based compensation is recognized using an accelerated
method of amortization for awards with graded vesting features
and on a straight-line basis for awards with cliff vesting. The
amortization of stock-based compensation reflects estimated
forfeitures adjusted for actual forfeiture experience. As
compensation expense is recognized, a deferred tax is recorded
that represents an estimate of the future tax deduction from
exercise or release of restrictions. At the time stock options
are exercised, cancelled or expire, the Company may be required
to recognize an adjustment to tax expense.

Per Share
Calculations

Earnings per share is
calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings
per share is calculated by adjusting income and outstanding
shares, assuming conversion of all potentially dilutive
securities, using the treasury stock method. All per share
amounts have been restated for stock splits.

Note 2

Accounting Changes

Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments
with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity

In May 2003, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 150 (“SFAS 150”), “Accounting
for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both
Liabilities and Equity,” which establishes standards for
how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial
instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity.
The Company adopted SFAS 150 for financial instruments entered
into or modified after May 31, 2003, and adopted for all
other financial instruments as of July 1, 2003. The
adoption of SFAS 150 did not have a material impact on the
Company’s financial instruments.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

In April 2003, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 149 (“SFAS 149”),
“Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities,” which amends and clarifies accounting
and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including
certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and
for hedging activities under Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 133 (“SFAS 133”),
“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities.” In particular, SFAS 149 clarifies under what
circumstances a contract with an initial net investment meets
the characteristic of a derivative and clarifies when a
derivative contains a financing component. SFAS 149 is generally
effective for contracts entered into or modified after
June 30, 2003. The adoption of SFAS 149 did not have a
material impact on the Company’s financial statements.

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities

In January 2003, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation No. 46
(revised December 2003) (“FIN 46”),
“Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities”
(“VIEs”), an interpretation of Accounting Research
Bulletin No. 51, “Consolidated Financial
Statements,” to improve financial reporting of special
purpose and other entities. The interpretation requires the
consolidation of entities in which an enterprise absorbs a
majority of the entity’s expected losses, receives a
majority of the entity’s expected residual returns, or
both, as a result of ownership, contractual or other financial
interests in the entity. Prior to the issuance of FIN 46,
consolidation generally occurred when an enterprise controlled
another entity through voting interests. Certain VIEs that are
qualifying special purpose entities (“QSPEs”) subject
to the reporting requirements of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 140 (“SFAS 140”),
“Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets
and Extinguishment of Liabilities,” are not required to be
consolidated under the provisions of FIN 46. The consolidation
provisions of FIN 46 apply to VIEs created or entered into after
January 31, 2003. For VIEs created before February 1,
2003, the provisions of FIN 46 were effective for entities
commonly referred to as special purpose entities
(“SPEs”) for periods ending after December 15,
2003, and for all other types of entities was deferred to
periods ending after March 15, 2004.

The Company has relationships with several SPEs.
Because the Company’s investment securities conduit and the
asset-backed securitizations are QSPEs, which are exempt from
consolidation under the provisions of FIN 46, the Company does
not believe that FIN 46 requires the consolidation of the
conduit or securitizations in its financial statements. During
the third quarter of 2003, the

70 U.S. Bancorp


Company elected not to reissue more than
90 percent of the commercial paper funding of Stellar
Funding Group, Inc., the commercial loan conduit. This action
caused the conduit to lose its status as a qualifying special
purpose entity. As a result, the Company recorded all of
Stellar’s assets and liabilities at fair value and the
results of operations in the consolidated financial statements
of the Company. Given the floating rate nature and high credit
quality of the assets within the conduit, the net impact to the
Company’s financial statements was not significant. Prior
to December 31, 2003, the remaining commercial paper
borrowings held by third-party investors matured and the conduit
was legally dissolved.

With respect to other interests in entities
subject to FIN 46, including low-income housing investments, the
adoption of FIN 46 did not have a material impact on the
Company’s financial statements. The Company has determined
that the provisions of FIN 46 may require de-consolidation
of the subsidiary grantor trusts, which issue mandatorily
redeemable preferred securities (“Trust Preferred
Securities”). Currently, the Company consolidates the
grantor trusts and the balance sheet includes the mandatorily
redeemable preferred securities of the grantor trusts. In the
first quarter of 2004, the grantor trusts may be de-consolidated
and the junior subordinated debentures of the Company owned by
the grantor trusts would be recorded. The Trust Preferred
Securities currently qualify as Tier 1 capital of the
Company for regulatory capital purposes. The banking regulatory
agencies have issued guidance that would continue the current
regulatory capital treatment for Trust Preferred Securities
until further notice.

Stock-Based Compensation

In December 2002, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 148 (“SFAS 148”),
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation —
Transition and Disclosure,” an amendment of SFAS 123.
SFAS 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a
voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting
for stock-based employee compensation. In previous years, the
Company accounted for stock-based employee compensation under
the intrinsic based method and provided disclosure of the impact
of the fair value based method on reported income. For its 2003
financial statements, the Company elected to adopt the fair
value method using the retroactive restatement approach. All
prior periods presented have been restated to reflect the
compensation cost that would have been recognized had the
recognition provisions of SFAS 123 been applied to all awards
granted to employees after January 1, 1995 that remained
unvested at the beginning of the first period presented.

Guarantees

In
November 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
Interpretation No. 45 (“FIN 45”),
“Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements
for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of
Others,” to clarify accounting and disclosure requirements
relating to a guarantor’s issuance of certain types of
guarantees. FIN 45 requires entities to disclose additional
information about certain guarantees, or group of similar
guarantees, even if the likelihood of the guarantor’s
having to make any payments under the guarantee is remote. The
disclosure provisions are effective for interim and annual
financial statements for the first reporting period ending after
December 15, 2002. For certain guarantees, the
interpretation also requires that guarantors recognize a
liability equal to the fair value of the guarantee upon its
issuance. The Company adopted the initial recognition and
measurement provision effective January 1, 2003, which did
not have a material impact on the Company’s financial
statements.

Business Combinations and Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets

In June 2001, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 (“SFAS
141”), “Business Combinations,” and Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 (“SFAS
142”), “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.”
SFAS 141 mandates that the purchase method of accounting be used
for all business combinations initiated after June 30,
2001, and established specific criteria for the recognition of
intangible assets separately from goodwill. SFAS 142 addresses
the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to
their acquisition. The Company adopted SFAS 142 on
January 1, 2002. The most significant changes made by SFAS
142 are that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are
no longer amortized and are to be tested for impairment at least
annually. The amortization provisions of SFAS 142 apply to
goodwill and intangible assets acquired after June 30,
2001. With respect to goodwill and intangible assets acquired
prior to July 1, 2001, the amortization provisions of SFAS
142 were effective upon adoption of SFAS 142.

Applying the provisions of SFAS 141 to recent
acquisitions and the provisions of SFAS 142 to purchase
acquisitions completed prior to July 1, 2001, increased
after-tax income for the year ended December 31, 2002, by
$205.6 million, or $.11 per diluted share. During the first
quarter of 2002, the Company completed its initial impairment
test as required by SFAS 142. As a result of this initial
impairment test, the Company recognized an after-tax goodwill
impairment charge of $37.2 million as a “cumulative
effect of accounting change” in the income statement in the
first quarter of 2002. The impairment was primarily related to
the purchase of a transportation leasing

U.S. Bancorp  71


company in 1998 by the equipment leasing
business. Banking regulations exclude 100 percent of
goodwill from the determination of capital adequacy; therefore,
the impact of this impairment on the Company’s capital
adequacy was not significant.

Note 3

Business Combinations

On July 24, 2001, the Company acquired NOVA
Corporation (“NOVA”), a merchant processor, in a stock
and cash transaction valued at approximately $2.1 billion.
The transaction represented total assets acquired of
$2.9 billion and total liabilities assumed of
$773 million. Included in total assets were merchant
contracts and other intangibles of $650 million and the
excess of purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net
assets (“goodwill”) of $1.6 billion. The goodwill
reflected NOVA’s leadership position in the merchant
processing market and its ability to provide a technologically
superior product that is enhanced by a high level of customer
service. The Company believes that these factors, among others,
will allow NOVA to generate sufficient positive cash flows from
new business in future periods to support the goodwill recorded
in connection with the acquisition.

On December 31, 2002, the Company acquired
the corporate trust business of State Street Bank and Trust
Company (“State Street Corporate Trust”) in a cash
transaction valued at $725 million. State Street Corporate
Trust was a leading provider, particularly in the Northeast, of
corporate trust and agency services to a variety of
municipalities, corporations, government agencies and other
financial institutions serving approximately 20,000 client
issuances representing over $689 billion of assets under
administration. With this acquisition, the Company is among the
nation’s leading providers of a full range of corporate
trust products and services. The transaction represented total
assets acquired of $682 million and total liabilities
assumed of $39 million at the closing date. Included in
total assets were contract and other intangibles with a fair
value of $218 million and goodwill of $449 million.
The goodwill reflected the strategic value of the combined
organization’s leadership position in the corporate trust
business and processing economies of scale resulting from the
transaction. As part of the purchase price, $75 million was
placed in escrow for up to eighteen months with payment
contingent on the successful transition of business
relationships.

In addition to these mergers and business
acquisitions, the Company completed other strategic acquisitions
to enhance its presence in certain markets and businesses.

The following table summarizes acquisitions by
the Company completed since January 1, 2001, treating
Firstar Corporation as the original acquiring company:

Discontinued Operations

On February 19, 2003, the Company announced
that its Board of Directors approved a plan to effect a
distribution of its capital markets business unit, including the
investment banking and brokerage activities primarily conducted
by its wholly-owned subsidiary, Piper Jaffray Companies. On
December 31, 2003, the Company completed the distribution
of all the outstanding shares of common stock of Piper Jaffray
Companies to its shareholders. This non-cash distribution was
tax-free to the Company, its shareholders and Piper Jaffray
Companies.

In connection with the December 31, 2003
distribution, the results of Piper Jaffray Companies are
reported in the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Income
separately as discontinued operations.

The following table represents the condensed
results of operations for discontinued operations:

(a)

The $27.6 million of disposal costs
    related to discontinued operations primarily represents legal,
    investment banking and other costs directly related to the
    distribution.

The distribution was treated as a dividend to
shareholders for accounting purposes and, as such, reduced the
Company’s retained earnings by $685 million. At
December 31, 2003, the Consolidated Balance Sheet reflects
the non-cash dividend and corresponding reduction in assets and
liabilities at that date. In accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States, the
Consolidated Balance Sheet for 2002 has not been restated. A
summary of the assets and liabilities of the discontinued
operations is as follows:

(a)

Includes customer margin account receivables,
    due from brokers/ dealers and other assets.

(b)

Includes accrued expenses, due to brokers/
    dealers and other liabilities.

Following the distribution, the Company’s
wholly-owned subsidiary, USB Holdings, Inc. holds a
$180 million subordinated debt facility with Piper Jaffray
& Co., a broker-dealer subsidiary of Piper Jaffray
Companies. In addition, the Company provides an indemnification
in an amount up to $17.5 million with respect to certain
specified liabilities primarily resulting from third-party
claims relating to research analyst independence and from
certain regulatory investigations, as defined in the separation
and distribution agreement entered into with Piper Jaffray
Companies at the time of the distribution.

Merger and Restructuring-Related Items

The Company recorded pre-tax merger and
restructuring-related items of $46.2 million,
$321.2 million, and $1,364.8 million, in 2003, 2002,
and 2001, respectively. In 2003, merger-related items were
primarily incurred in connection with the NOVA acquisition and
the Company’s various other acquisitions including BayView
and State Street Corporate Trust. In 2002 and 2001,
merger-related items included costs associated with the
Firstar/USBM merger, NOVA and other smaller acquisitions noted
below and in Note 3 — Business Combinations.

U.S. Bancorp  73


The components of the merger and
restructuring-related items are shown below:

(a)

In 2003 and 2002, “Other” primarily
    included merger and restructuring-related items pertaining to
    the Bay View acquisition, State Street Corporate Trust and the
    Lyon Financial acquisition. In 2001, “Other” primarily
    included the 1999 merger of Firstar and Mercantile
    Bancorporation, Inc. and the 1998 acquisition of the former
    Firstar Corporation by Star Banc. Star Banc was renamed Firstar
    Corporation.

The Company determines merger and
restructuring-related items and related accruals based on its
integration strategy and formulated plans. These plans are
established as of the acquisition date and are regularly
evaluated during the integration process.

Severance and employee-related charges include
the cost of severance, other benefits and outplacement costs
associated with the termination of employees primarily in branch
offices and centralized corporate support and data processing
functions. The severance amounts are determined based on the
Company’s existing severance pay programs and are paid out
over a benefit period of up to two years from the time of
termination. The total number of employees included in severance
amounts were approximately 2,860 for USBM, and 400 for NOVA. In
2002, the Company recognized additional severance costs of
$13.1 million in connection with the USBM merger offset by
net curtailment and settlement gains of $9.0 million
related to changes in certain non-qualified pension plans.
Changes in severance costs for USBM and NOVA primarily reflected
a change in estimate in the liability given the mix of employees
terminated. Severance and employee-related costs for identified
groups of acquired employees are included in the determination
of goodwill at closing. Severance and employee-related costs are
recorded as incurred for groups of employees not specifically
identified

74 U.S. Bancorp


at the time of closing or acquired in business
combinations accounted for as “poolings.” In 2001, the
company also recognized $190.5 million of stock-based
compensation expense as a result of the accelerated vesting of
certain stock options and restricted stock due to the change of
control triggered by the USBM merger.

Systems conversions and integration costs are
recorded as incurred and are associated with the preparation and
mailing of numerous customer communications for the acquisitions
and conversion of customer accounts, printing and distribution
of training materials and policy and procedure manuals, outside
consulting fees, and other expenses related to systems
conversions and the integration of acquired branches and
operations.

Asset write-downs and lease terminations
represent lease termination costs and impairment of assets for
redundant office space, branches that will be vacated and
equipment disposed of as part of the integration plan. These
costs are recognized in the accounting period that contract
terminations occur or the asset becomes impaired and is
abandoned. In 2002, this category included $38.2 million of
signage write-offs, $26.9 million of software and equipment
write-offs, $32.0 million of lease and contract
cancellations and $6.9 million of leasehold and other
related items associated with the Firstar/ USBM merger. In 2001,
asset write-downs and lease terminations included
$45.7 million of lease and contract cancellation costs,
$36.2 million of software and equipment write-offs and
$48.5 million of other assets deemed to be worthless due to
integration decisions in connection with the merger.

In connection with certain mergers, the Company
has made charitable contributions to reaffirm a commitment to
its markets or as part of specific conditions necessary to
achieve regulatory approval. These contributions were funded up
front and represent costs that would not have been incurred had
the merger not occurred. Charitable contributions are charged to
merger and restructuring expenses or considered in determining
the acquisition cost at the applicable closing date.

Balance sheet restructurings primarily represent
gains or losses incurred by the Company related to the disposal
of certain businesses, products, or customer and business
relationships that no longer align with the long-term strategy
of the Company. It may also include charges to realign risk
management practices related to certain credit portfolios.
During 2002, the Company recognized asset gains related to the
sale of a non-strategic investment in a sub-prime lending
business of $28.7 million and a mark-to-market recovery of
$10.1 million associated with the liquidation of U.S.
Bancorp Libra’s investment portfolio. During 2001, balance
sheet restructuring costs incurred in connection with the
Firstar/ USBM merger of $457.6 million were comprised of a
$201.3 million provision associated with the Company’s
integration of certain small business products and
management’s decision to discontinue an unsecured small
business product of USBM; $90.0 million of charge-offs to align
risk management practices, align charge-off policies and to
expedite the Company’s transition out of a specific segment
of the healthcare industry; and $76.6 million of losses
related to the sales of two higher credit risk retail loan
portfolios of USBM. Also, the amount included $89.7 million
related to the Company’s decision to discontinue a
high-yield investment banking business, to restructure a
co-branding credit card relationship of USBM, and for the
planned disposition of certain equity investments that no longer
aligned with the long-term strategy of the Company. The
alignment of risk management practices included a write-down of
several large commercial loans originally held separately by
both Firstar and USBM, primarily to allow the Company to exit or
reduce these credits to conform with the credit risk exposure
policy of the combined entity.

Other merger-related items in 2002 of
$7.2 million primarily represented changes to conform
accounting policies implemented at the time of systems
conversions related to the Firstar/ USBM merger and other
acquired entities. In 2001, other merger-related charges of
$98.1 million primarily included $69.1 million and
$24.2 million of investment banking fees, legal fees and
stock registration fees associated with the Firstar/ USBM merger
and the acquisition of NOVA, respectively and $4.8 million
of other costs.

U.S. Bancorp  75


The following table presents a summary of
activity with respect to the merger and restructuring-related
accruals:

(a)

In 2003 and 2002, “Other” primarily
    included merger and restructuring-related items pertaining to
    the Bay View acquisition, State Street Corporate Trust and the
    Lyon Financial acquisition. In 2001, “Other” primarily
    included the 1999 merger of Firstar and Mercantile
    Bancorporation, Inc. and the 1998 acquisition of the former
    Firstar Corporation by Star Banc. Star Banc was renamed Firstar
    Corporation.

The adequacy of the accrued liabilities is
reviewed regularly taking into consideration actual and
projected payments. Adjustments are made to increase or decrease
these accruals as needed. Reversals of expenses can reflect a
lower utilization of benefits by affected staff, changes in
initial assumptions as a result of subsequent mergers and
alterations of business plans.

The components of the merger and
restructuring-related accruals for all acquisitions were as
follows:

The merger and restructuring-related accruals by
significant acquisition or business restructuring was as follows:

At December 31, 2002, the integration of
Firstar and USBM was completed, and no additional merger and
restructuring related charges occurred in 2003. The only
activity in the USBM accrual during 2003 was related to
severance costs that continue to be paid through the period
provided for in the Company’s severance plans. In 2003, the
integration of merchant processing platforms and business
processes of U.S. Bank National Association and NOVA, as well as
systems conversions for the acquisitions of the State Street
Corporate Trust business and Bay View were completed. The
Company does not anticipate any merger or restructuring-related
expenses in 2004 related to completed acquisitions.

Restrictions on Cash and Due from Banks

Bank subsidiaries are required to maintain
minimum average reserve balances with the Federal Reserve Bank.
The amount of those reserve balances was approximately
$243 million at December 31, 2003.

Note 7

Investment Securities

The detail of the amortized cost, gross
unrealized holding gains and losses, and fair value of
held-to-maturity and available-for-sale securities at
December 31 was as follows:

(a)

Held-to-maturity securities are carried at
    historical cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and
    accretion of discounts.

(b)

Available-for-sale securities are carried at
    fair value with unrealized net gains or losses reported within
    other comprehensive income in shareholders’
    equity.

The fair value of available-for-sale investments
shown above includes investments totaling $266.1 million
with unrealized losses of $19.8 million which have been in
an unrealized loss position for greater than 12 months. The
investments primarily represent 43 trust preferred securities
from 13 bank issuers. All principal and interest payments are
expected to be collected given the high credit quality of the
bank holding company issuers and the Company’s ability and
intent to hold the investments until such time as the value
recovers or maturity. All other available-for-sale investments
with unrealized losses have an aggregate fair value of
$27.3 billion and have been in an unrealized loss position
for less than 12 months and primarily represent fixed-rate
investments with temporary impairment resulting from increases
in interest rates since the purchase of the investments. The
Company has the ability to hold these investments until such
time as the value recovers or maturity.

Securities carried at $31.0 billion at
December 31, 2003, and $20.2 billion at
December 31, 2002, were pledged to secure public, private
and trust deposits and for other purposes required by law.
Securities sold under agreements to repurchase were
collateralized by securities and securities purchased under
agreements to resell with an amortized cost of $3.6 billion
and $2.9 billion at December 31, 2003, and 2002,
respectively.

The following table provides information as to
the amount of gross gains and losses realized through the sales
of available-for-sale investment securities.

Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses

The composition of the loan portfolio at
December 31 was as follows:

Loans are presented net of unearned interest and
deferred fees and costs, which amounted to $1.5 billion and
$1.8 billion at December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. The Company had loans of $28.7 billion at
December 31, 2003, and $26.1 billion at
December 31, 2002, pledged at the Federal Home Loan Bank.
Loans of $12.1 billion at December 31, 2003, and
$12.7 billion at December 31, 2002, were pledged at
the Federal Reserve Bank.

The Company primarily lends to borrowers in the
24 states in which it has banking offices. Collateral for
commercial loans may include marketable securities, accounts
receivable, inventory and equipment. For details of the
Company’s commercial portfolio by industry group and
geography as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, see
Table 7 included in Management’s Discussion and
Analysis which is incorporated by reference into these Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

estate portfolio by property type and geography as of
December 31, 2003 and 2002, see Table 9 included in
Management’s Discussion and Analysis which is incorporated
by reference into these Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements. Such loans are collateralized by the related
property.

Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans,
restructured loans not performing in accordance with modified
terms, other real estate and other nonperforming assets owned by
the Company. For details of the Company’s nonperforming
assets as of December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, see Table 12
included in Management’s Discussion and Analysis which is
incorporated by reference into these Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

The following table lists information related to
nonperforming loans as of December 31:

Activity in the allowance for credit losses was
as follows:

(a)

In 2001, $382.2 million of the provision
    for credit losses was incurred in connection with the
    Firstar/USBM merger.

A portion of the allowance for credit losses is
allocated to loans deemed impaired. All impaired loans are
included in non-performing assets. A summary of these loans and
their related allowance for loan losses is as follows:

Commitments to lend additional funds to customers
whose loans were classified as nonaccrual or restructured at
December 31, 2003, totaled $107.9 million. During 2003
there were $18.0 million of loans that were restructured at
market interest rates and returned to an accruing status.

The allowance for credit losses includes credit
loss liability related to off-balance sheet loan commitments. At
December 31, 2003, the allowance for credit losses includes
an estimated $133.6 million credit loss liability related
to the Company’s $58.3 billion of commercial
off-balance sheet loan commitments and letters of credit.

Note 9

Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and
    Extinguishments of Liabilities

FINANCIAL ASSET SALES

When the Company sells financial assets, it may
retain interest-only strips, servicing rights, residual rights
to a cash reserve account, and/or other retained interests in
the sold financial assets. The gain or loss on sale depends in
part on the previous carrying amount of the financial assets
involved in the transfer and is allocated between the assets
sold and the retained interests based on their relative fair
values at the date of transfer. Quoted market prices are used to
determine retained interest fair values when readily available.
Since quotes are generally not available for retained interests,
the Company estimates fair value based on the present value of
future expected cash flows using management’s best
estimates of the key assumptions including credit losses,
prepayment speeds, forward yield curves, and discount rates
commensurate with the risks involved. Retained interests and
liabilities are recorded at fair value using a discounted cash
flow methodology at inception and are evaluated at least
quarterly thereafter.

Conduits and Securitization

The Company sponsors an off-balance
sheet conduit to which it transferred high-grade investment
securities, funded by the issuance of commercial paper. The
conduit, a qualifying special purpose entity, held assets of
$7.3 billion at December 31, 2003, and
$9.5 billion in assets at December 31, 2002. These
investment securities include primarily (i) private label
asset-backed securities, which are insurance “wrapped”
by AAA/Aaa-rated monoline insurance companies and
(ii) government agency mortgage-backed securities and
collateralized mortgage obligations. The conduit had commercial
paper liabilities of $7.3 billion at December 31,
2003, and $9.5 billion at December 31, 2002. The
Company benefits by transferring the investment securities into
a conduit that provides diversification of funding sources in a
capital-efficient manner and the generation of income.

U.S. Bancorp  79


The Company provides a liquidity facility to the
conduit. Utilization of the liquidity facility would be
triggered by the conduit’s inability to issue commercial
paper to fund its assets. The recorded fair value of the
Company’s liability for the liquidity facility included in
other liabilities was $47.3 million at December 31,
2003, and $37.7 million at December 31, 2002. Changes
in fair value of these liabilities are recorded in the income
statement as other noninterest income or expense. In addition,
the Company recorded at fair value its retained residual
interest in the investment securities conduit of
$89.5 million at December 31, 2003, and
$93.4 million at December 31, 2002. The Company
recorded $30.5 million from the conduit during 2003 and
$63.0 million during 2002 in other noninterest income, for
revenues related to the conduit including fees for servicing,
management, administration and accretion income from retained
interests.

The Company also has an asset-backed
securitization to fund an unsecured small business credit
product. The unsecured small business credit securitization
trust held assets of $497.5 million at December 31,
2003, of which the Company retained $112.4 million of
subordinated securities, transferor’s interest of
$12.4 million and a residual interest-only strip of
$34.4 million. This compared with $652.4 million in
assets at December 31, 2002, of which the Company retained
$150.1 million of subordinated securities,
transferor’s interest of $16.3 million and a residual
interest-only strip of $53.3 million. The qualifying
special purpose entity issued asset-backed variable funding
notes in various tranches. The Company provides credit
enhancement in the form of subordinated securities and reserve
accounts. The Company’s risk, primarily from losses in the
underlying assets, was considered in determining the fair value
of the Company’s retained interests in this securitization.
The Company recognized income from subordinated securities, an
interest-only strip and servicing fees from this securitization
of $29.8 million during 2003 and $52.8 million during
2002. The unsecured small business credit securitization held
average assets of $571.4 million in 2003, and
$700.6 million in 2002.

During 2003, the Company undertook several
actions with respect to off-balance sheet structures. In January
2003, the Company exercised a cleanup call option on an indirect
automobile loan securitization, with the remaining assets from
the securitization recorded on the Company’s balance sheet
at fair value. The indirect automobile securitization held
$156.1 million in assets at December 31, 2002. During
the third quarter of 2003, the Company elected not to reissue
more than 90 percent of the commercial paper funding of
Stellar Funding Group, Inc., the commercial loan conduit. This
action caused the conduit to lose its status as a qualifying
special purpose entity. As a result, the Company recorded all of
Stellar’s assets and liabilities at fair value and the
results of operations in the consolidated financial statements
of the Company. Given the floating rate nature and high credit
quality of the assets within the conduit, the impact to the
Company’s financial statements was not significant. In the
third quarter of 2003, average commercial loan balances
increased by approximately $2 billion and the resulting
increase in net interest income was offset by a similar decline
in conduit fee income within commercial products revenue. Prior
to December 31, 2003, the remaining commercial paper
borrowings held by third-party investors matured and the conduit
was legally dissolved.

Sensitivity Analysis

At December 31, 2003, key
economic assumptions and the sensitivity of the current fair
value of residual cash flows to immediate 10 percent and
20 percent adverse changes in those assumptions were as
follows:

(a)

For the small business receivables a monthly
    principal payment rate assumption is used to value the residual
    interests.

(b)

Credit losses are zero for the investment
    securities conduit as the investments are all AAA/Aaa rated or
    insured investments.

(c)

For the small business receivables interest
    income is based on Prime + contractual spread.

(d)

The investment securities conduit is mostly
    match funded. Therefore, interest rate movements create no
    material impact to the value of the residual interest.

80 U.S. Bancorp


These sensitivities are hypothetical and should
be used with caution. As the figures indicate, changes in fair
value based on a 10 percent variation in assumptions
generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the
change in the assumptions to the change in fair value may not be
linear. Also, in this table the effect of a variation in a
particular assumption on the fair value of the retained interest
is calculated without changing any other assumptions; in
reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another
(for example, increases in market interest rates may result in
lower prepayments and increased credit losses), which might
magnify or counteract the sensitivities.

Cash Flow Information

The table below summarizes certain
cash flows received from and paid to conduits or structured
entities for the asset sales described above:

(a)

The small business credit securitizations are
    revolving transactions where proceeds are reinvested until their
    legal terminations.

Other Information

Quantitative information related to
managed assets and loan securitizations was as follows:

Mortgage Servicing Rights

The Company’s portfolio of residential
mortgages serviced for others was $53.9 billion,
$43.1 billion and $22.0 billion at December 31, 2003,
2002, and 2001 respectively.

The net carrying value of capitalized mortgage
servicing rights was as follows:

Changes in capitalized mortgage servicing rights
are summarized as follows:

The key economic assumptions used to estimate the
value of the mortgage servicing rights portfolio were as follows:

The estimated sensitivity of the fair value of
the mortgage servicing rights portfolio to changes in interest
rates at December 31, 2003, was as follows:

The Company utilizes the investment securities
portfolio as an economic hedge against possible adverse interest
rate changes. The Company also, from time to time, purchases
principal-only securities that act as a partial economic hedge.
The Company is able to recognize reparations from increases in
fair value of servicing rights when impairment reserves are
released.

The fair value of mortgage servicing rights and
its sensitivity to changes in interest rates is influenced by
the mix of the servicing portfolio and characteristics of each
segment of the portfolio. In the current interest rate
environment, mortgage loans originated as part of government
agency and state loan programs tend to experience slower
prepayment speeds and better cash flows than conventional
mortgage loans. The Company’s servicing portfolio consists
of the distinct portfolios of The Leader Mortgage Company, LLC
(a wholly-owned subsidiary) and U.S. Bank Home Mortgage.

82 U.S. Bancorp


A summary of the Company’s mortgage
servicing rights and related characteristics by portfolio as of
December 31, 2003, is as follows:

The Leader Mortgage Company, LLC specializes in
servicing loans made under state and local housing authority
programs. These programs provide mortgages to low and moderate
income borrowers and are generally under government insured
programs with down payment or closing cost assistance. As a
result of the slower prepayment characteristics of the state and
local loan programs, the Leader portfolio has a longer expected
life relative to other servicing portfolios.

The U.S. Bank Home Mortgage servicing
portfolio is predominantly comprised of fixed-rate agency loans
(FNMA, FHLMC, GNMA, FHLB and various housing agencies) with
limited adjustable-rate or jumbo mortgage loans.

Note 12

Intangible Assets

The Company adopted SFAS 142 on
January 1, 2002. The most significant changes made by
SFAS 142 are that goodwill and other indefinite lived
intangible assets are no longer amortized and will be tested for
impairment at least annually. The amortization provisions of
SFAS 142 apply to goodwill and intangible assets acquired
after June 30, 2001. With respect to goodwill and
intangible assets acquired prior to July 1, 2001, the
amortization provisions of SFAS 142 were effective upon
adoption of SFAS 142.

Prior to the adoption of SFAS 142, the Company
evaluated goodwill for impairment under a projected undiscounted
cash flow model. As a result of the initial impairment test from
the adoption of SFAS 142, the Company recognized an
impairment loss of $58.8 million resulting in an after-tax
loss of $37.2 million in the first quarter of 2002. The
impairment was primarily related to the purchase of a
transportation leasing company in 1998 by the equipment leasing
business. This charge was recognized as a “cumulative
effect of accounting change” in the income statement. The
fair value of that reporting unit was estimated using the
present value of future expected cash flows.

Net income and earnings per share adjusted for
the exclusion of amortization expense (net of tax) and asset
impairments related to goodwill are as follows:

The following table reflects the changes in the
carrying value of goodwill for the years ended December 31,
2002 and 2003:

Estimated life represents the amortization
    period for assets subject to the straight line method and the

following:

In April 2003, the Company’s subsidiary
U.S. Bank National Association issued $500 million of
fixed-rate subordinated notes due April 15, 2015. The
interest rate is 4.80 percent per annum.

Medium-term notes (“MTNs”) outstanding
at December 31, 2003, mature from May 2004 through March
2008. The MTNs bear fixed or floating interest rates ranging

Company-obligated Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Securities of
    Subsidiary Trusts Holding Solely the Junior Subordinated
    Debentures of the Parent Company

The Company has issued $2.6 billion of
company-obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of
subsidiary trusts holding solely the junior subordinated
debentures of the parent company (“Trust Preferred
Securities”) through eight separate issuances by eight
wholly-owned subsidiary grantor trusts (“Trusts”). The
Trust Preferred Securities accrue and pay distributions
periodically at specified rates as provided in the indentures.
The Trusts used the net proceeds from the offerings to purchase
a like amount of junior subordinated deferrable interest
debentures (the “Debentures”) of the Company. The
Debentures are the sole assets of the Trusts and are eliminated,
along with the related income statement effects, in the
consolidated financial statements.

The Company’s obligations under the
Debentures and related documents, taken together, constitute a
full and unconditional guarantee by the Company of the
obligations of the Trusts. The guarantee covers the
distributions and payments on liquidation or redemption of the
Trust Preferred Securities, but only to the extent of funds held
by the Trusts.

The Trust Preferred Securities are mandatorily
redeemable upon the maturity of the Debentures, or upon earlier
redemption as provided in the indentures. The Company has the
right to redeem retail Debentures in whole or in part, as well
as on or after specific dates, at a redemption price specified
in the indentures plus any accrued but unpaid interest to the
redemption date. The Company has the right to redeem
institutional Debentures in whole, (but not in part), on or
after specific dates, at a redemption price specified in the
indentures plus any accrued but unpaid interest to the
redemption date. The Trust Preferred Securities are redeemable
in whole or in part in 2006 and 2007 in the amounts of
$2.3 billion and $300 million, respectively.

The Trust Preferred Securities qualify as
Tier I capital of the Company for regulatory capital
purposes. The Company used the proceeds from the sales of the
Debentures for general corporate purposes.

Shareholders’ Equity

At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company
had authority to issue 4 billion shares of common stock and
10 million shares of preferred stock. The Company had
1,922.9 million and 1,917.0 million shares of common
stock outstanding at December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. At December 31, 2003, the Company had
208.0 million shares of common stock reserved for future
issuances, primarily under stock option plans.

The Company has a preferred share purchase rights
plan intended to preserve the long-term value of the Company by
discouraging a hostile takeover of the Company. Under the plan,
each share of common stock carries a right to purchase one
one-thousandth of a share of preferred stock. The rights become
exercisable in certain limited circumstances involving a
potential business combination transaction or an acquisition of
shares of the Company and are exercisable at a price of $100 per
right, subject to adjustment. Following certain other events,
each right entitles its holder to purchase for $100 an amount of
common stock of the Company, or, in certain circumstances,
securities of the acquirer, having a then-current market value
of twice the exercise price of the right. The dilutive effect of
the rights on the acquiring company is intended to encourage it
to negotiate with the Company’s Board of Directors prior to
attempting a takeover. If the Board of Directors believes a
proposed acquisition is in the best interests of the Company and
its shareholders, the Board may amend the plan or redeem the
rights for a nominal amount in order to permit the acquisition
to be completed without interference from the plan. Until a
right is exercised, the holder of a right has no rights as a
shareholder of the Company. The rights expire on
February 27, 2011.

On July 17, 2001, the Company’s Board
of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to
56.4 million shares of the Company’s common stock to
replace shares issued in connection with the acquisition of
NOVA. During the first quarter of 2002, the Company effectively
completed the July 17, 2001 authorization. On
December 18, 2001, the Board of Directors approved an
authorization to repurchase an additional 100 million
shares of outstanding common stock throughout 2003. On
December 16, 2003, the Board of Directors approved an
authorization to repurchase an additional 150 million
shares of outstanding common stock during the following 24
months. This repurchase program replaced the Company’s
December 18, 2001 program.

The following table summarizes the Company’s
common stock repurchased in each of the last three years:

Employee Benefits

Employee Investment Plan

The Company has defined contribution
retirement savings plans which allow qualified employees, at
their option, to make contributions up to certain percentages of
pre-tax base salary through salary deductions under
Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Employee
contributions are invested, at the employees’ direction,
among a variety of investment alternatives. Employee
contributions are 100 percent matched by the Company, up to
the first four percent of an employee’s compensation. The
Company’s matching contribution vests immediately; however,
a participant must be employed on December 31st to receive
that year’s matching contribution. Although the matching
contribution is initially invested in the Company’s common
stock, an employee can reinvest the matching contributions among
various investment alternatives. Total expense was
$48.5 million, $50.5 million and $43.7 million in
2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Pension Plans

Pension benefits are provided to
substantially all employees based on years of service and
employees’ compensation while employed with the Company.
Employees are fully vested after five years of service. Prior to
their acquisition dates, employees of certain acquired companies
were covered by separate, noncontributory pension plans that
provided benefits based on years of service and compensation.
Generally, the Company merges plans of acquired companies into
its existing pension plans when it becomes practicable.

As of January 1, 2002, the Company’s
two existing pension plans were merged under a new final
average-pay benefit structure. During 2001, the Company had
maintained two different qualified pension plans, with three
different pension benefit structures: the former USBM’s
cash balance pension benefit structure, a final average pay
benefit structure for the former Firstar organization, and a
cash balance pension benefit structure related to the Mercantile
acquisition. The benefit structure of the new combined plan did
not become effective for the Mercantile acquisition until
January 1, 2003. Under the new plan’s benefit
structure, a participant’s future retirement benefits are
based on a participant’s highest five year average annual
compensation during his or her last 10 years before
retirement or termination from the Company. Generally, under the
two previous cash balance pension benefit structures, the
participant’s earned retirement benefits based on their
average compensation over their career. Retirement benefits
under the former Firstar benefit structure were earned based on
final average pay and years of service, similar to the new plan.
Plan assets primarily consist of various equity mutual funds and
other miscellaneous assets.

During 2001, the Company also maintained several
unfunded, non-qualified, supplemental executive retirement
programs that provided additional defined pension benefits for
senior managers and executive employees. As of
September 30, 2001, a supplemental executive retirement
plan of USBM was frozen for substantially all participants but
with service credit running through December 31, 2001.
Effective January 1, 2002, substantially all of these
programs were merged into one non-qualified retirement plan.
Because all the non-qualified plans were unfunded, the aggregate
accumulated benefit obligations exceeded the assets. The
assumptions used in computing the present value of the
accumulated benefit obligation, the projected benefit obligation
and net pension expense are substantially consistent with those
assumptions used for the funded qualified plans. The Company
recognized a settlement loss of $3.5 million on this plan
in 2003, related to the level of payouts made from the plan. In
2002, the Company recognized combined curtailment and settlement
gains of $11.7 million related to changes in the
non-qualified pension plans in connection with the mergers of
the prior plans.

In general, the Company’s pension plan
objectives include maintaining a funded status sufficient to
meet participant benefit obligations over time while reducing
long-term funding requirements and pension costs. The Company
has an established process for evaluating all the plans, their
performance and significant plan assumptions, including the
assumed discount rate and the long-term rate of return
(“LTROR”). At least annually, an independent
consultant is engaged to assist U.S. Bancorp’s Compensation
Committee in evaluating plan objectives, funding policies and
plan investment policies considering its long-term investment
time horizon and asset allocation strategies. The process also
evaluates significant plan assumptions. Although plan
assumptions are established annually, the Company may update its
analysis on an interim basis in order to be responsive to
significant events that occur during the year, such as plan
mergers and amendments.

Funding Practices

The Company’s funding policy
is to contribute amounts to its plans sufficient to meet the
minimum funding requirements of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, plus such additional amounts as the
Company determines to be appropriate. During 2003 and 2002, the
Company made contributions of $310.8 million and
$150.0 million, respectively, to the qualified pension plan
in accordance with this policy. In 2004, the Company anticipates
no minimum funding requirement and therefore does not expect to
make any contributions to the plan. Contributions made to the
plan were invested in accordance with established investment
policies and asset allocation strategies.

Investment Policies and Asset Allocation

In establishing its investment
policies and asset allocation strategies, the Company considers
expected returns and the volatility associated with different
strategies. The independent consultant performs modeling that
projects numerous outcomes using a broad range of possible
scenarios, including a mix of possible rates of inflation and
economic growth. Some of the scenarios included are: low
inflation and high growth (ideal growth), low inflation and low
growth (recession), high inflation and low growth
(stagflation) and high inflation and high growth
(inflationary growth). Starting with current economic
information, the model bases its projections on past
relationships between inflation, fixed income rates and equity
returns when these types of economic conditions have existed
over the previous 30 years, both in the U.S. and in foreign
countries.

Based on an analysis of historical performance by
asset class, over any 20-year period since the mid-1940’s,
investments in equities have outperformed other investment
classes but are subject to higher volatility. While an asset
allocation including bonds and other assets generally has lower
volatility and may provide protection in a declining interest
rate environment, it limits the pension plan’s long-term
up-side potential. Given the pension plan’s investment
horizon and the financial viability of the Company to meet its
funding objectives, the Committee has determined that an asset
allocation strategy investing in 100% equities diversified among
various domestic equity categories and international equities is
appropriate.

The following unaudited table provides a summary
of asset allocations adopted by the Company compared with a
typical asset allocation alternative:

(a)

The target asset allocation was modified in
    December 2003, effective January 1, 2004, to reduce the
    potential volatility of the portfolio without significantly
    reducing the expected returns. The change in the allocation is
    not expected to be completed until the second quarter of 2004
    and variations from the target allocation are a result of the
    recent change.

(b)

The LTROR assumed for the target asset
    allocation strategy of 8.9 percent is based on a range of
    estimates evaluated by the Company including the compound
    expected return of 8.7 percent and the average expected
    return of 10.2 percent.

(c)

The Sharpe ratio is a direct measure of
    reward-to-risk. The Sharpe ratio for these asset allocation
    strategies is considered to be within acceptable
    parameters.

In accordance with its existing practices, the
independent pension consultant utilized by the Company updated
the analysis of expected rates of return and evaluated peer
group data, market conditions and other factors relevant to
determining the LTROR assumptions for pension costs for 2003 and
2004. The analysis performed late in 2002 indicated that there
had been a continued deterioration in market performance of
equities and as a result of that independent analysis, the
Company made a decision to reduce the LTROR assumption from
9.9 percent used in the second half of 2002, to
8.9 percent for 2003. The analysis performed late in 2003
indicated a stabilization of market performance with the
potential for better performance in 2004. As a result, the
Company expects to continue to use an LTROR of 8.9 percent
in 2004. Regardless of the extent of the Company’s analysis
of alternative asset allocation strategies, economic scenarios
and possible outcomes, plan assumptions developed for the LTROR
are subject to imprecision and changes in economic factors. As a
result of the modeling imprecision and uncertainty, the Company
considers a range of potential expected rates of return,
economic conditions for several scenarios, historical
performance relative to assumed rates of return and asset
allocation and LTROR information for a peer group in
establishing its assumptions.

U.S. Bancorp  91


Post-Retirement Medical Plans

In addition to providing pension
benefits, the Company provides health care and death benefits to
certain retired employees through several retiree medical
programs. As a result of the Firstar/ USBM merger, there were
three major retiree medical programs in place during 2001 with
various terms and subsidy schedules. Effective January 1,
2002, the Company adopted one retiree medical program for all
future retirees. For certain eligible employees, the provisions
of the USBM retiree medical plan and the Mercantile retiree
medical plan remained in place until December 31, 2002.
Generally, all employees may become eligible for retiree health
care benefits by meeting defined age and service requirements.
The Company may also subsidize the cost of coverage for
employees meeting certain age and service requirements. The
medical plan contains other cost-sharing features such as
deductibles and coinsurance. The estimated cost of these retiree
benefit payments is accrued during the employees’ active
service.

The following table summarizes benefit obligation
and plan asset activity for the retirement plans:

(a)

At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the
    accumulated benefit obligation for all qualified pension plans
    was $1.6 billion and $1.4 billion,
    respectively.

(b)

U.S. Bancorp retained the qualified pension
    plan obligation for the inactive participants, relating to
    employees of Piper Jaffray Companies. Therefore, all liabilities
    and plan assets related to inactive participants in the
    qualified pension plan associated with the Piper Jaffray
    Companies are included in the pension plans benefit
    obligation.

(c)

At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the
    Company’s qualified pension plans held 799,803 shares
    of U.S. Bancorp common stock, with a fair value of
    $23.8 million and $17.0 million, respectively.
    Dividends paid on the shares of U.S. Bancorp common stock
    held by the qualified pension plans totaled $.6 million for
    each of the years ended December 31, 2003 and
    2002.

The following table sets forth the components of

The following table sets forth the
weighted-average plan assumptions and other data:

(a)

In connection with the Firstar/ USBM merger,
    the asset management practices and investment strategies of the
    plan were conformed. At December 31, 2001, the investment
    asset allocation was weighted toward equities and diversified by
    industry and companies with varying market capitalization
    levels.

(b)

In light of the market performance and the
    results of the independent analysis, the Company made a decision
    to re-measure its pension plans effective in the third quarter
    of 2002 based on the current information at that time with
    respect to asset values, a reduction in the LTROR, discount
    rates, census data and other relevant factors. As a result of
    the remeasurement, the LTROR was reduced to 9.9% for the last
    half of 2002.

(c)

The discount rate at the measurement date
    approximated the Moody’s Aa corporate bond rating for
    projected benefit distributions with a duration of 12.2 and
    11.6 years for 2003 and 2002, respectively.

(d)

The pre-65 and post-65 rates are assumed to
    decrease gradually to 5.5% and 6.0% respectively by 2011 and
    remain at these levels thereafter.

Note 19

Stock-based Compensation

As part of its employee and director compensation
programs, the Company may grant certain stock awards under the
provisions of the existing stock compensation plans, including
plans assumed in acquisitions. The plans provide for grants of
options to purchase shares of common stock at a fixed price
generally equal to the fair value of the underlying stock at the
date of grant. Option grants are generally exercisable up to
ten years from the date of grant. In addition, the plans
provide for grants of shares of common stock or stock units that
are subject to restriction on transfer. Most stock awards vest
over three to five years and are subject to forfeiture if
certain vesting requirements are not met.

Stock incentive plans of acquired companies are
generally terminated at the merger closing dates. Option holders
under such plans receive the Company’s common stock, or
options to buy the Company’s stock, based on the conversion
terms of the various merger agreements. The historical stock
award information presented below reflects awards originally
granted under acquired companies’ plans.

At December 31, 2003, there were
41.8 million shares (subject to adjustment for forfeitures)
available for grant under our current stock incentive plan.

The following is a summary of shares issuable
under stock options outstanding and exercised under various
stock option plans of the Company:

(a)

The number of shares subject to
    then-outstanding stock options have been multiplied by, and the
    exercise prices have been divided by, a factor of 1.0068 in
    order to maintain the economic value of the options following
    the spin off of Piper Jaffray Companies.

Additional information regarding stock options
outstanding as of December 31, 2003, is as follows:

94 U.S. Bancorp


Stock-based compensation expense was
$158.1 million in 2003, compared with $185.0 million
and $168.7 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. In 2001,
the Company also recognized $190.5 million of stock-based
compensation expense as part of its merger and
restructuring-related charges as a result of accelerated vesting
of certain stock options and restricted stock due to
change-in-control provisions triggered by the Firstar/ USBM
merger. At the time employee stock options expire or are
exercised or cancelled, the Company determines the tax benefit
associated with the stock award and under certain circumstances
may be required to recognize an adjustment to tax expense. On an
after-tax basis, the financial impact of stock-based
compensation expense was $123.4 million in 2003, compared
with $113.3 million and $106.9 million in 2002 and
2001, respectively.

Stock-based compensation expense is based on the
fair value of the award at the date of grant or modification.
The fair value of options was estimated using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model requiring the use of subjective valuation
assumptions. Because employee stock options have characteristics
that differ from those of traded options, including vesting
provisions and trading limitations that impact their liquidity,
the determined value used to measure compensation expense may
vary from their actual fair value.

The following table provides a summary of the
valuation assumptions utilized by the Company to determine the
estimated value of stock option grants:

Note 20

Income Taxes

The components of income tax expense were:

A reconciliation of expected income tax expense
at the federal statutory rate of 35% to the Company’s
applicable income tax expense follows:

The tax effects of fair value adjustments on
securities available-for-sale, derivative instruments in cash
flow hedges and certain tax benefits related to stock options
are recorded directly to shareholders’ equity as part of
other comprehensive income.

In preparing its tax returns, the Company is
required to interpret complex tax laws and regulations and
utilize income and cost allocation methods to determine its
taxable income. On an ongoing basis, the Company is subject to
examinations by federal and state taxing authorities that

U.S. Bancorp  95


may give rise to differing interpretations of
these complex laws, regulations and methods. Due to the nature
of the examination process, it generally takes years before
these examinations are completed and matters are resolved. At
December 31, 2003, the Company is in various stages of the
examination process for federal tax return matters of U.S.
Bancorp for periods dating back to 1995 and other predecessor
entities dating back to 1997. In addition, examinations by
various state taxing authorities date back to 1997. At year-end,
the Company believes the aggregate amount of any additional tax
liabilities that may result from these examinations, if any,
will not have a material adverse effect on the financial
condition, results of operations or cash flows of the Company.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities
reflect the tax effect of temporary differences between the
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial
reporting purposes and the amounts used for the same items for
income tax reporting purposes.

The components of the Company’s net deferred
tax liability as of December 31 were:

The Company has established a valuation allowance
to offset deferred tax assets related to state net operating
loss carryforwards which are expected to expire unused. The
Company has approximately $252 million of state net
operating loss carryforwards, which expire at various times
through 2022.

Certain events covered by Internal Revenue Code
section 593(e), which was not repealed, will trigger a recapture
of base year reserves of acquired thrift institutions. The base
year reserves of acquired thrift institutions would be
recaptured if an entity ceases to qualify as a bank for federal
income tax purposes. The base year reserves of thrift
institutions also remain subject to income tax penalty
provisions that, in general, require recapture upon certain
stock redemptions of, and excess distributions to, stockholders.
At December 31, 2003, retained earnings included
approximately $101.8 million of base year reserves for
which no deferred federal income tax liability has been
recognized.

Note 21

Derivative Instruments

In the ordinary course of business, the Company
enters into derivative transactions to manage its interest rate
and prepayment risk and to accommodate the business requirements
of its customers. The Company does not enter into derivative
transactions for speculative purposes. Refer to Note 1
“Significant Accounting Policies” in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the
Company’s accounting policies for derivative instruments.
For information related to derivative positions held for asset
and liability management purposes and customer-related
derivative positions, see Table 17 “Derivative
Positions,” included in Management’s Discussion and
Analysis, which is incorporated by reference into these Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

ASSET AND LIABILITY MANAGEMENT
POSITIONS

Cash Flow Hedges

The
Company had $21.2 billion of designated cash flow hedges at
December 31, 2003. These

96 U.S. Bancorp


derivatives are interest rate swaps that are
hedges of the forecasted cash flows from the underlying
variable-rate LIBOR loans and floating-rate debt. All cash flow
hedges are highly effective for the year ended December 31,
2003, and the change in fair value attributed to hedge
ineffectiveness was not material.

At December 31, 2003 and 2002, accumulated
other comprehensive income included a deferred after-tax net
gain of $174.9 million and $309.9 million,
respectively, related to derivatives used to hedge cash flows.
The unrealized gain will be reflected in earnings when the
related cash flows or hedged transactions occur and will offset
the related performance of the hedged items. The occurrence of
these related cash flows and hedged transactions remains
probable. The estimated amount of after-tax gain to be
reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into
earnings during 2004 is $53.1 million, which includes gains
related to hedges that were terminated early when the forecasted
transactions are still probable.

Fair Value Hedges

The Company has $8.6 billion of
designated fair value hedges at December 31, 2003. These
derivatives are primarily interest rate contracts that hedge the
change in fair value related to interest rate changes of
underlying fixed-rate debt, trust preferred securities, and
deposit obligations. In addition, the Company uses forward
commitments to sell residential mortgage loans to hedge its
interest rate risk related to residential mortgage loans held
for sale. The Company commits to sell the loans at specified
prices in a future period, typically within 90 days. The
Company is exposed to interest rate risk during the period
between issuing a loan commitment and the sale of the loan into
the secondary market.

All fair value hedges are considered highly
effective for the year ended December 31, 2003. The change
in fair value attributed to hedge ineffectiveness was a loss of
$6.8 million, related to the Company’s mortgage loans
held for sale and its 2003 production volume of
$29.9 billion.

Other Asset and Liability Management
Derivative Positions

The Company has
derivative positions that are used for interest rate risk and
other risk management purposes but are not designated as cash
flow hedges or fair value hedges in accordance with the
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedge Activities.” At December 31, 2003, the Company
had $1.0 billion of forward commitments to sell residential
mortgage loans to hedge the Company’s interest rate risk
related to $1.0 billion of unfunded residential loan
commitments. Gains and losses on mortgage banking derivatives
and the unfunded loan commitments are included in mortgage
banking revenue on the income statement.

CUSTOMER-RELATED POSITIONS

The Company acts as a seller and buyer of
interest rate contracts and foreign exchange rate contracts on
behalf of customers. At December 31, 2003, the Company had
$16.6 billion of aggregate customer derivative positions,
including $12.6 billion of interest rate swaps, caps, and
floors and $4.0 billion of foreign exchange rate contracts.
The Company minimizes its market and liquidity risks by taking
similar offsetting positions. Gains or losses on
customer-related transactions were not significant for the year
ended December 31, 2003.

Note 22

Fair Values of Financial Instruments

Due to the nature of its business and its
customers’ needs, the Company offers a large number of
financial instruments, most of which are not actively traded.
When market quotes are unavailable, valuation techniques
including discounted cash flow calculations and pricing models
or services are used. The Company also uses various aggregation
methods and assumptions, such as the discount rate and cash flow
timing and amounts. As a result, the fair value estimates can
neither be substantiated by independent market comparisons, nor
realized by the immediate sale or settlement of the financial
instrument. Also, the estimates reflect a point in time and
could change significantly based on changes in economic factors,
such as interest rates. Furthermore, the disclosure of certain
financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities are not
required. Finally, the fair value disclosure is not intended to
estimate a market value of the Company as a whole. A
summary of the Company’s valuation techniques and
assumptions follows.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The carrying value of cash, amounts
due from banks, federal funds sold and securities purchased
under resale agreements was assumed to approximate fair value.

Securities

Investment securities were valued
using available market quotes. In some instances, for securities
that are not widely traded, market quotes for comparable
securities were used.

Loans

The loan
portfolio consists of both floating and fixed-rate loans, the
fair value of which was estimated using discounted cash flow
analyses and other valuation techniques. To calculate discounted
cash flows, the loans were aggregated into pools of similar
types and expected repayment terms. The expected cash flows of
loans considered historical prepayment experiences and estimated
credit losses for nonperforming loans and were discounted using
current rates offered to borrowers of similar credit
characteristics.

U.S. Bancorp  97


Deposit Liabilities

The fair value of demand deposits,
savings accounts and certain money market deposits is equal to
the amount payable on demand at year-end. The fair value of
fixed-rate certificates of deposit was estimated by discounting
the contractual cash flow using the discount rates implied by
the high-grade corporate bond yield curve.

Short-term Borrowings

Federal funds purchased, securities
sold under agreements to repurchase and other short-term funds
borrowed are at floating rates or have short-term maturities.
Their carrying value is assumed to approximate their fair value.

Long-term Debt and Company-obligated
Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Securities of Subsidiary Trusts
Holding Solely the Junior Subordinated Debentures of the Parent
Company

The estimated fair value of
medium-term notes, bank notes, Federal Home Loan Bank Advances,
capital lease obligations and mortgage note obligations was
determined using a discounted cash flow analysis based on
current market rates of similar maturity debt securities to
discount cash flows. Other long-term debt instruments and
company-obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of
subsidiary trusts holding solely the junior subordinated
debentures of the parent company were valued using available
market quotes.

Interest Rate Swaps, Basis Swaps and Options

The interest rate options and swap
cash flows were estimated using a third-party pricing model and
discounted based on appropriate LIBOR, eurodollar futures, swap
and treasury note yield curves.

Loan Commitments, Letters of Credit and
Guarantees

The fair value of
commitments, letters of credit and guarantees represents the
estimated costs to terminate or otherwise settle the obligations
with a third-party. Residential mortgage commitments are
actively traded and the fair value is estimated using available
market quotes. Other loan commitments, letters of credit and
guarantees are not actively traded. Substantially all loan
commitments have floating rates and do not expose the Company to
interest rate risk assuming no premium or discount was ascribed
to loan commitments because funding could occur at market rates.
The Company estimates the fair value of loan commitments,
letters of credit and guarantees based on the related amount of
unamortized deferred commitment fees adjusted for the probable
losses for these arrangements.

The estimated fair values of the Company’s
financial instruments at December 31 are shown in the
following table:

98 U.S. Bancorp


The fair value of unfunded commitments, standby
letters of credit and other guarantees is approximately equal to
their carrying value. The carrying value of unfunded commitments
and standby letters of credit was $192 million. The
carrying value of other guarantees was $132 million.

Note 23

Guarantees and Contingent Liabilities

COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT

Commitments to extend credit are legally binding
and generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination
clauses. The contractual amount represents the Company’s
exposure to credit loss, in the event of default by the
borrower. The Company manages this credit risk by using the same
credit policies it applies to loans. Collateral is obtained to
secure commitments based on management’s credit assessment
of the borrower. The collateral may include marketable
securities, receivables, inventory, equipment and real estate.
Since the Company expects many of the commitments to expire
without being drawn, total commitment amounts do not necessarily
represent the Company’s future liquidity requirements. In
addition, the commitments include consumer credit lines that are
cancelable upon notification to the consumer.

LETTERS OF CREDIT

Standby letters of credit are conditional
commitments the Company issues to guarantee the performance of a
customer to a third-party. The guarantees frequently support
public and private borrowing arrangements, including commercial
paper issuances, bond financings and other similar transactions.
The Company issues commercial letters of credit on behalf of
customers to ensure payment or collection in connection with
trade transactions. In the event of a customer’s
nonperformance, the Company’s credit loss exposure is the
same as in any extension of credit, up to the letter’s
contractual amount. Management assesses the borrower’s
credit to determine the necessary collateral, which may include
marketable securities, real estate, accounts receivable and
inventory. Since the conditions requiring the Company to fund
letters of credit may not occur, the Company expects its
liquidity requirements to be less than the total outstanding
commitments. The maximum potential future payments guaranteed by
the Company under standby letter of credit arrangements at
December 31, 2003, were approximately $9.7 billion
with a weighted average term of approximately 24 months.
The estimated fair value of standby letters of credit was
approximately $84.6 million at December 31, 2003.

The contract or notional amounts of commitments
to extend credit and letters of credit at December 31,
2003, were as follows:

LEASE COMMITMENTS

Rental expense for operating leases amounted to
$151.4 million in 2003, $148.0 million in 2002 and
$165.2 million in 2001. Future minimum payments, net of
sublease rentals, under capitalized leases and noncancelable
operating leases with initial or remaining terms of
one year or more, consisted of the following at
December 31, 2003:

GUARANTEES

Guarantees are contingent commitments issued by
the Company to customers or other third-parties. The
Company’s guarantees primarily include parent guarantees
related to subsidiaries’ third-party borrowing
arrangements; third-party performance guarantees inherent in the
Company’s business operations such as indemnified
securities lending programs and merchant charge-back guarantees;
indemnification or buy-back provisions related to certain asset
sales; and contingent consideration arrangements related to
acquisitions. For certain guarantees, the Company has recorded a
liability related to the potential obligation, or has access to
collateral to support

U.S. Bancorp  99


the guarantee or through the exercise of other
recourse provisions can offset some or all of the maximum
potential future payments made under these guarantees. The
estimated fair value of guarantees, other than standby letters
of credit, was approximately $132 million at
December 31, 2003.

Third-Party Borrowing Arrangements

The Company provides guarantees to
third-parties as a part of certain subsidiaries’ borrowing
arrangements, primarily representing guaranteed operating or
capital lease payments or other debt obligations with maturity
dates extending through 2014. The maximum potential future
payments guaranteed by the Company under these arrangements was
approximately $1.5 billion at December 31, 2003. The
Company’s recorded liabilities as of December 31,
2003, included $40.7 million representing outstanding
amounts owed to these third-parties and required to be recorded
on balance sheet in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. The guaranteed operating lease payments
are also included in the disclosed minimum lease obligations.

Commitments from Securities Lending

The Company participates in securities
lending activities by acting as the customer’s agent
involving the loan or sale of securities. The Company
indemnifies customers for the difference between the market
value of the securities lent and the market value of the
collateral received. Cash collateralizes these transactions. The
maximum potential future payments guaranteed by the Company
under these arrangements was approximately $13.2 billion at
December 31, 2003, and represented the market value of the
securities lent to third-parties. At December 31, 2003, the
Company held assets with a market value of $13.6 billion as
collateral for these arrangements.

Asset Sales

The
Company has provided guarantees to certain third-parties in
connection with the sale of certain assets, primarily loan
portfolios and low-income housing tax credits. These guarantees
are generally in the form of asset buy-back or make-whole
provisions that are triggered upon a credit event or a change in
the tax-qualifying status of the related projects, as
applicable, and remain in effect until the loans are collected
or final tax credits are realized, respectively. The maximum
potential future payments guaranteed by the Company under these
arrangements were approximately $784.9 million at
December 31, 2003, and represented the total proceeds
received from the buyer in these transactions where the buy-back
or make-whole provisions have not yet expired. Recourse
available to the Company includes guarantees from the Small
Business Administration (for SBA loans sold), recourse against
the correspondent that originated the loan or to the private
mortgage issuer, the right to collect payments from the debtors,
and/or the right to liquidate the underlying collateral, if any,
and retain the proceeds. Based on its established loan-to-value
guidelines, the Company believes the recourse available is
sufficient to recover future payments, if any, under the loan
buy-back guarantees.

Merchant Processing

The Company, through its subsidiary
NOVA Information Systems, Inc., provides merchant processing
services. Under the rules of credit card associations, a
merchant processor retains a contingent liability for credit
card transactions processed. This contingent liability arises in
the event of a billing dispute between the merchant and a
cardholder that is ultimately resolved in the cardholder’s
favor. In this situation, the transaction is “charged
back” to the merchant and the disputed amount is credited
or otherwise refunded to the cardholder. If the Company is
unable to collect this amount from the merchant, it bears the
loss for the amount of the refund paid to the cardholder.

A cardholder, through its issuing bank, generally
has until the latter of up to four months after the date the
transaction is processed or the receipt of the product or
service to present a charge-back to the Company as the merchant
processor. The absolute maximum potential liability is estimated
to be the total volume of credit card transactions that meet the
associations’ requirements to be valid charge-back
transactions at any given time. Management estimates that the
maximum potential exposure for charge-backs would approximate
the total amount of merchant transactions processed through the
credit card associations for the last four months. For the last
four months of 2003, this amount totaled approximately
$36.8 billion. In most cases, this contingent liability is
unlikely to arise, as most products and services are delivered
when purchased and amounts are refunded when items are returned
to merchants. However, where the product or service is not
provided until a future date (“future delivery”), the
potential for this contingent liability increases. To mitigate
this risk, the Company may require the merchant to make an
escrow deposit, may place maximum volume limitations on future
delivery transactions processed by the merchant at any point in
time, or may require various credit policy enhancements
(including letters of credit and bank guarantees). Also,
merchant processing contracts may include event triggers to
provide the Company more financial and operational control in
the event of financial deterioration of the merchant. At
December 31, 2003, the Company held $28.6 million of
merchant escrow deposits as collateral.

The Company currently processes card transactions
for several of the largest airlines in the United States. In the
event of liquidation of these airlines, the Company could become
financially liable for refunding tickets purchased

100 U.S. Bancorp


through the credit card associations under the
charge-back provisions. Charge-back risk related to an airline
is evaluated in a manner similar to credit risk assessments and
merchant processing contracts consider the potential risk of
default. At December 31, 2003, the value of future delivery
airline tickets purchased was approximately $1.4 billion,
and the Company held collateral of $188.7 million in escrow
deposits and lines of credit related to airline customer
transactions.

In the normal course of business, the Company has
unresolved charge-backs that are in process of resolution. The
Company assesses the likelihood of its potential liability based
on the extent and nature of unresolved charge-backs and its
historical loss experience. At December 31, 2003, the
Company recorded a liability for potential losses of
$22.7 million.

Contingent Consideration Arrangements

The Company has contingent payment
obligations related to certain business combination
transactions. Payments are guaranteed as long as certain
post-acquisition performance-based criteria are met or customer
relationships are maintained. At December 31, 2003, the
maximum potential future payments required to be made by the
Company under these arrangements was approximately
$75.5 million and primarily represented contingent payments
related to the acquisition of the State Street Corporate Trust
business on December 31, 2002. If required, these
contingent payments would be payable within the next six months.

Other Guarantees

The
Company provides liquidity and credit enhancement facilities to
a Company-sponsored conduit, as more fully described in the
“Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements” section within
Management’s Discussion and Analysis. Although management
believes a draw against these facilities is remote, the maximum
potential future payments guaranteed by the Company under these
arrangements was approximately $7.3 billion at
December 31, 2003. The recorded fair value of the
Company’s liability for the credit enhancement recourse
obligation and liquidity facilities was $47.3 million at
December 31, 2003, and was included in other liabilities.

The Company guarantees payments to certain
certificate holders of Company-sponsored investment trusts with
varying termination dates extending through September 2004. The
maximum potential future payments guaranteed by the Company
under these arrangements was approximately $49.1 million at
December 31, 2003. At December 31, 2003, the Company
had a recorded liability of $44.1 million, held
$15.0 million in cash collateral and has other contractual
sources of recourse available to it including guarantees from
third-parties and the underlying assets held by the investment
trusts.

OTHER CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

In connection with the spin-off of Piper Jaffray
Companies, the Company has agreed to indemnify Piper Jaffray
Companies against losses that may result from third-party claims
relating to certain specified matters. The Company’s
indemnification obligation related to these specified matters is
capped at $17.5 million and can be terminated by the
Company if there is a change in control event for Piper Jaffray
Companies.

The Company is subject to various other
litigation, investigations and legal and administrative cases
and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of its
businesses. Due to their complex nature, it may be years before
some matters are resolved. While it is impossible to ascertain
the ultimate resolution or range of financial liability with
respect to these contingent matters, the Company believes that
the aggregate amount of such liabilities will not have a
material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of
operations or cash flows of the Company.

Condensed Statement of Cash Flows

Transfer of funds (dividends, loans or advances)
from bank subsidiaries to the Company is restricted. Federal law
prohibits loans unless they are secured and generally limits any
loan to the Company or individual affiliate to 10 percent
of the bank’s equity. In aggregate, loans to the Company
and all affiliates cannot exceed 20 percent of the
bank’s equity.

Dividend payments to the Company by its
subsidiary banks are subject to regulatory review and statutory
limitations and, in some instances, regulatory approval. The
approval of the Comptroller of the Currency is required if total
dividends by a national bank in any calendar year exceed the
bank’s net income for that year combined with its retained
net income for the preceding two calendar years or if the
bank’s retained earnings are less than zero. Furthermore,
dividends are restricted by the Comptroller of the
Currency’s minimum capital constraints for all national
banks. Within these guidelines, all bank subsidiaries have the
ability to pay dividends without prior regulatory approval. The
amount of dividends available to the parent company from the
bank subsidiaries at December 31, 2003, was approximately
$828.5 million.

General Business Description

U.S. Bancorp is a multi-state
financial services holding company headquartered in Minneapolis,
Minnesota. U.S. Bancorp was incorporated in Delaware in 1929 and
operates as a financial holding company and a bank holding
company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. U.S. Bancorp
provides a full range of financial services, including lending
and depository services, cash management, foreign exchange and
trust and investment management services. It also engages in
credit card services, merchant and automated teller machine
(“ATM”) processing, mortgage banking, insurance,
brokerage, leasing and investment banking.

U.S. Bancorp’s banking subsidiaries are
engaged in the general banking business, principally in domestic
markets. The subsidiaries range in size from $26 million to
$128 billion in deposits and provide a wide range of
products and services to individuals, businesses, institutional
organizations, governmental entities and other financial
institutions. Commercial and consumer lending services are
principally offered to customers within the Company’s
domestic markets, to domestic customers with foreign operations
and within certain niche national venues. Lending services
include traditional credit products as well as credit card
services, financing and import/export trade, asset-backed
lending, agricultural finance and other products. Leasing
products are offered through bank leasing subsidiaries.
Depository services include checking accounts, savings accounts
and time certificate contracts. Ancillary services such as
foreign exchange, treasury management and receivable lock-box
collection are provided to corporate customers.
U.S. Bancorp’s bank and trust subsidiaries provide a
full range of asset management and fiduciary services for
individuals, estates, foundations, business corporations and
charitable organizations.

U.S. Bancorp’s non-banking subsidiaries
primarily offer investment and insurance products to the
Company’s customers principally within its markets and
mutual fund processing services to a broad range of mutual funds.

Banking and investment services are provided
through a network of 2,343 banking offices principally operating
in 24 states in the Midwest and West. The Company operates
a network of 4,425 branded ATMs and provides 24-hour, seven day
a week telephone customer service. Mortgage banking services are
provided through banking offices and loan production offices
throughout the Company’s markets. Consumer lending products
may be originated through banking offices, indirect
correspondents, brokers or other lending sources, and a consumer
finance division. The Company is also one of the largest
providers of Visa® corporate and purchasing card services
and corporate trust services in the United States. A
wholly-owned subsidiary, NOVA Information Systems, Inc.,
provides merchant processing services directly to merchants and
through a network of banking affiliations.

On a full-time equivalent basis, employment
during 2003 averaged a total of 51,377 employees.

Competition.

The
commercial banking business is highly competitive. Subsidiary
banks compete with other commercial banks and with other
financial institutions, including savings and loan associations,
mutual savings banks, finance companies, mortgage banking
companies, credit unions and investment companies. In recent
years, competition has increased from institutions not subject
to the same regulatory restrictions as domestic banks and bank
holding companies.

Government Policies

The operations of the Company’s
various operating units are affected by state and federal
legislative changes and by policies of various regulatory
authorities, including those of the numerous states in which
they operate, the United States and foreign governments. These
policies include, for example, statutory maximum legal lending
rates, domestic monetary policies of the Board of Governors of
the Federal Reserve System, United States fiscal policy,
international currency regulations and monetary policies, U.S.
Patriot Act and capital adequacy and liquidity constraints
imposed by bank regulatory agencies.

Supervision and Regulation

As a registered bank holding company
and financial holding company under the Bank Holding Company
Act, U.S. Bancorp is subject to the supervision of, and
regulation by, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System.

Under the Bank Holding Company Act, a financial
holding company may engage in banking, managing or controlling
banks, furnishing or performing services for banks it controls,
and conducting other financial activities. U.S. Bancorp
must obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board
before acquiring more than 5 percent of the outstanding shares
of another bank or bank holding company, and must provide notice
to, and in some situations obtain the prior approval of, the
Federal Reserve Board in connection with engaging in, or
acquiring more than 5 percent of the outstanding shares of
a company engaged in, a new financial activity.

Under the Bank Holding Company Act,
U.S. Bancorp may acquire banks throughout the United
States, subject only to state or federal deposit caps and state
minimum age requirements.

National banks are subject to the supervision of,
and are examined by, the Comptroller of the Currency. All
subsidiary banks of the Company are members of the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation and are subject to

U.S. Bancorp  113


examination by the FDIC. In practice, the primary
federal regulator makes regular examinations of each subsidiary
bank subject to its regulatory review or participates in joint
examinations with other federal regulators. Areas subject to
regulation by federal authorities include the allowance for
credit losses, investments, loans, mergers, issuance of
securities, payment of dividends, establishment of branches and
other aspects of operations.

Properties

U.S. Bancorp and its significant
subsidiaries occupy headquarter offices under a long-term lease
in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The Company also leases eight
freestanding operations centers in St. Paul, Portland,

    Executive Stock Incentive Plan and the U.S. Bancorp 1991
    Executive Stock Incentive Plan. Excludes 62,277,981 shares
    underlying outstanding stock options and warrants assumed by
    U.S. Bancorp in connection with acquisitions by U.S. Bancorp. Of
    the excluded shares, 54,776,567 underlie stock options granted
    under equity compensation plans of the former U.S. Bancorp that
    were approved by the shareholders of the former U.S.
    Bancorp.

(c)

All of the identified shares underlie stock
    options granted to a broad-based employee population pursuant to
    the U.S. Bancorp 2001 Employee Stock Incentive plan, the Firstar
    Corporation 1999 Employee Stock Incentive Plan, the Firstar
    Corporation 1998 Employee Stock Incentive Plan and the Star Banc
    Corporation 1996 Starshare Stock Incentive Plan for
    Employees.

Under the U.S. Bancorp 2001 Employee Stock
Incentive Plan (“2001 Plan”), 11,678,800 shares are
authorized for issuance pursuant to the grant of nonqualified
stock options to any full-time or part-time employee actively
employed by U.S. Bancorp on the grant date, other than
individuals eligible to participate in any of the Company’s
executive stock incentive plans or in U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray
Inc.’s annual option plan. As of December 31, 2003,
options to purchase an aggregate of 6,238,529 shares were
outstanding under the plan. All options under the plan were
granted on February 27, 2001.

As of December 31, 2003, options to purchase
an aggregate of 2,331,475 shares of the Company’s common
stock were outstanding under the Firstar Corporation 1999
Employee Stock Incentive Plan (“1999 Plan”). Under
this plan, stock options were granted to each full-time or
part-time employee actively employed by Firstar Corporation on
the grant date, other than managers who participated in an
executive stock incentive plan.

As of December 31, 2003, options to purchase
an aggregate of 3,278,230 shares of the Company’s common
stock were outstanding under the Firstar Corporation 1998
Employee Stock Incentive Plan (“1998 Plan”). Under
this plan, stock options were granted to each full-time or
part-time employee actively employed by Firstar Corporation on
the grant date, other than managers who participated in an
executive stock incentive plan.

As of December 31, 2003, options to purchase
an aggregate of 411,689 shares of the Company’s common
stock were outstanding under the Star Banc Corporation 1996
Starshare Stock Incentive Plan for Employees (“1996
Plan”). Under the plan, stock options were granted to each
employee of Star Banc Corporation, a predecessor company, other
than managers who participated in an executive stock incentive
plan.

No further options will be granted under any of
these plans. Under all of the plans, the exercise price of the
options equals the fair market value of the underlying common
stock on the grant date. All options granted under the plan have
a term of 10 years from the grant date and become
exercisable over a period of time set forth in the plan or
determined by the committee administering the plan. Options
granted under the plan are nontransferable and, during the
optionee’s lifetime, are exercisable only by the optionee.

114 U.S. Bancorp


If an optionee is terminated as a result of his
or her gross misconduct or offense, all options terminate
immediately, whether or not vested. Under the 2001 Plan, the
1999 Plan and the 1998 Plan, in the event an optionee is
terminated immediately following a change in control (as defined
in the plans) of U.S. Bancorp, and the termination is due to
business needs resulting from the change in control and not as a
result of the optionee’s performance or conduct, all of the
optionee’s outstanding options will become immediately
vested and exercisable as of the date of such termination. Under
the 1996 Plan, all outstanding options vest and become
exercisable immediately following a change in control.

If the outstanding shares of common stock of
U.S. Bancorp are changed into or exchanged for a different
number or kind of shares of stock or other securities as a
result of a reorganization, recapitalization, stock dividend,
stock split, combination of shares, reclassification, merger,
consolidation or similar event, the number of shares underlying
outstanding options also may be adjusted. The number of shares
underlying the options shown in the table have been adjusted to
maintain the economic value of the options following the special
dividend paid to effect the spin-off of our Piper Jaffray
subsidiary. The plans may be terminated, amended or modified by
the Board of Directors at any time.

Change in Certifying Accountants

In response to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
of 2002, the Audit Committee determined on November 8,
2002, to segregate the internal and external auditing functions
performed for U.S. Bancorp by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and
appointed Ernst & Young LLP to become the
Company’s external auditors following the filing of the
Company’s 2002 Annual Report on Form 10-K during the
first quarter of 2003.

No report of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP on the
financial statements of U.S. Bancorp for the years ended
December 31, 2002 and 2001 contained an adverse opinion or
a disclaimer of opinion, or was qualified or modified as to
uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. During the
two years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, there were no
disagreements with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP on any matter of
accounting principles or practices, financial statement
disclosure or auditing scope or procedure which, if not resolved
to the satisfaction of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, would have
caused it to make reference to the subject matter of the
disagreement in connection with its reports on the financial
statements for such years. U.S. Bancorp believes that
during the two years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001,
there were no “reportable events,” as defined in
Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K of the Securities
and Exchange Commission.

During the two years ended December 31, 2002
and 2001, the Company did not consult with Ernst & Young LLP
on any items regarding the application of accounting principles,
the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the
Company’s financial statements, or the subject matter of a
disagreement or reportable event (as described in Regulation S-K
Item 304(a)(2)).

U.S. Bancorp reported the change in accountants
on a Form 8-K filed on November 14, 2002. The
Form 8-K contained a letter from PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP, addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission,
stating that it agreed with the statements concerning
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP in such Form 8-K.

Website Access to SEC Reports

U.S. Bancorp’s internet website
