LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS:

OUR 2005 RESULTS WERE EXCELLENT ACROSS A WIDE RANGE OF KEY MEASURES. I am pleased that
we were able to deliver on our promise to produce high-quality earnings and industry-leading
returns. At the same time, we maintained superior credit quality and continued to make
revenue-producing investments in this corporation.

Fellow Shareholders:

Industry-leading core earnings and consistent performance

We achieved record earnings of $4.5 billion in 2005. This represented $2.42 per diluted share, an
11 percent increase over our 2004 results. This is the fourth consecutive year that we have
exceeded our long-term goal of 10 percent earnings per share growth. We also improved upon our
industry-leading performance metrics and posted return on average assets of 2.21 percent and return
on average equity of 22.5 percent for the year.

Our financial results reflect our ability to execute our strategies for success. These
include our long-term targets for earnings per share growth of 10 percent and for return on equity
of 20 percent, both of which we exceeded in 2005. Other corporate goals include reducing credit and
earnings volatility of the company and continuing to invest for future growth. You will read below
more details about our accomplishing these goals.

Finally, two overriding goals are to provide high-quality service to every customer and to
target 80 percent return of earnings to our shareholders. In the pages to follow, you will see some
excellent examples of ways we are changing and growing to enhance customer service. And in
the graphs at the top of the next page, you can see that we continue our commitment to creating
shareholder value.

Positive operating leverage and superior efficiency

Excluding securities gains and losses and the valuation of our mortgage servicing rights, we grew
revenue faster than expense in 2005, thus creating positive operating leverage — a fundamental
objective of this corporation. In this fiercely competitive and commodity-like banking industry,
maintaining superior operating efficiency is critical. This management team is dedicated to
maintaining superior operating efficiency, and the year 2005 was no exception, as we obtained a
tangible efficiency ratio for the year of 40.8 percent.

Achieving our goal of lowering our credit risk profile

We are extremely proud of the improvements we have made in the company’s overall risk profile. Our
net charge-offs were 51 basis points of average loans in 2005, a continued improvement compared
with prior years. Nonperforming assets at December 31, 2005, were $644 million, a 14 percent
decrease from the balance at December 31, 2004. The steps we have taken to reduce the
company’s risk profile we believe will enable us to minimize the impact of future changes in the
economy, keep our credit costs lower than our peers and thereby lower the volatility of operating
results.

Continuing to invest in this company

We have continued to invest in our company. In particular, the acquisitions we have made in our
fee-based businesses over the past few years have allowed us to achieve our earnings objectives
while maintaining high returns, despite the pressure on the net interest margin, the challenges of
the recent and current interest rate cycle and an incredibly competitive environment.

Our continued investments in fee based businesses, distribution channels and market expansion
provide future growth opportunities for U.S. Bancorp. These investments have strengthened our
presence and product offerings for the benefit of our entire customer base. We operate with an
advantageous mix of businesses and have strong market positions in fee-based businesses,
particularly merchant processing and corporate trust. We have strategically developed a number of
diverse national business lines, which in addition to our powerhouse regional consumer and small
business banking, have generated sustainable profitability.

Standard & Poors Rating Services raises ratings on U.S. Bancorp

In January 2006, Standard & Poor’s (S&P) Ratings Services announced that it has raised the ratings
on U.S. Bancorp, including its counterparty credit ratings, to AA-/A-1+ from A+/A-1.

S&P also raised its long-term counterparty credit ratings on U.S. Bancorp’s subsidiaries, U.S. Bank
National Association and U.S. Bank National Association ND, to AA from AA-. This AA rating is
currently the highest rating given by S&P to any domestic bank.

We are pleased that our performance and outlook allowed the rating agencies to make those ratings
increases.

Managing this company in a way to make you proud of your investment

U.S. Bancorp was ranked as the second most respected banking company in the United States and the
50th most respected company in the world, according to a survey of institutional investors
published in the September 12, 2005 edition of

Barron’s

. The survey ranked the world’s 100 largest
companies by market capitalization. Six U.S. banking corporations made the list, with U.S. Bancorp
one of only two to make the top 50 ranking.

The publication noted that respondents to the survey overwhelmingly cited strong management and
business strategy as the two most important criteria for ranking corporations on the list. Other
criteria included competitive edge, consistent sales and profit growth, ethical business practices
and product innovation.

Creating shareholder value is always our priority

In December 2005, U.S. Bancorp announced a 10 percent increase in the dividend rate on U.S. Bancorp
common stock to $1.32 on an annualized basis, or $0.33 on a quarterly basis. The quarterly common
stock dividend of $0.33 per common share was payable on January 16, 2006 to shareholders of record
at the close of business on December 30, 2005.

That dividend action represents 34 consecutive years of increasing our dividend. Since 1993, our
dividend has shown a compound annual growth rate of 19.6 percent. Our dividend program is an
important part of our shareholders’ total return on their investment in U.S. Bancorp. U.S. Bancorp,
since 1863 through its predecessor companies, has paid a dividend for 143 consecutive years.

In late 2003, our company made a commitment to return 80 percent of earnings to our
shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. In 2005, we returned 90 percent of
earnings to our shareholders, and since we originally made that commitment, we have returned 98
percent of our earnings to shareholders. We expect to continue to return 80 plus percent in 2006.

As always, we want you to remember that we manage this corporation to increase the value of your
investment in U.S. Bancorp. It’s the reason we come to work each day.

PAYMENT SERVICES:

Merchant processing

expands

global footprint

ONE OF OUR BEST OPPORTUNITIES FOR REVENUE GROWTH is to leverage our position in
payments. Electronic payment products have become more widely accepted worldwide and represent the
potential to drive significant revenue growth. The acquisition of payments businesses and
portfolios has been a strategic focus of U.S. Bancorp, as they add capability, increase scale and
give our company an

advantaged position in high-value, high-growth businesses.

U.S. Bank’s growth
in payments acquisitions led the industry in 2005, far outnumbering those of our peer banks. Among
our major transactions was the acquisition of Citibank Card Acceptance in Europe.

NOVA Information Systems, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of U.S. Bancorp, is a leader in the
payment processing industry. Combined, NOVA and its affiliates euroConex and Elan provide global
merchant processing services to more than 800,000 customers in the U.S., Canada and Europe. In
2005, NOVA processed more than one billion transactions worldwide.

U.S. Bank successfully combines information technology, business management and customer service in
payment services, as well as throughout all of our lines of business. In November 2005, U.S. Bank
won

CIO

magazine’s 14th Annual CIO Enterprise Value Award in the banking and brokerage category.
U.S. Bank won for Access Online, an electronic program management tool used by major corporations
and government agencies, and created by U.S. Bank Corporate Payment Systems.

Recent acquisitions have expanded our merchant processing globally.

At year-end 2005, euroConex
acquired Citibank Card Acceptance, a part of Citigroup, Inc., and added 100,000 new merchant
locations in more than 30 countries, including Ireland, the U.K., Spain, France, Belgium, Italy,
Germany, Poland, Austria, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden, raising the company’s total
pan-European portfolio to more than 200,000 merchant locations.

great growth potential.

PRIVATE CLIENT, TRUST AND ASSET MANAGEMENT:

Corporate trust and institutional

custody growth solidifies our

leadership

U.S. BANK IS A RECOGNIZED NATIONAL LEADER IN THE CORPORATE TRUST AND INSTITUTIONAL CUSTODY
BUSINESSES  — the largest trustee in the area of tax-exempt debt, the second largest in the
area of asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities, the third largest in new corporate bond
issuances, and the ninth-largest institutional custody provider.

U.S. Bank recently solidified this top tier position with the acquisition of a major corporate
trust and institutional custody portfolio. As a result of the transaction, which closed on December
30, 2005, U.S. Bank Corporate Trust Services acquired approximately 14,100 new client issuances and
$410 billion in assets under administration, and U.S. Bank Institutional Trust & Custody acquired
approximately 1,700 new clients and $570 billion in assets under administration.

This transaction

strongly complements our existing corporate trust and institutional custody
businesses

, making us more competitive by increasing our scale and leveraging our existing
capabilities and operational platforms. In addition to serving the specialized needs of our
corporate trust and institutional custody customers, U.S. Bancorp continues to enhance our
top-notch service delivery to affluent individuals and families, professional service corporations
and nonprofit organizations through The Private Client Group. Acting as a bank within a bank, The
Private Client Group works to build, manage and preserve our customers’ wealth by providing expert

CONSUMER BANKING:

Small Business Service Center

streamlines

service delivery

WE LISTEN TO OUR CUSTOMERS.

When our small
business banking customers said they wanted a one-stop resource for all their special banking
needs and questions, we immediately began the development of our Small Business Service Center.
We created a model that tackled such issues as staffing with a team of experts, ensuring the
highest level of product knowledge, taking full ownership of issues, and one-and-done problem
resolution, among others.

The system
is designed to

make banking smooth and effortless

for these valuable customers.
Diverse customer service groups within the bank that may previously have worked separately now
are pulled together and collaborate through the Service Center. Communication with customers has
increased, and customer satisfaction scores in the pilot markets have improved significantly.

Based on the success of our Denver pilot program, the Small Business Service Center program has
been expanded throughout Colorado and into the St. Louis marketplace. Expansion into additional
markets is planned for 2006 to ensure that we are delivering Five Star Service to all of our
small business banking customers.

COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT:

U.S. Bancorp invests in our communities through active leadership, employee volunteerism, and
financial support. By helping to build strong, vibrant communities, we’re building a healthy
marketplace for our company and fostering neighborhoods where businesses succeed and people want
to live and work. We do this by investing in affordable housing, economic opportunity, education,
arts and culture, and community service initiatives. By devoting time, talent and money to
projects, programs and organizations focused on invigorating our communities, we provide
residents and businesses with access to opportunities that will enable them to thrive and
prosper.

Through the U.S. Bancorp Foundation, we provide cash contributions to nonprofit
organizations in support of affordable housing, economic opportunities, education and artistic
and cultural enrichment. In 2005, total charitable contributions from the U.S. Bancorp Foundation
exceeded $21 million.

U.S. Bancorp provides superior, competitive products to every customer we serve. In addition,
we help customers and businesses overcome challenging financial situations through customized
financial solutions. U.S. Bancorp provides loans and investments to help build, rehabilitate and
finance affordable housing units throughout our corporate footprint.

U.S. Bancorp also helps communities foster economic growth and revitalization by providing loans,
grants and investments to small businesses and other entities in support of projects and
organizations designed to create jobs and rehabilitate communities.

Through volunteer efforts, U.S. Bancorp employees are providing their expertise, time and talents
to help improve our communities. The U.S. Bank Development Network, comprised of 50
geographically based chapters, provides a forum where our employees engage in community service
activities, mentoring opportunities, charitable fundraising drives and more. In 2005, U.S.
Bancorp recognized 250 of our most exceptional employee volunteers through the U.S. Bank Five
Star Volunteer Award program. In addition to recognition as outstanding volunteers, winners were
honored through a $1,000 contribution to their volunteer organizations.

U.S. Bank connects our communities with opportunities.

Recently, U.S. Bank provided
community development loans totaling almost $5.6 million for the construction and permanent
financing of Seniors on Broadway. This new 42-unit affordable housing and retail development is
located adjacent to the Chula Vista Learning Community Charter School in San Diego
County. The program helps create a valuable link between seniors and elementary school students
through literacy, technology, art, after-school programs and other inter-generational activities.
All units in the complex are affordable to seniors with incomes below 50% of the area median
income. Our nonprofit partner is MAAC Project, a multi-purpose social service agency with a
successful 40-year history of serving various communities throughout San Diego County.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis

OVERVIEW

In 2005, U.S. Bancorp and its subsidiaries (the
“Company”) continued to demonstrate its financial
strength and shareholder focus. The Company achieved record
earnings in 2005 and grew earnings per share, on a diluted
basis, by 11.0 percent despite industry challenges related
to rising interest rates. This represents the fourth consecutive
year that earnings growth has exceeded the Company’s
long-term goal of achieving 10 percent earnings per share
growth. The Company continues to meet this goal through its
focus on organic growth, investing in business initiatives that
strengthen our presence and product offerings for customers, and
acquiring fee-based businesses with operating scale. As a result
of this focus, the Company’s fee-based revenue grew 9.4
percent over 2004 with growth in most product categories. Fee
income growth was led by growth in deposit service charges and
revenues generated by payment processing businesses. In
addition, average loans outstanding rose 9.0 percent
year-over-year despite very competitive credit pricing. In 2006,
the Company will continue to focus on revenue growth driven by
disciplined strategic business initiatives, customer service and
an emphasis on payment processing, fiduciary and trust
businesses, retail banking and commercial lending. The
Company’s performance was also driven by continued
improvement in the credit quality of the Company’s loan
portfolios. During the year, nonperforming assets declined
13.9 percent from a year ago and total net charge-offs
decreased to .51 percent of average loans outstanding in
2005, compared with .63 percent in 2004. In 2006, the
Company will continue to focus on credit quality and minimizing
volatility of credit-related losses. Finally, effectively
managing costs is always a goal for the Company and an important
factor of financial performance. During 2005, the Company’s
efficiency ratio (the ratio of noninterest expense to
taxable-equivalent net revenue excluding net securities gains or
losses) improved to 44.3 percent, compared with
45.3 percent in 2004, and the Company continues to be an
industry leader in this category.

The Company’s strong performance is also reflected in its
capital levels and the favorable credit ratings assigned by
various credit rating agencies. Equity capital of the Company
continued to be strong at 5.9 percent of tangible common
assets at December 31, 2005, compared with 6.4 percent
at December 31, 2004. In 2005, credit ratings for the
Company were upgraded by Moody’s Investors Service. On
January 27, 2006, Standard & Poor’s Rating
Services upgraded the Company’s credit ratings to AA-/A-1+.
Standard & Poor’s also upgraded the Company’s
primary banking subsidiaries to an AA long-term debt rating.
Credit ratings assigned by various credit rating agencies
reflect the rating agencies’ recognition of the
Company’s sector-leading earnings performance and lower
credit risk profile.

In concert with achieving stated financial objectives, the
Company exceeded its objective to return at least
80 percent of earnings to shareholders in the form of
dividends and share repurchases by returning 90 percent of 2005
earnings to shareholders. In December 2005, the Company further
increased its cash dividend, resulting in a 10 percent
increase from the dividend rate in the fourth quarter of 2004.
Throughout 2005, the Company continued to repurchase shares
under its share repurchase program. The Company continues to
affirm its goal of returning at least 80 percent of
earnings to shareholders. During 2006, the Company will also
continue its focus on its financial objectives of strong
earnings growth, creating operating leverage and a strong credit
risk profile, as well as its five-star customer service to
further strengthen customer loyalty.

Earnings Summary

The Company
reported net income of $4.5 billion in 2005, or $2.42 per
diluted share, compared with $4.2 billion, or $2.18 per
diluted share, in 2004. Return on average assets and return on
average equity were 2.21 percent and 22.5 percent,
respectively, in 2005, compared with returns of 2.17 percent and
21.4 percent, respectively, in 2004.

Total net revenue, on a taxable-equivalent basis for 2005, was
$474 million (3.7 percent) higher than 2004 despite
the adverse impact of rising interest rates on product margins
generally experienced by the banking industry. The increase in
net revenue was comprised of a 9.5 percent increase in
noninterest income and a .7 percent decline in net interest
income. The increase in noninterest income was driven by
9.4 percent growth in fee-based revenue across the majority
of fee categories and expansion in payment processing businesses
from a year ago. The decline in net interest income reflected
growth in average earning assets, more than offset by lower net
interest margins. In 2005, average earning assets increased
$10.3 billion (6.1 percent), compared with 2004,
primarily due to growth in residential mortgages, commercial
loans and retail loans. The net interest margin in 2005 was
3.97 percent, compared with 4.25 percent in 2004. The
year-over-year decline in net interest margin reflected narrower
credit spreads due to the competitive lending environment, the
mix of growth in lower-spread fixed-rate credit products and the
impact of changes in the yield curve from a year ago. The net
interest margin also declined due to share repurchases during
the year, funding incremental growth with higher cost

wholesale funding, and asset/liability decisions
given rising shorter-term interest rates. Slightly higher loan
fees and the increasing margin benefit of deposits and net free
funds partially offset the impact of these factors during the
year.

Total noninterest expense in 2005 increased
$78 million (1.3 percent), compared with 2004.
Noninterest expense reflected incremental costs related to
expanding the payment processing businesses, investments in
in-store branches (branches located within grocery stores) and
service-related business initiatives, expenses related to
investments in affordable housing or other similar
tax-advantaged development projects and higher medical and
pension costs from a year ago. These incremental expenses were
partially offset by a favorable change in impairment charges
related to the mortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”)
portfolio of $110 million due to changing longer-term
interest rates and a $101 million reduction in debt
prepayment charges, compared with 2004. The efficiency ratio
(the ratio of noninterest expense to taxable-equivalent net
revenue excluding net securities gains or losses) was
44.3 percent in 2005, compared with 45.3 percent in
2004. The improvement in the efficiency ratio reflected these

changes and the Company’s ability to
generate operating leverage within its businesses.

The provision for credit losses was
$666 million for 2005, a decrease of $3 million
(.4 percent) from 2004 due to improving credit quality
reflected in lower levels of nonperforming loans, somewhat
offset by the effects of a $56 million provision recorded
in 2005 for charge-offs related to new bankruptcy legislation
that became effective in October, 2005.

Significant Acquisitions

On December 30, 2005, the Company acquired
the corporate trust and institutional custody businesses of
Wachovia Corporation in a cash transaction valued at
$720 million initially with an additional $80 million
payable in one year based on business retention levels. As a
result of this transaction, the Company acquired approximately
14,100 new Corporate Trust client issuances with
$410 billion in assets under administration and
approximately 1,700 new Institutional Trust and Custody clients
with $570 billion in assets under administration. The
transaction represented total assets acquired of
$730 million and liabilities assumed of $10 million at
the closing date. Included in total assets were contract and
other intangibles with an estimated fair value of
$227 million and goodwill of $500 million. The
goodwill reflected the strategic value of the combined
organization’s leadership position in the corporate trust
and institutional custody businesses and economies of scale
resulting from the transaction.

STATEMENT OF INCOME ANALYSIS

Net Interest Income

Net interest income, on a
taxable-equivalent basis, was $7.1 billion in 2005,
$7.1 billion in 2004 and $7.2 billion in 2003. Net
interest income declined $52 million in 2005, reflecting
growth in average earning assets, more than offset by lower net
interest margins. Average earning assets were
$178.4 billion for 2005, compared with $168.1 billion
and $160.8 billion for 2004 and 2003, respectively. The
$10.3 billion (6.1 percent) increase in average
earning assets for 2005, compared with 2004, was primarily
driven by increases in residential mortgages, commercial loans
and retail loans. The net interest margin in 2005 was
3.97 percent, compared with 4.25 percent and
4.49 percent in 2004 and 2003, respectively. The 28 basis
point decline in the 2005 net interest margin, compared with
2004, reflected the current competitive lending environment,
asset/ liability management decisions and the impact of changes
in the yield curve from a year ago. Compared with 2004, credit
spreads have tightened by approximately 19 basis points in 2005
across most lending products due to competitive pricing and a
change in mix due to growth in lower-spread, fixed-rate credit
products. The net interest margin also declined due to the
impact of share repurchases, funding incremental growth of
earning assets with higher cost wholesale funding, and asset/
liability management decisions designed to minimize the
Company’s rate sensitivity position, including issuing
longer-term fixed-rate debt and a reduction in the
Company’s net receive-fixed interest rate swap position of
18.3 percent since December 31, 2004.

Slightly higher loan fees and the increasing
margin benefit of deposits and net free funds partially offset
these factors.

Average loans in 2005 were higher by
$11.0 billion (9.0 percent), compared with 2004,
driven by growth in residential mortgages, commercial loans and
retail loans of $3.7 billion (25.9 percent),
$3.3 billion (8.4 percent) and $3.3 billion
(7.9 percent), respectively. The significant growth in
residential mortgages was, in part, due to an asset/liability
management decision to retain adjustable-rate mortgage
production over the last several quarters. Total average
commercial real estate loans increased only 2.6 percent,
relative to 2004, principally due to higher refinancing
activities during the past two years given the interest rate
environment.

Average investment securities were
$906 million (2.1 percent) lower in 2005, compared
with 2004. The Company utilizes the investment portfolio as part
of its liquidity and asset/liability management practices to
minimize structural interest rate and market valuation risks
associated with changing interest rates. The reduction in
average investment securities in 2005 principally reflected
maturities and prepayments utilized to fund earning asset
growth. It also reflected the net impact of repositioning the
investment portfolio as part of asset/liability risk management
decisions to acquire primarily variable-rate securities to
minimize the Company’s rate sensitivity position given the
changing rate environment and mix of loan growth. During 2005,
the Company received proceeds from prepayments and maturities of
securities of $10.3 billion. In response to structural
interest rate risk due to changing interest rates and the mix of
loan growth, the Company also made decisions to sell
$4.3 billion of securities, classified as
available-for-sale, recognizing net securities losses of
$106 million. In 2005, approximately $13.2 billion was
reinvested in principally adjustable-rate securities, giving
consideration to the Company’s asset/liability position. At
December 31, 2005, the Company’s investment portfolio
consisted of approximately 41 percent variable-rate
securities. Refer to the “Interest Rate Risk
Management” section for further information on the
sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates.

Average noninterest-bearing deposits in 2005 were
lower by $587 million (2.0 percent), compared with
2004. The year-over-year change in the average balances of
noninterest-bearing deposits was impacted by product changes in
the Consumer Banking business line. In late 2004, the Company
migrated approximately $1.3 billion of noninterest-bearing
deposit balances to interest checking accounts as an enhancement
to its Silver Elite Checking product. Average branch-based
noninterest-bearing deposits in 2005, excluding the migration of
certain high-value customers to Silver Elite Checking, were
higher by approximately $210 million (1.8 percent),
over 2004. Average noninterest-bearing deposits in other areas,
including commercial banking and Private Client, Trust and Asset
Management, also increased year-over-year. These favorable
variances were offset somewhat by expected declines in average
noninterest-bearing deposits in corporate banking as these
customers utilized their excess liquidity to fund their
operations.

Average total savings products declined
$1.7 billion (2.9 percent) year-over-year, compared
with 2004, due to reductions in average money market savings
account balances and savings accounts, partially offset by
higher interest checking balances. During 2005, average
branch-based interest checking deposits increased by
$2.2 billion (14.7 percent) due to strong new account
growth of 9.0 percent, as well as the $1.3 billion
migration of the Silver Elite Checking product. This positive
variance in branch-based interest checking account deposits was
partially offset by reductions in other business units. Average
money market savings account balances declined year-over-year by
$3.5 billion (10.8 percent), with declines in both the
branches and other business lines. The decline was primarily the
result of deposit pricing by the Company for money market
products in relation to other fixed-rate deposit products
offered. A portion of the money market balances have migrated to
time deposits greater than $100,000 as rates increased on the
time deposit products. Average time deposits greater than
$100,000 grew $7.0 billion (51.0 percent) in 2005,
compared with 2004, most notably in corporate banking, as
customers migrated balances to higher rate deposits.

The decline in net interest income in 2004,
compared with 2003, reflected modest growth in average earning
assets, more than offset by lower net interest margins. Also
contributing to the year-over-year decline was a
$38 million reduction in loan fees, the result of fewer
loan prepayments in a rising rate environment. The
$7.3 billion (4.5 percent) increase in average earning
assets for 2004, compared with 2003, was primarily driven by
increases in residential mortgages, retail loans and investment
securities, partially offset by a decline in commercial loans
and loans held for sale related to mortgage banking activities.
The decline in average commercial loans reflected soft loan
demand in 2003 and through the third quarter of 2004. The 24
basis point decline in 2004 net interest margin, compared with
2003, primarily reflected the competitive credit pricing
environment, a preference to acquire adjustable-rate securities
which have lower yields and a decline in prepayment fees. The
net interest margin was also impacted by a modest increase in
the percent of total earning assets funded by wholesale sources
of funding and higher interest rates paid on wholesale funding
due to the impact of rising rates. In addition, the net interest
margin declined year-over-year as a

U.S. BANCORP


result of consolidating high credit quality, low
margin loans from a commercial loan conduit previously
maintained by the Company onto the Company’s balance sheet
beginning in the third quarter of 2003.

Average loans in 2004 were $3.8 billion
(3.2 percent) higher than in 2003, reflecting growth in
residential mortgages, retail loans and commercial real estate
loans of $2.6 billion (22.5 percent),
$3.0 billion (7.9 percent) and $.1 billion
(.5 percent), respectively. Growth in these categories was
offset somewhat by an overall decline in average commercial
loans of $2.0 billion (4.8 percent).

Average investment securities were
$5.8 billion (15.5 percent) higher in 2004, compared
with 2003, reflecting the reinvestment of proceeds from
declining average commercial loan balances and loans held for
sale. Average noninterest-bearing deposits in 2004 were lower by
$1.9 billion (6.0 percent), compared with 2003. While
average branch-based noninterest-bearing deposits increased by
2.7 percent from 2003, mortgage-related escrow balances and
business-related noninterest-bearing deposits, including
corporate banking, mortgage banking and government deposits,
declined. Average interest-bearing deposits were higher by
$1.6 billion (1.8 percent), compared with 2003. The
year-over-year increase in average interest-bearing deposits
included increases in average savings products deposits of
$2.6 billion (4.6 percent) and time deposits greater
than $100,000 of $1.4 billion (11.0 percent),
partially offset by a decrease in time certificates of deposit
less than $100,000 of $2.4 billion (15.6 percent). The
decrease in time certificates of deposit less than $100,000 was
primarily due to pricing decisions by management in connection
with the Company’s overall funding and risk management
activities. Average net free funds increased $.3 billion in
2004, compared with 2003, including a decrease in average
noninterest-bearing deposits, other liabilities and other assets
of $1.9 billion (6.0 percent), $1.3 billion
(16.7 percent) and $3.1 billion (10.5 percent),
respectively. The decrease in other assets and liabilities
principally reflected the impact of the spin-off of Piper
Jaffray Companies.

Provision for Credit Losses

The provision for credit losses is
recorded to bring the allowance for credit losses to a level
deemed appropriate by management based on factors discussed in
the “Analysis and Determination of Allowance for Credit
Losses” section. The provision for credit losses was
$666 million in 2005, compared with $669 million and
$1,254 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively.

The decrease in the provision for credit losses
of $3 million (.4 percent) in 2005 reflected improving
levels of nonperforming loans resulting in lower total net
charge-offs

in 2005. Nonperforming loans, principally
reflecting changes in the quality of commercial and commercial
real estate loans, declined $96 million from
December 31, 2004. Net charge-offs declined
$82 million from 2004, the result of lower gross
charge-offs within the commercial and commercial real estate
loan portfolios. This improvement in commercial and commercial
real estate net charge-offs was offset somewhat by higher
residential and retail net charge-offs reflecting changes in the
mix of these portfolios and the impact of recently enacted
bankruptcy legislation.

In 2004, the decline in the provision for credit
losses of $585 million (46.7 percent) reflected continuing
improvement in the credit quality of the loan portfolio and
changing economic conditions. The changes in credit quality were
broad-based across most industries resulting in improving credit
risk ratings, a decline in nonperforming assets and lower total
net charge-offs. Commercial loan demand was soft in most markets
within the banking footprint during much of 2003 and 2004.
Overall, credit quality of the Company’s portfolios has
improved since 2002 due to better economic conditions and
enhancements in collection efforts, underwriting and risk
management practices. In response to these changes, the
Company’s allowance for credit losses has trended downward
since 2002. Refer to “Corporate Risk Profile” for
further information on the provision for credit losses, net
charge-offs, nonperforming assets and other factors considered
by the Company in assessing the credit quality of the loan
portfolio and establishing the allowance for credit losses.

Noninterest Income

Noninterest income in 2005 was
$6.0 billion, compared with $5.5 billion in 2004 and
$5.3 billion in 2003. The $526 million
(9.5 percent) increase in 2005 over 2004 was driven by
strong organic growth in the majority of fee income categories,
particularly payment processing revenues and deposit service
charges.

The growth in credit and debit card revenue of
9.9 percent was principally driven by higher customer
transaction volumes and rate changes from a year ago. The
corporate payment products revenue growth of 19.9 percent
reflected growth in sales, card usage, rate changes and the
recent acquisition of a small aviation card business. ATM
processing services revenue was higher by 30.9 percent
primarily due to the expansion of the ATM business in May of
2005. Merchant processing services revenue was higher by
14.1 percent in 2005, compared with 2004, reflecting an
increase in merchant sales volume and business expansion in
European markets. The increase in trust and investment
management fees was primarily attributable to improved equity
market conditions and account growth. Deposit service charges
were higher by 15.0 percent year-over-year due to new
account growth in the branches and higher transaction-related
service activities. The growth in mortgage banking revenue was
due to origination fees and gains from higher production volumes
and increased servicing income. Other income increased by
24.1 percent from 2004, primarily due to higher income from
equity investments and the cash surrender value of insurance
products relative to 2004. Partially offsetting these positive
variances year-over-year were decreases in treasury management
fees and commercial products revenue of 6.4 percent and
7.4 percent, respectively. The decrease in treasury
management fees was due to higher earnings credits on
customers’ compensating balances, reflecting rising
interest rates relative to a year ago, partially offset by
growth in treasury management-related activities. Commercial
products revenue declined due to reductions in non-yield loan
fees, syndications and fees for letters of credit.

In 2004, noninterest income increased
$206 million (3.9 percent), compared with 2003, driven
by strong organic growth in most fee-based products and services
categories, particularly in payment processing revenue.

U.S. BANCORP


Partially offsetting the increase in fee-based
revenue growth in 2004 was a year-over-year reduction in net
securities gains (losses) of $350 million. The growth
in credit and debit card revenue was driven by higher
transaction volumes and rate changes. This growth in sales
volumes was somewhat muted due to the impact of the settlement
of the antitrust litigation brought against VISA USA and
MasterCard by Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., Sears Roebuck & Co. and
other retailers, which lowered interchange rates on signature
debit transactions beginning in August 2003. The year-over-year
impact of VISA’s settlement on debit card revenue for 2004
was approximately $33 million. The corporate payment
products revenue growth reflected growth in sales, card usage
and rate changes. The favorable variance in ATM processing
services revenue was also due to increases in transaction
volumes and sales. Merchant processing services revenue was
higher in 2004, compared with 2003, reflecting an increase in
same store sales volume, new business and expansion of the
Company’s merchant acquiring business in Europe. Deposit
service charges increased in 2004 primarily due to account
growth, revenue enhancement initiatives and transaction-related
fees. Trust and investment management fees increased as gains
from equity market valuations were partially offset by lower
fees, partially due to a change in mix of fund balances and
customers’ migration from money market mutual funds to
interest-bearing deposits with marginally better pricing. During
2004, commercial products revenue increased primarily due to
syndication fees and commercial leasing revenue. The growth in
mortgage banking revenue was due to an increase in loan
servicing revenues, offset somewhat by lower gains from the sale
of mortgage loan production. Other noninterest income increased
principally due to improving retail lease residual values
resulting in lower end-of-term residual losses, a residual value
insurance recovery of $17 million during 2004 and improving
equity investment valuations.

Noninterest Expense

Noninterest expense in 2005 was
$5.9 billion, compared with $5.8 billion and
$5.6 billion in 2004 and 2003, respectively. The
$78 million (1.3 percent) increase in noninterest
expenses in 2005, compared with 2004, was primarily driven by
production-based incentives and expenses related to business
initiatives, including acquisitions investments, acquired
businesses, and production-based, offset by a $110 million
favorable change in the MSR valuation and a $101 million
decrease in debt prepayment charges. Compensation expense was
higher by 5.8 percent year-over-year principally due to
business expansion, including in-store branches, expanding the
Company’s payment processing businesses and other product
sales initiatives. Employee benefits increased
10.8 percent, year-over-year, primarily as a result of
higher pension expense, medical costs, payroll taxes and other
benefits. Professional services expense was higher by
11.4 percent due to increases in legal and other
professional services related to business initiatives,
technology development and integration costs of specific payment
processing businesses. Marketing and business development
expense increased 21.1 percent principally related to brand
awareness, credit card and prepaid gift card programs.
Technology and communications expense was higher in 2005 by 8.4
percent, reflecting depreciation of technology investments,
network costs associated with the expansion of the payment
processing businesses, and higher outside data processing
expense associated with expanding a prepaid gift card program.
Other expense declined 1.7 percent primarily due to lower
operating and fraud losses and insurance costs, partially offset
by increased investments in affordable housing and other
tax-advantaged projects and higher merchant processing costs due
to the expansion of the payment processing businesses relative
to 2004.

The noninterest expense increase of
$188 million (3.4 percent) in 2004, compared with
2003, principally reflected a $155 million charge related
to the prepayment of

a portion of the Company’s long-term debt,
costs related to business initiatives and incremental expenses
of $63 million due to the expansion of the Company’s
European merchant processing business. These increases were
offset somewhat by a net reduction in MSR impairments of
$152 million and lower merger and restructuring-related
charges. Compensation expense increased due to increases in
salaries and stock-based compensation. The increase in salaries
reflected business expansion of in-store branches, the expansion
of the Company’s merchant acquiring business in Europe and
other initiatives. Stock-based compensation was higher due to
lower employee stock-award forfeitures relative to prior years.
Employee benefits increased primarily as a result of higher
payroll taxes and pension expense. Marketing and business
development increased due to corporate brand advertising and an
increase in product marketing campaigns. Technology and
communications expense was higher year-over-year, reflecting
technology investments that increased software amortization and
the write-off of capitalized software being replaced. Other
expense increased in 2004, compared with 2003, related to higher
fraud and operating losses, insurance costs, operating costs
associated with affordable housing investments and merchant
processing costs for payment services products, the result of
the expansion of the payment processing business and increases
in transaction volume year-over-year.

Pension Plans

Because of the long-term nature of
pension plans, the administration and accounting for pensions is
complex and can be impacted by several factors, including
investment and funding policies, accounting methods and the
plan’s actuarial assumptions. The Company and its
Compensation Committee have an established process for
evaluating the plans, their performance and significant plan
assumptions, including the assumed discount rate and the
long-term rate of return (“LTROR”). At least annually,
an independent consultant is engaged to assist the
Company’s Compensation Committee in evaluating plan
objectives, funding policies and investment policies considering
its long-term investment time horizon and asset allocation
strategies. Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements provides further information on funding practices,
investment policies and asset allocation strategies.

Periodic pension expense (or credits) includes
service costs, interest costs based on the assumed discount
rate, the expected return on plan assets based on an actuarially
derived market-related value and amortization of actuarial gains
and losses. The Company’s pension accounting policy follows
guidance outlined in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 87, “Employer’s Accounting for Pension
Plans,” and reflects the long-term nature of benefit
obligations and the investment horizon of plan assets. This
accounting guidance has the effect of reducing earnings
volatility related to short-term changes in interest rates and
market valuations. Actuarial gains and losses include the impact
of plan amendments and various unrecognized gains and losses
which are deferred and amortized over the future service periods
of active employees. The actuarially derived market-related
value utilized to determine the expected return on plan assets
is based on fair value adjusted for the difference between
expected returns and actual performance of plan assets. The
unrealized difference between actual experience and expected
returns is included in the actuarially derived market-related
value ratably over a five-year period. At September 30,
2005, the accumulated unrecognized gain approximated
$206 million, compared with an accumulated unrecognized
loss of approximately $139 million at September 30,
2004. The impact to pension expense of the unrecognized asset
gains or losses will incrementally increase
(decrease) pension costs in each year from 2006 to 2010, by
approximately $30 million, $(3) million,
$(21) million, $(13) million and $(9) million,
respectively. This assumes that the performance of plan assets
equals the assumed LTROR. Actual results will vary depending on
the performance of plan assets and changes to assumptions
required in the future. Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the
Company’s accounting policies for pension plans.

In 2005, the Company recognized a pension cost of
$33 million compared with a pension cost of $9 million
in 2004 and pension credit of $24 million in 2003. The
$24 million increase in pension costs in 2005 was driven by
recognition of deferred actuarial (gains) losses and the
impact of a lower discount rate. In 2004, pension costs
increased by $33 million, compared with 2003, driven by a
recognition of deferred actuarial (gains) losses and the
impact of a lower discount rate, partially offset by the benefit
of higher investment income related to pension contributions
made in 2003.

In 2006, the Company anticipates that pension
costs will increase by approximately $48 million. The
increase will be primarily driven by the lower discount rate and
amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses from prior years,
accounting for approximately $12 million and

Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements provides a summary of the significant
pension plan assumptions. Because of the subjective nature of
plan assumptions, a sensitivity analysis to hypothetical changes
in the LTROR and the discount rate is provided below:

Due to the complexity of forecasting pension plan
activities, the accounting method utilized for pension plans,
management’s ability to respond to factors impacting the
plans and the hypothetical nature of this information, the
actual changes in periodic pension costs could be different than
the information provided in the sensitivity analysis.

Income Tax Expense

The provision for income taxes was
$2,082 million (an effective rate of 31.7 percent) in
2005, compared with $2,009 million (an effective rate of
32.5 percent) in 2004 and $1,941 million (an effective
rate of 34.3 percent) in 2003. The decrease in the
effective tax rate from 2004 primarily reflects higher tax
exempt income from investment securities and insurance products
and incremental tax credits generated from investments in
affordable housing and similar tax-advantaged projects.

Included in 2005 was a reduction of income tax
expense of $94 million related to the resolution of federal
income tax examinations covering substantially all of the
Company’s legal entities for the years 2000 through 2002.
Included in 2004 was a reduction in income tax expense of
$90 million related to the resolution of federal income tax
examinations covering substantially all of the Company’s
legal entities for the years 1995 through 1999 and
$16 million related to the resolution of a state tax
examination for tax years through 2000. The Company anticipates
its effective tax rate for the foreseeable future to approximate
33 percent.

BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS

Average earning assets were $178.4 billion
in 2005, compared with $168.1 billion in 2004. The increase
in average earning assets of $10.3 billion
(6.1 percent) was primarily driven by growth in residential
mortgages, commercial loans and retail loans. The change in
average earning assets was principally funded by increases of
$5.4 billion in interest-bearing deposits and
$5.9 billion in wholesale funding.

For average balance information, refer to
Consolidated Daily Average Balance Sheet and Related Yields and
Rates on pages 108 and 109.

Loans

The
Company’s total loan portfolio was $137.8 billion at
December 31, 2005, an increase of $11.5 billion
(9.1 percent) from December 31, 2004. The increase in
total loans was driven by growth in residential mortgages
(34.9 percent), commercial loans (6.9 percent), retail
loans (5.7 percent) and commercial real estate loans
(3.2 percent). Table 6 provides a summary of the loan
distribution by product type while Table 10 provides a summary
of selected loan maturity distribution by loan category. Average
total loans increased $11.0 billion (9.0 percent) in
2005, compared with 2004. The increase was due to growth in
residential mortgages, commercial loans and retail loans.

Commercial

Commercial loans, including lease
financing, increased $2.8 billion (6.9 percent) at
December 31, 2005, compared with December 31, 2004.
The increase in commercial loans was driven by new customer
relationships and increases in mortgage banking and corporate
card balances. Average commercial loans increased by
$3.3 billion (8.4 percent) in 2005, compared with
2004, primarily due to an increase in commercial loan demand
driven by general economic conditions in 2005.

Table 7 provides a summary of commercial
loans by industry and geographical locations.

COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE BY PROPERTY TYPE AND
    GEOGRAPHY

Commercial Real Estate

The Company’s portfolio of
commercial real estate loans, which includes commercial
mortgages and construction loans, increased $878 million
(3.2 percent) at December 31, 2005, compared with
December 31, 2004. Specifically, construction and
development loans increased by $921 million
(12.7 percent) as developers continued to take advantage of
relatively low interest rates. Commercial mortgages outstanding
decreased modestly by $43 million (.2 percent) as
growth in Small Business Administration (“SBA”) real
estate mortgages was more than offset by reductions in
traditional commercial real estate mortgages due to refinancing
activities. Average commercial real estate loans increased by
$697 million (2.6 percent) in 2005, compared with
2004, primarily driven by growth in construction and development
loans. Table 8 provides a summary of commercial real estate
by property type and geographical locations.

The Company maintains the real estate
construction designation until the completion of the
construction phase and, if retained, the loan is reclassified to
the commercial mortgage category. Approximately
$187 million of construction loans were permanently
financed and reclassified to the commercial mortgage loan
category in 2005. At year-end 2005, $219 million of
tax-exempt industrial development loans were secured by real
estate. The Company’s commercial real estate mortgages and
construction loans had unfunded commitments of $9.8 billion
at December 31, 2005, compared with $7.9 billion at
December 31, 2004. The Company also finances the operations
of real estate developers and other entities with operations
related to real estate. These loans are not secured directly by
real estate and are subject to terms and conditions similar to
commercial loans. These loans were included in the commercial
loan category and totaled $1.9 billion at December 31,
2005.

Residential Mortgages

Residential mortgages held in the loan
portfolio at December 31, 2005, increased $5.4 billion
(34.9 percent) from December 31, 2004. The increase
was primarily the result of asset/liability risk management
decisions to retain a greater portion of the Company’s
adjustable-rate loan production and an increase in consumer
finance originations. Average residential mortgages increased
$3.7 billion (25.9 percent) in 2005, primarily due to
retaining adjustable-rate residential mortgages beginning in
mid-2004.

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES AND RETAIL LOANS BY
    GEOGRAPHY

Retail

Total retail
loans outstanding, which include credit card, retail leasing,
home equity and second mortgages and other retail loans,
increased $2.5 billion (5.7 percent) at
December 31, 2005, compared with December 31, 2004.
The increase was driven by an increase in automobile loans and
installment loans, credit cards, home equity loans, student
loans and retail leasing, which increased $1.5 billion,
$534 million, $352 million, $176 million and
$172 million, respectively, during 2005. The increases in
these loan categories were offset somewhat by a reduction in
home equity lines of credit of $223 million during the
year. Average retail loans increased $3.3 billion
(7.9 percent) in 2005, reflecting growth in home equity
lines, installment loans, retail leasing and credit card. Of the
total retail loans and residential mortgages outstanding,
approximately 82.8 percent were to customers located in the
Company’s primary banking regions. Table 9 provides a
geographic summary of residential mortgages and retail loans
outstanding as of December 31, 2005.

Loans Held for Sale

At December 31, 2005, loans held
for sale, consisting of residential mortgages to be sold in the
secondary market, were $1.7 billion, compared with
$1.4 billion at December 31, 2004. Average loans held
for sale were $1.8 billion in 2005, compared with
$1.6 billion in 2004. The balance of loans held for sale is
primarily a function of mortgage loan production during the past
ninety days. During the fourth quarter of 2005, mortgage loan
production was approximately $6.1 billion compared with
$4.4 billion during the same period of 2004.

Investment Securities

The Company uses its investment
securities portfolio for several purposes. It serves as a
vehicle to manage interest rate and prepayment risk, generates
interest and dividend income from the investment of excess funds
depending on loan demand, provides liquidity and is used as
collateral for public deposits and wholesale funding sources.
While it is the Company’s intent to hold its investment
securities indefinitely, the Company may take actions in
response to structural changes in the balance sheet and related
interest rate risks and to meet liquidity requirements.

At December 31, 2005, investment securities,
both available-for-sale and held-to-maturity, totaled
$39.8 billion, compared with $41.5 billion at
December 31, 2004. The $1.7 billion (4.1 percent)
decrease primarily reflected purchases of $13.2 billion of
securities, more than offset by sales, maturities and
prepayments. During 2005,

Table 10

SELECTED LOAN MATURITY DISTRIBUTION

U.S. BANCORP


securities transactions were principally related
to asset/liability management decisions. At December 31,
2005, approximately 41 percent of the investment securities
portfolio represented adjustable-rate financial instruments,
compared with 39 percent at December 31, 2004.
Adjustable-rate financial instruments include variable-rate
collateralized mortgage obligations, mortgage-backed securities,
agency securities, adjustable-rate money market accounts and
asset-backed securities. Average investment securities were
$.9 billion (2.1 percent) lower in 2005, compared with
2004. The decline principally reflected the net impact of
repositioning the investment portfolio as part of
asset/liability risk management decisions to acquire
variable-rate securities.

The weighted-average yield of the
available-for-sale portfolio was 4.89 percent at
December 31, 2005,

compared with 4.43 percent at
December 31, 2004. The average maturity of the
available-for-sale portfolio increased to 6.10 years at
December 31, 2005, up from 4.45 years at
December 31, 2004. The relative mix of the type of
investment securities maintained in the portfolio is provided in
Table 11. At December 31, 2005, the available-for-sale
portfolio included a $662 million net unrealized loss,
compared with a net unrealized loss of $271 million at
December 31, 2004.

Deposits

Total
deposits were $124.7 billion at December 31, 2005,
compared with $120.7 billion at December 31, 2004,
resulting from increases in time deposits greater than $100,000,
time certificates of deposit less than $100,000 and
noninterest-bearing deposits, partially offset by a decrease in
money market savings accounts. Average total deposits in 2005
increased $4.8 billion (4.1 percent) from 2004,
reflecting growth in average time deposits greater than $100,000
and interest checking accounts. The increases in these
categories were offset somewhat by lower average money market
savings account balances and lower noninterest-bearing deposits.

Noninterest-bearing deposits at December 31,
2005, increased $1.5 billion (4.7 percent) from
December 31, 2004. The increase was primarily attributable
to increasing deposits related to corporate business deposits,
mortgage banking businesses and government banking deposits in
the Wholesale Banking business line relative to a year ago.
Corporate business deposits increased due to new customer
relationships and business customers utilizing less of their
deposit liquidity to fund business growth. Average
noninterest-bearing deposits in 2005 decreased $.6 billion
(2.0 percent), compared with 2004.

Interest-bearing savings deposits decreased
$2.6 billion (4.3 percent) at December 31, 2005,
compared with December 31, 2004. The decrease was primarily
due to a decrease in money market savings accounts. The
$2.5 billion (8.3 percent) decrease in money market
savings account balances reflected the Company’s deposit
pricing decisions in selected markets, given excess customer
liquidity throughout 2004 and a migration of some customer
balances to time deposits greater than $100,000 as rates
increased on time deposit products. Average interest-bearing
savings deposits in 2005 decreased $1.7 billion
(2.9 percent), compared with 2004, primarily driven by a
reduction in money market savings account balances of
$3.5 billion (10.8 percent) offset by higher interest
checking account balances of $1.9 billion
(8.8 percent).

DEPOSITS

The composition of deposits was as follows:

The maturity of time certificates of deposit less
than $100,000 and time deposits greater than $100,000 was as
follows:

U.S. BANCORP


Interest-bearing time deposits at
December 31, 2005, increased $5.1 billion
(16.6 percent), compared with December 31, 2004. The
increase was driven by increases of $4.4 billion
(24.5 percent) and $.7 billion (5.3 percent) in
time deposits greater than $100,000 and time certificates of
deposits less than $100,000, respectively. Changes in these
deposit categories were principally due to pricing decisions
based on the relative cost of funding. Average time deposits
greater than $100,000 increased $7.0 billion
(51.0 percent) and average time certificates of deposit
less than $100,000 increased $125 million (1.0 percent) in
2005, compared with 2004. Time deposits greater than $100,000
are largely viewed as purchased funds and are managed to levels
deemed appropriate given alternative funding sources.

Borrowings

The
Company utilizes both short-term and long-term borrowings to
fund growth of earning assets in excess of deposit growth.
Short-term borrowings, which include federal funds purchased,
securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other
short-term borrowings, were $20.2 billion at
December 31, 2005, compared with $13.1 billion at
December 31, 2004. Short-term funding is managed, within
approved liquidity policies, to levels deemed appropriate given
alternative funding sources. The increase of $7.1 billion
in short-term borrowings reflected wholesale funding associated
with the Company’s earning asset growth and asset/
liability management activities.

Long-term debt was $37.1 billion at
December 31, 2005, compared with $34.7 billion at
December 31, 2004, reflecting the issuances of
$5.5 billion of bank notes, $4.5 billion of convertible
senior debentures, $.5 billion of medium-term notes,
$.9 billion of subordinated debt, $1.0 billion of
junior subordinated debentures and the addition of
$3.1 billion of Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”)
advances, offset by long-term debt maturities, repayments and
the impact of the tender offer completed during 2005. Refer to
Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
for additional information regarding long-term debt and the
“Liquidity Risk Management” section for discussion of
liquidity management of the Company.

CORPORATE RISK PROFILE

Overview

Managing
risks is an essential part of successfully operating a financial
services company. The most prominent risk exposures are credit,
residual, operational, interest rate, market and liquidity risk.
Credit risk is the risk of not collecting the interest and/or
the principal balance of a loan or investment when it is due.
Residual risk is the potential reduction in the end-of-term
value of leased assets or the residual cash flows related to
asset securitization and other off-balance sheet structures.
Operational risk includes risks related to fraud, legal and
compliance risk, processing errors, technology, breaches of
internal controls and business continuation and disaster
recovery risk. Interest rate risk is the potential reduction of
net interest income as a result of changes in interest rates.
Rate movements can affect the repricing of assets and
liabilities differently, as well as their market value. Market
risk arises from fluctuations in interest rates, foreign
exchange rates, and equity prices that may result in changes in
the values of financial instruments, such as trading and
available-for-sale securities that are accounted for on a
mark-to-market basis. Liquidity risk is the possible inability
to fund obligations to depositors, investors or borrowers. In
addition, corporate strategic decisions, as well as the risks
described above, could give rise to reputation risk. Reputation
risk is the risk that negative publicity or press, whether true
or not, could result in costly litigation or cause a decline in
the Company’s stock value, customer base or revenue.

Credit Risk Management

The Company’s strategy for credit
risk management includes well-defined, centralized credit
policies, uniform underwriting criteria, and ongoing risk
monitoring and review processes for all commercial and consumer
credit exposures. The strategy also emphasizes diversification
on a geographic, industry and customer level, regular credit
examinations and management reviews of loans experiencing
deterioration of credit quality. The credit risk management
strategy also includes a credit risk assessment process,
independent of business line managers, that performs assessments
of compliance with commercial and consumer credit policies, risk
ratings, and other critical credit information. The Company
strives to identify potential problem loans early, take any
necessary charge-offs promptly and maintain adequate reserve
levels for probable loan losses inherent in the portfolio.
Commercial banking operations rely on prudent credit policies
and procedures and individual lender and business line manager
accountability. Lenders are assigned lending authority based on
their level of experience and customer service requirements.
Credit officers reporting to an independent credit
administration function have higher levels of lending authority
and support the business units in their credit decision process.
Loan decisions are documented as to the borrower’s
business, purpose of the loan, evaluation of the repayment
source and the associated risks, evaluation of collateral,
covenants and monitoring requirements, and risk rating
rationale. The Company utilizes a credit risk rating system to
measure the credit quality of individual commercial loan
transactions. The Company uses the risk rating system for
regulatory reporting, determining the frequency of review of the
credit exposures, and evaluation and determination of the
specific allowance for commercial credit losses. The Company
regularly forecasts potential changes in risk ratings,
nonperforming status and potential


U.S. BANCORP

for loss and the estimated impact on the
allowance for credit losses. In the Company’s retail
banking operations, standard credit scoring systems are used to
assess credit risks of consumer, small business and small-ticket
leasing customers and to price consumer products accordingly.
The Company conducts the underwriting and collections of its
retail products in loan underwriting and servicing centers
specializing in certain retail products. Forecasts of
delinquency levels, bankruptcies and losses in conjunction with
projection of estimated losses by delinquency categories and
vintage information are regularly prepared and are used to
evaluate underwriting and collection and determine the specific
allowance for credit losses for these products. Because business
processes and credit risks associated with unfunded credit
commitments are essentially the same as for loans, the Company
utilizes similar processes to estimate its liability for
unfunded credit commitments. The Company also engages in
non-lending activities that may give rise to credit risk,
including interest rate swap and option contracts for balance
sheet hedging purposes, foreign exchange transactions, deposit
overdrafts and interest rate swap contracts for customers, and
settlement risk, including Automated Clearing House
transactions, and the processing of credit card transactions for
merchants. These activities are also subject to credit review,
analysis and approval processes.

Economic and Other Factors

In evaluating its credit risk, the
Company considers changes, if any, in underwriting activities,
the loan portfolio composition (including product mix and
geographic, industry or customer-specific concentrations),
trends in loan performance, the level of allowance coverage
relative to similar banking institutions and macroeconomic
factors. Since mid-2003, economic conditions have steadily
improved as evidenced by stronger earnings across many corporate
sectors, higher equity valuations, and stronger retail sales and
consumer spending. In late 2003, unemployment rates stabilized
and began to decline from a high of 6.13 percent in the
third quarter of that year. However, the banking industry
continued to have elevated levels of nonperforming assets and
net charge-offs in 2003 compared with the late 1990’s.
Conditions within certain industries, including manufacturing
and airline transportation sectors, lagged behind the growth in
the broader economy especially in some markets served by the
Company.

During 2004, unemployment rates and bankruptcy
levels continued to improve. The trends related to consumer
spending for retail goods and services expanded throughout the
year. While corporate profits were strong, the index of
corporate profits retreated somewhat in the second quarter of
2004. As a result, equity markets stalled in the second and
third quarters of 2004 due to uncertainty related to corporate
profits and world events. Within the Company’s customer
base, commercial loan demand continued to be somewhat soft
through mid-2004. In the fourth quarter of 2004, most economic
indicators again began to expand and commercial loan balances
for the Company displayed year-over-year quarterly growth for
the first time since mid-2001.

Economic conditions continued to improve in 2005,
as reflected in strong expansion of the gross domestic product
index, lower unemployment rates, favorable trends related to
corporate profits and consumer spending for retail goods and
services. The Federal Reserve Bank pursued a measured approach
to increasing short-term rates in an effort to prevent an
acceleration of inflation and maintain the current rate of
economic growth.

In addition to economic factors, changes in
regulations and legislation can have an impact on the credit
performance of the loan portfolios. During 2005, the Company
began implementing higher minimum balance payment requirements
for its credit card customers in response to industry guidance
issued by the banking regulatory agencies. This industry
guidance was provided to minimize the likelihood that minimum
balance payments would not be sufficient to cover interest, fees
and a portion of the principal balance of a credit card loan
resulting in negative amortization, or increasing account
balances. Also, new bankruptcy legislation was enacted in
October 2005, making it more difficult for borrowers to have
their debts forgiven during bankruptcy proceedings. While these
changes may have a long term benefit, the lending industry may
experience increasing levels of nonperforming loans,
restructured loans and delinquencies over the short-term related
to consumer credit.

Credit Diversification

The Company manages its credit
risk, in part, through diversification of its loan portfolio. As
part of its normal business activities, it offers a broad array
of traditional commercial lending products and specialized
products such as asset-based lending, commercial lease
financing, agricultural credit, warehouse mortgage lending,
commercial real estate, health care and correspondent banking.
The Company also offers an array of retail lending products
including credit cards, retail leases, home equity, revolving
credit, lending to students and other consumer loans. These
retail credit products are primarily offered through the branch
office network, home mortgage and loan production offices,
indirect distribution channels, such as automobile dealers and a
consumer finance division. The Company monitors and manages the
portfolio diversification by industry, customer and geography.
Table 6 provides information with respect to the overall
product diversification and changes in the mix during 2005.

The commercial portfolio reflects the
Company’s focus on serving small business customers, middle
market and

U.S. BANCORP


larger corporate businesses throughout its
24-state banking region and large national customers within
certain niche industry groups. Table 7 provides a summary of the
significant industry groups and geographic locations of
commercial loans outstanding at December 31, 2005 and 2004.
The commercial loan portfolio is diversified among various
industries with somewhat higher concentrations in consumer
products and services, financial services, commercial services
and supplies, capital goods (including manufacturing and
commercial construction-related businesses), property management
and development and agricultural industries. Additionally, the
commercial portfolio is diversified across the Company’s
geographical markets with 81.4 percent of total commercial loans
within the 24-state banking region. Credit relationships outside
of the Company’s banking region are reflected within the
corporate banking, mortgage banking, auto dealer and leasing
businesses focusing on large national customers and specifically
targeted industries. Loans to mortgage banking customers are
primarily warehouse lines which are collateralized with the
underlying mortgages. The Company regularly monitors its
mortgage collateral position to manage its risk exposure.

The commercial real estate portfolio reflects the
Company’s focus on serving business owners within its
footprint as well as regional and national investment-based real
estate. At December 31, 2005, the Company had commercial
real estate loans of $28.5 billion, or 20.7 percent of
total loans, compared with $27.6 billion at
December 31, 2004. Within commercial real estate loans,
different property types have varying degrees of credit risk.
Table 8 provides a summary of the significant property types and
geographic locations of commercial real estate loans outstanding
at December 31, 2005 and 2004. At December 31, 2005,
approximately 32.4 percent of the commercial real estate
loan portfolio represented business owner-occupied properties
that tend to exhibit credit risk characteristics similar to the
middle market commercial loan portfolio. Generally, the
investment-based real estate mortgages are diversified among
various property types with somewhat higher concentrations in
multi-family, office and retail properties. While
investment-based commercial real estate continues to perform
with relatively strong occupancy levels and cash flows, these
categories of loans can be adversely impacted during a rising
rate environment. Included in commercial real estate at year end
2005 was approximately $.5 billion in loans related to land
held for development and $1.9 billion of loans related to
residential and commercial acquisition and development
properties. These loans are subject to quarterly monitoring for
changes in local market conditions due to a higher credit risk
profile. Acquisition and development loans continued to perform
well with strong market conditions; however, these loans can be
adversely impacted by a slow down in the housing market and
softening of demand. The commercial real estate portfolio is
diversified across the Company’s geographical markets with
92.0 percent of total commercial real estate loans
outstanding at December 31, 2005, within the 24-state
banking region.

Residential mortgages are originated through the
Company’s branches, loan production offices, a wholesale
network of originators and a consumer finance company. Within
the residential mortgage portfolio approximately 71 percent
had a loan-to-value of 80 percent or less at the date of
origination (39 percent of the consumer finance company
portfolio and 86 percent of the traditional mortgage
portfolio). Interest-only mortgages at December 31, 2005
represent 18 percent of the residential mortgage portfolio
(20 percent of the consumer finance company portfolio and
17 percent of the traditional mortgage portfolio). The
Company does not have any residential mortgages whose payment
schedule would cause balances to increase over time. The retail
loan portfolio principally reflects the Company’s focus on
consumers within its footprint of branches and certain niche
lending activities that are nationally focused. Within the
Company’s retail loan portfolio approximately
83.1 percent of the credit card balances relate to bank
branch, co-branded and affinity programs that generally
experience better credit quality performance than portfolios
generated through national direct mail programs. At
December 31, 2005, approximately 84.7 percent of the
student loan portfolio is federally guaranteed through various
programs reducing its risk profile. Table 9 provides a
geographical summary of the residential mortgage and retail loan
portfolios.

Loan Delinquencies

Trends in delinquency ratios
represent an indicator, among other considerations, of credit
risk within the Company’s loan portfolios. The entire
balance of an account is considered delinquent if the minimum
payment contractually required to be made is not received by the
specified date on the billing statement. The Company measures
delinquencies, both including and excluding nonperforming loans,
to enable comparability with other companies. Advances made
pursuant to servicing agreements to Government National Mortgage
Association (“GNMA”) mortgage pools whose repayments
of principal and interest are substantially insured by the
Federal Housing Administration or guaranteed by the Department
of Veterans Affairs are excluded from delinquency statistics. In
addition, under certain situations, a retail customer’s
account may be re-aged to remove it from delinquent status.
Generally, the intent of a re-aged account is to assist
customers who have recently overcome temporary financial
difficulties, and have demonstrated both the ability and
willingness to resume regular payments. To qualify for re-


U.S. BANCORP

aging, the account must have been open for at
least one year and cannot have been re-aged during the preceding
365 days. An account may not be re-aged more than two times
in a five year period. To qualify for re-aging, the customer
must also have made three regular minimum monthly payments
within the last 90 days. In addition, the Company may
re-age the retail account of a customer who has experienced
longer-term financial difficulties and apply modified,
concessionary terms and conditions to the account. Such
additional re-ages are limited to one in a five year period,
must meet the qualifications for re-aging described above,
except that the customer’s three consecutive minimum
monthly payments may be based on the modified terms and
conditions applied to the account, and continue to be reported
in restructured loans. All re-aging strategies must be
independently approved by the Company’s credit
administration function and are limited to credit card and other
retail accounts. Commercial loans are not subject to re-aging
policies.

Accruing loans 90 days or more past due
totaled $253 million at December 31, 2005, compared
with $294 million at December 31, 2004, and
$329 million at December 31, 2003. These loans were
not included in nonperforming assets and continue to accrue
interest because they are adequately secured by collateral,
and/or are in the process of collection and are reasonably
expected to result in repayment or restoration to current
status. The ratio of 90 day delinquent loans to total loans
was .18 percent at December 31, 2005, compared with
..23 percent at December 31, 2004.

To monitor credit risk associated with retail
loans, the Company also monitors delinquency ratios in the
various stages of collection. In general, delinquency ratios for
retail loans continued to improve relative to December 31,
2004, reflecting the Company’s ongoing improvement in
collection efforts, underwriting, risk management and stable

    6.07 percent at December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
    respectively. Information prior to 2003 is not
    available.

The following table provides summary delinquency
information for residential mortgages and retail loans:

Nonperforming Assets

The level of nonperforming assets
represents another indicator of the potential for future credit
losses. The Company’s continued focus on improving the
credit process and improving economic conditions since mid-2003
were the primary factors in reducing the overall credit risk
profile during the past several years. Recent changes in
regulation and bankruptcy laws may effect delinquency levels in
the short-term.

Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans,
restructured loans not performing in accordance with modified
terms, other real estate and other nonperforming assets owned by
the Company. Interest payments collected from assets on
nonaccrual status are typically applied against the principal
balance and not recorded as income. At December 31, 2005,
total nonperforming assets were $644 million, compared with
$748 million at year-end 2004 and $1,148 million at
year-end 2003. The ratio of total nonperforming assets to total
loans and other real estate decreased to .47 percent at
December 31, 2005, compared with .59 percent and
..97 percent at the end of 2004 and 2003, respectively. The
$104 million decrease in total nonperforming assets in 2005
principally reflected decreases in nonperforming commercial and
commercial real estate loans, partially offset by increases in
nonperforming retail loans and residential mortgages. The
decrease in nonperforming commercial loans in 2005 was
broad-based across most industry sectors within the commercial
loan portfolio including capital goods, consumer-related
sectors, manufacturing and certain segments of transportation.
The transportation industry, particularly the airline industry,
continues to be economically stressed and has had difficulty
improving cash flows from operations. While airline travel
continues to improve, the recovery of the industry has been
prolonged due to intense competition from low-cost providers,
the nature of their cost structure and rising fuel prices. The
reduction in nonperforming commercial real estate loans during
2005, was broad-based and extended across most property types.
Nonperforming retail loans increased by $49 million from a
year ago, primarily due to implementing a program for customers
having financial difficulties meeting recent minimum balance
payment requirements. Retail customers that meet certain
criteria may have the terms of their credit card and other loan
agreements modified to allow amortization of their balances over
a period of up to 60 months. The Company has considered
these loans in the determination of the allowance for credit
losses.


U.S. BANCORP

Residential mortgage loans on nonaccrual status
increased slightly during 2005 primarily reflecting growth in
the portfolio. As a percentage of loan balances, nonperforming
residential mortgages declined to .23 percent at
December 31, 2005 compared with .28 percent at
December 31, 2004.

The $400 million decrease in total
nonperforming assets in 2004, as compared with 2003, reflected
decreases in nonperforming commercial, commercial real estate
and retail loans, partially offset by an increase in
nonperforming residential mortgages. The decrease in
nonperforming assets in 2004 was also broad-based across most
industry sectors within the commercial loan portfolio including
capital goods, consumer-related sectors, manufacturing and
certain segments of transportation.

Included in nonperforming loans were restructured
commercial, commercial real estate and retail loans of
$75 million and $58 million at December 31, 2005
and 2004, respectively. Commitments to lend additional funds
under restructured loans were $9 million at
December 31, 2005, compared with $12 million as of
December 31, 2004. Restructured loans performing under the
restructured terms beyond a specified timeframe are reported as
“restructured loans” and accrue interest.

Company’s collection of its balance. Loans restructured at
a rate equal to or greater than that of a new loan with
comparable risk at the time the contract is modified are
excluded from restructured loans once repayment performance, in
accordance with the modified agreement, has been demonstrated
over several payment cycles. Loans that have interest rates
reduced below comparable market rates remain classified as
restructured loans; however, interest income is accrued at the
reduced rate as long as the customer complies with the revised
terms and conditions.

The following table provides a summary of
restructured loans that continue to accrue interest:

Analysis of Loan Net Charge-Offs

Total loan net charge-offs were
$685 million in 2005, compared with $767 million in
2004 and $1,252 million in 2003. The ratio of total loan
net charge-offs to average loans was .51 percent in 2005,
compared with .63 percent in 2004 and 1.06 percent in
2003. The overall level of net charge-offs in 2005 and 2004
reflected improving economic conditions and the Company’s
efforts to reduce the overall risk profile of the portfolio
through ongoing improvement in collection efforts underwriting
and risk management. These factors have resulted in improving
credit quality, lower gross charge-offs and high levels of
commercial loan recoveries.

Commercial and commercial real estate loan net
charge-offs for 2005 were $90 million (.13 percent of
average loans outstanding), compared with $196 million
(.29 percent of average loans outstanding) in 2004 and
$609 million (.89 percent of average loans
outstanding) in 2003. The year-over-year improvement in net
charge-offs was broad-based across most industries within the
commercial loan portfolio. The Company anticipates commercial
loan recoveries will decline somewhat over the next several
quarters causing commercial loan net charge-offs to stabilize or
slightly increase in 2006. The decrease in commercial and
commercial real estate loan net charge-offs in 2004, when
compared with 2003, was broad-based and extended across most
industries within the commercial loan portfolio and reflected
higher levels of commercial loan recoveries principally within
the Wholesale Banking line of business.

Retail loan net charge-offs in 2005 were
$559 million (1.26 percent of average loans
outstanding), compared with $542 million (1.32 percent
of average loans outstanding) in 2004 and $616 million
(1.61 percent of average loans outstanding) in 2003. Higher
levels of retail loan net charge-offs in 2005, compared with
2004, reflected approximately $56 million of charge-offs
related to the new bankruptcy legislation. The Company
anticipates that the higher level of

    the allowance for credit losses under “Losses from loan

bankruptcy filings that occurred in late 2005
will result in lower bankruptcy filings through the first half
of 2006 before returning to more normalized levels. Lower levels
of retail loan net charge-offs in 2004, compared with 2003,
principally reflected changes by the Company in underwriting,
ongoing collection efforts and other risk management activities.
The decline also reflected lower delinquency ratios from 2003 as
the economy continued to improve.

The Company’s retail lending business
utilizes several distinct business processes and channels to
originate retail credit including traditional branch credit,
indirect lending and a consumer finance division. Each distinct
underwriting and origination activity manages unique credit risk
characteristics and prices its loan production commensurate with
the differing risk profiles. Within Consumer Banking, U.S. Bank
Consumer Finance (“USBCF”) participates in all facets
of the Company’s consumer lending activities. USBCF
specializes in serving channel-specific and alternative lending
markets in residential mortgages, home equity and installment
loan financing. USBCF manages loans originated through a broker
network, correspondent relationships and U.S. Bank branch
offices. Generally, loans managed by the Company’s consumer
finance division exhibit higher credit risk characteristics, but
are priced commensurate with the differing risk profile.

The following table provides an analysis of net
charge-offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding managed
by the consumer finance division, compared with traditional
branch related loans:

Analysis and Determination of the Allowance
for Credit Losses

The allowance
for loan losses provides coverage for probable and estimable
losses inherent in the Company’s loan and lease portfolio.
Management evaluates the allowance each quarter to determine
that it is adequate to cover these inherent losses. The
evaluation of each element and the overall allowance is based on
a continuing assessment of problem loans, recent loss experience
and other factors, including regulatory guidance and economic
conditions. Because business processes and credit risks
associated with unfunded credit commitments are essentially the
same as for loans, the Company utilizes similar processes to
estimate its liability for unfunded credit commitments, which is
included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Both the allowance for loan losses and the liability for
unfunded credit commitments are included in the Company’s
analysis of credit losses.

At December 31, 2005, the allowance for
credit losses was $2,251 million (1.63 percent of
loans). This compares with an allowance of $2,269 million
(1.80 percent of loans) at December 31, 2004, and
$2,369 million (2.00 percent of loans) at
December 31, 2003. The ratio of the allowance for credit
losses to nonperforming loans was 414 percent at year-end
2005, compared with 355 percent at year-end 2004 and
232 percent at year-end 2003. The ratio of the allowance
for credit losses to loan net charge-offs was 329 percent
at year-end 2005, compared with 296 percent at year-end
2004 and 189 percent at year-end 2003. Management
determined that the allowance for credit losses was adequate at
December 31, 2005.

Several factors were taken into consideration in
evaluating the allowance for credit losses at December 31,
2005, including the risk profile of the portfolios and loan net
charge-offs during the period, the level of nonperforming
assets, accruing loans 90 days or more past due and
delinquency ratios compared with December 31, 2004.
Management also considered the uncertainty related to certain
industry sectors, including the airline industry, and the extent
of credit exposure to other borrowers within the portfolio. In
addition, concentration risks associated with commercial real
estate and the mix of loans, including credit cards, loans
originated through the consumer finance division and residential
mortgages balances, and their relative credit risks were
evaluated. Finally, the Company considered current economic
conditions that might impact the portfolio. Management
determines the allowance that is required for specific loan
categories based on relative risk characteristics of the loan
portfolio. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its methods
for determining the allowance for each element of the portfolio
and makes enhancements considered appropriate. Table 17 shows
the amount of the allowance for credit losses by portfolio
category.

The allowance recorded for commercial and
commercial real estate loans is based on a regular review of
individual credit relationships. The Company’s risk rating
process is an integral component of the methodology utilized to
determine these elements of the allowance for credit losses. An
allowance for credit losses is established for pools of
commercial and commercial real estate loans and unfunded
commitments based on the risk ratings assigned. An analysis of
the migration of commercial and commercial real estate loans and
actual loss experience throughout the business cycle is also
conducted quarterly to assess the exposure for credits with
similar risk characteristics. In addition to its risk rating
process, the Company separately analyzes the carrying value of
impaired loans to determine whether the carrying value is less
than or equal to the appraised collateral value or the present
value of expected cash flows. Based on this analysis, an
allowance for credit losses may be specifically established for
impaired loans. The allowance established for commercial and
commercial real estate loan portfolios, including impaired
commercial and commercial real estate loans, was
$929 million at December 31, 2005, compared with
$941 million and $1,015 million at December 31,
2004 and 2003, respectively. The decline in the allowance for
commercial and commercial real estate loans of $12 million
at December 31, 2005, compared with December 31, 2004,
reflected a $21 million reduction related to changes in
loss severity rates, offset somewhat by the impact of growth in
the portfolios and a $9 million increase related to changes
in risk classifications.

The allowance recorded for the residential
mortgages and retail loan portfolios is based on an analysis of
product mix, credit scoring and risk composition of the
portfolio, loss and bankruptcy experiences, economic conditions
and historical and expected delinquency and charge-off
statistics for each homogenous group of loans. Based on this
information and analysis, an allowance was established
approximating a rolling twelve-month estimate of net
charge-offs. The allowance established for residential mortgages
was $39 million at December 31, 2005, compared with
$33 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. The increase in the allowance for the residential
mortgage portfolio year-over-year was primarily due to growth of
the portfolio during 2005. The allowance established for retail
loans was $558 million at December 31, 2005, compared
with $610 million and $651 million at
December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The decline in
the allowance for the retail portfolio in 2005 reflected
improved credit quality favorably impacting inherent loss ratios
and declining delinquency trends, partially offset by the impact
of portfolio growth.

U.S. BANCORP


Regardless of the extent of the Company’s
analysis of customer performance, portfolio trends or risk
management processes, certain inherent but undetected losses are
probable within the loan portfolios. This is due to several
factors, including inherent delays in obtaining information
regarding a customer’s financial condition or changes in
their unique business conditions, the judgmental nature of
individual loan evaluations, collateral assessments and the
interpretation of economic trends. Volatility of economic or
customer-specific conditions affecting the identification and
estimation of losses from larger non-homogeneous credits and the
sensitivity of assumptions utilized to establish allowances for
homogeneous groups of loans, loan portfolio concentrations, and
other subjective considerations are among other factors. Because
of these subjective factors, the process utilized to determine
each element of the allowance for credit losses by specific loan
category has some imprecision. As such, the Company estimates a
range of inherent losses in the portfolio based on statistical
analyses and management judgment, and maintains an
“allowance available for other factors” that is
related to but not allocated to a specific loan category. A
statistical analysis attempts to measure the extent of
imprecision by determining the volatility of losses over time
across loan categories. Also, management judgmentally considers
loan concentrations, risks associated with specific industries,
the stage of the business cycle, economic conditions and other
qualitative factors. Based on this process, the amount of the
allowance available for other factors was $725 million at
December 31, 2005, compared with $685 million at
December 31, 2004, and $670 million at
December 31, 2003. At December 31, 2005, approximately
$592 million was related to estimated imprecision as
described above. Of this amount, commercial and commercial real
estate represented approximately 68 percent while
residential and retail loans represented approximately
32 percent. The remaining allowance available for other
factors of $133 million was related to concentration risk,
including risks associated with the sluggish airline industry,
relative size of the consumer finance and commercial real estate
portfolios, highly leveraged enterprise-value credits,
uncertainty regarding credit card losses during the transition
to higher minimum balance payments and other qualitative
factors. Given the many subjective factors affecting the credit
portfolio, changes in the allowance for other factors may not
directly coincide with changes in the risk ratings or the credit
portfolio.

Although the Company determines the amount of
each element of the allowance separately and this process is an
important credit management tool, the entire allowance for
credit losses is available for the entire loan portfolio. The
actual amount of losses incurred can vary significantly from the
estimated amounts. Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for accounting policies
related to the allowance for credit losses.

Residual Risk Management

The Company manages its risk to
changes in the residual value of leased assets through
disciplined residual valuation setting at the inception of a

Table 17

ELEMENTS OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES


U.S. BANCORP

lease, diversification of its leased assets,
regular residual asset valuation reviews and monitoring of
residual value gains or losses upon the disposition of assets.
Commercial lease originations are subject to the same
well-defined underwriting standards referred to in the
“Credit Risk Management” section which includes an
evaluation of the residual risk. Retail lease residual risk is
mitigated further by originating longer-term vehicle leases and
effective end-of-term marketing of off-lease vehicles. Also, to
reduce the financial risk of potential changes in vehicle
residual values, the Company maintains residual value insurance.
The catastrophic insurance maintained by the Company provides
for the potential recovery of losses on individual vehicle sales
in an amount equal to the difference between:
(a) 105 percent or 110 percent of the average
wholesale auction price for the vehicle at the time of sale and
(b) the vehicle residual value specified by the Automotive
Lease Guide (an authoritative industry source) at the inception
of the lease. The potential recovery is calculated for each
individual vehicle sold in a particular policy year and is
reduced by any gains realized on vehicles sold during the same
period. The Company will receive claim proceeds under this
insurance program if, in the aggregate, there is a net loss for
such period. In addition, the Company obtains separate residual
value insurance for all vehicles at lease inception where end of
lease term settlement is based solely on the residual value of
the individual leased vehicles. Under this program, the
potential recovery is computed for each individual vehicle sold
and does not allow the insurance carrier to offset individual
determined losses with gains from other leases. This individual
vehicle coverage is included in the calculation of minimum lease
payments when making the capital lease assessment. To reduce the
risk associated with collecting insurance claims, the Company
monitors the financial viability of the insurance carrier based
on insurance industry ratings and available financial
information.

Included in the retail leasing portfolio was
approximately $4.3 billion of retail leasing residuals at
December 31, 2005, compared with $4.0 billion at
December 31, 2004. The Company monitors concentrations of
leases by manufacturer and vehicle “make and model.”
At year-end 2005, no vehicle-type concentration exceeded five
percent of the total number of vehicles in the aggregate
portfolio. Because retail residual valuations tend to be less
volatile for longer-term leases, relative to the estimated
residual at inception of the lease, the Company actively manages
lease origination production to achieve a longer-term portfolio.
At December 31, 2005, the weighted-average origination term
of the portfolio was 51 months. Since early 2003, the
wholesale market for used vehicles has been in a period of
sustained recovery, resulting in the improvement of residual
values. Within vehicle categories, wholesale values for
automobiles have performed better than trucks, experiencing an
increase in average wholesale prices of 13.6 percent during
2005, while trucks have seen an increase of 2.8 percent.
The smaller increase in truck values is attributed to a market
decline in demand for full size, midsize, and luxury sport
utility vehicles. These models have not experienced price
increases as great as automobiles due to the impact of higher
gas prices on consumer buying patterns, an oversupply in the
marketplace, and the emergence of the crossover segments. The
improvement in the used car marketplace combined with the mix of
the Company’s lease residual portfolio have reduced the
exposure to retail lease residual impairments relative to a year
ago.

At December 31, 2005, the commercial leasing
portfolio had $678 million of residuals, compared with
$769 million at December 31, 2004. At year-end 2005,
lease residuals related to trucks and other transportation
equipment were 25.1 percent of the total residual portfolio.
Railcars represented 17.7 percent of the aggregate
portfolio, while business and office equipment and aircraft were
17.2 percent and 16.6 percent, respectively. No other
significant concentrations of more than 10 percent existed
at December 31, 2005. In 2005, residual values in general
improved or remained stable. The transportation industry
residual values improved for marine, rail and corporate
aircraft. Commercial aircraft continues to experience lower
values due to the abundance of supply and technological
efficiencies on newer models.

Operational Risk Management

Operational risk represents the risk
of loss resulting from the Company’s operations, including,
but not limited to, the risk of fraud by employees or persons
outside the Company, the execution of unauthorized transactions
by employees, errors relating to transaction processing and
technology, breaches of the internal control system and
compliance requirements and business continuation and disaster
recovery. This risk of loss also includes the potential legal
actions that could arise as a result of an operational
deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable
regulatory standards, adverse business decisions or their
implementation, and customer attrition due to potential negative
publicity.

The Company operates in many different businesses
in diverse markets and relies on the ability of its employees
and systems to process a high number of transactions.
Operational risk is inherent in all business activities, and the
management of this risk is important to the achievement of the
Company’s objectives. In the event of a breakdown in the
internal control system, improper operation of systems or
improper employees’ actions, the Company could suffer
financial loss, face regulatory action and suffer damage to its
reputation.

U.S. BANCORP


The Company manages operational risk through a
risk management framework and its internal control processes.
Within this framework, the Corporate Risk Committee (“Risk
Committee”) provides oversight and assesses the most
significant operational risks facing the Company within its
business lines. Under the guidance of the Risk Committee,
enterprise risk management personnel establish policies and
interact with business lines to monitor significant operating
risks on a regular basis. Business lines have direct and primary
responsibility and accountability for identifying, controlling,
and monitoring operational risks embedded in their business
activities. Business managers maintain a system of controls with
the objective of providing proper transaction authorization and
execution, proper system operations, safeguarding of assets from
misuse or theft, and ensuring the reliability of financial and
other data. Business managers ensure that the controls are
appropriate and are implemented as designed.

Each business line within the Company has
designated risk managers. These risk managers are responsible
for, among other things, coordinating the completion of ongoing
risk assessments and ensuring that operational risk management
is integrated into business decision-making activities. Business
continuation and disaster recovery planning is also critical to
effectively manage operational risks. Each business unit of the
Company is required to develop, maintain and test these plans at
least annually to ensure that recovery activities, if needed,
can support mission critical functions including technology,
networks and data centers supporting customer applications and
business operations. The Company’s internal audit function
validates the system of internal controls through risk-based,
regular and ongoing audit procedures and reports on the
effectiveness of internal controls to executive management and
the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.

Customer-related business conditions may also
increase operational risk or the level of operational losses in
certain transaction processing business units, including
merchant processing activities. Ongoing risk monitoring of
customer activities and their financial condition and
operational processes serve to mitigate customer-related
operational risk. Refer to Note 23 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on
merchant processing.

While the Company believes that it has designed
effective methods to minimize operational risks, there is no
absolute assurance that business disruption or operational
losses would not occur in the event of a disaster. On an ongoing
basis, management makes process changes and investments to
enhance its systems of internal controls and business continuity
and disaster recovery plans.

Interest Rate Risk Management

In the banking industry, changes in
interest rates is a significant risk that can impact earnings,
market valuations and safety and soundness of an entity. To
minimize the volatility of net interest income and of the market
value of assets and liabilities, the Company manages its
exposure to changes in interest rates through asset and
liability management activities within guidelines established by
its Asset Liability Policy Committee (“ALPC”) and
approved by the Board of Directors. ALPC has the responsibility
for approving and ensuring compliance with ALPC management
policies, including interest rate risk exposure. The Company
uses Net Interest Income Simulation Analysis and Market Value of
Equity Modeling for measuring and analyzing consolidated
interest rate risk.

Net Interest Income Simulation Analysis

One of the primary tools used to
measure interest rate risk and the effect of interest rate
changes on rate sensitive income and net interest income is
simulation analysis. The monthly analysis incorporates
substantially all of the Company’s assets and liabilities
and off-balance sheet instruments, together with forecasted
changes in the balance sheet and assumptions that reflect the
current interest rate environment. Through these simulations,
management estimates the impact on interest rate sensitive
income of a 300 basis point upward or downward gradual
change of market interest rates over a one-year period. The
simulations also estimate the effect of immediate and sustained
parallel shifts in the yield curve of 50 basis points as
well as the effect of immediate and sustained flattening or
steepening of the yield curve. These simulations include
assumptions about how the balance sheet is likely to be affected
by changes in loan and deposit growth. Assumptions are made to
project interest rates for new loans and deposits based on
historical analysis, management’s outlook and repricing
strategies. These assumptions are validated on a periodic basis.
A sensitivity analysis is provided for key variables of the
simulation. The results are reviewed by ALPC monthly and are
used to guide asset/liability management strategies.

The table on page 45 summarizes the interest
rate risk of net interest income and rate sensitive income based
on forecasts over the succeeding 12 months. At
December 31, 2005, the Company’s overall interest rate
risk position was liability sensitive to changes in interest
rates. Rate sensitive income includes net interest income as
well as other income items that are sensitive to interest rates,
including asset management fees, mortgage banking and the impact
from compensating deposit balances. The Company manages its
interest rate risk position by holding assets on the balance
sheet with desired interest rate risk characteristics,
implementing certain pricing strategies for loans and


U.S. BANCORP

deposits and through the selection of derivatives
and various funding and investment portfolio strategies. The
Company manages the overall interest rate risk profile within
policy limits. ALPC policy guidelines limit the estimated change
in interest rate sensitive income to 5.0 percent of
forecasted interest rate sensitive income over the succeeding
12 months. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company
was within its policy guidelines.

Market Value of Equity
Modeling

The Company also utilizes
the market value of equity as a measurement tool in managing
interest rate sensitivity. The market value of equity measures
the degree to which the market values of the Company’s
assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments will
change given a change in interest rates. ALPC guidelines limit
the change in market value of equity in a 200 basis point
parallel rate shock to 15 percent of the market value of
equity assuming interest rates at December 31, 2005. The up
200 basis point scenario resulted in a 6.8 percent decrease
in the market value of equity at December 31, 2005,
compared with a 2.7 percent decrease at December 31,
2004. The down 200 basis point scenario resulted in a
4.1 percent decrease in the market value of equity at
December 31, 2005, compared with a 4.2 percent
decrease at December 31, 2004. At December 31, 2005
and 2004, the Company was within its policy guidelines.

The valuation analysis is dependent upon certain
key assumptions about the nature of assets and liabilities with
non-contractual maturities. Management estimates the average
life and rate characteristics of asset and liability accounts
based upon historical analysis and management’s expectation
of rate behavior. These assumptions are validated on a periodic
basis. A sensitivity analysis of key variables of the valuation
analysis is provided to ALPC monthly and is used to guide
asset/liability management strategies. The Company also uses
duration of equity as a measure of interest rate risk. The
duration of equity is a measure of the net market value
sensitivity of the assets, liabilities and derivative positions
of the Company. The duration of assets was 1.61 years at
December 31, 2005, compared with 1.63 years at
December 31, 2004. The duration of liabilities was
1.57 years at December 31, 2005, compared with
1.89 years at December 31, 2004. At December 31,
2005, the duration of equity was 1.84 years, compared with
..12 years at December 31, 2004. The increased duration
of equity measure shows that sensitivity of the market value of
equity of the Company was liability sensitive to changes in
interest rates.

Use of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate
Risk

In the ordinary course of
business, the Company enters into derivative transactions to
manage its interest rate, prepayment and foreign currency risks
(“asset and liability management positions”) and to
accommodate the business requirements of its customers
(“customer-related positions”). To manage its interest
rate risk, the Company may enter into interest rate swap
agreements and interest rate options such as caps and floors.
Interest rate swaps involve the exchange of fixed-rate and
variable-rate payments without the exchange of the underlying
notional amount on which the interest payments are calculated.
Interest rate caps protect against rising interest rates while
interest rate floors protect against declining interest rates.
In connection with its mortgage banking operations, the Company
enters into forward commitments to sell mortgage loans related
to fixed-rate mortgage loans held for sale and fixed-rate
mortgage loan commitments. The Company also acts as a seller and
buyer of interest rate contracts and foreign exchange rate
contracts on behalf of customers. The Company minimizes its
market and liquidity risks by taking similar offsetting
positions.

All interest rate derivatives that qualify for
hedge accounting are recorded at fair value as other assets or
liabilities on the balance sheet and are designated as either
“fair value” or “cash flow” hedges. The
Company performs an assessment, both at inception and quarterly
thereafter, when required, to determine whether these
derivatives are highly effective in offsetting changes in the
value of the hedged items. Hedge ineffectiveness for both cash
flow and fair value hedges is recorded in noninterest income.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as fair
value hedges, and changes in the fair value of the hedged items,
are recorded in earnings. Changes in the fair value of
derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in other
comprehensive income until income from the cash flows of the
hedged items is realized. Customer-related interest rate swaps,
foreign exchange rate contracts, and all other derivative
contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recorded
at fair value and resulting gains or losses are recorded in
trading account gains or losses or mortgage banking revenue.

By their nature, derivative instruments are
subject to market risk. The Company does not utilize derivative
instruments for speculative purposes. Of the Company’s
$30.2 billion of total notional amount of asset and
liability management derivative positions at December 31,
2005, $27.4 billion was designated as either fair value or
cash flow hedges, or net investment hedges of foreign
operations. The cash flow hedge derivative positions are
interest rate swaps that hedge the forecasted cash flows from
the underlying variable-rate LIBOR loans and floating-rate debt.
The fair value hedges are primarily interest rate swaps that
hedge the change in fair value related to interest rate changes
of underlying fixed-rate debt and subordinated obligations.

In addition, the Company uses forward commitments
to sell residential mortgage loans to hedge its interest rate
risk related to residential mortgage loans held for sale. The
Company commits to sell the loans at specified prices in a
future period, typically within 90 days. The Company is
exposed to interest rate risk during the period between issuing
a loan commitment and the sale of the loan into the secondary
market. Related to its mortgage banking

operations, the Company held $1.1 billion of
forward commitments to sell mortgage loans and $1.1 billion
of unfunded mortgage loan commitments that were derivatives in
accordance with the provisions of the Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 133, “Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedge Activities.” The unfunded
mortgage loan commitments are reported at fair value as options
in Table 18.

Derivative instruments are also subject to credit
risk associated with counterparties to the derivative contracts.
Credit risk associated with derivatives is measured based on the
replacement cost should the counterparties with contracts in a
gain position to the Company fail to perform under the terms of
the contract. The Company manages this risk through
diversification of its derivative positions among various
counterparties, requiring collateral agreements with
credit-rating thresholds, entering into master netting
agreements in certain cases and entering into interest rate swap
risk participation agreements. These agreements are credit
derivatives that transfer the credit risk related to interest
rate swaps from the Company to an unaffiliated third-party. The
Company also provides credit protection to third-parties with
risk participation agreements, for a fee, as part of a loan
syndication transaction.

At December 31, 2005, the Company had
$10 million in accumulated other comprehensive income
related to realized and unrealized losses on derivatives
classified as cash flow hedges. The unrealized losses will be
reflected in earnings when the related cash flows or hedged
transactions occur and will offset the related performance of
the hedged items. The estimated amount of gain to be
reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into
earnings during the next 12 months is $26 million.

Gains or losses on customer-related derivative
positions were not material in 2005. The change in fair value of
forward commitments attributed to hedge ineffectiveness recorded
in noninterest income was a decrease of $4 million in 2005,
compared with an increase of $1 million in 2004. The change
in the fair value of all other asset and liability management
derivative positions attributed to hedge ineffectiveness was a
decrease of $2 million in 2005.

The Company may enter into derivatives to protect
its net investment in certain foreign operations. The Company
uses forward commitments to sell specified amounts of certain
foreign currencies to hedge its capital volatility risk
associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
The net amount of gains or losses included in the cumulative
translation adjustment for 2005 was not material.

Table 18 summarizes information on the
Company’s derivative positions at December 31, 2005.
Refer to Notes 1 and 21 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for significant accounting policies and
additional information regarding the Company’s use of
derivatives.

Market Risk
Management

In addition to interest
rate risk, the Company is exposed to other forms of market risk
as a consequence of conducting normal trading activities.
Business activities that contribute to market risk include,
among other things, proprietary trading and foreign exchange
positions. Value at Risk (“VaR”) is a key measure of
market risk for the Company. Theoretically, VaR represents the
maximum amount that the Company has placed at risk of loss, with
a ninety-ninth percentile degree of confidence, to adverse
market movements in the course of its risk taking activities.

VaR modeling of trading activities is subject to
certain limitations. Additionally, it should be recognized that
there are assumptions and estimates associated with VaR
modeling, and actual results could differ from those assumptions
and estimates. The Company mitigates these uncertainties through
regular monitoring of trading activities by management and other
risk management practices, including stop-loss and position
limits related to its trading activities. Stress-test models are
used to provide management with perspectives on market events
that VaR models do not capture.

The Company establishes market risk limits,
subject to approval by the Company’s Board of Directors.
The Company’s VaR limit was $20 million at
December 31, 2005 and 2004. The market valuation risk
inherent in its customer-based derivative trading, mortgage
banking pipeline and foreign exchange, as estimated by the VaR
analysis, was $1 million at December 31, 2005, and
$2 million at December 31, 2004.

Liquidity Risk
Management

ALPC establishes policies,
as well as analyzes and manages liquidity, to ensure that
adequate funds are available to meet normal operating
requirements in addition to unexpected customer demands for
funds, such as high levels of deposit withdrawals or loan
demand, in a timely and cost-effective manner. The most
important factor in the preservation of liquidity is maintaining
public confidence that facilitates the retention and growth of a
large, stable supply of core deposits and wholesale funds.
Ultimately, public confidence is generated through profitable
operations, sound credit quality and a strong capital position.
The Company’s performance in these areas has enabled it to
develop a large and reliable base of core funding within its
market areas and in domestic and global capital markets.
Liquidity management is viewed from long-term and short-term
perspectives, as well as from an asset and liability
perspective. Management monitors liquidity through a regular
review of maturity profiles, funding sources, and loan and
deposit forecasts to minimize funding risk.

The Company maintains strategic liquidity and
contingency plans that are subject to the availability of asset
liquidity in the balance sheet. Monthly, ALPC reviews the

U.S. BANCORP


Company’s ability to meet funding
requirements due to adverse business events. These funding needs
are then matched with specific asset-based sources to ensure
sufficient funds are available. Also, strategic liquidity
policies require diversification of wholesale funding sources to
avoid concentrations in any one market source. Subsidiary banks
are members of various Federal Home Loan Banks
(“FHLB”) that provide a source of funding through FHLB
advances. The Company maintains a Grand Cayman branch for
issuing eurodollar time deposits. The Company also issues
commercial paper through its Canadian branch. In addition, the
Company establishes relationships with dealers to issue national
market retail and institutional savings certificates and short-
and medium-term bank notes. The Company’s subsidiary banks
also have significant correspondent banking networks and
corporate accounts. Accordingly, the Company has access to
national fed funds, funding through repurchase agreements and
sources of more stable, regionally-based certificates of deposit
and commercial paper.

The Company’s ability to raise negotiated
funding at competitive prices is influenced by rating
agencies’ views of the Company’s credit quality,
liquidity, capital and earnings. On January 27, 2006,
Standard & Poor’s Rating Services upgraded the
Company’s credit ratings to AA-/A-1+. Standard &
Poor’s also upgraded the Company’s primary banking
subsidiaries to an AA long-term debt rating. At January 27,
2006, the credit ratings outlook for the Company was considered
“Stable” by Moody’s Investors Service, Standard
& Poor’s and Fitch Ratings. The debt ratings noted in
Table 19, upgraded for the Standard & Poor’s
January of 2006 upgrade, reflect the rating agencies’
recognition of the Company’s sector-leading core earnings
performance and lower credit risk profile.

The parent company’s routine funding
requirements consist primarily of operating expenses, dividends
to shareholders, debt service, repurchases of common stock and
funds used for acquisitions. The parent company obtains funding
to meet its obligations from dividends collected from its
subsidiaries and the issuance of debt securities.

At December 31, 2005, parent company
long-term debt outstanding was $10.9 billion, compared with
$6.9 billion at December 31, 2004. The
$4.0 billion increase was primarily due to issuances of
convertible senior debentures of $4.5 billion, medium-term notes
of $.5 billion and junior subordinated debentures of
$1.0 billion, offset by long-term debt maturities and
repayments during 2005. Total parent company debt scheduled to
mature in 2006 is $626 million. These debt obligations may
be met through medium-term note and capital security issuances
and dividends from subsidiaries, as well as from parent company
cash and cash equivalents.

Federal banking laws regulate the amount of
dividends that may be paid by banking subsidiaries without prior
approval. The amount of dividends available to the parent
company from its banking subsidiaries after meeting the
regulatory capital requirements for well-capitalized banks was
approximately $1.0 billion at December 31, 2005. For
further information, see Note 24 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Refer to Table 20 for further information on
significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2005.

Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangements

Off-balance sheet
arrangements include any contractual arrangement to which an
unconsolidated entity is a party, under which the Company has an
obligation to provide credit or liquidity enhancements or market
risk support. Off-balance sheet arrangements include certain
defined guarantees, asset securitization trusts and conduits.
Off-balance sheet arrangements also include any obligation under
a variable interest held by an unconsolidated entity that
provides financing, liquidity, credit enhancement or market risk
support.

In the ordinary course of business, the Company
enters into an array of commitments to extend credit, letters of
credit and various forms of guarantees that may be considered
off-balance sheet arrangements. The nature and

Table 19

DEBT RATINGS


U.S. BANCORP

extent of these arrangements are provided in
Note 23 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Asset securitizations and conduits represent a
source of funding for the Company through off-balance sheet
structures. Credit, liquidity, operational and legal structural
risks exist due to the nature and complexity of asset
securitizations and other off-balance sheet structures. ALPC
regularly monitors the performance of each off-balance sheet
structure in an effort to minimize these risks and ensure
compliance with the requirements of the structures. The Company
utilizes its credit risk management systems to evaluate the
credit quality of underlying assets and regularly forecasts cash
flows to evaluate any potential impairment of retained
interests. Also, regulatory guidelines require consideration of
asset securitizations in the determination of risk-based capital
ratios. The Company does not rely significantly on off-balance
sheet arrangements for liquidity or capital resources.

The Company sponsors an off-balance sheet
conduit, a qualified special purpose entity (“QSPE”),
to which it transferred high-grade investment securities, funded
by the issuance of commercial paper. Because QSPE’s are
exempt from consolidation under the provisions of Financial
Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46R,
“Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities”
(“FIN 46R”), the Company does not consolidate the
conduit structure in its financial statements. The conduit held
assets of $3.8 billion at December 31, 2005, and
$5.7 billion at December 31, 2004. These investment
securities include primarily (i) private label asset-backed
securities, which are insurance “wrapped” by
AAA/Aaa-rated mono-line insurance companies and
(ii) government agency mortgage-backed securities and
collateralized mortgage obligations. The conduit had commercial
paper liabilities of $3.8 billion at December 31,
2005, and $5.7 billion at December 31, 2004. The
Company provides a liquidity facility to the conduit.
Utilization of the liquidity facility would be triggered if the
conduit is unable to, or does not, issue commercial paper to
fund its assets. A liability for the estimate of the potential
risk of loss the Company has as the liquidity facility provider
is recorded on the balance sheet in other liabilities. The
liability is adjusted downward over time as the underlying
assets pay down with the offset recognized as other noninterest
income. The liability for the liquidity facility was
$20 million and $32 million at December 31, 2005
and 2004, respectively. In addition, the Company recorded at
fair value its retained residual interest in the investment
securities conduit of $28 million and $57 million at
December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Capital Management

The Company is committed to managing capital for maximum
shareholder benefit and maintaining strong protection for
depositors and creditors. The Company has targeted returning
80 percent of earnings to our shareholders through a
combination of dividends and share repurchases. In keeping with
this target, the Company returned 90 percent of earnings in
2005. The Company continually assesses its business risks and
capital position. The Company also manages its capital to exceed
regulatory capital requirements for well-capitalized bank
holding companies. To achieve these capital goals, the Company
employs a variety of capital management tools, including
dividends, common share repurchases, and the issuance of
subordinated debt and other capital instruments. Total
shareholders’ equity was $20.1 billion at
December 31, 2005, compared with $19.5 billion at
December 31, 2004. The increase was the result of corporate
earnings, offset by share repurchases and dividends.

On December 20, 2005, the Company increased
its dividend rate per common share by 10 percent, from $.30
per quarter to $.33 per quarter. On December 21, 2004, the
Company increased its dividend rate per common share by
25.0 percent, from $.24 per quarter to $.30 per
quarter.

On December 16, 2003, the Board of Directors
approved an authorization to repurchase 150 million shares
of common stock over the following 24 months. In 2004, the
Company repurchased 89 million shares of common stock under
the December 2003 plan. On December 21, 2004, the Board of
Directors approved an authorization to repurchase
150 million shares of common stock during the

next 24 months. This new authorization
replaced the December 16, 2003, authorization. During 2004,
the Company purchased 5 million shares of common stock
under the plan. The average price paid for the 94 million
shares repurchased during 2004 was $28.34 per share. In 2005,
the Company purchased 62 million shares under the 2004
plan. The average price paid for the shares repurchased in 2005
was $29.37 per share. For a complete analysis of activities
impacting shareholders’ equity and capital management
programs, refer to Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

The following table provides a detailed analysis
of all shares repurchased under this authorization during the
fourth quarter of 2005:

All shares purchased during the fourth quarter
    of 2005 were purchased under the publicly announced

Banking regulators define minimum capital
requirements for banks and financial services holding companies.
These requirements are expressed in the form of a minimum
Tier 1 capital ratio, total risk-based capital ratio, and
Tier 1 leverage ratio. The minimum required level for these
ratios is 4.0 percent, 8.0 percent, and 4.0 percent,
respectively. The Company targets its regulatory capital levels,
at both the bank and bank holding company level, to exceed the
“well-capitalized” threshold for these ratios of
6.0 percent, 10.0 percent, and 5.0 percent,
respectively. All regulatory ratios, at both the bank and bank
holding company level, continue to be in excess of stated
“well-capitalized” requirements.

Table 21 provides a summary of capital ratios as
of December 31, 2005 and 2004, including Tier 1 and
total risk-based capital ratios, as defined by the regulatory
agencies. During 2006, the Company expects to target capital
level ratios of 8.5 percent Tier 1 capital and
12.0 percent total risk-based capital on a consolidated
basis.

FOURTH QUARTER SUMMARY

The Company reported net income of
$1,143 million for the fourth quarter of 2005, or $.62 per
diluted share, compared with $1,056 million, or $.56 per
diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2004. Return on average
assets and return on average equity were 2.18 percent and
22.6 percent, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2005,
compared with returns of 2.16 percent and 21.2 percent,
respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2004. The Company’s
results for the fourth quarter of 2005 improved over the same
period of 2004, as net income rose by $87 million
(8.2 percent), primarily due to growth in fee-based
products and services and a debt restructuring charge taken in
the fourth quarter of 2004, partially offset by a release of the
loan loss allowance in the fourth quarter of 2004. In addition,
income tax expense was lower in the fourth quarter of 2005,
driven by the timing of investments that generate incremental
tax credits. In addition, the Company’s

Table 21

REGULATORY CAPITAL RATIOS


U.S. BANCORP

results reflect an $81 million favorable
change in the valuation of MSRs, due to changing longer-term
interest rates. These favorable changes were partially offset by
higher securities losses of $28 million compared with the
fourth quarter of 2004 and additional bankruptcy-related credit
losses of approximately $56 million in the fourth quarter
of 2005.

Total net revenue, on a taxable-equivalent basis
for the fourth quarter of 2005, was $96 million
(3.0 percent) higher than the fourth quarter of 2004,
primarily reflecting a 7.7 percent increase in noninterest
income due to 9.5 percent growth in fee-based revenue
across the majority of fee categories and expansion in payment
processing businesses. This was partially offset by the increase
in securities losses compared with the fourth quarter of 2004
driven by asset/liability risk management decisions given the
flatter yield curve and continued growth in fixed-rate loan
products.

Fourth quarter net interest income, on a
taxable-equivalent basis was $1,785 million, compared with
$1,800 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. Average
earning assets increased by $12.2 billion
(7.1 percent), primarily driven by a $5.3 billion
(35.1 percent) increase in residential mortgages, a
$3.6 billion (8.9 percent) increase in total
commercial loans and a $2.7 billion (6.3 percent)
increase in total retail loans. The positive impact to net
interest income from the growth in earning assets was offset by
a lower net interest margin. The net interest margin for the
fourth quarter of 2005 was 3.88 percent, compared with
4.20 percent in the fourth quarter of 2004. The decline in
net interest margin reflected the current lending environment,
asset/liability management decisions and the impact of changes
in the yield curve from a year ago. Since the fourth quarter of
2004, credit spreads have tightened by approximately 25 basis
points across most lending products due to competitive pricing,
growth in noninterest-bearing corporate payment card balances
and a change in mix due to growth in lower-spread, fixed-rate
credit products. The net interest margin also declined due to
funding incremental asset growth with higher cost wholesale
funding, share repurchases and asset/liability decisions
designed to minimize the Company’s rate sensitivity
position, including an 18.3 percent reduction in the net
receive fixed swap position since December 31, 2004. An
increase in the margin benefit of net free funds and loan fees
partially offset these factors.

Noninterest income in the fourth quarter of 2005
was $1,546 million, compared with $1,435 million in
the same period of 2004. The $111 million
(7.7 percent) increase was driven by favorable variances in
the majority of fee income categories, partially offset by a
$28 million reduction in net securities gains (losses).
Credit and debit card revenue and corporate payment products
revenue were both higher in the fourth quarter of 2005 than the
fourth quarter of 2004 by $13 million and $25 million,
or 7.1 percent and 24.8 percent, respectively. The
growth in credit and debit card revenue was primarily driven by
higher transaction volumes. The corporate payment products
revenue growth reflected growth in sales, card usage, rate
changes and the

acquisition of a small aviation card business.
ATM processing services revenue was higher by $18 million
(41.9 percent) in the fourth quarter of 2005 than the same
quarter of the prior year, primarily due to the expansion of the
ATM business in May of 2005. Merchant processing services
revenue was higher in the fourth quarter of 2005 than the same
quarter of 2004 by $13 million (7.2 percent),
reflecting an increase in sales volume and new business. Trust
and investment management fees increased $17 million
(7.1 percent) year-over-year, primarily due to improved
equity market conditions and account growth. Deposit service
charges increased year-over-year by $26 million
(12.3 percent) due to account growth and
transaction-related activities. Mortgage banking revenue was
higher in the fourth quarter of 2005 than the same quarter of
2004 by $13 million (13.5 percent), due to higher
production volumes and increased servicing income. Other income
was higher by $27 million (18.9 percent), primarily
due to higher income from equity and other investments relative
to the same quarter of 2004. Partially offsetting these positive
variances, year-over-year, were reductions in commercial
products revenue and treasury management fees, which declined by
$7 million (6.5 percent) and $6 million
(5.5 percent), respectively. The decrease in commercial
products revenue was due to reductions in loan-related fees and
international product revenue. Treasury management fees declined
due to higher earnings credits on customers’ compensating
balances relative to a year ago, reflecting rising interest
rates, partially offset by growth in treasury management-related
activities.

Noninterest expense was $1,464 million in
the fourth quarter of 2005, a decrease of $115 million
(7.3 percent) from the fourth quarter of 2004. The decrease
in expense year-over-year included the $113 million charge
related to the prepayment of the Company’s long-term debt
in the prior year and the $81 million favorable change in
the MSR valuation. Compensation expense was higher
year-over-year by $22 million (3.8 percent),
principally due to business expansion, including in-store
branches, the Company’s payment processing businesses and
other growth initiatives. Employee benefits increased
year-over-year by $3 million (3.1 percent), primarily
as a result of higher payroll taxes, 401(k) costs and other
benefits. Marketing and business development expense increased
$15 million (30.6 percent) due to the timing of
payment processing business program initiatives in 2005.
Technology and communications expense rose by $13 million
(11.2 percent), reflecting depreciation of technology
investments, network costs associated with expansion of the
payment processing businesses and higher outside data processing
expense principally associated with expanding a prepaid gift
program. Other expense increased in the fourth quarter of 2005
from the same quarter of 2004 by $20 million
(10.5 percent), primarily due to the $35 million
incremental impact from amortization of investments in
tax-advantaged projects.

The provision for credit losses for the fourth
quarter of 2005 was $205 million, an increase of
$141 million from the fourth quarter of 2004. The increase
in the provision for credit losses year-over-year reflected a
$56 million provision in the fourth quarter of 2005 related
to charge-offs related to new bankruptcy legislation and a
reduction in the allowance for credit losses of $99 million
in the fourth quarter of 2004. Net charge-offs in the fourth
quarter of 2005 were $213 million, compared with net
charge-offs of $163 million during the fourth quarter of
2004.

The provision for income taxes for the fourth
quarter of 2005 declined to an effective tax rate of
30.8 percent from an effective tax rate of
33.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2004. The decline
primarily reflected the Company’s decision to increase
tax-advantaged investments and the timing of making these
investments. The Company expects its effective tax rate to
approximate 33 percent in future periods.

LINE OF BUSINESS FINANCIAL REVIEW

Within the Company, financial performance is
measured by major lines of business, which include Wholesale
Banking, Consumer Banking, Private Client, Trust and Asset
Management, Payment Services, and Treasury and Corporate
Support. These operating segments are components of the Company
about which financial information is available and is evaluated
regularly in deciding how to allocate resources and assess
performance.

Basis of Presentation

Business line results are derived from
the Company’s business unit profitability reporting systems
by specifically attributing managed balance sheet assets,
deposits and other liabilities and their related income or
expense. Goodwill and other intangible assets are assigned to
the lines of business based on the mix of business of the
acquired entity. Within the Company, capital levels are
evaluated and managed centrally; however, capital is allocated
to the operating segments to support evaluation of business
performance. Capital allocations to the business lines are based
on the amount of goodwill and other intangibles, the extent of
off-balance sheet managed assets and lending commitments and the
ratio of on-balance sheet assets relative to the total Company.
Certain lines of business, such as Private Client, Trust and
Asset Management, have no significant balance sheet components.
For these business units, capital is allocated taking into
consideration fiduciary and operational risk, capital levels of
independent organizations operating similar businesses, and
regulatory requirements. Interest income and expense is
determined based on the assets and liabilities managed by


U.S. BANCORP

the business line. Because funding and asset
liability management is a central function, funds
transfer-pricing methodologies are utilized to allocate a cost
of funds used or credit for funds provided to all business line
assets and liabilities, respectively, using a matched funding
concept. Also, the business unit is allocated the
taxable-equivalent benefit of tax-exempt products. Noninterest
income and expenses directly managed by each business line,
including fees, service charges, salaries and benefits, and
other direct costs are accounted for within each segment’s
financial results in a manner similar to the consolidated
financial statements. Occupancy costs are allocated based on
utilization of facilities by the lines of business. Operating
losses are charged to the line of business when the loss event
is realized in a manner similar to a loan charge-off.
Noninterest expenses incurred by centrally managed operations or
business lines that directly support another business
line’s operations are charged to the applicable business
line based on its utilization of those services primarily
measured by the volume of customer activities, number of
employees or other relevant factors. These allocated expenses
are reported as net shared services expense within noninterest
expense. Certain activities that do not directly support the
operations of the lines of business or for which the line of
business is not considered accountable are not charged to the
lines of business. The income or expenses associated with these
corporate activities is reported within the Treasury and
Corporate Support line of business. The provision for credit
losses within the Wholesale Banking, Consumer Banking, Private
Client, Trust and Asset Management and Payment Services lines of
business is based on net charge-offs, while Treasury and
Corporate Support reflects the residual component of the
Company’s total consolidated provision for credit losses
determined in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. Income taxes are assessed to each
line of business at a standard tax rate with the residual tax
expense or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax
rate included in Treasury and Corporate Support.

Designations, assignments and allocations change
from time to time as management systems are enhanced, methods of
evaluating performance or product lines change or business
segments are realigned to better respond to our diverse customer
base. During 2005, certain organization and methodology changes
were made and, accordingly, 2004 results were restated and
presented on a comparable basis. Due to organizational and
methodology changes, the Company’s basis of financial
presentation differed in 2003. The presentation of comparative
business line results for 2003 is not practical and has not been
provided.

Wholesale Banking

offers lending, depository, treasury
management and other financial services to middle market, large
corporate and public sector clients. Wholesale Banking
contributed $1,063 million of the Company’s net income
in 2005, an increase of $79 million (8.0 percent),
compared with 2004. The increase was primarily driven by growth
in total net revenue and reductions in total noninterest expense
and the provision for credit losses.

Total net revenue increased $71 million
(3.0 percent) in 2005, compared with 2004. Net interest
income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, increased
$63 million (4.0 percent) in 2005, compared with 2004,
driven by growth in average loan balances of approximately
$2.6 billion and wider spreads on deposits due to the
funding benefit associated with the impact of rising interest
rates, partially offset by reduced loan spreads due to
competitive pricing. The increase in average loans was driven by
stronger commercial loan demand beginning in late 2004 and
continuing throughout 2005. Total deposits increased
year-over-year, driven by growth in time deposits, partially
offset by decreases in noninterest-bearing and interest checking
deposits. Average savings products balances in 2005 were also
lower than 2004. The shift in mix of deposits is partially due
to the result of deposit pricing by the Company for money market
products in relation to other fixed-rate deposits offered. The
$8 million (1.0 percent) increase in noninterest
income in 2005, compared with 2004, was due to higher revenue
from equity investments, partially offset by reductions in
treasury management fees and other commercial loan fees.
Treasury management fees declined due to higher earnings credits
on customers’ compensating balances, partially offset by
growth in treasury management-related activities.

Noninterest expense decreased $7 million
(.8 percent) in 2005 compared to 2004, due to reductions in
net shared services, fraud losses and other loan expenses,
partially offset by an increase in personnel expenses.

The provision for credit losses decreased
$46 million in 2005, compared with 2004. The favorable
change in the provision for credit losses during 2005, was due
to improving credit quality in the commercial loan portfolio
resulting in net recoveries of $24 million in 2005,
compared with net charge-offs of $22 million in 2004.
Nonperforming assets within Wholesale Banking were
$242 million at December 31, 2005, compared with
$387 million at December 31, 2004. Nonperforming
assets as a percentage of end-of-period loans were
..54 percent at December 31, 2005, compared with
..91 percent at December 31, 2004. Refer to the
“Corporate Risk Profile” section for further
information on factors impacting the credit quality of the loan
portfolios.

U.S. BANCORP


Consumer Banking

delivers products and services through
banking offices, telephone servicing and sales, on-line
services, direct mail and ATMs. It encompasses community
banking, metropolitan banking, in-store banking, small business
banking, including lending guaranteed by the Small Business
Administration, small-ticket leasing, consumer lending, mortgage
banking, consumer finance, workplace banking, student banking,
24-hour banking and investment product and insurance sales.
Consumer Banking contributed $1,788 million of the
Company’s net income in 2005, an increase of
$315 million (21.4 percent), compared with 2004. While
the retail banking business grew net income 23.6 percent in
2005, the contribution of the mortgage banking business declined
1.6 percent, compared with 2004.

Total net revenue increased $495 million
(8.9 percent) in 2005, compared with 2004. Net interest
income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, increased
$332 million in 2005, compared with 2004. The
year-over-year increase in net interest income was due to strong
growth in average loans and the funding benefit of deposits due
to rising interest rates. Partially offsetting these increases
were reduced spreads on commercial and retail loans due to
competitive pricing. The increase in average loan balances
reflected growth in retail loans, residential mortgages,
commercial loans and commercial real estate loans. Included
within the retail loan category are second-lien home equity
loans, installment loans and retail leases which had a growth
rate of 6.6 percent, 10.1 percent and
10.4 percent, respectively, in 2005, compared with the
prior year. Residential mortgages, including traditional
residential mortgages and first-lien home equity loans, grew
26.2 percent in 2005, compared with 2004, reflecting the
Company’s decision to retain adjustable-rate residential
mortgages. The year-over-year decrease in average deposits of
..7 percent reflected a reduction in noninterest-bearing
deposits and savings products, offset by growth in interest
checking and time deposits. The decline in noninterest-bearing
deposits in 2005, compared with the prior year, was primarily
due to the Company’s decision to migrate $1.3 billion
of certain high-value customer accounts to interest checking as
an

enhancement to its Silver Elite Checking product
in late 2004. The year-over-year increase in interest checking
balances reflected this migration of the Silver Elite product
and strong branch-based new account deposit growth. On a
combined basis, the Consumer Banking line of business generated
growth of $1.2 billion (4.2 percent) in average
checking account balances in 2005, compared with 2004, driven by
6.1 percent growth in net new checking accounts. Offsetting
this growth was a reduction in average savings balances of
$2.9 billion (10.7 percent) from 2004, principally
related to money market accounts. The decline reflected deposit
pricing by the Company for money market products in relation to
other fixed-rate deposits offered. Average time deposit balances
grew $1.2 billion (7.2 percent) in 2005, compared with
the prior year, as a portion of money market balances migrated
to time deposit products.

Fee-based noninterest income increased
$163 million in 2005, compared with 2004, driven by strong
deposit service charges and mortgage banking revenue growth,
partially offset by lower treasury management fees. Deposit
service charges were higher due to new account growth and higher
transaction-related service activities. The growth in mortgage
banking revenue was due to strong loan production generating
origination fees and gains from production volumes and increased
servicing income.

Noninterest expense increased $66 million
(2.3 percent) in 2005, compared with the prior year. The
increase was primarily attributable to compensation and employee
benefits expense, reflecting the impact of adding thirty-six
in-store and thirteen traditional branches during 2005 and
production-based incentives.

The provision for credit losses decreased
$65 million in 2005, compared with 2004. The improvement
was primarily attributable to strong credit quality during the
year. As a percentage of average loans outstanding, net
charge-offs declined to .43 percent in 2005, compared with
..58 percent in 2004. The decline in net charge-offs
included both the commercial and retail loan portfolios. The
$44 million improvement in commercial loan net charge-offs
in 2005, compared with 2004, was broad-based across most
industry and geographical regions. Retail loan net

U.S. BANCORP


charge-offs declined by $12 million in 2005,
compared to 2004, primarily resulting from ongoing collection
efforts and risk management activities. Nonperforming assets
within Consumer Banking were $341 million at
December 31, 2005, and $353 million at
December 31, 2004. Nonperforming assets as a percentage of
end-of-period loans were .47 percent at December 31,
2005, and .56 percent at December 31, 2004. Refer to
the “Corporate Risk Profile” section for further
information on factors impacting the credit quality of the loan
portfolios.

Private Client, Trust and Asset
Management

provides trust, private
banking, financial advisory, investment management and mutual
fund servicing through five businesses: Private Client Group,
Corporate Trust, Asset Management, Institutional Trust and
Custody and Fund Services. Private Client, Trust and Asset
Management contributed $484 million of the Company’s
net income in 2005, or an increase of $90 million
(22.8 percent), compared with 2004. The growth was
primarily attributable to strong revenue growth in this business
line.

Total net revenue increased $130 million
(9.5 percent) in 2005, compared with 2004. Net interest
income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, increased
$91 million (25.1 percent) in 2005, compared with the
prior year, due to 10.7 percent growth in average deposits
and the favorable impact of rising interest rates on the funding
benefit of customer deposits. The increase in total deposits was
attributable to growth in noninterest-bearing deposits and time
deposits, principally in Corporate Trust. Noninterest income
increased $39 million (3.9 percent) in 2005, compared
with 2004, driven by improved equity market conditions and
account growth.

Noninterest expense decreased $7 million
(1.0 percent) in 2005, compared with 2004, primarily due to
reductions in operating losses and net shared services,
partially offset by higher personnel-related costs.

The provision for credit losses decreased
$5 million in 2005, compared with 2004. The decrease was
due to a reduction in net charge-offs. Net charge-offs as a
percentage of average loans outstanding were .10 percent in
2005, compared with .21 percent in 2004.

Payment Services

includes consumer and business credit
cards, stored-value cards, debit cards, corporate and purchasing
card services, consumer lines of credit, ATM processing and
merchant processing. Payment Services contributed
$715 million of the Company’s net income in 2005, or
an increase of $59 million (9.0 percent), compared
with 2004. The increase was due to growth in total net revenue,
partially offset by increases in total noninterest expense and
the provision for loan losses.

Total net revenue increased $312 million
(12.7 percent) in 2005, compared 2004. The 2005 increase in
net interest income of $12 million, compared with the prior
year, was attributable to increases in retail and commercial
credit card balances and customer late fees, partially offset by
corporate card rebates and the margin impact of higher
non-earning assets. Noninterest income increased
$300 million (15.9 percent) in 2005, compared with
2004. The increase in fee-based revenue was driven by strong
growth in credit and debit card revenue, corporate payment
products revenue, ATM processing services revenue and merchant
processing revenue. Credit and debit card revenue increased
primarily due to higher customer transaction volumes and rate
changes from a year ago. Corporate payment products revenue
increased primarily due to growth in sales volume, card usage,
rate changes and the recent acquisition of a small aviation card
business. ATM processing services revenue increased primarily
due to the expansion of the business through the acquisition of
a small ATM processing company in the second quarter of 2005.
Merchant processing revenue increased due to increases in
merchant sales volume and business expansion in European markets.

Noninterest expense increased $196 million
(18.6 percent) in 2005, compared with 2004, primarily due
to higher compensation and employee benefit costs for processing
associated with increased credit and debit card transaction
volumes, higher corporate payment products and merchant
processing sales volumes, higher ATM processing services volumes
due to the ATM business acquisition and higher merchant
acquiring costs resulting from the expansion of the merchant
acquiring business and increases in transaction volume
year-over-year.

The provision for credit losses increased
$22 million in 2005, compared with 2004, due to higher net
charge-offs. The unfavorable change in credit losses was
primarily driven by additional charge-offs related to new
bankruptcy legislation. As a percentage of average loans
outstanding, net charge-offs were 3.37 percent in 2005,
compared with 3.42 percent in 2004.

Treasury and Corporate Support

includes the Company’s investment
portfolios, funding, capital management and asset securitization
activities, interest rate risk management, the net effect of
transfer pricing related to average balances and the residual
aggregate of those expenses associated with corporate activities
that are managed on a consolidated basis. Treasury and Corporate
Support recorded net income of $439 million in 2005, or a
decrease of $221 million, compared with 2004.

Total net revenue decreased $534 million
(60.3 percent) in 2005, compared with 2004, primarily due
to a decrease in net interest income. Net interest income was
$409 million, or 5.8 percent of consolidated net
interest income, in 2005 compared with $959 million, or


U.S. BANCORP

13.4 percent of consolidated net interest
income, in 2004. The decline of $550 million reflected
asset/liability management decisions to borrow more in the
capital markets, a higher interest rate environment and the
reduction of net receive fixed swap positions as short-term
rates have risen over the past eighteen months.

Noninterest expense decreased $170 million
(57.4 percent) in 2005, compared with 2004. The
year-over-year decrease reflected a favorable change in the MSR
valuation and lower debt prepayment charges, partially offset by
higher personnel expenses. Noninterest expense in 2005 included
MSR reparation of $53 million, compared with MSR impairment
of $57 million in 2004. The change in MSR valuations was
driven by higher interest rates and declining prepayment speeds
in 2005, compared with 2004. Debt prepayment charges were
$54 million in 2005, compared with $155 million in
2004.

The provision for credit losses for this business
unit represents the residual aggregate of the net credit losses
allocated to the reportable business units and the
Company’s recorded provision determined in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
The provision for credit losses was a net recovery of
$12 million in 2005, compared with $103 million in
2004. Refer to the “Corporate Risk Profile” section
for further information on the provision for credit losses,
nonperforming assets and factors considered by the Company in
assessing the credit quality of the loan portfolio and
establishing the allowance for credit losses.

Income taxes are assessed to each line of
business at a managerial tax rate of 36.4 percent with the
residual tax expense or benefit to arrive at the consolidated
effective tax rate included in Treasury and Corporate Support.
The $234 million favorable change in income tax expense
reflected a consolidated effective tax rate of 31.7 percent
in 2005, compared with 32.5 percent in 2004. The decrease
in the effective tax rate from 2004 primarily reflected higher
tax exempt income from investment securities and insurance
products and incremental tax credits generated from investments
in affordable housing and similar tax-advantaged projects.

ACCOUNTING CHANGES

Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements discusses accounting standards recently
issued but not yet required to be adopted and the expected
impact of the changes in accounting standards. To the extent the
adoption of new accounting standards affects the Company’s
financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, the
impacts are discussed in the applicable section(s) of the
Management’s Discussion and Analysis and the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The accounting and reporting policies of the
Company comply with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States and conform to general practices within the
banking industry. The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to make estimates and assumptions. The
financial position and results of operations can be affected by
these estimates and assumptions, which are integral to
understanding the Company’s financial statements. Critical
accounting policies are those policies that management believes
are the most important to the portrayal of the Company’s
financial condition and results, and require management to make
estimates that are difficult, subjective or complex. Most
accounting policies are not considered by management to be
critical accounting policies. Several factors are considered in
determining whether or not a policy is critical in the
preparation of financial statements. These factors include,
among other things, whether the estimates are significant to the
financial statements, the nature of the estimates, the ability
to readily validate the estimates with other information
including third-parties or available prices, and sensitivity of
the estimates to changes in economic conditions and whether
alternative accounting methods may be utilized under generally
accepted accounting principles. Management has discussed the
development and the selection of critical accounting policies
with the Company’s Audit Committee.

Significant accounting policies are discussed in
Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Those policies considered to be critical accounting policies are
described below.

Allowance for Credit Losses

The allowance for credit losses is
established to provide for probable losses inherent in the
Company’s credit portfolio. The methods utilized to
estimate the allowance for credit losses, key assumptions and
quantitative and qualitative information considered by
management in determining the adequacy of the allowance for
credit losses are discussed in the “Credit Risk
Management” section.

Management’s evaluation of the adequacy of
the allowance for credit losses is often the most critical of
accounting estimates for a banking institution. It is an
inherently subjective process impacted by many factors as
discussed throughout the Management’s Discussion and
Analysis section of the Annual Report. Although risk management
practices, methodologies and other tools are utilized to
determine each element of the allowance, degrees of imprecision
exist in these measurement tools due in part to subjective
judgments involved and an inherent lagging of credit quality
measurements relative to the stage of the business cycle. Even
determining the stage of the business

U.S. BANCORP


cycle is highly subjective. As discussed in the
“Analysis and Determination of Allowance for Credit
Losses” section, management considers the effect of
imprecision and many other factors in determining the allowance
for credit losses by establishing an “allowance for other
factors” that is not specifically allocated to a category
of loans. If not considered, inherent losses in the portfolio
related to imprecision and other subjective factors could have a
dramatic adverse impact on the liquidity and financial viability
of a bank.

Given the many subjective factors affecting the
credit portfolio, changes in the allowance for credit losses may
not directly coincide with changes in the risk ratings of the
credit portfolio reflected in the risk rating process. This is
in part due to the timing of the risk rating process in relation
to changes in the business cycle, the exposure and mix of loans
within risk rating categories, levels of nonperforming loans and
the timing of charge-offs and recoveries. For example, the
amount of loans within specific risk ratings may change,
providing a leading indicator of improving credit quality, while
nonperforming loans and net charge-offs continue at elevated
levels. Also, inherent loss ratios, determined through migration
analysis and historical loss performance over the estimated
business cycle of a loan, may not change to the same degree as
net charge-offs. Because risk ratings and inherent loss ratios
primarily drive the allowance specifically allocated to
commercial loans, the amount of the allowance for commercial and
commercial real estate loans might decline; however, the degree
of change differs somewhat from the level of changes in
nonperforming loans and net charge-offs. Also, management would
maintain an adequate allowance for credit losses by increasing
the allowance for other factors during periods of economic
uncertainty or changes in the business cycle.

Some factors considered in determining the
adequacy of the allowance for credit losses are quantifiable
while other factors require qualitative judgment. Management
conducts analysis with respect to the accuracy of risk ratings
and the volatility of inherent losses, and utilizes this
analysis along with qualitative factors including uncertainty in
the economy from changes in unemployment rates, the level of
bankruptcies, concentration risks, including risks associated
with the airline industry sector and highly leveraged
enterprise-value credits, in determining the overall level of
the allowance for credit losses. The Company’s
determination of the allowance for commercial and commercial
real estate loans is sensitive to the assigned credit risk
ratings and inherent loss rates at December 31, 2005. In
the event that 10 percent of loans within these portfolios
experienced downgrades of two risk categories, the allowance for
commercial and commercial real estate would increase by
approximately $264 million at December 31, 2005. In the
event that inherent loss or estimated loss rates for these
portfolios increased by 10 percent, the allowance
determined for commercial and commercial real estate would
increase by approximately $92 million at December 31, 2005.
The Company’s determination of the allowance for
residential and retail loans is sensitive to changes in
estimated loss rates. In the event that estimated loss rates
increased by 10%, the allowance for residential mortgages and
retail loans would increase by approximately $60 million at
December 31, 2005. Because several quantitative and
qualitative factors are considered in determining the allowance
for credit losses, these sensitivity analyses do not necessarily
reflect the nature and extent of future changes in the allowance
for credit losses. They are intended to provide insights into
the impact of adverse changes in risk rating and inherent losses
and do not imply any expectation of future deterioration in the
risk rating or loss rates. Given current processes employed by
the Company, management believes the risk ratings and inherent
loss rates currently assigned are appropriate. It is possible
that others, given the same information, may at any point in
time reach different reasonable conclusions that could be
significant to the Company’s financial statements. Refer to
the “Analysis and Determination of the Allowance for Credit
Losses” section for further information.

Mortgage Servicing Rights

MSRs are capitalized as separate
assets when loans are sold and servicing is retained. The total
cost of loans sold is allocated between the loans sold and the
servicing assets retained based on their relative fair values.
MSRs that are purchased from others are initially recorded at
cost. The carrying value of the MSRs is amortized in proportion
to and over the period of estimated net servicing revenue and
recorded in noninterest expense as amortization of intangible
assets. The carrying value of these assets is periodically
reviewed for impairment using a lower of carrying value or fair
value methodology. For purposes of measuring impairment, the
servicing rights are stratified based on the underlying loan
type and note rate and the carrying value for each stratum is
compared to fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis,
utilizing current prepayment speeds and discount rates. Events
that may significantly affect the estimates used are changes in
interest rates and the related impact on mortgage loan
prepayment speeds and the payment performance of the underlying
loans. If the carrying value is greater than fair value,
impairment is recognized through a valuation allowance for each
impaired stratum and recorded as amortization of intangible
assets. The reduction in the fair value of MSRs at
December 31, 2005, to immediate 25 and 50 basis point
adverse changes in interest rates would be approximately
$47 million and $109 million, respectively. An upward
movement in interest rates at December 31, 2005, of 25 and
50 basis points would increase the value of the MSRs by
approximately $32 million and $58 million,
respectively. Refer to Note 11 of the Notes


U.S. BANCORP

to Consolidated Financial Statements for
additional information regarding MSRs.

Goodwill and Other Intangibles

The Company records all assets and
liabilities acquired in purchase acquisitions, including
goodwill and other intangibles, at fair value as required by
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141,
“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” Goodwill and
indefinite-lived assets are no longer amortized but are subject,
at a minimum, to annual tests for impairment. Under certain
situations, interim impairment tests may be required if events
occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not
reduce the fair value of a reporting segment below its carrying
amount. Other intangible assets are amortized over their
estimated useful lives using straight-line and accelerated
methods and are subject to impairment if events or circumstances
indicate a possible inability to realize the carrying amount.

The initial recognition of goodwill and other
intangible assets and subsequent impairment analysis require
management to make subjective judgments concerning estimates of
how the acquired assets will perform in the future using
valuation methods including discounted cash flow analysis.
Additionally, estimated cash flows may extend beyond ten years
and, by their nature, are difficult to determine over an
extended timeframe. Events and factors that may significantly
affect the estimates include, among others, competitive forces,
customer behaviors and attrition, changes in revenue growth
trends, cost structures, technology, changes in discount rates
and specific industry and market conditions. In determining the
reasonableness of cash flow estimates, the Company reviews
historical performance of the underlying assets or similar
assets in an effort to assess and validate assumptions utilized
in its estimates.

In assessing the fair value of reporting units,
the Company may consider the stage of the current business cycle
and potential changes in market conditions in estimating the
timing and extent of future cash flows. Also, management often
utilizes other information to validate the reasonableness of its
valuations including public market comparables, and multiples of
recent mergers and acquisitions of similar businesses. Valuation
multiples may be based on revenue, price-to-earnings and
tangible capital ratios of comparable public companies and
business segments. These multiples may be adjusted to consider
competitive differences including size, operating leverage and
other factors. The carrying amount of a reporting unit is
determined based on the capital required to support the
reporting unit’s activities including its tangible and
intangible assets. The determination of a reporting unit’s
capital allocation requires management judgment and considers
many factors including the regulatory capital regulations and
capital characteristics of comparable public companies in
relevant industry sectors. In certain circumstances, management
will engage a third-party to independently validate its
assessment of the fair value of its business segments.

The Company’s annual assessment of potential
goodwill impairment was completed during the second quarter of
2005. Based on the results of this assessment, no goodwill
impairment was recognized.

Income Taxes

The Company estimates income tax
expense based on amounts expected to be owed to various tax
jurisdictions. Currently, the Company files tax returns in
approximately 140 federal, state and local domestic
jurisdictions and 10 foreign jurisdictions. The estimated income
tax expense is reported in the Consolidated Statement of Income.
Accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due or to be
received from taxing jurisdictions either currently or in the
future and are reported in other assets or other liabilities on
the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In estimating accrued taxes, the
Company assesses the relative merits and risks of the
appropriate tax treatment considering statutory, judicial and
regulatory guidance in the context of the tax position. Because
of the complexity of tax laws and regulations, interpretation
can be difficult and subject to legal judgment given specific
facts and circumstances. It is possible that others, given the
same information, may at any point in time reach different
reasonable conclusions regarding the estimated amounts of
accrued taxes.

Changes in the estimate of accrued taxes occur
periodically due to changes in tax rates, interpretations of tax
laws, the status of examinations being conducted by various
taxing authorities, and newly enacted statutory, judicial and
regulatory guidance that impact the relative merits and risks of
tax positions. These changes, when they occur, affect accrued
taxes and can be significant to the operating results of the
Company. Refer to Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information regarding income
taxes.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Under the supervision and with the participation
of the Company’s management, including its principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, the Company
has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of
its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”)). Based upon this
evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal
financial officer have concluded that, as of the end of the
period covered by this report, the Company’s disclosure
controls and procedures were effective.

U.S. BANCORP


During the most recently completed fiscal
quarter, there was no change made in the Company’s internal
controls over financial reporting (as defined in
Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that
has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

U.S. Bancorp and its subsidiaries (the
“Company”) is a multi-state financial services holding
company headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The Company
provides a full range of financial services including lending
and depository services through banking offices principally in
24 states. The Company also engages in credit card, merchant,
and ATM processing, mortgage banking, insurance, trust and
investment management, brokerage, and leasing activities
principally in domestic markets.

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. The
consolidation eliminates all significant intercompany accounts
and transactions. Certain items in prior periods have been
reclassified to conform to the current presentation.

Uses of Estimates

The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
accompanying notes. Actual experience could differ from those
estimates.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS

Within the Company, financial performance is
measured by major lines of business based on the products and
services provided to customers through its distribution
channels. The Company has five reportable operating segments:

Wholesale Banking

offers lending, depository, treasury
management and other financial services to middle market, large
corporate and public sector clients.

Consumer Banking

delivers products and services through
banking offices, telephone servicing and sales, on-line
services, direct mail and automated teller machines
(“ATMs”). It encompasses community banking,
metropolitan banking, in-store banking, small business banking,

operations and administrative support functions.

Segment Results

Accounting policies for the lines of
business are the same as those used in preparation of the
consolidated financial statements with respect to activities
specifically attributable to each business line. However, the
preparation of business line results requires management to
establish methodologies to allocate funding costs and benefits,
expenses and other financial elements to each line of business.
For details of these methodologies and segment results, see
“Basis of Presentation” and Table 23 “Line of
Business Financial Performance” included in
Management’s Discussion and Analysis which is incorporated
by reference into these Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

SECURITIES

Realized gains or losses on securities are
determined on a trade date basis based on the specific carrying
value of the investments being sold.

Trading Securities

Debt and equity securities held for
resale are classified as trading securities and reported at fair
value. Realized gains or losses are reported in noninterest
income.

Available-for-sale Securities

These securities are not trading
securities but may be sold before maturity in response to
changes in the Company’s interest rate risk profile,
funding needs or demand for collateralized deposits by public
entities. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair
value with unrealized net gains or losses reported within other
comprehensive income in shareholders’ equity. When sold,
the amortized cost of the specific securities is used to compute
the gain or loss. Declines in fair value that are deemed
other-than-temporary, if any, are reported in noninterest income.


U.S. BANCORP

Held-to-maturity Securities

Debt securities for which the Company
has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are
reported at historical cost adjusted for amortization of
premiums and accretion of discounts. Declines in fair value that
are deemed other than temporary, if any, are reported in
noninterest income.

Securities Purchased Under Agreements to
Resell and Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase

Securities purchased under agreements
to resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are
generally accounted for as collateralized financing transactions
and are recorded at the amounts at which the securities were
acquired or sold, plus accrued interest. The fair value of
collateral received is continually monitored and additional
collateral obtained or requested to be returned to the Company
as deemed appropriate.

EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN OPERATING ENTITIES

Equity investments in public entities in which
ownership is less than 20 percent are accounted for as
available-for-sale securities and carried at fair value. Similar
investments in private entities are accounted for using the cost
method. Investments in entities where ownership interest is
between 20 percent and 50 percent are accounted for
using the equity method with the exception of limited
partnerships and limited liability companies where an ownership
interest of greater than 5 percent requires the use of the
equity method. If the Company has a voting interest greater than
50 percent, the consolidation method is used. All equity
investments are evaluated for impairment at least annually and
more frequently if certain criteria are met.

LOANS

Loans are reported net of unearned income.
Interest income is accrued on the unpaid principal balances as
earned. Loan and commitment fees and certain direct loan
origination costs are deferred and recognized over the life of
the loan and/or commitment period as yield adjustments.

Commitments to Extend Credit

Unfunded residential mortgage loan
commitments entered into in connection with mortgage banking
activities are considered derivatives and recorded on the
balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value recorded
in income. All other unfunded loan commitments are generally
related to providing credit facilities to customers of the bank
and are not actively traded financial instruments. These
unfunded commitments are disclosed as off-balance sheet
financial instruments in Note 23 in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Allowance for Credit Losses

Management determines the adequacy of
the allowance based on evaluations of credit relationships, the
loan portfolio, recent loss experience, and other pertinent
factors, including economic conditions. This evaluation is
inherently subjective as it requires estimates, including
amounts of future cash collections expected on nonaccrual loans,
which may be susceptible to significant change. The allowance
for credit losses relating to impaired loans is based on the
loan’s observable market price, the collateral for certain
collateral-dependent loans, or the discounted cash flows using
the loan’s effective interest rate.

The Company determines the amount of the
allowance required for certain sectors based on relative risk
characteristics of the loan portfolio. The allowance recorded
for commercial loans is based on quarterly reviews of individual
credit relationships and an analysis of the migration of
commercial loans and actual loss experience. The allowance
recorded for homogeneous consumer loans is based on an analysis
of product mix, risk characteristics of the portfolio,
bankruptcy experiences, and historical losses, adjusted for
current trends, for each homogenous category or group of loans.
The allowance is increased through provisions charged to
operating earnings and reduced by net charge-offs.

The Company also assesses the credit risk
associated with off-balance sheet loan commitments, letters of
credit, and derivatives and determines the appropriate amount of
credit loss liability that should be recorded. The liability for
off-balance sheet credit exposure related to loan commitments
and other financial instruments is included in other liabilities.

Nonaccrual Loans

Generally commercial loans (including
impaired loans) are placed on nonaccrual status when the
collection of interest or principal has become 90 days past
due or is otherwise considered doubtful. When a loan is placed
on nonaccrual status, unpaid accrued interest is reversed.
Future interest payments are generally applied against
principal. Revolving consumer lines and credit cards are charged
off by 180 days past due and closed-end consumer loans
other than loans secured by 1-4 family properties are charged
off at 120 days past due and are, therefore, generally not
placed on nonaccrual status. Certain retail customers having
financial difficulties may have the terms of their credit card
and other loan agreements modified to require only principal
payments and, as such, are reported as nonaccrual.

Impaired Loans

A
loan is considered to be impaired when, based on current
information and events, it is probable that the Company will be
unable to collect all amounts due (both interest and principal)
according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement.

Restructured Loans

In cases where a borrower experiences
financial difficulties and the Company makes certain
concessionary modifications to contractual terms, the loan is
classified as a restructured loan. Loans restructured at a rate

U.S. BANCORP


equal to or greater than that of a new loan with
comparable risk at the time the contract is modified may be
excluded from restructured loans in the calendar years
subsequent to the restructuring if they are in compliance with
the modified terms.

Generally, a nonaccrual loan that is restructured
remains on nonaccrual for a period of six months to demonstrate
that the borrower can meet the restructured terms. However,
performance prior to the restructuring, or significant events
that coincide with the restructuring, are considered in
assessing whether the borrower can meet the new terms and may
result in the loan being returned to accrual status at the time
of restructuring or after a shorter performance period. If the
borrower’s ability to meet the revised payment schedule is
not reasonably assured, the loan remains classified as a
nonaccrual loan.

Leases

The Company
engages in both direct and leveraged lease financing. The net
investment in direct financing leases is the sum of all minimum
lease payments and estimated residual values, less unearned
income. Unearned income is added to interest income over the
terms of the leases to produce a level yield.

The investment in leveraged leases is the sum of
all lease payments (less nonrecourse debt payments) plus
estimated residual values, less unearned income. Income from
leveraged leases is recognized over the term of the leases based
on the unrecovered equity investment.

Residual values on leased assets are reviewed
regularly for other-than-temporary impairment. Residual
valuations for retail automobile leases are based on independent
assessments of expected used car sale prices at the end-of-term.
Impairment tests are conducted based on these valuations
considering the probability of the lessee returning the asset to
the Company, re-marketing efforts, insurance coverage and
ancillary fees and costs. Valuations for commercial leases are
based upon external or internal management appraisals. When
there is other than temporary impairment in the estimated fair
value of the Company’s interest in the residual value of a
leased asset, the carrying value is reduced to the estimated
fair value with the writedown recognized in the current period.

Loans Held for Sale

Loans held for sale (“LHFS”)
represent mortgage loan originations intended to be sold in the
secondary market and other loans that management has an active
plan to sell. LHFS are carried at the lower of cost or market
value as determined on an aggregate basis by type of loan. In
the event management decides to sell loans receivable, the loans
are transferred at the lower of cost or fair value. Loans
transferred to LHFS are marked-to-market (“MTM”) at
the time of transfer. MTM losses related to the sale/transfer of
non-homogeneous loans that are predominantly credit-related are
reflected in charge-offs. With respect to homogeneous loans, the
amount of “probable” credit loss determined in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies,”
methodologies utilized to determine the specific allowance
allocation for the portfolio is also included in charge-offs.
Any incremental loss determined in accordance with MTM
accounting, that includes consideration of other factors such as
estimates of inherent losses, is reported separately from
charge-offs as a reduction to the allowance for credit losses.
Subsequent decreases in fair value are recognized in noninterest
income.

Other Real Estate

Other real estate (“ORE”),
which is included in other assets, is property acquired through
foreclosure or other proceedings. ORE is carried at fair value,
less estimated selling costs. The property is evaluated
regularly and any decreases in the carrying amount are included
in noninterest expense.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

In the ordinary course of business, the Company
enters into derivative transactions to manage its interest rate,
foreign currency and prepayment risk and to accommodate the
business requirements of its customers. All derivative
instruments are recorded as either other assets, other
liabilities or short-term borrowings at fair value. Subsequent
changes in a derivative’s fair value are recognized
currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria
are met.

All derivative instruments that qualify for hedge
accounting are recorded at fair value and classified either as a
hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability
(“fair value” hedge) or as a hedge of the variability
of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized
asset or liability or a forecasted transaction (“cash
flow” hedge). Changes in the fair value of a derivative
that is highly effective and designated as a fair value hedge
and the offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged item
are recorded in income. Changes in the fair value of a
derivative that is highly effective and designated as a cash
flow hedge are recognized in other comprehensive income until
income from the cash flows of the hedged item is recognized. The
Company performs an assessment, both at the inception of the
hedge and on a quarterly basis thereafter, when required, to
determine whether these derivatives are highly effective in
offsetting changes in the value of the hedged items. Any change
in fair value resulting from hedge ineffectiveness is
immediately recorded in noninterest income.

If a derivative designated as a hedge is
terminated or ceases to be highly effective, the gain or loss is
amortized to earnings over the remaining life of the hedged
asset or liability (fair value hedge) or over the same period(s)
that the forecasted hedged transactions impact earnings (cash


U.S. BANCORP

flow hedge). If the hedged item is disposed of,
or the forecasted transaction is no longer probable, the
derivative is recorded at fair value with any resulting gain or
loss included in the gain or loss from the disposition of the
hedged item or, in the case of a forecasted transaction that is
no longer probable, included in earnings immediately.

OTHER SIGNIFICANT POLICIES

Intangible Assets

The price paid over the net fair value
of acquired businesses (“goodwill”) is not amortized.
Other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated
useful lives, using straight-line and accelerated methods. The
recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets is
evaluated annually, at a minimum, or on an interim basis if
events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to realize
the carrying amount. The evaluation includes assessing the
estimated fair value of the intangible asset based on market
prices for similar assets, where available, and the present
value of the estimated future cash flows associated with the
intangible asset.

Income Taxes

Deferred taxes are recorded to reflect
the tax consequences on future years of differences between the
tax basis of assets and liabilities and the financial reporting
amounts at each year-end.

Mortgage Servicing Rights

Mortgage servicing rights
(“MSRs”) are capitalized as separate assets when loans
are sold and servicing is retained. The total cost of loans sold
is allocated between the loans sold and the servicing assets
retained based on their relative fair values. MSRs that are
purchased from others are initially recorded at cost. The
carrying value of the MSRs is amortized in proportion to, and
over the period of, estimated net servicing revenue and recorded
in noninterest expense as amortization of intangible assets. The
carrying value of these assets is periodically reviewed for
impairment using a lower of carrying value or fair value
methodology. For purposes of measuring impairment, the servicing
rights are stratified based on the underlying loan type and note
rate and the carrying value of each stratum is compared to fair
value based on a discounted cash flow analysis, utilizing
current prepayment speeds and discount rates. Events that may
significantly affect the estimates used are changes in interest
rates and the related impact on mortgage loan prepayment speeds
and the payment performance of the underlying loans. If the
carrying value is greater than fair value, impairment is
recognized through a valuation allowance for each impaired
stratum and recorded as amortization of intangible assets. The
valuation allowance is adjusted each subsequent period to
reflect any increase or decrease in the indicated impairment.
The Company reviews mortgage servicing rights for
other-than-temporary impairment each quarter and recognizes a
direct write-down when the recoverability of a recorded
valuation allowance is determined to be remote. In determining
whether other-than-temporary impairment has taken place, the
Company considers historical trends in pay off activity and the
potential for impairment recovery. Unlike a valuation allowance,
a direct write-down permanently reduces the carrying value of
the mortgage servicing rights, precluding subsequent reversals.

Pensions

For
purposes of its retirement plans, the Company utilizes a
measurement date of September 30. At the measurement date,
plan assets are determined based on fair value, generally
representing observable market prices. The actuarial cost method
used to compute the pension liabilities and related expense is
the projected unit credit method. The projected benefit
obligation is principally determined based on the present value
of projected benefit distributions at an assumed discount rate.
The discount rate utilized is based on match-funding maturities
and interest payments of high quality corporate bonds available
in the market place to projected cash flows as of the
measurement date for future benefit payments. Periodic pension
expense (or credits) includes service costs, interest costs
based on the assumed discount rate, the expected return on plan
assets based on an actuarially derived market-related value and
amortization of actuarial gains and losses. Pension accounting
reflects the long-term nature of benefit obligations and the
investment horizon of plan assets and can have the effect of
reducing earnings volatility related to short-term changes in
interest rates and market valuations. Actuarial gains and losses
include the impact of plan amendments and various unrecognized
gains and losses which are deferred and amortized over the
future service periods of active employees. The market-related
value utilized to determine the expected return on plan assets
is based on fair value adjusted for the difference between
expected returns and actual performance of plan assets. The
unrealized difference between actual experience and expected
returns is included in the market-related value ratably over a
five-year period.

Premises and Equipment

Premises and equipment are stated at
cost less accumulated depreciation and depreciated primarily on
a straight-line basis over the estimated life of the assets.
Estimated useful lives range up to 40 years for newly
constructed buildings and from 3 to 20 years for furniture
and equipment.

Capitalized leases, less accumulated
amortization, are included in premises and equipment. The lease
obligations are included in long-term debt. Capitalized leases
are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and
the amortization is included in depreciation expense.

Statement of Cash Flows

For purposes of reporting cash flows,
cash and cash equivalents include cash and money

U.S. BANCORP


market investments, defined as interest-bearing
amounts due from banks, federal funds sold and securities
purchased under agreements to resell.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company grants stock-based awards
including restricted stock and options to purchase common stock
of the Company. Stock option grants are for a fixed number of
shares to employees and directors with an exercise price equal
to the fair value of the shares at the date of grant. The
Company recognizes stock-based compensation in its results of
operations utilizing the fair value method under Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard No. 123, “Accounting for
Stock-based Compensation” (“SFAS 123”).
Stock-based compensation is recognized using an accelerated
method of amortization for awards with graded vesting features
and on a straight-line basis for awards with cliff vesting. The
Company recognizes compensation cost over the normal vesting
period for awards subject to continued vesting upon the
employee’s retirement. The amortization of stock-based
compensation reflects estimated forfeitures adjusted for actual
forfeiture experience. As compensation expense is recognized, a
deferred tax asset is recorded that represents an estimate of
the future tax deduction from exercise or release of
restrictions. At the time stock-based awards are exercised,
cancelled, expire, or restrictions are released, the Company may
be required to recognize an adjustment to tax expense.

Per Share Calculations

Earnings per share is calculated by
dividing net income by the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share
is calculated by adjusting income and outstanding shares,
assuming conversion of all potentially dilutive securities,
using the treasury stock method. All per share amounts have been
restated for stock splits.

Note 2

ACCOUNTING CHANGES

Stock-Based Compensation

In December 2004, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004)
(“SFAS 123R”), “Share-Based Payment”, a
revision of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 123 (“SFAS 123”), “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation.” SFAS 123R requires
companies to measure the cost of employee services in exchange
for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair
value of the award. This statement eliminates the use of the
alternative intrinsic value method of accounting that was
allowed when SFAS 123 was originally issued. The provisions
of this statement are effective for the Company on
January 1, 2006. Because the Company retroactively adopted
the fair value method in 2003, the impact of expensing
stock-based awards is already recorded in the Company’s
Consolidated Statement of Income. In conjunction with the
adoption of SFAS 123R, the Company plans to change from an
accelerated to a straight-line method of expense attribution
effective January 1, 2006, for new stock-based awards. The
impact of changing from accelerated to straight-line
amortization for new awards will reduce expenses by
approximately $33 million ($20 million after tax) in
2006.

Loan Commitments

On
March 9, 2004, the Securities and Exchange Commission staff
issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 105
(“SAB 105”), “Application of Accounting
Principles to Loan Commitments,” which provides guidance
regarding loan commitments accounted for as derivative
instruments and is effective for commitments entered into after
March 31, 2004. The guidance clarifies that expected future
cash flows related to the servicing of the loan may be
recognized only when the servicing asset has been contractually
separated from the underlying loan by sale with servicing
retained. The adoption of SAB 105 did not have a material
impact on the Company’s financial statements.

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

On December 30, 2005, the Company acquired
the corporate trust and institutional custody businesses of
Wachovia Corporation in a cash transaction valued at
$720 million initially with an additional $80 million
payable in one year based on business retention levels. As a
result of this transaction, the Company acquired approximately
14,100 new Corporate Trust client issuances with
$410 billion in assets under administration and
approximately 1,700 new Institutional Trust and Custody clients
with $570 billion in assets under administration. The
transaction represented total assets acquired of
$730 million and liabilities assumed of $10 million at
the closing date. Included in total assets were contract and
other intangibles with an estimated fair value of
$227 million and goodwill of $500 million. The
goodwill reflected the strategic value of the combined
organization’s leadership position in the corporate trust
and institutional custody businesses and economies of scale
resulting from the transaction.

In
addition to this acquisition the Company completed other smaller
acquisitions to enhance its presence in certain markets and
businesses.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

On December 31, 2003, the Company completed
the distribution of all the outstanding shares of common stock
of Piper Jaffray Companies to its shareholders. This non-cash
distribution was tax-free to the Company, its shareholders and
Piper Jaffray Companies. In connection with the
December 31, 2003, distribution, the results of Piper
Jaffray Companies are reported in the Company’s
Consolidated Statement of Income separately as discontinued
operations.

The following table represents the condensed
results of operations for discontinued operations:

(a)

The $27 million of disposal costs related
    to discontinued operations primarily represents legal,
    investment banking and other costs directly related to the
    distribution.

The distribution was treated as a dividend to
shareholders for accounting purposes and, as such, reduced the
Company’s retained earnings by $685 million. Following
the distribution, the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary,
USB Holdings, Inc. holds a $180 million subordinated debt
facility with Piper Jaffray & Co., a broker-dealer
subsidiary of Piper Jaffray Companies. In addition, the Company
provides an indemnification in an amount up to $18 million
with respect to certain specified liabilities resulting from
third-party claims relating to research analyst independence and
from certain regulatory investigations, as defined in the
separation and distribution agreement entered into with Piper
Jaffray Companies at the time of the distribution. Through
December 31, 2005, the Company has paid approximately
$4 million to Piper Jaffray Companies under this
indemnification agreement.

INVESTMENT SECURITIES

The detail of the amortized cost, gross
unrealized holding gains and losses, and fair value of
held-to-maturity and available-for-sale securities at
December 31 was as follows:

(a)

Held-to-maturity securities are carried at
    historical cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and
    accretion of discounts.

(b)

Available-for-sale securities are carried at
    fair value with unrealized net gains or losses reported within
    other comprehensive income in shareholders’
    equity.

The fair value of available-for-sale securities
shown above includes securities totaling $11.3 billion with
unrealized losses of $380 million which had been in an
unrealized loss position for greater than 12 months at
December 31, 2005, compared with securities totaling
$4.8 billion with unrealized losses of $149 million which
had been in a loss position of greater than 12 months at
December 31, 2004. All other available-for-sale securities
with unrealized losses have an aggregate fair value of
$21.7 billion and have been in an unrealized loss position
for less than 12 months and represent both fixed-rate
securities and adjustable-rate securities with temporary
impairment resulting from increases in interest rates since the
purchase of the securities. All principal and interest payments
on available-for-sale debt securities are expected to be
collected given the high credit quality of the
U.S. government agency debt securities and bank holding
company issuers.

As of December 31, 2005, the Company has the
ability and intent to hold investment securities until their
anticipated recovery in value or maturity.

The weighted-average maturity of the
available-for-sale investment securities was 6.10 years at
December 31, 2005, compared with 4.45 years at
December 31, 2004. The corresponding weighted-average
yields were 4.89 percent and 4.43 percent,
respectively. The weighted-average maturity of the
held-to-maturity investment securities was 7.21 years at
December 31, 2005, compared with 6.19 years at
December 31, 2004. The corresponding weighted-average
yields were 6.44 percent and 6.28 percent,
respectively.

Securities carried at $36.9 billion at
December 31, 2005, and $28.0 billion at
December 31, 2004, were pledged to secure public, private

repurchase and for other purposes required by law. Securities
sold under agreements to repurchase where the buyer/ lender has
the right to sell or pledge the securities, were
$10.9 billion at December 31, 2005, and
$4.8 billion at December 31, 2004, respectively.

LOANS AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

The composition of the loan portfolio at
December 31 was as follows:

Loans are presented net of unearned interest and
deferred fees and costs, which amounted to $1.3 billion and
$1.4 billion at December 31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. The Company had loans of $44.1 billion at
December 31, 2005, and $38.3 billion at
December 31, 2004, pledged at the Federal Home Loan Bank.
Loans of $18.1 billion at December 31, 2005, and
$10.3 billion at December 31, 2004, were pledged at
the Federal Reserve Bank.

The Company primarily lends to borrowers in the
24 states in which it has banking offices. Collateral for
commercial loans may include marketable securities, accounts
receivable, inventory and equipment. For details of the
Company’s commercial portfolio by industry group and
geography as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, see
Table 7 included in Management’s Discussion and
Analysis which is incorporated by reference into these Notes to

Activity in the allowance for credit losses was
as follows:

(a) Included in this analysis is activity
related to the Company’s liability for unfunded
commitments, which is separately recorded in other liabilities
in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

A portion of the allowance for credit losses is
allocated to commercial and commercial real estate loans deemed
impaired. These impaired loans are included in nonperforming
assets. A summary of impaired loans and their related allowance
for credit losses is as follows:

Commitments to lend additional funds to customers
whose commercial or commercial real estate loans were classified
as nonaccrual or restructured at December 31, 2005, totaled
$35 million. At December 31, 2005, there were
$1 million of these loans that were restructured at market
interest rates and returned to an accruing status.

In addition to impaired commercial and commercial
real estate loans, the Company had smaller balance homogenous
loans that are accruing interest at rates considered to be below
market rate. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the recorded
investment in these other restructured loans was $315 million
and $227 million, respectively, with average balances of
$278 million during 2005 and $229 million during 2004.
The Company recognized estimated interest income on these loans
of $20 million $17 million during 2005 and 2004
respectively.

Included in noninterest income, primarily in
mortgage banking revenue, for the years ended December 31,
2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company had net gains on the sale of
loans of $175 million, $171 million and
$163 million, respectively.

Note 9

ACCOUNTING FOR TRANSFERS AND SERVICING OF
    FINANCIAL ASSETS AND EXTINGUISHMENTS OF LIABILITIES

Financial Asset Sales

When the Company sells financial assets, it may
retain interest-only strips, servicing rights, residual rights
to a cash reserve account, and/or other retained interests in
the sold financial assets. The gain or loss on sale depends in
part on the previous carrying amount of the financial assets
involved in the transfer and is allocated between the assets
sold and the retained interests based on their relative fair
values at the date of transfer. Quoted market prices are used to
determine retained interest fair values when readily available.
Since quotes are generally not available for retained interests,
the Company estimates fair value based on the present value of
future expected cash flows using management’s best
estimates of the key assumptions including credit losses,
prepayment speeds, forward yield curves, and discount rates
commensurate with the risks involved. Retained interests and
liabilities are recorded at fair value using a discounted cash
flow methodology at inception and are evaluated at least
quarterly thereafter.

Conduits and Securitization

The Company sponsors an off-balance
sheet conduit, a qualified special purpose entity
(“QSPE”), to which it transferred high-grade
investment securities, funded by the issuance of commercial
paper. Because QSPE’s are exempt from consolidation under
the provisions of Financial Interpretation No. 46,
“Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities
(“FIN 46”), the Company does not consolidate the
conduit structure in its financial statements. The conduit held
assets of $3.8 billion at December 31, 2005, and
$5.7 billion at December 31, 2004. These investment
securities include primarily (i) private label asset-backed
securities, which are insurance “wrapped” by AAA/
Aaa-rated monoline insurance companies and (ii) government
agency mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage
obligations. The conduit had commercial paper liabilities of
$3.8 billion at December 31, 2005, and
$5.7 billion at December 31, 2004. The Company
benefits by transferring the investment securities into a
conduit that provides diversification of funding sources in a
capital-efficient manner and the generation of income.

The Company provides a liquidity facility to the
conduit. Utilization of the liquidity facility would be
triggered if the conduit is unable to, or does not, issue
commercial paper to fund its assets. A liability for the
estimate of the potential risk of loss the Company has as the
liquidity facility provider is recorded on the balance sheet in
other liabilities. The liability is adjusted downward over time
as the underlying assets pay down with the offset recognized as
other noninterest income. The liability for the liquidity
facility was $20 million at December 31, 2005, and
$32 million at December 31, 2004. In addition, the
Company recorded at fair value its retained residual interest in
the investment securities conduit of $28 million at
December 31, 2005, and $57 million at
December 31, 2004. The Company recorded $17 million
from the conduit during 2005 and $25 million during 2004,
for revenues related to the conduit including fees for
servicing, management, administration and accretion income from
retained interests.

Sensitivity Analysis

At December 31, 2005, key
economic assumptions and the sensitivity of the current fair
value of residual cash flows to immediate 10 percent and
20 percent adverse changes in those assumptions for the
investment securities conduit were as follows:

(a)

Credit losses are zero as the investments are
    all AAA/ Aaa rated or insured investments.

(b)

The investment securities conduit is mostly
    match funded. Therefore, interest rate movements create no
    material impact to the value of the residual interest.

These sensitivities are hypothetical and should
be used with caution. As the figures indicate, changes in fair
value based on a 10 percent variation in assumptions
generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the
change in the assumptions to the change in fair value may not be
linear. Also, in this table the effect of a variation in a
particular assumption on the fair value of the retained interest
is calculated without changing any other assumptions; in
reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another
(for example, increases in market interest rates may result in
lower prepayments and increased credit losses), which might
magnify or counteract the sensitivities.

MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS

The Company’s portfolio of residential
mortgages serviced for others was $69.0 billion,
$63.2 billion and $53.9 billion at December 31,
2005, 2004 and 2003 respectively.

Changes in the valuation allowance for
capitalized mortgage servicing rights are summarized as follows:

Changes in net carrying value of capitalized
mortgage servicing rights are summarized as follows:

The key economic assumptions used to estimate the
value of the mortgage servicing rights portfolio were as follows:

The estimated sensitivity of the fair value of
the mortgage servicing rights portfolio to changes in interest
rates at December 31, 2005, was as follows:

The fair value of mortgage servicing rights and
its sensitivity to changes in interest rates is influenced by
the mix of the servicing portfolio and characteristics of each
segment of the portfolio. The Company’s servicing portfolio
consists of the distinct portfolios of Mortgage Revenue Bond
Programs (“MRBP”), government-insured mortgages and
conventional mortgages. The MRBP division specializes in
servicing loans made under state and local housing authority
programs. These programs provide mortgages to low- and
moderate-income borrowers and are generally government-insured
programs with a favorable rate subsidy, down payment and/or
closing cost assistance. Mortgage loans originated as part of
government agency and state loan programs tend to experience
slower prepayment speeds and better cash flows than conventional
mortgage loans. The servicing portfolios are predominantly
comprised of fixed-rate agency loans (FNMA, FHLMC, GNMA, FHLB
and various housing agencies) with limited adjustable-rate or
jumbo mortgage loans.

Long-term debt (debt with original maturities of
more than one year) at December 31 consisted of the
following:

(a)

Other includes debt issuance fees and
    unrealized gains and losses and deferred fees relating to
    derivative instruments.

In August 2005, the Company issued floating-rate
convertible senior debentures of $2.5 billion, due
August 21, 2035. These debentures bear interest at a
floating-rate equal to three-month LIBOR, minus
1.68 percent, payable quarterly until August 21, 2026.
After that date, the Company will not pay interest on the
debentures prior to maturity. On the maturity date or certain
earlier redemption dates, the holder will receive the original
principal amount of $1,000 per debenture, plus accrued
interest. At December 31, 2005, the interest rate was
2.69 percent. The debentures are callable anytime on or
after August 21, 2006, at a price equal to 100 percent
of the accreted principle amount plus accrued and unpaid
interest and putable August 21, 2006, 2007, 2010, and every
five years, thereafter, until maturity at a price equal to
100 percent of the accreted principle amount plus accrued
and unpaid interest. The debentures are convertible at any time
on or prior to the maturity date at an initial conversion rate
of 27.7316 shares for each $1,000 debenture. This results
in a conversion price of approximately $36.06 per share and
represents a premium of 20 percent over the closing sale
price of $30.05 per share on August 9, 2005. If
converted, holders of the convertible debentures will generally
receive cash up to the accreted principal amount of the
debentures and, if the market price of the Company’s common
stock exceeds the conversion price in effect on the conversion
date, holders will also receive a number of shares of the
Company’s common stock, or the equivalent amount in cash at
the option of the Company, per debenture as determined pursuant
to a specified formula.

In December 2005, the Company issued
floating-rate convertible senior debentures of
$2.0 billion, due December 11, 2035. These debentures
bear interest at a floating-rate equal to three-month LIBOR,
minus 1.46 percent, payable quarterly until
December 11, 2030. After that date, the Company will not
pay interest on the debentures prior to maturity. On the
maturity date or certain earlier redemption dates, the holder
will receive the original principal amount of $1,000 per
debenture plus accrued interest. At December 31, 2005, the
interest rate was 3.00 percent. The debentures are callable
anytime on or after December 11, 2006, at a price equal to

to the maturity date at an initial conversion rate of
27.1370 shares for each $1,000 debenture. This results in a
conversion price of approximately $36.85 per share and
represents a premium of 20 percent over the closing sale
price of $30.71 per share on December 5, 2005. If
converted, holders of the convertible debentures will generally
receive cash up to the accreted principal amount of the

In October 2004, the Company’s subsidiary
U.S. Bank National Association (“USBNA”) issued
$650 million of fixed-rate subordinated notes due
October 30, 2014. The interest rate is 4.95 percent
per annum. In January of 2005, USBNA issued $200 million of
fixed-rate subordinated notes due October 30, 2014. The
interest rate is 4.95 percent per annum. In March 2005,
USBNA issued $150 million of fixed-rate subordinated

JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES

The Company sponsors and wholly owns 100% of the
common equity of eleven trusts that were formed for the purpose
of issuing Company-obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred
securities (“Trust Preferred Securities”) to
third-party investors and investing the proceeds from the sale
of the Trust Preferred Securities solely in junior
subordinated debt securities of the Company (the
“Debentures”). The Debentures held by the trusts,
which total $3.2 billion, are the sole assets of each
trust. The Company’s obligations under the Debentures and
related documents, taken together, constitute a full and
unconditional guarantee by the Company of the obligations of the
Trusts. The guarantee covers the distributions and payments on
liquidation or redemption of the Trust Preferred Securities, but
only to the extent of funds held by the Trusts. The Company used
the proceeds from the sales of the Debentures for general
corporate purposes.

The Company has the right to redeem retail
Debentures in whole or in part, on or after specific dates, at a
redemption price specified in the indentures plus any accrued
but unpaid interest to the redemption date. The Company has the
right to redeem institutional Debentures in whole, (but not in
part), on or after specific dates, at a redemption price
specified in the indentures plus any accrued but unpaid interest
to the redemption date. The Debentures are redeemable in 2006,
2007 and 2010 in the amounts of $1.9 billion,
$310 million and $979 million, respectively.

In March 2004, as a result of adopting the
provisions of Interpretation No. 46 (revised December
2003), “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities”,
an interpretation of Accounting Research
Bulletin No. 51, “Consolidated Financial
Statements”, the Company was required to de-consolidate
these subsidiary trusts from its financial statements. The
de-consolidation of the net assets and results of operations of
the trusts had an insignificant impact on the Company’s
financial statements and liquidity position since the Company
continues to be obligated to repay the Debentures held by the
trusts and guarantees repayment of the Trust Preferred
Securities issued by the trusts. The consolidated debt
obligation related to the trusts increased $79 million upon
de-consolidation with the increase representing the
Company’s common equity ownership in the trusts. The
Trust Preferred Securities held by the trusts qualify as
Tier 1 capital for the Company under the Federal Reserve
Board guidelines. The banking regulatory agencies have issued
guidance that would continue the current regulatory capital
treatment for Trust Preferred Securities.

SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY

At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Company
had authority to issue 4 billion shares of common stock and
50 million shares of preferred stock. The Company had
1,815 million and 1,858 million shares of common stock
outstanding at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. At
December 31, 2005, the Company had 151 million shares
of common stock reserved for future issuances, primarily under
stock option plans.

The Company has a preferred share purchase rights
plan intended to preserve the long-term value of the Company by
discouraging a hostile takeover of the Company. Under the plan,
each share of common stock carries a right to purchase one
one-thousandth of a share of preferred stock. The rights become
exercisable in certain limited circumstances involving a
potential business combination transaction or an acquisition of
shares of the Company and are exercisable at a price of
$100 per right, subject to adjustment. Following certain
other events, each right entitles its holder to purchase for
$100 an amount of common stock of the Company, or, in certain
circumstances, securities of the acquirer, having a then-current
market value of twice the exercise price of the right. The
dilutive effect of the rights on the acquiring company is
intended to encourage it to negotiate with the Company’s
Board of Directors prior to attempting a takeover. If the Board
of Directors believes a proposed acquisition is in the best
interests of the Company and its shareholders, the Board may
amend the plan or redeem the rights for a nominal amount in
order to permit the acquisition to be completed without
interference from the plan. Until a right is exercised, the
holder of a right has no rights as a shareholder of the Company.
The rights expire on February 27, 2011.

On December 18, 2001, the Board of Directors
approved an authorization to repurchase 100 million shares
of common stock through 2003. In 2003, the Company repurchased
7 million shares of common stock under the plan, which
expired in December of 2003. On December 16, 2003, the
Board of Directors approved an authorization to repurchase
150 million shares of outstanding common stock during the
following 24 months. During 2003, the Company repurchased
8 million shares under the December 2003 plan. In 2004, the
Company repurchased 89 million shares of common stock under
the plan. On December 21, 2004, the Board of Directors
approved an authorization to repurchase 150 million shares
of outstanding common stock during the following 24 months.
This new repurchase program replaces the Company’s
December 16, 2003, program. In 2004, the Company
repurchased 5 million shares of common stock under the
plan. During 2005, all share repurchases were made under the
2004 plan.

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

Employee Investment Plan

The Company has a defined contribution
retirement savings plan which allows qualified employees to make
contributions up to 50 percent of their annual
compensation, subject to Internal Revenue Service limits,
through salary deductions under Section 401(k) of the
Internal Revenue Code. Employee contributions are invested, at
the employees’ direction, among a variety of investment
alternatives. Employee contributions are 100 percent
matched by the Company, up to four percent of an employee’s
eligible annual compensation. The Company’s matching
contribution vests immediately; however, a participant must be
employed in an eligible position on the last business day of the
year to receive that year’s matching contribution. Although
the matching contribution is initially invested in the
Company’s common stock, an employee can reinvest the
matching contributions among various investment alternatives.
Total expense was $53 million, $49 million and
$49 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Pension Plans

Pension benefits are provided to
substantially all employees based on years of service and
employees’ compensation while employed with the Company.
Employees are fully vested after five years of service. Prior to
their acquisition dates, employees of certain acquired companies
were covered by separate, noncontributory pension plans that
provided benefits based on years of service and compensation.
Generally, the Company merges plans of acquired companies into
its existing pension plans when it becomes practicable.

Under the current plan’s benefit structure,
a participant’s future retirement benefits are based on a
participant’s highest five-year average annual compensation
during his or her last 10 years before retirement or
termination from the Company. Prior to the merger with Firstar
Corporation, two of the previous companies had cash balance
pension benefit structures under which the participants earned
retirement benefits based on their average compensation over
their entire career, while the former Firstar Corporation
retirement benefit structure was based on final average pay and
years of service, similar to the current plan. Plan assets
primarily consist of various equities, equity mutual funds and
other miscellaneous assets.

In general, the Company’s pension plan
objectives include maintaining a funded status sufficient to
meet participant benefit obligations over time while reducing
long-term funding requirements and pension costs. The Company
has an established process for evaluating all the plans, their
performance and significant plan assumptions, including the
assumed discount rate and the long-term rate of return (LTROR).
At least annually, an independent consultant is engaged to
assist U.S. Bancorp’s Compensation Committee (“the
Committee”) in evaluating plan objectives, funding policies
and plan investment policies considering its long-term
investment time horizon and asset allocation strategies. The
process also evaluates significant plan assumptions. Although
plan assumptions are established annually, the Company may
update its analysis on an interim basis in order to be
responsive to significant events that occur during the year,
such as plan mergers and amendments.

In addition to the funded qualified retirement
plan, the Company maintains a non-qualified plan that is
unfunded and the aggregate accumulated benefit obligation
exceeds the assets. The assumptions used in computing the
present value of the accumulated benefit obligation, the
projected benefit obligation and net pension expense are
substantially consistent with those assumptions used for the
funded qualified plan. The Company recognized a settlement loss
of $4 million on this plan in 2003, related to the level of
payouts made from the plan.

Funding Practices

The Company’s funding policy
is to contribute amounts to its plans sufficient to meet the
minimum funding requirements of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, plus such additional amounts as the
Company determines to be appropriate. No contributions were made
in 2004 or 2005. In 2006, the Company anticipates no minimum
funding requirement and therefore does not expect to make any
contributions to the plan. Contributions made to the plan were
invested in accordance with established investment policies and
asset allocation strategies.

Investment Policies and Asset Allocation

In establishing its investment
policies and asset allocation strategies, the Company considers
expected returns and the volatility associated with different
strategies. An independent consultant performs modeling that
projects numerous


U.S. BANCORP

outcomes using a broad range of possible
scenarios, including a mix of possible rates of inflation and
economic growth. Some of the scenarios included are: low
inflation and high growth (ideal growth), low inflation and low
growth (recession), high inflation and low growth
(stagflation) and high inflation and high growth
(inflationary growth). Starting with current economic
information, the model bases its projections on past
relationships between inflation, fixed income rates and equity
returns when these types of economic conditions have existed
over the previous 30 years, both in the U.S. and in foreign
countries.

Generally, based on historical performance of the
various investment asset classes, investments in equities have
outperformed other investment classes but are subject to higher
volatility. While an asset allocation including bonds and other
assets generally has lower volatility and may provide protection
in a declining interest rate environment, it limits the pension
plan’s long-term up-side potential. Given the pension
plan’s investment horizon and the financial viability of
the Company to meet its funding objectives, the Committee has
determined that an asset allocation strategy investing in
100 percent equities diversified among various domestic
equity categories and international equities is appropriate.

The following unaudited table provides a summary
of asset allocations adopted by the Company compared with a
typical asset allocation alternative:

(a)

The target asset allocation was modified in
    December 2003, effective January 1, 2004, to reduce the
    potential volatility of the portfolio without significantly
    reducing the expected returns. The change in the allocation was
    completed by the second quarter of 2004 and the year end
    variations from the target allocation were a result of that
    change.

(b)

The LTROR assumed for the target asset
    allocation strategy of 8.9 percent is based on a range of
    estimates evaluated by the Company including the compound
    expected return of 8.3 percent and the average expected
    return of 9.8 percent.

(c)

The Sharpe ratio is a direct measure of
    reward-to-risk. The Sharpe ratio for these asset allocation
    strategies is considered to be within acceptable
    parameters.

In accordance with its existing practices, the
independent pension consultant utilized by the Company updated
the analysis of expected rates of return and evaluated peer
group data, market conditions and other factors relevant to
determining the LTROR assumptions for pension costs for 2004 and
2005. The analysis performed indicated that the LTROR assumption
of 8.9 percent, used in both 2004 and 2005, continued to be
in line with expected returns based on current economic
conditions and the Company expects to continue using this LTROR
in 2006. The LTROR was first reduced to the current LTROR of
8.9 percent in 2003 to reflect the long range impact of the
poor market performance of equities in 2001 and 2002. Regardless
of the extent of the Company’s analysis of alternative
asset allocation strategies, economic scenarios and possible
outcomes, plan assumptions developed for the LTROR are subject
to imprecision and changes in economic factors. As a result of
the modeling imprecision and uncertainty, the Company considers
a range of potential expected rates of return, economic
conditions for several scenarios, historical performance
relative to assumed rates of return and asset allocation and
LTROR information for a peer group in establishing its
assumptions.

Post-Retirement Medical Plans

In addition to providing pension
benefits, the Company provides health care and death benefits to
certain retired employees through one retiree medical program.
Generally, all active employees may become eligible for retiree
health care benefits by meeting defined age and service
requirements. The Company may also subsidize the cost of
coverage for employees meeting certain age and service
requirements. The medical plan contains other cost-sharing
features such as deductibles and coinsurance. The estimated cost
of these retiree benefit payments is accrued during the
employees’ active service.

U.S. BANCORP


In December 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act) was enacted.
The Act established a prescription drug benefit under Medicare,
known as “Medicare Part D”, and a federal subsidy
to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a
benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare
Part D. The Company recognized the estimated expected
benefit prospectively from July 1, 2004. The expected
subsidy reduced the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation (APBO) at September 30, 2004, by
$40 million, and net periodic cost for 2004 by
$2 million. Based on final regulations issued during 2005,
the expected benefit impact of the Medicare subsidy increased
and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was
reduced by an additional $10 million as of
September 30, 2005. The net periodic cost for 2005 was
reduced by $5 million. The Company does not expect a

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

As part of its employee and director compensation
programs, the Company may grant certain stock awards under the
provisions of the existing stock compensation plans, including
plans assumed in acquisitions. The plans provide for grants of
options to purchase shares of common stock at a fixed price
generally equal to the fair value of the underlying stock at the
date of grant. Option grants are generally exercisable up to ten
years from the date of grant. In addition, the plans provide for
grants of shares of common stock or stock units that are subject
to restriction on transfer. Most stock awards vest over three to
five years and are subject to forfeiture if certain vesting
requirements are not met.

Stock incentive plans of acquired companies are
generally terminated at the merger closing dates. Option holders
under such plans receive the Company’s common stock, or
options to buy the Company’s stock, based on the conversion
terms of the various merger agreements. The historical stock
award information presented below has been restated to reflect
the options originally granted under acquired companies’
plans.

At December 31, 2005, there were
25 million shares (subject to adjustment for forfeitures)
available for grant under various plans.

The following is a summary of stock options
outstanding and exercised under various stock options plans of
the Company:

(a)

In connection with the December 31, 2003,
    tax-free distribution of Piper Jaffray Companies, stock options
    were adjusted in accordance with provisions of the contracts
    based on an exchange ratio of 1.0068 representing the relative
    stock price adjustment at the time of distribution.

(b)

Options cancelled includes both non-vested
    (i.e., forfeitures) and vested shares.


U.S. BANCORP

Additional information regarding stock options
outstanding as of December 31, 2005, is as follows:

Stock-based compensation was $132 million in
2005, compared with $176 million and $158 million in
2004 and 2003, respectively. At the time employee stock options
expire, are exercised or cancelled, the Company determines the
tax benefit associated with the stock award and under certain
circumstances may be required to recognize an adjustment to tax
expense. On an after-tax basis, stock-based compensation was
$83 million in 2005, compared with $139 million and
$123 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively.

The following table provides a summary of the
valuation assumptions utilized by the Company to determine the
estimated value of stock option grants:

Stock-based compensation expense is based on the
fair value of the award at the date of grant or modification.
The fair value of options was estimated using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model requiring the use of subjective valuation
assumptions. Because employee stock options have characteristics
that differ from those of traded options, including vesting
provisions and trading limitations that impact their liquidity,
the determined value used to measure compensation expense may
vary from their actual fair value.

INCOME TAXES

The components of income tax expense were:

A reconciliation of expected income tax expense
at the federal statutory rate of 35 percent to the
Company’s applicable income tax expense follows:

The tax effects of fair value adjustments on
securities available-for-sale, derivative instruments in cash
flow hedges and certain tax benefits related to stock options
are recorded directly to shareholders’ equity as part of
other comprehensive income.

In preparing its tax returns, the Company is
required to interpret complex tax laws and regulations and
utilize income and cost allocation methods to determine its
taxable income. On an ongoing basis, the Company is subject to
examinations by federal and state taxing authorities that may
give rise to differing interpretations of these complex laws,
regulations and methods. Due to the nature of the examination
process, it generally takes years before these examinations are
completed and matters are resolved. Included in 2005 was a
$94 million reduction in income tax expense related to the
resolution of federal income tax examinations covering
substantially all of the Company’s legal entities for the
years 2000 through 2002. In addition, included in 2004 was a
reduction in income tax expense of $90 million related to
the resolution of federal income tax examinations covering
substantially all of the Company’s legal entities for the
years 1995 through 1999 and $16 million related to the
resolution of a state tax examination for tax years through
2000. The resolution of these cycles was the result of
negotiations held between the Company and representatives of
various taxing authorities throughout the examinations. The
resolution of these matters and the taxing authorities’
acceptance of submitted claims and tax return adjustments
resulted in the reduction of estimated income tax liabilities.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities
reflect the tax effect of temporary difference between the
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial
reporting purposes and the amounts used for the same items for
income tax reporting purposes.


U.S. BANCORP

The significant components of the Company’s
net deferred tax liability as of December 31 were:

The Company has established a valuation allowance
to offset deferred tax assets related to state net operating
loss carryforwards which are expected to expire unused. The
Company has approximately $138 million of net operating
loss carryforwards which expire at various times through 2023.

Certain events covered by Internal Revenue Code
section 593(e), which was not repealed, will trigger a recapture
of base year reserves of acquired thrift institutions. The base
year reserves of acquired thrift institutions would be
recaptured if an entity ceases to qualify as a bank for federal
income tax purposes. The base year reserves of thrift
institutions also remain subject to income tax penalty
provisions that, in general, require recapture upon certain
stock redemptions of, and excess distributions to, stockholders.
At December 31, 2005, retained earnings included
approximately $102 million of base year reserves for which
no deferred federal income tax liability has been recognized.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

In the ordinary course of business, the Company
enters into derivative transactions to manage its interest rate,
prepayment and foreign currency risks and to accommodate the
business requirements of its customers. The Company does not
enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes.
Refer to Note 1 “Significant Accounting Policies”
in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a
discussion of the Company’s accounting policies for
derivative instruments. For information related to derivative
positions held for asset and liability management purposes and
customer-related derivative positions, see Table 18
“Derivative Positions,” included in Management’s
Discussion and Analysis, which is incorporated by reference in
these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

ASSET AND LIABILITY MANAGEMENT POSITIONS

Cash Flow Hedges

The
Company has $17.2 billion of designated cash flow hedges at
December 31, 2005. These derivatives are interest rate
swaps that are hedges of the forecasted cash flows from the
underlying variable-rate LIBOR loans and floating-rate debt. All
cash flow hedges are highly effective for the year ended
December 31, 2005, and the change in fair value attributed
to hedge ineffectiveness was not material.

At December 31, 2005 and 2004, accumulated
other comprehensive income included a deferred after-tax net
loss of $10 million and a deferred after-tax net gain of
$113 million, respectively, related to cash flow hedges.
The unrealized gain or loss will be reflected in earnings when
the related cash flows or hedged transactions occur and will
offset the related performance of the hedged items. The

U.S. BANCORP


occurrence of these related cash flows and hedged
transactions remains probable. The estimated amount of after-tax
gain to be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive
income into earnings during 2006 is $26 million. This includes
gains related to hedges that were terminated early and the
forecasted transactions are still probable.

Fair Value Hedges

The Company has $10.1 billion of
designated fair value hedges at December 31, 2005. These
derivatives are primarily interest rate swaps that hedge the
change in fair value related to interest rate changes of
underlying fixed-rate debt, trust preferred securities and
deposit obligations. In addition, the Company uses forward
commitments to sell residential mortgage loans to hedge its
interest rate risk related to residential mortgage loans held
for sale. The Company commits to sell the loans at specified
prices in a future period, typically within 90 days. The
Company is exposed to interest rate risk during the period
between issuing a loan commitment and the sale of the loan into
the secondary market.

All fair value hedges are considered highly
effective for the year ended December 31, 2005. The change
in fair value attributed to hedge ineffectiveness was a loss of
$4 million, related to the Company’s mortgage loans held
for sale and its 2005 production volume of $23.0 billion.

Net Investment Hedges

The Company enters into derivatives
to protect its net investment in certain foreign operations. The
Company uses forward commitments to sell specified amounts of
certain foreign currencies to hedge its capital volatility risk
associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
The net amount of gains or losses included in the cumulative
translation adjustment for 2005 was not significant.

Other Asset and Liability Management
Derivative Positions

The Company has
derivative positions that are used for interest rate risk and
other risk management purposes but are not designated as cash
flow hedges or fair value hedges in accordance with the
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities.” At December 31, 2005, the Company
had $1.1 billion of forward commitments to sell residential
mortgage loans to hedge the Company’s interest rate risk
related to $1.1 billion of unfunded residential loan
commitments. Gains and losses on mortgage banking derivatives
and the unfunded loan commitments are included in mortgage
banking revenue on the income statement.

CUSTOMER-RELATED POSITIONS

The Company acts as a seller and buyer of
interest rate contracts and foreign exchange rate contracts on
behalf of customers. At December 31, 2005, the Company had
$26.9 billion of aggregate customer derivative positions,
including $22.7 billion of interest rate swaps, caps, and
floors and $4.2 billion of foreign exchange rate contracts.
The Company minimizes its market and liquidity risks by taking
similar offsetting positions. Gains or losses on
customer-related transactions were not significant for the year
ended December 31, 2005.

Note 22

FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Due to the nature of its business and its
customers’ needs, the Company offers a large number of
financial instruments, most of which are not actively traded.
When market quotes are unavailable, valuation techniques
including discounted cash flow calculations and pricing models
or services are used. The Company also uses various aggregation
methods and assumptions, such as the discount rate and cash flow
timing and amounts. As a result, the fair value estimates can
neither be substantiated by independent market comparisons, nor
realized by the immediate sale or settlement of the financial
instrument. Also, the estimates reflect a point in time and
could change significantly based on changes in economic factors,
such as interest rates. Furthermore, the disclosure of certain
financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities is not
required. Finally, the fair value disclosure is not intended to
estimate a market value of the Company as a whole. A summary of
the Company’s valuation techniques and assumptions follows.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The carrying value of cash, amounts
due from banks, federal funds sold and securities purchased
under resale agreements was assumed to approximate fair value.

Securities

Investment securities were valued
using available market quotes. In some instances, for securities
that are not widely traded, market quotes for comparable
securities were used.

Loans

The loan
portfolio includes adjustable and fixed-rate loans, the fair
value of which was estimated using discounted cash flow analyses
and other valuation techniques. To calculate discounted cash
flows, the loans were aggregated into pools of similar types and
expected repayment terms. The expected cash flows of loans
considered historical prepayment experiences and estimated
credit losses for nonperforming loans and were discounted using
current rates offered to borrowers of similar credit
characteristics. The fair value of adjustable rate loans is
assumed to be equal to their par value.

Deposit Liabilities

The fair value of demand deposits,
savings accounts and certain money market deposits is equal to
the amount payable on demand at year-end. The fair value of
fixed-rate certificates of deposit was estimated by discounting
the contractual cash flow using the discount rates implied by
high-grade corporate bond yield curves.

Short-term Borrowings

Federal funds purchased, securities
sold under agreements to repurchase, commercial paper and


U.S. BANCORP

other short-term funds borrowed are at floating
rates or have short-term maturities. Their par value is assumed
to approximate their fair value.

Long-term Debt

The
estimated fair value of medium-term notes, bank notes, and
subordinated debt was determined by using discounted cash flow
analysis based on high-grade corporate bond yield curves.
Floating rate debt is assumed to be equal to par value. Capital
trust and other long-term debt instruments were valued using
market quotes.

Interest Rate Swaps, Equity Contracts and
Options

The interest rate options and
swap cash flows were estimated using a third-party pricing model
and discounted based on appropriate LIBOR, eurodollar futures,
swap, treasury note yield curves and equity market prices.

Loan Commitments, Letters of Credit and
Guarantees

The fair value of
commitments, letters of credit and guarantees represents the
estimated costs to terminate or otherwise settle the obligations
with a third-party. Residential mortgage commitments are
actively traded and the fair value is estimated using available
market quotes. Other loan commitments, letters of credit and
guarantees are not actively traded. Substantially all loan
commitments have floating rates and do not expose the Company to
interest rate risk assuming no premium or discount was ascribed
to loan commitments because funding could occur at market rates.
The Company estimates the fair value of loan commitments,
letters of credit and guarantees based on the related amount of
unamortized deferred commitment fees adjusted for the probable
losses for these arrangements.

The estimated fair values of the Company’s
financial instruments at December 31 are shown in the table
below.

The fair value of unfunded commitments, standby
letters of credit and other guarantees is approximately equal to
their carrying value. The carrying value of unfunded commitments
and standby letters of credit was $276 million. The
carrying value of other guarantees was $79 million.

U.S. BANCORP


Note 23

GUARANTEES AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT

Commitments to extend credit are legally binding
and generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination
clauses. The contractual amount represents the Company’s
exposure to credit loss, in the event of default by the
borrower. The Company manages this credit risk by using the same
credit policies it applies to loans. Collateral is obtained to
secure commitments based on management’s credit assessment
of the borrower. The collateral may include marketable
securities, receivables, inventory, equipment and real estate.
Since the Company expects many of the commitments to expire
without being drawn, total commitment amounts do not necessarily
represent the Company’s future liquidity requirements. In
addition, the commitments include consumer credit lines that are
cancelable upon notification to the consumer.

LETTERS OF CREDIT

Standby letters of credit are commitments the
Company issues to guarantee the performance of a customer to a
third-party. The guarantees frequently support public and
private borrowing arrangements, including commercial paper
issuances, bond financings and other similar transactions. The
Company issues commercial letters of credit on behalf of
customers to ensure payment or collection in connection with
trade transactions. In the event of a customer’s
nonperformance, the Company’s credit loss exposure is the
same as in any extension of credit, up to the letter’s
contractual amount. Management assesses the borrower’s
credit to determine the necessary collateral, which may include
marketable securities, receivables, inventory, equipment and
real estate. Since the conditions requiring the Company to fund
letters of credit may not occur, the Company expects its
liquidity requirements to be less than the total outstanding
commitments. The maximum potential future payments guaranteed by
the Company under standby letter of credit arrangements at
December 31, 2005, were approximately $10.7 billion
with a weighted-average term of approximately 23 months.
The estimated fair value of standby letters of credit was
approximately $82 million at December 31, 2005.

The contract or notional amounts of commitments
to extend credit and letters of credit at December 31,
2005, were as follows:

LEASE COMMITMENTS

Rental expense for operating leases amounted to
$192 million in 2005, $187 million in 2004 and
$208 million in 2003. Future minimum payments, net of
sublease rentals, under capitalized leases and noncancelable
operating leases with initial or remaining terms of one year or
more, consisted of the following at December 31, 2005:

GUARANTEES

Guarantees are contingent commitments issued by
the Company to customers or other third-parties. The
Company’s guarantees primarily include parent guarantees
related to subsidiaries’ third-party borrowing
arrangements; third-party performance guarantees inherent in the
Company’s business operations such as indemnified
securities lending programs and merchant charge-back guarantees;
indemnification or buy-back provisions related to certain asset
sales; and contingent consideration arrangements related to
acquisitions. For certain guarantees, the Company has recorded a
liability related to the potential obligation, or has access to
collateral to support the guarantee or through the exercise of
other recourse provisions can offset some or all of the maximum
potential future payments made under these guarantees.


U.S. BANCORP

Third-Party Borrowing Arrangements

The Company provides guarantees to
third-parties as a part of certain subsidiaries’ borrowing
arrangements, primarily representing guaranteed operating or
capital lease payments or other debt obligations with maturity
dates extending through 2013. The maximum potential future
payments guaranteed by the Company under these arrangements were
approximately $466 million at December 31, 2005. The
Company’s recorded liabilities as of December 31,
2005, included $8 million representing outstanding amounts owed
to these third-parties and required to be recorded on the
Company’s balance sheet in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States.

Commitments from Securities Lending

The Company participates in securities
lending activities by acting as the customer’s agent
involving the loan of securities. The Company indemnifies
customers for the difference between the market value of the
securities lent and the market value of the collateral received.
Cash collateralizes these transactions. The maximum potential
future payments guaranteed by the Company under these
arrangements were approximately $13.0 billion at
December 31, 2005, and represented the market value of the
securities lent to third-parties. At December 31, 2005, the
Company held assets with a market value of $13.4 billion as
collateral for these arrangements.

Asset Sales

The
Company has provided guarantees to certain third-parties in
connection with the sale of certain assets, primarily loan
portfolios and low-income housing tax credits. These guarantees
are generally in the form of asset buy-back or make-whole
provisions that are triggered upon a credit event or a change in
the tax-qualifying status of the related projects, as
applicable, and remain in effect until the loans are collected
or final tax credits are realized, respectively. The maximum
potential future payments guaranteed by the Company under these
arrangements were approximately $843 million at
December 31, 2005, and represented the proceeds or
guaranteed portion received from the buyer in these transactions
where the buy-back or make-whole provisions have not yet
expired. Recourse available to the Company includes guarantees
from the Small Business Administration (for SBA loans sold),
recourse against the correspondent that originated the loan or
to the private mortgage issuer, the right to collect payments
from the debtors, and/or the right to liquidate the underlying
collateral, if any, and retain the proceeds. Based on its
established loan-to-value guidelines, the Company believes the
recourse available is sufficient to recover future payments, if
any, under the loan buy-back guarantees.

Merchant Processing

The Company, through its subsidiaries
NOVA Information Systems, Inc. and NOVA European Holdings
Company, provides merchant processing services. Under the rules
of credit card associations, a merchant processor retains a
contingent liability for credit card transactions processed.
This contingent liability arises in the event of a billing
dispute between the merchant and a cardholder that is ultimately
resolved in the cardholder’s favor. In this situation, the
transaction is “charged back” to the merchant and the
disputed amount is credited or otherwise refunded to the
cardholder. If the Company is unable to collect this amount from
the merchant, it bears the loss for the amount of the refund
paid to the cardholder.

A cardholder, through its issuing bank, generally
has until the latter of up to four months after the date the
transaction is processed or the receipt of the product or
service to present a charge-back to the Company as the merchant
processor. The absolute maximum potential liability is estimated
to be the total volume of credit card transactions that meet the
associations’ requirements to be valid charge-back
transactions at any given time. Management estimates that the
maximum potential exposure for charge-backs would approximate
the total amount of merchant transactions processed through the
credit card associations for the last four months. For the last
four months this amount totaled approximately $49.0 billion. In
most cases, this contingent liability is unlikely to arise, as
most products and services are delivered when purchased and
amounts are refunded when items are returned to merchants.
However, where the product or service is not provided until a
future date (“future delivery”), the potential for
this contingent liability increases. To mitigate this risk, the
Company may require the merchant to make an escrow deposit, may
place maximum volume limitations on future delivery transactions
processed by the merchant at any point in time, or may require
various credit enhancements (including letters of credit and
bank guarantees). Also, merchant processing contracts may
include event triggers to provide the Company more financial and
operational control in the event of financial deterioration of
the merchant.

The Company’s primary exposure to future
delivery is related to merchant processing for the airline
industry. The Company currently processes card transactions for
various airlines in the United States and Europe. In the event
of liquidation of these airlines, the Company could become
financially liable for refunding tickets purchased through the
credit card associations under the charge-back provisions.
Charge-back risk related to an airline is evaluated in a manner
similar to credit risk assessments and as such merchant
processing contracts consider the potential risk of default.
Under certain situations, the Company may obtain various forms
of collateral to minimize the risk of charge-backs. At
December 31, 2005, the value of airline tickets purchased
to be delivered at a future date was

U.S. BANCORP


approximately $1.7 billion, and the Company
held collateral of $1.2 billion in escrow deposits, letters
of credit and liens on various assets. With respect to future
delivery risk for non-airline merchants, the Company held
$33 million of merchant escrow deposits as collateral. In
addition to specific collateral or other credit enhancements,
the Company maintains a liability for its implied guarantees
associated with future delivery. At December 31, 2005, the
liability was $24 million primarily related to these
airline processing arrangements.

In the normal course of business, the Company has
unresolved charge-backs that are in process of resolution. The
Company assesses the likelihood of its potential liability based
on the extent and nature of unresolved charge-backs and its
historical loss experience. At December 31, 2005, the
Company had a recorded liability for potential losses of
$19 million.

Contingent Consideration Arrangements

The Company has contingent payment
obligations related to certain business combination
transactions. Payments are guaranteed as long as certain
post-acquisition performance-based criteria are met or customer
relationships are maintained. At December 31, 2005, the
maximum potential future payments required to be made by the
Company under these arrangements was approximately $80 million
and represented contingent payments related to the acquisition
of the Wachovia Corporation’s corporate trust and
institutional custody business on December 30, 2005. If
required, these contingent payments would be payable within the
next 12 months.

Minimum Revenue Guarantees

In the normal course of business, the
Company may enter into revenue share agreements with third party
business partners who generate customer referrals or provide
marketing or other services related to the generation of
revenue. In certain of these agreements, the Company may
guarantee that a minimum amount of revenue share payments will
be made to the third party over a specified period of time. For
the period ending December 31, 2005, the maximum potential
future payments required to be made by the Company under these
agreements was $42 million.

Other Guarantees

The
Company provides liquidity and credit enhancement facilities to
a Company-sponsored conduit, as more fully described in the
“Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements” section within
Management’s Discussion and Analysis. Although management
believes a draw against these facilities is remote, the maximum
potential future payments guaranteed by the Company under these
arrangements were approximately $3.8 billion at
December 31, 2005. The recorded fair value of the
Company’s liability for the credit enhancement liquidity
facility was $20 million at December 31, 2005, and was
included in other liabilities.

The Company has also made financial performance
guarantees related to the operations of its subsidiaries. The
maximum potential future payments guaranteed by the Company
under these arrangements were approximately $1.8 billion at
December 31, 2005.

OTHER CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

In connection with the spin-off of Piper Jaffray
Companies, the Company has agreed to indemnify Piper Jaffray
Companies against losses that may result from third-party claims
relating to certain specified matters. The Company’s
indemnification obligation related to these specified matters is
capped at $18 million and can be terminated by the Company
if there is a change in control event for Piper Jaffray
Companies. Through December 31, 2005, the Company has paid
approximately $4 million to Piper Jaffray Companies under this
agreement.

The Company is subject to various other
litigation, investigations and legal and administrative cases
and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of its
businesses. Due to their complex nature, it may be years before
some matters are resolved. While it is impossible to ascertain
the ultimate resolution or range of financial liability with
respect to these contingent matters, the Company believes that
the aggregate amount of such liabilities will not have a
material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of
operations or cash flows of the Company.

Transfer of funds (dividends, loans or advances)
from bank subsidiaries to the Company is restricted. Federal law
prohibits loans unless they are secured and generally limits any
loan to the Company or individual affiliate to 10 percent
of each bank’s unimpaired capital and surplus. In
aggregate, loans to the Company and all affiliates cannot exceed
20 percent of each bank’s unimpaired capital and
surplus.

Dividend payments to the Company by its
subsidiary banks are subject to regulatory review and statutory
limitations and, in some instances, regulatory approval. The
approval of the Comptroller of the Currency is required if total
dividends by a national bank in any calendar year exceed the
bank’s net income for that year combined with its retained
net income for the preceding two calendar years or if the
bank’s retained earnings are less than zero. Furthermore,
dividends are restricted by the Comptroller of the
Currency’s minimum capital constraints for all national
banks. Within these guidelines, all bank subsidiaries have the
ability to pay dividends without prior regulatory approval. The
amount of dividends available to the parent company from the
bank subsidiaries at December 31, 2005, was approximately
$1.0 billion.

Report of Management

Responsibility for the financial statements and
other information presented throughout the Annual Report on
Form 10-K rests with the management of U.S. Bancorp. The
Company believes that the consolidated financial statements have
been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States and present the substance of
transactions based on the circumstances and management’s
best estimates and judgment.

In meeting its responsibilities for the
reliability of the financial statements, management is
responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system
of internal control over financial reporting as defined by
Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934. The Company’s system of internal controls is
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
publicly filed financial statements in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

To test compliance, the Company carries out an
extensive audit program. This program includes a review for
compliance with written policies and procedures and a
comprehensive review of the adequacy and effectiveness of the
internal control system. Although control procedures are
designed and tested, it must be recognized that there are limits
inherent in all systems of internal control and, therefore,
errors and irregularities may nevertheless occur. Also,
estimates and judgments are required to assess and balance the
relative cost and expected benefits of the controls. Projection
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The Board of Directors of the Company has an
Audit Committee composed of directors who are independent of
U.S. Bancorp. The committee meets periodically with
management, the internal auditors and the independent
accountants to consider audit results and to discuss internal
accounting control, auditing and financial reporting matters.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal controls over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2005. In making this assessment, management
used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission in its Internal
Control-Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment and those
criteria, management believes that the Company designed and
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2005.

The Company’s independent accountants,
Ernst & Young LLP, have been engaged to render an
independent professional opinion on the financial statements and
issue an attestation report on management’s assessment of
the Company’s system of internal control over financial
reporting. Their opinion on the financial statements appearing
on page 102 and their attestation on the system of internal
controls over financial reporting appearing on page 103 are
based on procedures conducted in accordance with auditing
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States).

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of U.S.
Bancorp:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of U.S. Bancorp as of December 31, 2005 and
2004, and the related consolidated statements of income,
shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2005. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of U.S. Bancorp at
December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the consolidated results of
its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2005, in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States), the effectiveness of U.S. Bancorp’s
internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in
Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
and our report dated February 17, 2006 expressed an unqualified
opinion thereon.

U.S. BANCORP

Report of Independent Registered Public
Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of U.S.
Bancorp:

We have audited management’s assessment,
included in the accompanying Report of Management, that U.S.
Bancorp maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria
established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). U.S. Bancorp’s
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s
assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the
company’s internal control over financial reporting based
on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance
with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that
U.S. Bancorp maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, is fairly
stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria.
Also, in our opinion, U.S. Bancorp maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2005, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States), the consolidated balance sheets of U.S. Bancorp
as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related
consolidated statements of income, shareholders’ equity,
and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2005 and our report dated February 17, 2006
expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

U.S. BANCORP

General Business Description

U.S. Bancorp is a multi-state
financial holding company headquartered in Minneapolis,
Minnesota. U.S. Bancorp was incorporated in Delaware in 1929 and
operates as a financial holding company and a bank holding
company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. U.S. Bancorp
provides a full range of financial services, including lending
and depository services, cash management, foreign exchange and
trust and investment management services. It also engages in
credit card services, merchant and automated teller machine
(“ATM”) processing, mortgage banking, insurance,
brokerage and leasing.

U.S. Bancorp’s banking subsidiaries are
engaged in the general banking business, principally in domestic
markets. The subsidiaries range in size from $35 million to
$136 billion in deposits and provide a wide range of
products and services to individuals, businesses, institutional
organizations, governmental entities and other financial
institutions. Commercial and consumer lending services are
principally offered to customers within the Company’s
domestic markets, to domestic customers with foreign operations
and within certain niche national venues. Lending services
include traditional credit products as well as credit card
services, financing and import/export trade, asset-backed
lending, agricultural finance and other products. Leasing
products are offered through bank leasing subsidiaries.
Depository services include checking accounts, savings accounts
and time certificate contracts. Ancillary services such as
foreign exchange, treasury management and receivable lock-box
collection are provided to corporate customers. U.S.
Bancorp’s bank and trust subsidiaries provide a full range
of asset management and fiduciary services for individuals,
estates, foundations, business corporations and charitable
organizations.

U.S. Bancorp’s non-banking subsidiaries
primarily offer investment and insurance products to the
Company’s customers principally within its markets and
mutual fund processing services to a broad range of mutual funds.

Banking and investment services are provided
through a network of 2,419 banking offices principally operating
in 24 states in the Midwest and West. The Company operates a
network of 5,003 branded ATMs and provides 24-hour, seven day a
week telephone customer service. Mortgage banking services are
provided through banking offices and loan production offices
throughout the Company’s markets. Consumer lending products
may be originated through banking offices, indirect
correspondents, brokers or other lending sources, and a consumer
finance division. The Company is also one of the largest
providers of
Visa

®

corporate and purchasing card services and corporate trust
services in the United States. A wholly-owned subsidiary, NOVA
Information Systems, Inc. (“NOVA”), provides merchant
processing services directly to merchants and through a network
of banking affiliations. Affiliates of NOVA provide similar
merchant services in Canada and segments of Europe. These
foreign operations are not significant to the Company.

On a full-time equivalent basis, as of
December 31, 2005, U.S. Bancorp employed 49,684 people.

Competition

The
commercial banking business is highly competitive. Subsidiary
banks compete with other commercial banks and with other
financial institutions, including savings and loan associations,
mutual savings banks, finance companies, mortgage banking
companies, credit unions and investment companies. In recent
years, competition has increased from institutions not subject
to the same regulatory restrictions as domestic banks and bank
holding companies.

Government Policies

The operations of the Company’s
various operating units are affected by state and federal
legislative changes and by policies of various regulatory
authorities, including those of the numerous states in which
they operate, the United States and foreign governments. These
policies include, for example, statutory maximum legal lending
rates, domestic monetary policies of the Board of Governors of
the Federal Reserve System, United States fiscal policy,
international currency regulations and monetary policies, U.S.
Patriot Act and capital adequacy and liquidity constraints
imposed by bank regulatory agencies.

Supervision and Regulation

As a registered bank holding company
and financial holding company under the Bank Holding Company
Act, U.S. Bancorp is subject to the supervision of, and
regulation by, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System.

Under the Bank Holding Company Act, a financial
holding company may engage in banking, managing or controlling
banks, furnishing or performing services for banks it controls,
and conducting other financial activities. U.S. Bancorp must
obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board before
acquiring more than 5 percent of the outstanding shares of
another bank or bank holding company, and must provide notice
to, and in some situations obtain the prior approval of, the
Federal Reserve Board in connection with engaging in, or
acquiring more than 5 percent of the outstanding shares of
a company engaged in, a new financial activity.

Under the Bank Holding Company Act, U.S. Bancorp
may acquire banks throughout the United States, subject only to
state or federal deposit caps and state minimum age requirements.

National banks are subject to the supervision of,
and are examined by, the Comptroller of the Currency. All
subsidiary banks of the Company are members of the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation and are subject to

U.S. BANCORP


examination by the FDIC. In practice, the primary
federal regulator makes regular examinations of each subsidiary
bank subject to its regulatory review or participates in joint
examinations with other federal regulators. Areas subject to
regulation by federal authorities include the allowance for
credit losses, investments, loans, mergers, issuance of
securities, payment of dividends, establishment of branches and
other aspects of operations.

Risk Factors

There
are a number of factors, including those specified below, that
may adversely affect the Company’s business, financial
results or stock price. Additional risks that the Company
currently does not know about or currently views as immaterial
may also impair the Company’s business or adversely impact
its financial results or stock price.

Industry Risk Factors

The Company’s business and financial
results are significantly affected by general business and
economic conditions.

The
Company’s business activities and earnings are affected by
general business conditions in the United States and abroad.
These conditions include short-term and long-term interest
rates, inflation, monetary supply, fluctuations in both debt and
equity capital markets, and the strength of the United States
economy and the local economies in which the Company operates.
For example, an economic downturn, an increase in unemployment,
or other events that affect household and/or corporate incomes
could result in a deterioration of credit quality, a change in
the allowance for credit losses, or reduced demand for credit or
fee-based products and services. Changes in the financial
performance and condition of the Company’s borrowers could
negatively affect repayment of those borrowers’ loans. In
addition, changes in securities market conditions and monetary
fluctuations could adversely affect the availability and terms
of funding necessary to meet the Company’s liquidity needs.

Changes in the domestic interest rate
environment could reduce the Company’s net interest income.

The operations of financial
institutions such as the Company are dependent to a large degree
on net interest income, which is the difference between interest
income from loans and investments and interest expense on
deposits and borrowings. An institution’s net interest
income is significantly affected by market rates of interest,
which in turn are affected by prevailing economic conditions, by
the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and
by the policies of various regulatory agencies. Like all
financial institutions, the Company’s balance sheet is
affected by fluctuations in interest rates. Volatility in
interest rates can also result in the flow of funds away from
financial institutions into direct investments. Direct
investments, such as U.S. Government and corporate securities
and other investment vehicles (including mutual funds) generally
pay higher rates of return than financial institutions, because
of the absence of federal insurance premiums and reserve
requirements.

Changes in the laws, regulations and
policies governing financial services companies could alter the
Company’s business environment and adversely affect
operations.

The Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve System regulates the supply of money and
credit in the United States. Its fiscal and monetary policies
determine in a large part the Company’s cost of funds for
lending and investing and the return that can be earned on those
loans and investments, both of which affect the Company’s
net interest margin. Federal Reserve Board policies can also
materially affect the value of financial instruments that the
Company holds, such as debt securities and mortgage servicing
rights.

The Company and its bank subsidiaries are heavily
regulated at the federal and state levels. This regulation is to
protect depositors, federal deposit insurance funds and the
banking system as a whole. Congress and state legislatures and
federal and state agencies continually review banking laws,
regulations and policies for possible changes. Changes in
statutes, regulations or policies could affect the Company in
substantial and unpredictable ways, including limiting the types
of financial services and products that the Company offers
and/or increasing the ability of non-banks to offer competing
financial services and products. The Company cannot predict
whether any of this potential legislation will be enacted, and
if enacted, the effect that it or any regulations would have on
the Company’s financial condition or results of operations.

The financial services industry is highly
competitive, and competitive pressures could intensify and
adversely affect the Company’s financial results.

The Company operates in a highly
competitive industry that could become even more competitive as
a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes
and continued consolidation. The Company competes with other
commercial banks, savings and loan associations, mutual savings
banks, finance companies, mortgage banking companies, credit
unions and investment companies. In addition, technology has
lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to
offer products and services traditionally provided by banks.
Many of the Company’s competitors have fewer regulatory
constraints and some have lower cost structures. Also, the
potential need to adapt to industry changes in information
technology systems, on which the Company and financial services
industry are highly dependent, could present operational issues
and require capital spending.

Changes in consumer use of banks and
changes in consumer spending and saving habits could adversely
affect the Company’s financial results.

Technology and other changes now
allow many consumers to complete


U.S. BANCORP

financial transactions without using banks. For
example, consumers can pay bills and transfer funds directly
without going through a bank. This “disintermediation”
could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of
customer deposits and income generated from those deposits. In
addition, changes in consumer spending and saving habits could
adversely affect the Company’s operations, and the Company
may be unable to timely develop competitive new products and
services in response to these changes that are accepted by new
and existing customers.

Acts or threats of terrorism and political
or military actions taken by the United States or other
governments could adversely affect general economic or industry
conditions.

Geopolitical
conditions may also affect the Company’s earnings. Acts or
threats or terrorism and political or military actions taken by
the United States or other governments in response to terrorism,
or similar activity, could adversely affect general economic or
industry conditions.

Company Risk Factors

The Company’s allowance for loan
losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses.

Like all financial institutions,
the Company maintains an allowance for loan losses to provide
for loan defaults and non-performance. The Company’s
allowance for loan losses is based on its historical loss
experience as well as an evaluation of the risks associated with
its loan portfolio, including the size and composition of the
loan portfolio, current economic conditions and geographic
concentrations within the portfolio. The Company’s
allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual
loan losses, and future provisions for loan losses could
materially and adversely affect its financial results.

The Company may suffer losses in its loan
portfolio despite its underwriting practices.

The Company seeks to mitigate the
risks inherent in its loan portfolio by adhering to specific
underwriting practices. These practices often include: analysis
of a borrower’s credit history, financial statements, tax
returns and cash flow projections; valuation of collateral based
on reports of independent appraisers; and verification of liquid
assets. Although the Company believes that its underwriting
criteria are appropriate for the various kinds of loans it
makes, the Company may incur losses on loans that meet these
criteria.

Maintaining or increasing the
Company’s market share may depend on lowering prices and
market acceptance of new products and services.

The Company’s success
depends, in part, on its ability to adapt its products and
services to evolving industry standards. There is increasing
pressure to provide products and services at lower prices. Lower
prices can reduce the Company’s net interest margin and
revenues from its fee-based products and services. In addition,
the widespread adoption of new technologies, including internet
services, could require the Company to make substantial
expenditures to modify or adapt the Company’s existing
products and services. Also, these and other capital investments
in the Company’s businesses may not produce expected growth
in earnings anticipated at the time of the expenditure. The
Company might not be successful in introducing new products and
services, achieving market acceptance of its products and
services, or developing and maintaining loyal customers.

Because the nature of the financial
services business involves a high volume of transactions, the
Company faces significant operational risks.

The Company operates in many
different businesses in diverse markets and relies on the
ability of its employees and systems to process a high number of
transactions. Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting
from the Company’s operations, including, but not limited
to, the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside of the
Company, the execution of unauthorized transactions by
employees, errors relating to transaction processing and
technology, breaches of the internal control system and
compliance requirements and business continuation and disaster
recovery. This risk of loss also includes the potential legal
actions that could arise as a result of an operational
deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable
regulatory standards, adverse business decisions or their
implementation, and customer attrition due to potential negative
publicity. In the event of a breakdown in the internal control
system, improper operation of systems or improper employee
actions, the Company could suffer financial loss, face
regulatory action and suffer damage to its reputation.

The change in residual value of leased
assets may have an adverse impact on the Company’s
financial results.

The Company
engages in leasing activities and is subject to the risk that
the residual value of the property under lease will be less than
the Company’s recorded asset value. Adverse changes in the
residual value of leased assets can have a negative impact on
the Company’s financial results. The risk of changes in the
realized value of the leased assets compared to recorded
residual values depends on many factors outside of the
Company’s control, including supply and demand for the
assets, collecting insurance claims, condition of the assets at
the end of the lease term, and other economic factors.

Negative publicity could damage the
Company’s reputation and adversely impact its business and
financial results.

Reputation
risk, or the risk to the Company’s earnings and capital
from negative publicity, is inherent in the Company’s
business. Negative publicity can result from the Company’s
actual or alleged conduct in any number of

U.S. BANCORP


activities, including lending practices,
corporate governance and acquisitions, and actions taken by
government regulators and community organizations in response to
those activities. Negative publicity can adversely affect the
Company’s ability to keep and attract customers and can
expose the Company to litigation and regulatory action. Because
most of the Company’s businesses operate under the
“U.S. Bank” brand, actual or alleged conduct by one
business can result in negative publicity about other businesses
the Company operates. Although the Company takes steps to
minimize reputation risk in dealing with customers and other
constituencies, the Company, as a large diversified financial
services company with a high industry profile, is inherently
exposed to this risk.

The Company’s reported financial
results depend on management’s selection of accounting
methods and certain assumptions and estimates.

The Company’s accounting
policies and methods are fundamental to how the Company records
and reports its financial condition and results of operations.
The Company’s management must exercise judgment in
selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and
methods so they comply with GAAP and reflect management’s
judgment of the most appropriate manner to report the
Company’s financial condition and results. In some cases,
management must select the accounting policy or method to apply
from two or more alternatives, any of which might be reasonable
under the circumstances yet might result in the Company’s
reporting materially different results than would have been
reported under a different alternative.

Certain accounting policies are critical to
presenting the Company’s financial condition and results.
They require management to make difficult, subjective or complex
judgments about matters that are uncertain. Materially different
amounts could be reported under different conditions or using
different assumptions or estimates. These critical accounting
policies include: the allowance for credit losses; the valuation
of mortgage servicing rights; the valuation of goodwill and
other intangible assets; and income taxes. Because of the
uncertainty of estimates involved in these matters, the Company
may be required to do one or more of the following:
significantly increase the allowance for credit losses and/or
sustain credit losses that are significantly higher than the
reserve provided; recognize significant provision for impairment
of its mortgage servicing rights; recognize significant
impairment on its goodwill and other intangible asset balances;
or significantly increase its accrued taxes liability.

For more information, refer to “Critical
Accounting Policies” in this Annual Report and
Form 10-K.

Changes in accounting standards could
materially impact the Company’s financial statements.

From time to time, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) changes the financial
accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation
of the Company’s financial statements. These changes can be
hard to predict and can materially impact how the Company
records and reports its financial condition and results of
operations. In some cases, the Company could be required to
apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in the
Company’s restating prior period financial statements.

Acquisitions may not produce revenue
enhancements or cost savings at levels or within timeframes
originally anticipated and may result in unforeseen integration
difficulties.

The Company
regularly explores opportunities to acquire financial services
businesses or assets and may also consider opportunities to
acquire other banks or financial institutions. The Company
cannot predict the number, size or timing of acquisitions.

Difficulty in integrating an acquired business or
company may cause the Company not to realize expected revenue
increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product
presence, and/or other projected benefits from the acquisition.
The integration could result in higher than expected deposit
attrition (run-off), loss of key employees, disruption of the
Company’s business or the business of the acquired company,
or otherwise adversely affect the Company’s ability to
maintain relationships with customers and employees or achieve
the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. Also, the negative
effect of any divestitures required by regulatory authorities in
acquisitions or business combinations may be greater than
expected.

The Company must generally receive federal
regulatory approval before it can acquire a bank or bank holding
company. In determining whether to approve a proposed bank
acquisition, federal bank regulators will consider, among other
factors, the effect of the acquisition on the competition,
financial condition, and future prospects. The regulators also
review current and projected capital ratios and levels, the
competence, experience, and integrity of management and its
record of compliance with laws and regulations, the convenience
and needs of the communities to be served (including the
acquiring institution’s record of compliance under the
Community Reinvestment Act) and the effectiveness of the
acquiring institution in combating money laundering activities.
In addition, the Company cannot be certain when or if, or on
what terms and conditions, any required regulatory approvals
will be granted. The Company may be required to sell banks or
branches as a condition to receiving regulatory approval.

If new laws were enacted that restrict the
ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to share information
about customers, the Company’s financial results could be
negatively affected.

The
Company’s business model


U.S. BANCORP

depends on sharing information among the family
of companies owned by U.S. Bancorp to better satisfy the
Company’s customer needs. Laws that restrict the ability of
the companies owned by U.S. Bancorp to share information about
customers could negatively affect the Company’s revenue and
profit.

The Company’s business could suffer if
the Company fails to attract and retain skilled people.

The Company’s success
depends, in large part, on its ability to attract and retain key
people. Competition for the best people in most activities the
Company engages in can be intense. The Company may not be able
to hire the best people or to keep them.

The Company relies on other companies to
provide key components of the Company’s business
infrastructure.

Third party
vendors provide key components of the Company’s business
infrastructure such as internet connections, network access and
mutual fund distribution. While the Company has selected these
third party vendors carefully, it does not control their
actions. Any problems caused by these third parties, including
as a result of their not providing the Company their services
for any reason or their performing their services poorly, could
adversely affect the Company’s ability to deliver products
and services to the Company’s customers and otherwise to
conduct its business. Replacing these third party vendors could
also entail significant delay and expense.

Significant legal actions could subject the
Company to substantial uninsured liabilities.

The Company is from time to time
subject to claims related to its operations. These claims and
legal actions, including supervisory actions by the
Company’s regulators, could involve large monetary claims
and significant defense costs. To protect itself from the cost
of these claims, the Company maintains insurance coverage in
amounts and with deductibles that it believes are appropriate
for its operations. However, the Company’s insurance
coverage may not cover all claims against the Company or
continue to be available to the Company at a reasonable cost. As
a result, the Company may be exposed to substantial uninsured
liabilities, which could adversely affect the Company’s
results of operations and financial condition.

The Company is exposed to risk of
environmental liability when it takes title to properties.

In the course of the
Company’s business, the Company may foreclose on and take
title to real estate. As a result, the Company could be subject
to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties.
The Company may be held liable to a governmental entity or to
third parties for property damage, personal injury,
investigation and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in
connection with environmental contamination or may be required
to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances or
chemical releases at a property. The costs associated with
investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. In
addition, if the Company is the owner or former owner of a
contaminated site, it may be subject to common law claims by
third parties based on damages and costs resulting from
environmental contamination emanating from the property. If the
Company becomes subject to significant environmental
liabilities, its financial condition and results of operations
could be adversely affected.

A natural disaster could harm the
Company’s business.

Natural
disasters could harm the Company’s operations directly
through interference with communications, including the
interruption or loss of the Company’s websites, which would
prevent the Company from gathering deposits, originating loans
and processing and controlling its flow of business, as well as
through the destruction of facilities and the Company’s
operational, financial and management information systems.

The Company faces systems failure risks as
well as security risks, including “hacking” and
“identity theft.”

The
computer systems and network infrastructure the Company and
others use could be vulnerable to unforeseen problems. These
problems may arise in both our internally developed systems and
the systems of our third-party service providers. Our operations
are dependent upon our ability to protect computer equipment
against damage from fire, power loss or telecommunication
failure. Any damage or failure that causes an interruption in
our operations could adversely affect our business and financial
results. In addition, our computer systems and network
infrastructure present security risks, and could be susceptible
to hacking or identity theft.

The Company relies on dividends from its
subsidiaries for its liquidity needs.

The Company is a separate and
distinct legal entity from its bank subsidiaries and non-bank
subsidiaries. The Company receives substantially all of its cash
from dividends paid by its subsidiaries. These dividends are the
principal source of funds to pay dividends on the Company’s
stock and interest and principal on its debt. Various federal
and state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends
that our bank subsidiaries and certain of our non-bank
subsidiaries may pay to the Company. Also, the Company’s
right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a
subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization is subject to
prior claims of the subsidiary’s creditors.

The Company has non-banking businesses that
are subject to various risks and uncertainties.

The Company is a diversified
financial services company and the Company’s

U.S. BANCORP


business model is based on a mix of businesses
that provide a broad range of products and services delivered
through multiple distribution channels. In addition to banking,
the Company provides payment services, investments, mortgages
and corporate and personal trust services. Although the Company
believes its diversity helps lessen the effect of downturns in
any one segment of its industry, it also means the
Company’s earnings could be subject to various specific
risks and uncertainties related to these non-banking businesses.

The Company’s stock price can be
volatile.

The Company’s stock
price can fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors,
including: actual or anticipated variations in the
Company’s quarterly operating results; recommendations by
securities analysts; significant acquisitions or business
combinations; strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital
commitments by or involving the Company or the Company’s
competitors; operating and stock price performance of other
companies that investors deem comparable to the Company; new
technology used or services offered by the Company’s
competitors; news reports relating to trends, concerns and other
issues in the financial services industry, and changes in
government regulations.

General market fluctuations, industry factors and
general economic and political conditions and events, including
terrorist attacks, economic slowdowns or recessions, interest
rate changes, credit loss trends or currency fluctuations, could
also cause the Company’s stock price to decrease regardless
of the Company’s operating results.

Properties

U.S.
Bancorp and its significant subsidiaries occupy headquarter
offices under a long-term lease in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The
Company also leases eight freestanding operations centers in
Cincinnati, Denver, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, Portland and St.
Paul. The Company owns nine principal operations centers in
Cincinnati, Coeur d’Alene, Fargo, Milwaukee, Owensboro,
Portland, St. Louis and St. Paul. At December 31, 2005, the
Company’s subsidiaries owned and operated a total of 1,431
facilities and leased an additional 1,405 facilities, all of
which are well maintained. The Company believes its current
facilities are adequate to meet its needs. Additional
information with respect to premises and equipment is presented
in Notes 10 and 23 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

ENTRY INTO CERTAIN COVENANTS

USB Capital VIII Replacement Capital Covenant

On December 29, 2005, the Company
and USB Capital VIII, a Delaware statutory trust and wholly
owned subsidiary of U.S. Bancorp, closed the public
offering of $375,000,000 principal amount of 6.35%
Trust Preferred Securities (the “Capital
Securities”), representing preferred beneficial interests
in the assets of USB Capital VIII. The proceeds from the sale by
USB Capital VIII of the Capital Securities to investors, and its
common securities to the Company, were invested by USB Capital
VIII in the Company’s 6.35% Income Capital Obligation Notes
(the “ICONs”), due 2065 (the “ICONs
Offering”).

Simultaneously with the closing of the ICONs
Offering, the Company entered into a replacement capital
covenant for the benefit of persons that buy, hold or sell a
specified series of long-term indebtedness of the Company or
U.S. Bank National Association (“ICONs Covered
Debt”). We will provide a copy of the ICONs Replacement
Capital Covenant to holders of ICONs Covered Debt upon request
made to the Investor Relations contact listed inside the back
cover of this annual report.

The ICONs replacement capital covenant provides
that the Company will not redeem or repurchase, and will cause
USB Capital VIII not to redeem or repurchase, all or any part of
the ICONs or the Capital Securities on or before
December 29, 2035, except, with certain limited exceptions,
to the extent that, during the 180 days prior to the date
of that redemption or repurchase, the Company has received
proceeds from the sale of qualifying securities that
(i) have equity-like characteristics that are the same as,
or more equity-like than, the applicable characteristics of the
ICONs at the time of redemption or repurchase and qualify as
Tier 1 capital of the Company under the capital guidelines
of the Federal Reserve Board, and (ii) the Company has
obtained prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board, if such
approval is then required by the Federal Reserve Board.

As of the date of this Annual Report, the
U.S. Bancorp 4.50% Medium-Term Notes, Series P, CUSIP
No. 91159HGJ3, constitutes ICONs Covered Debt whose holders
are entitled to the benefits of the ICONS Replacement Capital
Covenant.
