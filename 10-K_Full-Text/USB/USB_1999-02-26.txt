ABOUT THE COMPANY
- -----------------

U.S. Bancorp-Registered Trademark- is a multistate bank holding company with
headquarters in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Through our bank and other subsidiaries,
we offer a comprehensive range of financial solutions to meet the needs of
businesses, institutions, government entities, and individuals.

     The nation's 14th largest bank holding company, U.S. Bancorp assets totaled
$76.4 billion at December 31, 1998. Our market capitalization of nearly $26
billion at year-end 1998 placed us eighth among U.S. bank holding companies.

     U.S. Bancorp also ranks among the top-performing U.S. bank holding
companies in terms of profitability and efficiency. We reported 1998 return on
average assets of 2.03 percent, return on average common equity of 24.1 percent,
and an efficiency ratio of 49.1 percent, before nonrecurring items. Without the
impact of investment banking and brokerage operations, our efficiency ratio was
44.2 percent.

     U.S. Bancorp serves millions of banking customers principally in 17 states
from the Midwest to the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific Northwest. For larger
businesses and affluent clients with more complex needs, we provide
relationship-driven, customized solutions. For retail customers, including small
businesses and individuals, we focus on providing anytime, anywhere access to
high-quality products and services. Through our bank and other subsidiaries, we
also offer specialized expertise and leadership covering a broad financial
spectrum including electronic payment systems, corporate trust services, asset
management, investment banking, and securities brokerage.

     U.S. Bancorp is committed to satisfying customers and creating shareholder
value. Our five business lines--Commercial & Business Banking and Private
Financial Services, Retail Banking, Payment Systems, Corporate Trust and
Institutional Financial Services, and Investment Banking and Brokerage--focus on
fulfilling these commitments to customers and shareholders.

                               -------------------

IN 1998 WE LAID THE FOUNDATION FOR AN EVEN STRONGER U.S. BANCORP, A UNIFIED
FINANCIAL SERVICES PROVIDER WITH MORE AND BETTER TOOLS TO BUILD DEEPER CUSTOMER
RELATIONSHIPS AND CREATE SHAREHOLDER VALUE.

Successfully completing the integration of our banking operations ranks as our
greatest achievement of the year. As you know, in August 1997 First Bank System,
Inc. (FBS) acquired U.S. Bancorp of Portland, Oregon and adopted the U.S.
Bancorp name. After many months of planning, preparation and conversion, we
built a united organization serving our entire 17-state banking region with one
strong brand identity, a broad array of high-quality products and services, and
centralized systems and operations.

     In addition to combining the best of our banking organizations, we expanded
our capabilities with the May 1998 acquisition of Piper Jaffray Companies Inc.,
a full-service investment banking and securities company. We immediately began
the task of leveraging this new partnership to provide our business, private
banking, and retail customers a broader range of financial solutions. We further
enhanced our investment banking capabilities in January 1999 with the
acquisition of Libra Investments, Inc., a specialist in underwriting and trading
high yield and mezzanine securities for middle market companies.

                 CHAIRMAN, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER


     Our customers and employees have experienced tremendous change during the
bank integration and have begun to reap the rewards of our larger, smarter
organization. We have maintained outstanding financial performance during this
transition and are well-positioned to make the most of our new opportunities,
and others yet to come.

FINANCIAL RESULTS
- -----------------

U.S. Bancorp's focus on providing solutions for customers and creating value 
for shareholders remains steadfast. Shareholder value drives our management 
priorities and directs virtually every decision we make. This strategy 
- --comprised of strong market presence, core business growth and productivity, 
and technology to support our core business initiatives--has served us well, 
even through volatile economic times such as those we experienced during the 
past year.

     Before nonrecurring items, diluted earnings per common share increased to
$1.96, up 16.7 percent from 1997. U.S. Bancorp continues to rank among the
leaders in our peer group in terms of profitability. Excluding nonrecurring
items, our return on 

2                                                                  U.S. Bancorp


average assets of 2.03 percent in 1998 placed us first in our peer group of 
18 regional bank holding companies. Our return on average common equity of 
24.1 percent for the year, before nonrecurring items, also placed us first 
among our peers.

     Cost containment and productivity continue to be U.S. Bancorp hallmarks. 
Our efficiency ratio (noninterest expenses divided by total revenue), before 
nonrecurring items, was 49.1 percent in 1998, placing us second in our peer 
group. Without the impact of investment banking and brokerage activity, the 
efficiency ratio, before nonrecurring items, was 44.2 percent in 1998, 
improved from 47.9 percent in 1997. In the third quarter we reached our 
originally targeted expense reduction associated with the U.S. Bancorp 
acquisition.

     From a long-term view, our stock's relative performance remained strong.
One hundred dollars invested in U.S. Bancorp (formerly FBS) common stock on
December 31, 1989, would have been worth $858 at year-end 1998. That compares
with $520 for the KBW 50 Bank Index and $439 for the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock
Index. (Keefe Bruyette & Woods, Inc. publishes the KBW 50 Bank Index, a
market-capitalization-weighted total return index of the 50 largest U.S. banks.)

     As we begin the new year, revenue growth is our top priority. In 1998 loan
growth in 11 central states was exceptional, while six western states lagged
behind the rest of our banking region. This slower loan growth was related to
our time-consuming focus on systems conversion and training, as well as the
impact of Asian economic problems on our more export-dependent markets. We are
confident that, as employees become more familiar with the operating model that
has proven successful in our Midwest and Rocky Mountain regions--a sales-driven
culture supported by high-quality products, services, and technology--we will
generate more consistent loan growth throughout all our markets.

     Economic uncertainty lurks behind the scenes, but we are confident that our
fundamental business remains sound. Our conservative risk management practices
have served us well during this turbulent time in financial markets. Our credit
quality and reserve coverage remain strong. We have no direct exposure to
emerging markets and no exposure to hedge funds. Furthermore, we have strong
market presence in diverse, growing geographic markets.

     We are completing the implementation of our strategic plan for "Year 2000
readiness," that is, preparing our computer systems to correctly receive,
process, handle, and calculate dates on and beyond January 1, 2000. We have
substantially finished Year 2000 upgrades to our critical computer hardware and
software. This year we will conduct further testing and modifications, as
necessary. Our Year 2000 readiness reaches across our entire organization,
including phone systems, automated teller machines, and vendor relationships.

U.S. BANK INTEGRATION
- ---------------------

The launch of our new brand identity in all markets and integration of the six
western states of the former U.S. Bancorp have been successful by many measures.

     Consider the March 1998 rollout of the U.S. Bank-Registered Trademark- 
brand identity in our 11 former First Bank and Colorado National Bank states. 
By May 1998, after sign unveilings and an advertising blitz, 99 percent of 
customers in key markets were aware that the bank's name had changed. 
Awareness was 75 percent among noncustomers.

     Introducing a new name and logo was just one of many tasks involved in 
this large, complex integration. Less noticeable but perhaps more critical, 
we successfully completed more than two dozen major systems conversions. In 
the process, we maintained the integrity of millions of pieces of customer 
data. We also made a common set of high-quality financial solutions available 
to customers throughout our markets.

     Despite the changes we have put customers through,

"U.S. BANCORP'S FOCUS ON PROVIDING SOLUTIONS FOR CUSTOMERS AND CREATING VALUE 
FOR SHAREHOLDERS REMAINS STEADFAST."

we have enjoyed virtually zero customer attrition and continued to grow loans
and deposits. We thank our customers for their loyalty. One reason commercial
and high net worth customers, in particular, have stayed with us is that we have
retained nearly all employees who manage customer relationships. Our employees
deserve credit for helping guide customers through this transition.

     The post-conversion U.S. Bank is strong. Our managers and employees have
high standards, and they are focused on achieving high performance. Our
workforce is endowed with great talent and experience, as well as an improved
product set and sales tools.

     We are over our integration hurdles and have a strong focus on new business
development. By contrast, our major bank competitors are just beginning their
integration efforts. We are prepared to take full advantage of this environment.

CAPITAL ALLOCATION
- ------------------

U.S. Bancorp continues to pursue the all-important task of allocating capital to
create and preserve shareholder value. We allocate capital by:

     - MAKING STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS--As I mentioned, we are bridging the gap 
between banking and investments with the additions of U.S. Bancorp Piper 
Jaffray-Registered Trademark- and U.S. Bancorp-Registered Trademark- 
Libra-SM- (a division of U.S. Bancorp Investments, Inc.). Both will enable us 
to maintain our strong position with middle market businesses. Last year we 
also made several smaller acquisitions that broadened our capabilities, 
expanded our geographic reach, and strengthened existing businesses.

     - INVESTING IN CORE BUSINESSES--U.S. Bancorp invests in businesses that 
hold potential for strong, sustainable profitability. We manage our company 
along five business lines: Commercial & Business Banking and Private 
Financial Services, Retail Banking, Payment Systems, Corporate Trust and 
Institutional Financial Services, and Investment Banking and Brokerage. Our 
business lines were busy with integration activities in 1998, while laying 
the groundwork to improve sales and service, revenue, and profitability in 
1999. For details on how our business units are providing solutions to 
customers, please turn to page 6.

     - REPURCHASING STOCK--On June 9, 1998, the company announced a share
repurchase program of up to $2.5 billion of common stock over the period ending
March 31, 2000. At year-end, we had repurchased 24.6 million of those shares for
a total dollar value of $963 million.

     - INCREASING DIVIDENDS--On February 17, 1999, the U.S. Bancorp Board of
Directors increased the quarterly dividend to 19.50 cents from 17.50 cents, an
increase of more than 11 percent. It was our eighth consecutive annual increase.

U.S. BANCORP PEOPLE
- -------------------

In the financial services business, products and services may seem like 
commodities. However, we know from continuous innovation that short-term 
competitive advantage is possible and profitable. Perhaps more importantly, 
superior execution produces additional advantage. What truly distinguishes 
one provider from another are talented people who understand their customers' 
needs, have a wide range of high-quality tools at their disposal, and can put 
the two together to create solutions. U.S. Bancorp has this edge.

     Our employees work hard to create shareholder value, because they are 
shareholders. Their interests are aligned with yours. Most employees have the 
opportunity to own a piece of U.S. Bancorp through two programs: the U.S. 
Bancorp 401(k) Savings Plan; and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which 
enables them to purchase company stock at a discount.

     Senior managers have additional incentives to invest in U.S. Bancorp. 
More than 360 have targets to own the equivalent of 80 percent to 550 percent 
of their annual salaries in U.S. Bancorp stock. At year-end 1998, virtually 
all senior managers were on track to achieve their five-year ownership 
targets. Senior managers owned more than 10 million shares of company stock 
worth more than $359 million.

     Like our dedicated employees, our directors share responsibility for 
U.S. Bancorp's success. Six directors will retire at our annual meeting on 
April 20, 1999: Gerry B. Cameron, Carolyn Silva Chambers, Roger L. Hale, 
Richard L. Knowlton, Richard L. Schall, and Walter Scott, Jr. Along with our 
remaining directors, they have helped steward the corporation through the 
tremendous challenge of combining two great banking organizations and 
reaching beyond the traditional boundaries of our business. We thank them for 
their service and wish them well.

     We owe a special debt of gratitude to Gerry Cameron, who retired 
December 31, 1998, as Chairman of the Board. Gerry spent his entire 42-year 
career with U.S. Bancorp, former and present, and his vision made creation of 
the new U.S. Bancorp possible. Gerry's leadership from August 1997 through 
his retirement in December was instrumental in ensuring a smooth integration 
for employees, customers, and the communities we serve.

     Our company's prosperity is directly related to the well-being of the 
communities where we operate. In 1998 U.S. Bancorp contributed more than $44 
million to our communities, of which more than $21 million was cash grants in 
areas including affordable housing and economic development, K-12 education, 
artistic and cultural enrichment, and United Way. In addition to grants, 
volunteerism, loan assistance, and in-kind contributions, we provided more 
than $350 million in community development loans for revitalization efforts 
across our 17-state banking region. These contributions and investments, made 
possible by our success, will make our communities even stronger places to 
live and do business.

     We appreciate your investment in U.S. Bancorp. We expect to continue to 
win your confidence as we build on the solid foundation we have established.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

U.S. BANCORP AND ITS AFFILIATES PROVIDE AN INCREASINGLY BROAD ARRAY OF 
HIGH-QUALITY SOLUTIONS TO MEET THE WIDE-RANGING FINANCIAL NEEDS OF SMALL, 
MEDIUM AND LARGE BUSINESSES, AND GOVERNMENT ENTITIES.

We take a customized approach to addressing the capital, borrowing, deposit, 
and treasury management needs of approximately 40,000 middle market and 
larger business clients, while providing a more standard set of products and 
services to meet the less complex needs of approximately 500,000 small 
business customers. Beyond traditional banking for businesses, which we 
primarily offer in our 17-state banking region, we provide other financial 
services nationally. Our recently expanded investment banking capabilities 
include corporate finance, merger and acquisition advisory services, and debt 
and equity offerings. In addition, clients continue to benefit from our 
national leadership in electronic payment systems, investment management, and 
corporate trust services.

BANKING TAILORED TO BUSINESS NEEDS

Relationship managers located in 145 regional offices work with middle market 
and larger businesses to develop innovative solutions to address their 
clients' complex financial needs. Continuity in relationship management 
personnel contributed to our success during the integration of our banking 
operations in 1998, when we introduced significant improvements in products, 
services, and systems throughout our 17-state territory. Amidst this change, 
we continued to give clients what they tell us they want: knowledgeable 
bankers who understand their needs and provide meaningful solutions.

     As part of the integration, we adopted best practices from our combined 
organization. We offer middle market and larger businesses a consistent, 
high-quality product set. Now these products are supported by common systems, 
which facilitate doing business with us no matter where our clients' 
operations are located. Examples of enhanced products and services include 
U.S. Bank Corporate Checking, which offsets service charges on accounts with 
higher balances. Automated cash concentration transfers all of a client's 
funds to one banking location, providing faster access to those funds. And 
U.S. Bank EasyTax-SM- allows electronic tax payment to many states.

     U.S. Bank also is making substantial technology investments to enhance 
our service to middle market and larger business clients. These investments 
include the latest Windows-Registered Trademark--based, image-based, and 
internet-based treasury management services. We also are developing new 
systems for relationship management, sales management, and client service. 
Recognizing that non-credit products provide high economic value to the bank, 
we are enhancing services for our non-credit customer base. In order to 
increase our deposits and fee income, we have developed better segmentation 
and prospect lists, enhanced training and products for these segments, and 
relationship managers who focus on clients that do not require credit.

     With the December 1998 rollout of our SIMPLY BUSINESS-Registered 
Trademark- product line across our entire region, we now can provide small 
businesses one source for virtually all their financial services needs.

unsecured line of credit of $10,000 to $75,000. In keeping with our goal to 
provide single-source small business solutions, U.S. Bank Advantage Line 
clients are pre-approved for U.S. Bank Visa-Registered Trademark- Business

services, and real estate lending.

INVESTMENT BANKING EXPANDS CAPABILITIES

We have tremendous opportunities to serve our clients, attract new ones, and 
generate added revenue with our fully integrated approach to financial 
services. The combined resources of U.S. Bank, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray, and 
U.S. Bancorp Libra offer business clients the opportunity to manage their 
balance sheet with one relationship that can meet a wider range of financial 
needs. U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray offers full-service investment banking 
capabilities including equity and debt underwriting, private placement of 
equity and debt securities, trading, sales, and research, as well as corporate 
finance advisory, and merger and acquisition advisory services. U.S. Bancorp 
Libra specializes in underwriting and trading high yield and mezzanine 
securities.

     In 1998 we merged the U.S. Bancorp Investments, Inc. capital markets 
business into the Equity and Fixed Income Capital Markets groups at U.S. 
Bancorp Piper Jaffray. The capital markets groups and the bank are working 
closely together to serve clients. We have achieved early success, and future 
prospects are promising. Our initial focus in providing clients both 
commercial and investment banking services is to maximize the opportunities in 
our overlapping businesses, primarily those serving financial institutions and 
industrial companies. In addition, we merged the U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray 
high yield unit into U.S. Bancorp Libra, which opened a Minneapolis office to 
facilitate teamwork with U.S. Bank and U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray.

U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray Equity Capital Markets experienced strong financial 
results driven by an increase in merger and acquisition advisory fees, as well 
as skilled trading inventory management that helped offset the public offering 
slowdown of late summer and early fall. Equity Capital Markets focuses on 
emerging growth companies in the financial institutions, industrial growth, 
health care, technology, and consumer sectors, covering more than 300 
companies. To meet the equity financing and investment needs of issuers, we 
serve clients with integrated teams of professionals in research, investment 
banking, syndicate, institutional sales, and trading. Clients have access to a 
full range of investment banking services.

     U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray Fixed Income Capital Markets benefited from an 
outstanding municipal underwriting calendar in 1998 marked by growing volume, 
average deal size, and market share. Fixed Income Capital Markets provides 
expertise in research, trading, sales, and underwriting to individual, 
corporate, institutional, municipal, and public entity clients. We have 
expertise in both the taxable and tax-exempt markets. Our distribution 
approach combines an extensive retail system with a large fixed income 
institutional sales staff.

     Cross-selling between U.S. Bank, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray and U.S. 
Bancorp Libra already is producing results. At year-end, U.S. Bank had booked 
hundreds of millions of dollars in loan commitments with U.S. Bancorp Piper 
Jaffray clients, and other transactions were in process. Also at year-end, 
even before the U.S. Bancorp Libra acquisition closed in early January 1999, 
we were awarded several hundred million dollars in high-yield transactions and 
had many proposals pending.

INVESTING IN PAYMENT SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY

U.S. Bank Corporate Payment Systems offers programs that help businesses and 
government entities process purchases cost-effectively. The U.S. Bank 
Visa-Registered Trademark- Corporate Card is a non-revolving charge card that 
enables companies to monitor and control employee travel and entertainment 
expenses. The U.S. Bank Visa-Registered Trademark- Purchasing Card enables 
employees of large businesses to place orders directly with vendors, 
eliminating requisitions, purchase orders, and check requests. Other card 
programs include the I.M.P.A.C.-Registered Trademark- purchasing card for 
government agencies, as well as cards for payments associated with employee 
relocation, fleet services, and small business travel and entertainment.

     As the corporate payment systems industry moves to its third generation 
of products, U.S. Bank continually invests in innovative technology to help 
our clients improve productivity and lower costs. First came the U.S. Bank 
Visa Corporate and Purchasing Cards with standard, paper-based reporting of 
transaction data. Second came the mainframe and desktop generation, with 
products such as FirstLink-SM- and FirstView. Now we're entering the third 
generation, electronic commerce, which leverages the growing, widespread 
connectivity through Web-enabled technologies to change how businesses and 
government entities make purchases. We launched two electronic commerce 
initiatives in 1998: PowerTrack-SM-, a completely electronic Internet-based 
freight payment and transaction tracking system, and C.A.R.E., our Web-based 
Customer Automation and Reporting Environment.

     PowerTrack automatically pays carriers and bills shippers, saving both 
time and expense. Clients submit shipment information to PowerTrack 
electronically through the Internet or a private network, and both the shipper 
and carrier have instant access to the data. Carriers receive payments as 
quickly as 24 hours after delivery, compared with 45 to 90 days for 
paper-based processes. Shippers keep the same payment terms they had with 
traditional payment

methods and receive a consolidated monthly statement from PowerTrack. Both 
shippers and carriers can create standard reports from shipping cycle data 
that allow users to determine information such as which carriers have the best 
on-time delivery records or provide the most cost-effective service for a 
specific route.

     In 1998 we successfully integrated PowerTrack at 11 shipping management 
sites of the U.S. Department of Defense. In 1999 we will pursue cross-sell 
opportunities with our existing customers, which make up just part of an 
estimated $400 billion in annual U.S. freight shipments.

     C.A.R.E. provides an electronic interface with U.S. Bank core processing 
systems for U.S. Bank Visa Corporate and Purchasing Card clients. It has 
improved client communication with U.S. Bank by providing customized 
information and reports that clients choose at any time from secure, 
easy-to-use Internet access points. We converted our government customers to 
C.A.R.E. from desktop reporting systems in December 1998, and commercial 
customers will begin switching in 1999.

     U.S. Bank Merchant Payment Services provides electronic transaction 
processing for merchants throughout our banking region. Customers can 
electronically authorize and capture transactions from bank cards, other 
credit cards, and debit cards, as well as verify checks at the point of sale. 
We are pursuing two key strategies to grow our merchant portfolio. First, our 
focus on providing high-quality service to bank customers and other businesses 
in our 17-state region resulted in 32 percent growth in new sales in our 
regional segment in 1998. Second, our strategy of delivering credit card 
processing to businesses that haven't traditionally accepted credit cards for 
payment--including those that now accept a U.S. Bank Visa Purchasing 
Card--resulted in 46 percent growth in processing volume in our 
business-to-business segment in 1998. In addition, we introduced an online 
merchant application accessible via the U.S. Bank Web site, providing even 
easier access to our merchant processing solution for potential clients across 
the United States. In 1999 merchant processing customers will begin benefiting 
from C.A.R.E., which enables them to view statements and chargeback and 
qualification reports online.

MEETING INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT NEEDS

U.S. Bank Institutional Financial Services serves the investment needs of 
institutional investors, retirement plan sponsors and participants, and high 
net worth individuals. We deliver our products and services through three 
primary business units: First American Asset Management, First American Funds, 
and Retirement Plan Services. First

EXTENDING CAPABILITIES TO MEET CUSTOMER'S NEEDS

WHEN IT COMES TO MANAGING TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT EXPENSES, NEW YORK-BASED 
SIEMENS CORP. SETS THE STANDARD. A BEST PRACTICE IN PAYMENT SYSTEMS MANAGEMENT 
IS SIEMENS' TRAVEL DATA WAREHOUSE, A CENTRAL REPOSITORY FOR THE ENTIRE 
COMPANY. ALL TRAVEL COUNCIL MEMBERS AND SENIOR FINANCE MANAGERS HAVE ACCESS TO 
THE DATA WAREHOUSE FOR THEIR MANAGEMENT AND REPORTING NEEDS, INCLUDING TREND 
ANALYSIS, VERIFICATION OF POLICY COMPLIANCE, AND PURCHASING LEVERAGE.

U.S. BANK IS FORTUNATE TO WORK WITH SIEMENS IN MANAGING THE COMPANY'S 
EXPENSES. SIEMENS IS BOTH A U.S. BANK VISA-Registered Tradmark- CORPORATE CARD 
AND PURCHASING CARD CLIENT. WE REGULARLY SUPPLY THE SIEMENS DATA WAREHOUSE 
WITH INFORMATION FROM OUR CORPORATE AND PURCHASING CARD PROGRAM. WE HAVE 
RELATIONSHIPS WITH 50 SIEMENS LOCATIONS AND 25--NEARLY ALL--OF THE COMPANY'S 
OPERATING UNITS.

U.S. BANK HAS CONSULTED WITH SIEMENS AS WE HAVE INVESTED IN THE TECHNOLOGY AND 
EXPERTISE NEEDED TO HELP OUR CUSTOMERS MANAGE THEIR EXPENSES BETTER. THIS 
COLLABORATION IS ONE REASON WHY SIEMENS TURNED TO U.S. BANK TO HELP CAPTURE 
DISCOUNT RATES IT HAS NEGOTIATED WITH PREFERRED TRAVEL VENDORS. SIEMENS COULD 
NOT OBTAIN THE RATES UNLESS TRAVEL AGENTS AND/OR EMPLOYEES SUBMITTED THE 
IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS TO THE VENDORS. FOR VARIOUS REASONS, THE IDENTIFICATION 
NUMBERS WERE NOT ALWAYS SUBMITTED, AND SIEMENS DID NOT BENEFIT FULLY FROM 
NEGOTIATED RATES.

IN PARTNERSHIP WITH VISA U.S.A. AND 3-G INTERNATIONAL, INC., WE DEVELOPED AN 
INNOVATIVE U.S. BANK VISA CORPORATE CARD THAT DOUBLES AS A SMART CARD. IT 
CONTAINS SPECIAL MICROCHIPS THAT HAVE SIEMENS' DISCOUNT RATE IDENTIFICATION 
NUMBERS EMBEDDED IN THEM. WHEN PASSED THROUGH A READER, THE CARDS LOCK IN 
RATES THE COMPANY HAS NEGOTIATED WITH VENDORS FOR HOTEL AND CAR RENTAL. IN A 
PILOT PROGRAM THAT BEGAN IN 1998, SMART CARD READERS WERE DEPLOYED AT SEVERAL 
LOCATIONS OF SIEMENS' CAR RENTAL AND HOTEL VENDORS. MORE THAN 2,500 SIEMENS/ 
U.S. BANK VISA CORPORATE CARD USERS WERE ISSUED NEW SMART CARDS AND BEGAN 
SAVING SIGNIFICANTLY ON TRAVEL EXPENSES. WIDER USE OF SMART CARD TECHNOLOGY 
MAY BE FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD. WE ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH SIEMENS TODAY TO 
EXPLORE THE POSSIBILITIES.

American Asset Management is a multidiscipline, multistyle investment manager 
that serves institutional investors, including corporations, foundations, and 
pension and retirement plans, as well as high net worth individuals. First 
American Funds, a mutual fund family advised by First American Asset 
Management, has 38 equity, fixed income, and money market funds that span the 
full spectrum of investment objectives. Retirement Plan Services provides 
401(k) programs for small- through large-sized companies. Our programs offer a 
broad range of well-known funds, including First American Funds. In addition, 
we provide trustee and administrative services for plan sponsors.

     By packaging our investment services to meet the needs of a variety of 
investors, U.S. Bank Institutional Financial Services has attracted a growing 
client base. At the same time, we have kept our focus on maintaining 
disciplined investment processes and providing superior service. As a result, 
we are achieving our objective of gathering assets and, in turn, growing 
non-interest income. In 1998, assets under management increased nearly 24 
percent to more than $76 billion.

     One of our greatest accomplishments in 1998 was our successful 
integration of the money management subsidiary of Piper Jaffray Companies Inc. 
Employees at all levels of the two organizations completed the integration 
very efficiently. By the May 1 acquisition date, clients had consented to move 
all 393 separately managed portfolios totaling more than $6 billion in assets 
from the Piper Jaffray capital management unit to First American Asset 
Management. In addition, more than $5 billion in mutual funds were converted 
to First American Funds. Since then, the enhanced product line of our newly 
combined organization, along with the full resources of U.S. Bank, have 
created new opportunities to meet our clients' needs.

     In fall 1998, we introduced U.S. Bank Retirement Solution, a 401(k) 
program for companies with 25 to 100 employees. Retirement Solution was the 
first product to be launched jointly by U.S. Bank and U.S. Bancorp Piper 
Jaffray. In the few months that remained in 1998, brokers sold 28 new 
Retirement Solution plans with nearly $6.5 million in assets and generated new 
business proposals for more than $1.2 billion to U.S. Bank Retirement Select, 
our program for companies with more than 100 employees.

     For further information about First American Funds, see page 12.

MAINTAINING LEADERSHIP IN CORPORATE TRUST

U.S. Bank Corporate Trust Services provides trustee services for municipal, 
corporate, asset-backed and international bonds, as well as paying agent, 
escrow agent, and document collateral services. Corporate Trust Services 
continues to build the scale and low-cost structure that enables us to be 
among the nation's largest and most profitable providers in this industry. 
Through internal growth and multiple acquisitions over the past several years, 
we have developed expert service, leading-edge technology, and quality 
delivery. We are continually improving our centralized systems and operations 
that support our network of offices from coast to coast.

     In January 1999 we announced two transactions, one that will expand our 
geographic reach and another that will double the size of our document 
collateral services business when they close in March 1999. Our agreement to 
acquire the corporate trust business of Reliance Trust Co. will establish our 
presence in the southeastern United States. Consistent with our strategy of 
maintaining local offices to build and retain our client base, we will keep 
Reliance Trust's offices in Atlanta, Georgia, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and 
Nashville, Tennessee--giving us a total of 19 offices nationwide. We also have 
secured the exclusive appointment as mortgage custodian and provider of 
collateral services for Fleet Mortgage Corp. in Florence, South Carolina. With 
this appointment, U.S. Bank now provides document collateral services for 
customers with more than 2.8 million collateral files.

U.S. BANCORP SERVES AFFLUENT CLIENTS WITH ONE-STOP ACCESS TO PRIVATE BANKING, 
PERSONAL TRUST, FINANCIAL PLANNING, ESTATE PLANNING, CHARITABLE GIVING, 
INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, BROKERAGE, AND INSURANCE SERVICES. 

Through teamwork, relationship managers, investment executives, and other 
experts focus on meeting the complex financial needs of clients with high 
levels of income and net worth, including wealthy individuals and families, 
professionals and professional service firms, and foundations. U.S. Bank 
Private Financial Services and U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray provide expert, 
individualized service through 160 offices in 19 states.

DEEPENING CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS

Improved products, technology, and strategies helped strengthen our 
relationships with more than 45,000 clients of U.S. Bank Private Financial 
Services.

     To help meet the needs of Private Financial Services clients who need 
customized banking solutions, we made our successful U.S. Bank Private Select 
line of products available throughout our entire 17-state banking region. 
Available exclusively to our affluent clients who can make a $20,000 opening 
deposit, Private Select Checking pays a yield comparable to that of money 
market mutual funds. By year-end, Private Select Checking balances more than 
doubled to over $963 million, driven by growth in existing markets and product 
introduction in 11 states. The U.S. Bank Private Select CreditLine offers 
flexible rates and terms on credit lines, and ties into U.S. Bank Private 
Select Checking for overdraft protection.

     After successful testing, we continue to roll out financial planning 
services in additional markets to deliver clients a customized analysis of all 
their financial needs. State-of-the-art software enables our financial 
consultants to develop tailored plans that integrate a comprehensive cash flow 
analysis, asset allocation recommendations, and retirement and estate planning 
advice. Given these plans, clients are empowered to make informed decisions. A 
relationship team then helps clients implement their plans.

     For the ultra affluent, high net worth market, we focus on preserving and 
growing wealth. We increasingly emphasize client segmentation and service 
differentiation to provide more focused and comprehensive service levels based 
on client needs. For example, in 1998 we established a family office segment 
to serve clients with family office needs but who do not have the resources to 
establish their own family offices. Furthermore, all our markets now have 
access to charitable management specialists who advise clients and charitable 
organizations on gift planning.

EARNING CLIENT TRUST AND BUSINESS

A MIDWESTERN COMPANY EXPERIENCED TREMENDOUS CHALLENGES SHORTLY AFTER ITS 
OWNER'S DEATH. THE EXECUTIVE'S WIDOW FACED A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF FINANCIAL

A U.S. BANK PRIVATE FINANCIAL SERVICES TEAM STEPPED IN TO CREATE A MINI 
"FAMILY OFFICE" TO MANAGE THE WOMAN'S FINANCIAL AFFAIRS, INCLUDING

     U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray presents additional opportunities to deepen 
client relationships established by U.S. Bank Private Financial Services. In 
1998 we began offering Private Financial Services clients expanded brokerage 
services through U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray, and offering U.S. Bancorp Piper 
Jaffray clients full capabilities in private banking and trust services. These 
initiatives, which include co-locating U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray and Private 
Financial Services staff and establishing joint teams, will be further tested, 
refined, and implemented in 1999. Together, our banking and brokerage 
operations offer a more integrated, comprehensive array of solutions for 
clients.

BUILDING A STRONGER BROKERAGE

U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray Individual Investor Services promises to provide 
full-service securities brokerage and financial planning services with access 
to banking and trust services. Combined with U.S. Bancorp Investments, Inc., 
which offers selected investment services at U.S. Bank locations and operates 
U.S. Bancorp discount brokerage services, we have more than 100 retail 
brokerage offices, over 1,000 banking locations, and approximately 1,600 
investment representatives in 19 states.

     U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray Individual Investor Services grew through 
volatile markets in 1998, when a decline in sales of individual stocks was 
offset by continued growth in mutual fund, annuity, and insurance sales. To 
build market presence and competitive position, we are expanding the ranks of 
our investment executives and focusing on meeting the needs of distinct client 
segments. In 1998, we began merging U.S. Bancorp brokerage operations into 
U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray Individual Investor Services. By year-end 1999, 
investment executives and their clients will have moved from U.S. Bancorp 
Investments to U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray. These clients will have access to 
more sophisticated products and services such as managed accounts, powerful 
trading systems, and online access to equity research and strategic asset 
allocation models. For banking customers with less complex investment needs, 
nearly all banking locations will feature personal bankers licensed to sell 
annuities, mutual funds, and other banking products.

OFFERING HIGH-QUALITY INVESTMENT CHOICES

First American Asset Management strives for consistent, competitive 
performance over the long term. In 1998 our investment management teams 
achieved competitive results across the spectrum of equity investments, with 
standout performance in the areas of equity income and international equity, 
and we also had strong performance on the fixed income side.

     First American Funds, the mutual fund family advised by First American 
Asset Management, has 38 equity, fixed income and money market funds that span 
the full spectrum of investment objectives. The mutual fund family achieved 
dramatic growth in 1998. More than $5 billion in fund assets acquired from the 
capital management unit of Piper Jaffray Companies, combined with growth in 
existing funds, propelled First American Funds to more than $30 billion in 
assets under management, a 49 percent increase.

     High net worth individuals and other clients now have access to a 
complete spectrum of growth and value equity investment choices from First 
American Funds, including expanded fixed income offerings and the cost 
efficiencies that come from a mutual fund family with critical mass. The broad 
sales force at U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray complements strong sales from U.S. 
Bank Private Financial Services and U.S. Bank Corporate Trust Services.

U.S. BANK PROVIDES ANYTIME, ANYWHERE ACCESS TO A COMPREHENSIVE SET OF 
FINANCIAL SOLUTIONS TO MORE THAN 4 MILLION HOUSEHOLDS PRIMARILY THROUGHOUT OUR 
17-STATE BANKING REGION.

We meet a wide array of financial needs by offering high-quality retail 
deposit and credit products, debit and credit cards, investments, and 
insurance products. Customer households with checking accounts have an average 
of four U.S. Bank products. We provide access through broad distribution 
channels, including more than 1,000 banking offices (including more than 140 
in-store branches), more than 5,300 automated teller machines (including 
nearly 3,000 UBank-Registered Trademark- ATMs located in our banking region), 
UBank 24-Hour Phone Banking, and UBank Online. Our goal is to provide 
consistent, high-quality products with superior value at the greatest 
convenience to customers.

BUILDING A SALES CULTURE

During 1998 U.S. Bank focused on strengthening our retail brand and sales 
culture. We extended our product-distribution model--specialized sales and 
service staff in the branches with centralized product, distribution, and 
operations management--from 11 central states to include all our markets. We 
now incent all our branch sales people with compensation that offers them 
unlimited earnings potential and, as a result, we have attracted and retained 
sales-oriented people to drive revenue growth. In early 1999 we introduced an 
incentive program for branch service employees who make referrals to the sales 
staff. Service employees also are following new service delivery standards 
that link performance with compensation.

     In 1999 we will expand the number of personal bankers licensed to sell 
annuities, mutual funds, and other banking products. Such investment sales 
will be offered at nearly all banking locations. U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray 
will continue to serve investment clients with more sophisticated needs.

     Our Relationship Management System (RMS) now covers our entire banking 
region, with the addition of 2.4 million customers in late 1998. RMS is an 
analytical software engine systematically applied to our customer database. It 
uses customer behavioral data and predictive modeling to make better 
relationship-based decisions. Sales and service personnel, regardless of their 
location, have a comprehensive menu of options to meet customers' needs in 
areas such as credit approvals, authorizations, fee waivers, and the 
propensity to purchase additional products. Since the inception of RMS in 
1997, we have increased customer profitability and value, improved sales 
effectiveness, and lowered costs. In 1999 we will continue to develop 
effective uses for RMS.

IMPROVING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

As we introduced customers to the new U.S. Bank name and logo throughout our 
17-state region, we also provided them the best set of products and services 
from our combined organization. All retail customers now have access to 
leading products such as the U.S. Bank Home Equity Line, featuring fixed-rate 
loan options, overdraft protection and borrowing limits up to 125 percent of 
equity, as well as the

U.S. Bank Indexed Money Market, an FDIC-insured savings account that offers a 
competitive interest rate and easy access by check, telephone, branch, and ATM.

     U.S. Bank Retail Payment Systems continues to develop new credit card 
products to serve customers throughout our 17-state banking region. We aim to 
be the dominant consumer credit card issuer in the region by leveraging our 
customer base and the distribution power of our branch system. We also focus 
on building a specialized national portfolio by marketing our co-branded card 
products where our third-party commercial partners operate. In 1998 we 
achieved strong growth in our co-branded portfolio with targeted marketing 
strategies and high credit standards. Our U.S. Bank WorldPerks-Registered 
Trademark- Visa-Registered Trademark- Card portfolio, which earns cardholders 
frequent flier miles on Northwest Airlines and its partners, experienced 
continued strong growth, adding more than 58,000 net new accounts. Existing 
co-branded products such as the U.S. Bank Amway-Registered Trademark- and U.S. 
Bank King Soopers Visa Cards also continued to grow new accounts. We are 
excited about the opportunities with our new co-brand partners, Acme Markets, 
Jewel-Osco and Lucky Stores, all leaders in their respective markets.

     New partnerships announced in 1998 are expanding the solutions we provide 
to consumers. U.S. Bank now manages first mortgage sales, while an outside 
provider handles mortgage operations and marketing support. Under an agreement 
with New Century Financial Corp., which originates, purchases, sells, and 
services sub-prime mortgage loans secured primarily by first mortgages on 
single-family residences, we provide lending options for customers outside the 
bank's traditional credit standards. Additionally, U.S. Bancorp Insurance 
Services, Inc. formed an alliance with Great-West Life & Annuity Insurance Co. 
to jointly provide underwritten term and universal life insurance products to 
bank customers.

REFINING DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS

U.S. Bancorp continually strives to enhance the overall cost-effectiveness of 
our distribution channels while providing customers anytime, anywhere 
convenience. This process includes optimizing the number, location, and size 
of branches, as well as the products and services offered in each location. 
Meanwhile, customers are increasingly accessing quick, cost-effective 
distribution channels, namely the telephone, ATMs, the Internet, direct 
payroll deposits, and automated bill-paying services. No matter which option 
customers choose, our goal is to provide a consistent experience.

     Branch sales increased more than 21 percent year-over-year. While the 
number of locations increased slightly, we reduced overall branch square 
footage, resulting in significantly greater sales per square foot. After an 
extensive franchise optimization study, we have launched an aggressive 
expansion in Colorado, one of our largest markets. We opened four new in-store 
branches in Colorado in 1998, and plan to open additional free-standing and 
in-store branches in 1999, most in the Denver metropolitan area. All new 
locations feature standard design and layout that is tailored to better meet 
the sales and service needs of our customers. We will continue to make branch 
development decisions that help customers access our products and services 
more conveniently throughout our entire banking region and, therefore, 
continue to improve our sales per employee, sales per square foot, and 
profitability.

     Inbound and outbound telephone calls, as well as ATMs, remain key 
components of our distribution strategy, and we continually enhance the 
feature-functionality of these services.

PRODUCING ANOTHER SATISFIED CUSTOMER

JAMES AND PENELOPE GIBSON OF MCCALL, IDAHO STARTED BANKING WITH A U.S. BANK 
PREDECESSOR 11 YEARS AGO, SUBSEQUENTLY EXPERIENCING THREE BANK MERGERS. WITH 
THE NEW U.S. BANK, THEY FEARED LOSING THE ATTENTIVE SERVICE FROM THEIR BRANCH.

HOWEVER, IN 1998, HIGH-QUALITY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO MEET THEIR NEEDS DREW 
THE GIBSONS CLOSER TO U.S. BANK. A PERSONAL BANKER IN MCCALL GUIDED THE 
GIBSONS TO IMPROVED PRODUCTS SUCH AS U.S. BANK CHECKING 55+, FEE-FREE BECAUSE 
THEY USE DIRECT DEPOSIT SERVICES--DISCOUNTED SAFE DEPOSIT BOX INCLUDED. THEY 
ALSO OPENED A SAVINGS ACCOUNT AND SAVINGS CERTIFICATE, AND REFINANCED THEIR 
HOME MORTGAGE WITH A U.S. BANK HOME LOAN.

PLEASED WITH THE EASE OF REFINANCING, THE GIBSONS ACCEPTED THEIR BANKER'S 
REFERRAL TO A TRUST OFFICER IN BOISE. THEY FOLLOWED ADVICE TO TRANSFER A 
FAMILY TRUST ACCOUNT ADMINISTERED IN CALIFORNIA BY A COMPETING INSTITUTION TO 
U.S. BANK TRUST IN VANCOUVER, WASHINGTON--A TAX-SAVING MOVE IN THEIR SITUATION 
DUE TO DIFFERENT STATE LAWS.

THE GIBSONS PRIMARILY CONDUCT THEIR BANKING AT THE MCCALL BRANCH. HOWEVER, 
THEY USE THEIR CONVENIENT UBANK-Registered Tradmark- CHECK CARD AND UBANK ATMS 
ON THEIR FREQUENT TRAVELS THROUGHOUT THE NORTHWEST REGION, AND THEY ALSO 
ACCESS UBANK 24-HOUR PHONE BANKING TO CHECK BALANCES AND TRANSFER FUNDS.

BANKING ON THE WEB

Online banking using personal financial management software and the 
Internet is growing quickly, and we anticipate that the Internet will become 
our primary online delivery mechanism. In March 1998 we launched 
UBank-Registered Trademark- Online Express, our Web-based online banking 
option located at www.usbank.com. Customers can log on, register for a 
password, and immediately begin to check balances, view account history, and 
transfer funds between checking and savings accounts, credit lines, and credit 
cards. Customers also can use the Web site to apply for home equity loans, 
credit cards, and other products and services, make investments, locate 
branches and ATMs, and communicate with customer service representatives by 
e-mail.

     As of year-end, more than 13,000 visitors were reaching our Web site per 
day, with nearly two-thirds of these being customers making inquiries or 
conducting transactions related to their U.S. Bank accounts. The visitor count 
is rising by an average of 10 percent per month.

     In 1998, ADVERTISING AGE'S BUSINESS MARKETING named U.S. Bank as having one
of the top 50 business-to-business Web sites and the second-highest-ranked Web
site among banks based on functionality, content, design and response, as well
as overall effectiveness in adapting the Internet to our business strategies. We
will expand our successful Internet capabilities in 1999.

                      MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OVERVIEW

SUMMARY OF 1998 RESULTS U.S. Bancorp (the "Company") earned record operating 
earnings (net income excluding nonrecurring items) of $1.46 billion in 1998, 
up 16 percent from 1997 operating earnings of $1.26 billion. On a diluted 
share basis, operating earnings were $1.96 in 1998, compared with $1.68 in 
1997. Return on average assets and return on average common equity, excluding 
nonrecurring items, were 2.03 percent and 24.1 percent, compared with returns 
of 1.83 percent and 22.0 percent in 1997. Excluding nonrecurring items, the 
efficiency ratio (the ratio of expenses to revenues) was 49.1 percent in 1998, 
compared with 48.9 percent in 1997.

     The strong 1998 results reflect growth in noninterest income and a 
decrease in noninterest expense from core banking activity, resulting 
primarily from the cost savings achieved from the acquisition of the former 
U.S. Bancorp ("USBC") of Portland, Oregon. On May 1, 1998, the Company 
completed the acquisition of Piper Jaffray Companies Inc. ("Piper Jaffray") 
which affects comparisons to prior periods. Excluding Piper Jaffray, 
noninterest income, before nonrecurring items, increased $238 million (15 
percent), reflecting growth in credit card fee revenue and trust and 
investment management fees. On the same basis, noninterest expense, before 
nonrecurring items, declined $88 million (4 percent) from 1997. The banking 
efficiency ratio (the ratio of expenses to revenues without the impact of 
investment banking and brokerage activity) before nonrecurring items, was 44.2 
percent in 1998, compared with 47.9 percent in 1997 reflecting benefits of the 
Company's integration efforts.

     Net income was $1.3 billion in 1998, or $1.78 per diluted share, compared 
with $838.5 million, or $1.11 per diluted share, in 1997. Return on average 
assets and return on average common equity were 1.85 percent and 21.9 percent, 
compared with returns of 1.22 percent and 14.6 percent in 1997. Net income 
reflects nonrecurring items, primarily merger-related, of $128.4 million 
($203.9 million on a pre-tax basis) in 1998 and $416.7 million ($593.6 million 
on a pre-tax basis) in 1997. The 1997 nonrecurring items include a $95.0 
million merger-related provision for credit losses. See pages 22 through 24 
for further discussion on nonrecurring items.

ACQUISITION AND DIVESTITURE ACTIVITY On August 1, 1997, First Bank System, 
Inc. completed its acquisition of USBC and simultaneously changed its name to 
U.S. Bancorp. The transaction was accounted for as a pooling-of-interests. 
Since August of 1997, after tax merger-related items associated with the 
acquisition of USBC have totaled $546.3 million. As of December 31, 1998, 
integration activities are substantially complete and no additional charges 
for USBC are expected to be incurred.

     On May 1, 1998, the Company completed its acquisition of Piper Jaffray, a 
full-service investment banking and securities brokerage firm. The acquisition 
allows the Company to offer investment banking and institutional and retail 
brokerage services through a new subsidiary known as U.S. Bancorp Piper 
Jaffray Inc. The acquisition of Piper Jaffray was accounted for under the 
purchase method of accounting, and accordingly, the purchase price of $738 
million (including $719 million aggregate cash consideration for Piper Jaffray 
shares outstanding) was allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
based on their fair values at the date of acquisition.

     On December 15, 1998, the Company completed its acquisition of Northwest 
Bancshares, Inc., a privately held bank holding company headquartered in 
Vancouver, Washington, with 10 banking locations and $344 million in deposits. 
The transaction was accounted for as a purchase transaction.

     During 1997, the Company completed three purchase acquisitions of banks 
in its operating region: Zappco, Inc. of St. Cloud, Minnesota; Business and 
Professional Bank of Sacramento, California; and Sun Capital Bancorp of St. 
George, Utah. The Company also acquired the bond indenture and paying agency 
business of Comerica Incorporated and securitized and sold $420 million of 
corporate charge card receivables during 1997.

additional information regarding acquisitions and divestitures.

LINE OF BUSINESS FINANCIAL REVIEW

Effective in 1998, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. ("SFAS") 
131, "Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information" 
requires all public companies to provide financial disclosures and descriptive 
information about reportable operating segments. Operating segments are 
components of an enterprise about which financial information is available and 
is evaluated regularly in deciding how to allocate resources and assess 
performance. Within the Company, financial performance is measured by major 
lines of business, which include: Commercial & Business Banking and Private 
Financial Services, Retail Banking, Payment Systems,

Corporate Trust and Institutional Financial Services, and Investment Banking 
and Brokerage. These segments are determined based on the products and 
services provided to customers through various distribution channels.

BASIS OF FINANCIAL PRESENTATION Business line results are derived from the 
Company's business unit profitability reporting system by specifically 
attributing managed balance sheet assets, deposits and other liabilities and 
their related interest income or expense. Funds transfer pricing 
methodologies are utilized to allocate a cost for funds used or credit for 
funds provided to all business line assets and liabilities using a matched 
funding concept. Noninterest income and expenses directly related to each 
business line, including fees, service charges, salaries and benefits, and 
other direct expenses are accounted for within each segment's financial 
results in a manner similar to the consolidated financial statements. 
Noninterest expenses incurred by centrally managed operational units that 
support business lines' operations are directly charged to the business lines 
based on standard unit costs and volume measurements. Indirect expenses are 
allocated pro-rata based on the ratio of the business line's direct expense 
to total consolidated noninterest expense. Income taxes are assessed at the 
consolidated effective tax rate. Nonrecurring items are not identified by or 
allocated to lines of business. Since the Company's decision-making process 
emphasizes the creation of shareholder value, capital is allocated to each 
line of business based on its inherent risks, including credit, operational 
and other business risks. On and off-balance sheet assets subject to credit 
risk are assigned risk factors based upon expected loss experience and 
volatility taking into consideration changes in business practices that may 
introduce more or less risk into the portfolio. Certain lines of business, 
such as the Corporate Trust and Institutional Financial Services, have no 
significant balance sheet components. For these business lines, capital is 
allocated taking into consideration fiduciary and operational risk, capital 
levels of independent organizations operating similar businesses, and 
regulatory minimum requirements. Designations, assignments, and allocations 
may change from time to time as management accounting systems are enhanced or 
product lines change. During 1998 certain organization and methodology 
changes were made and 1997 and 1996 results are presented on a comparable 
basis.

COMMERCIAL & BUSINESS BANKING AND PRIVATE FINANCIAL SERVICES Commercial & 
Business Banking and Private Financial Services includes lending, treasury 
management, and other financial services to middle market, large corporate 
and mortgage banking companies and private banking and personal trust 
clients. Operating earnings increased to $701.5 million in 1998, compared 
with $631.5 million in 1997 and $570.2 million in 1996. Return on average 
assets was 1.73 percent in 1998, compared with 1.65 percent in 1997 and 1.58 
percent in 1996, and net tangible return on average common equity was 32.1 
percent in 1998, compared with 27.3 and 23.7 percent in 1997 and 1996 
respectively.

     Net interest income increased each year, reflecting growth in average 
loan and deposit balances partially offset by margin compression in the 
commercial loan and deposit portfolios. The provision for credit losses 
decreased $12.9 million in 1998 primarily due to an improvement in 
nonperforming assets and related credit performance of the commercial loan 
portfolio. Noninterest income increased $25.8 million in 1998 to $361.7 
million, compared with $335.9 million in 1997. The increase reflects 
increased trust fees and other fees. Noninterest expense decreased $27.7 
million in 1998 to $583.7 million as compared with 1997, reflecting expense 
savings attained from the integration of USBC. Noninterest expense in 1997 
was $611.4 million, a $14.7 million increase from 1996. The efficiency ratio 
on a cash basis improved to 30.0 percent in 1998, compared with 34.7 percent 
in 1997 and 37.0 percent in 1996.

RETAIL BANKING Retail Banking delivers products and services to the broad 
consumer market and small-business through branch offices, telemarketing, 
direct mail, and automated teller machines ("ATMs"). Operating earnings were 
$443.1 million in 1998, compared with $402.5 million in 1997 and $378.3 
million in 1996. Return on average assets increased to 2.01 percent from 1.72 
percent in 1997 and 1.54 percent in 1996. Net tangible return on average 
common equity increased to 41.2 percent from 39.3 percent and 32.7 percent in 
1997 and 1996, respectively.

     Net interest income declined each year, due primarily to the planned 
runoff of the residential mortgage loan portfolio partially offset by a 
decline in deposits and by growth in home equity loans. The provision for 
credit losses increased $17.2 million in 1998 to $184.9 million, compared to 
$167.7 million in 1997. The increase reflects growth in the consumer loan 
portfolios and an increase in

credit-related fraud losses. Noninterest income was $505.7 million in 1998, 
relatively flat to the $506.0 million in 1997 but an increase over the 1996 
total of $445.0 million. The increase from 1996 to 1997 is due primarily to 
increased service charges on deposits. Noninterest expense decreased each 
year, reflecting the benefits of continued streamlining of branch operations, 
as well as the integration of recent business combinations. The efficiency 
ratio on a cash basis improved to 52.1 percent in 1998, compared to 56.6 
percent in 1997 and 61.4 percent in 1996.

PAYMENT SYSTEMS Payment Systems includes consumer and business credit cards, 
corporate and purchasing card services, card-accessed secured and unsecured 
lines of credit, ATM processing, and merchant processing. Operating earnings 
increased to $188.4 million in 1998, compared with $134.2 million in 1997 and 
$120.2 million in 1996. Return on average assets was 2.67 percent in 1998, 
compared with 2.18 percent in 1997 and 2.13 percent in 1996. Net tangible 
return on average common equity improved to 50.4 percent in 1998, compared 
with 39.0 percent in 1997 and 41.9 percent in 1996.

     Fee-based noninterest income increased $158.9 million in 1998 to $592.4 
million, compared with $433.5 million in 1997. In 1996, fee-based noninterest 
income was $376.2 million. The 1998 increase was due to growth in the sales 
volume of the corporate card, the purchasing card, and the Northwest Airlines 
WorldPerks-Registered Trademark- credit card, and an increase in the 
commercial and consumer card interchange rates as well as the buyout of the 
third party interest in a merchant processing alliance. Payment Systems 
expects a more moderate growth in credit card revenue in 1999 due to the loss 
of approximately 50 percent of the U.S. Government purchasing card business, 
effective December 1, 1998. See Table 5, Noninterest Income, for additional 
information. Noninterest expense increased due to increased technology 
spending and costs related to increased sales volume. Net tangible return on 
average common equity improved to 50.4 percent in 1998, compared to 39.0 
percent in 1997 and 41.9 percent in 1996.

CORPORATE TRUST AND INSTITUTIONAL FINANCIAL SERVICES Corporate Trust and 
Institutional Financial Services includes institutional and corporate trust 
services, investment management services, and the former Piper Capital 
Management acquired in May of 1998. Operating earnings increased to $118.1 
million in 1998, compared with $88.9 million in 1997 and $72.5 million in 
1996. Net tangible return on average common equity was 46.0 percent in 1998, 
compared with 41.1 percent and 39.8 percent in 1997 and 1996, respectively.

     Noninterest income increased to $303.0 million in 1998 from $251.6 
million in 1997 and $236.5 million in 1996. The increases are due primarily 
to increases in mutual fund advisory fees and corporate trust fees. The 
efficiency ratio on a cash basis improved to 45.5 percent in 1998 from 47.2 
percent in 1997 and 50.2 percent in 1996, reflecting the effective 
integration of acquisitions, process re-engineering efforts, and revenue 
growth.

INVESTMENT BANKING AND BROKERAGE Investment Banking and Brokerage includes 
the U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray broker/dealer and U.S. Bancorp's existing 
broker/dealer operations. The U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray broker/dealer is a 
full-service brokerage company that was acquired as part of the acquisition 
of Piper Jaffray Companies Inc. on May 1, 1998. Table 2 reflects the results 
of the U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray broker/dealer since the acquisition date, 
including the amortization of intangible assets and employee retention 
programs (totaling $32.5 million in 1998), and U.S. Bancorp's existing 
broker/dealer operations for all periods.

TABLE 4  NET INTEREST INCOME - CHANGES DUE TO RATE AND VOLUME



THIS TABLE SHOWS THE COMPONENTS OF THE CHANGE IN NET INTEREST INCOME BY 
VOLUME AND RATE ON A TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT BASIS. THE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN RATES 
ON VOLUME CHANGES IS ALLOCATED BASED ON THE PERCENTAGE RELATIONSHIP OF 
CHANGES IN VOLUME AND CHANGES IN RATE. THIS TABLE DOES NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT 
THE LEVEL OF NONINTEREST-BEARING FUNDING, NOR DOES IT FULLY REFLECT CHANGES 
IN THE MIX OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

STATEMENT OF INCOME ANALYSIS

NET INTEREST INCOME Net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis was 
$3.11 billion in 1998 and 1997 and $3.03 billion in 1996. Average earning 
assets increased $2.2 billion (4 percent) in 1998, driven by core commercial 
and consumer loan growth, partially offset by reductions in investment 
securities and residential mortgages. Average loans were up $2.5 billion (5 
percent) from 1997. Excluding residential mortgage loan balances, 1998 
average loans were higher by approximately $3.4 billion (7 percent) than 
1997, reflecting growth in commercial loans, home equity and second mortgages 
and credit card loans. Loan growth in the Western states was not as robust as 
in the Midwest or the Rocky Mountain states due to the Company's focus on 
customer retention, employee training and conversion, as well as the impact 
of Asian economic problems on the level of exports from the region and 
related economic activity and the Company's desire to maintain strong credit 
quality during turbulence in the financial markets. See Table 7 for detail of 
the Company's loan portfolio distribution.

     Average available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities were $917 
million lower in 1998 compared with 1997, reflecting both maturities and 
sales of securities.

     Despite the growth in earning assets, net interest income remained 
virtually unchanged due to a decline in net interest margin during 1998. The 
net interest margin, on a taxable-equivalent basis declined to 4.87 percent 
in 1998 from 5.04 percent in 1997 and 1996. The decrease was primarily due to 
growth in Payment Systems' noninterest-bearing assets including corporate and 
purchasing card loan balances, the funding required by the Piper Jaffray 
acquisition and the share repurchase program, and margin compression in the 
commercial loan portfolio.

     The increase in net interest income from 1996 to 1997 was primarily 
attributable to growth in earning assets, driven by core commercial and 
consumer loan production partially offset by reductions in available-for-sale 
and held-to-maturity securities and residential mortgages. Average loans were 
up $2.7 billion (5 percent) from 1996 to 1997 reflecting growth in 
commercial, home equity and credit card portfolios offset by reductions in 
other consumer loans.

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES The provision for credit losses was $379.0 
million in 1998, compared to $460.3 million in 1997 and $271.2 million in 
1996. The provision for 1997 included a $95.0 million merger-related charge 
related to the USBC acquisition. Net charge-offs totaled $434.2 million in 
1998, $449.7 million in 1997 and $261.5 million in 1996. Net charge-offs for 
1997 included $62.3 million of merger-related charge-offs. The $95.0 
merger-related provision and $62.3 million of charge-offs were taken as a 
result of an alignment of the classification and charge-off practices of 
former USBC with those of the Company. Excluding merger-related provisions, 
the provision increased by $13.7 million in 1998 reflecting growth in the 
portfolios.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TABLE 5  NONINTEREST INCOME



The provision for credit losses was $55.2 million lower than net charge-offs 
in 1998 primarily due to continuation of a strong domestic economy, reduced 
exposure to foreign markets and improvements in the commercial loan portfolio 
as reflected in a decline in commercial nonperforming assets of $21.0 million 
in 1998. Excluding merger-related activities, net charge-offs increased by 
$46.8 million in 1998, reflecting growth in consumer loans and higher credit 
related fraud losses. The higher provision and net charge-offs in 1997 as 
compared with 1996, excluding the merger-related provision, resulted from 
increased loan growth and higher commercial net charge-offs. Refer to 
"Corporate Risk Profile" for further information on credit quality.

NONINTEREST INCOME Noninterest income was $2.26 billion in 1998, compared 
with $1.62 billion in 1997 and $1.78 billion in 1996. A number of 
nonrecurring gains affected noninterest income each year as summarized in 
Table 5. Nonrecurring gains in 1998 included $12.6 million in net securities 
gains. Nonrecurring gains for 1997 included a $9.4 million gain on the sale 
of an affinity credit card portfolio and $3.6 million in net securities 
gains. Nonrecurring gains for 1996 included: $190 million, net of expenses, 
received for the termination of the First Interstate Bancorp merger 
agreement; a $65 million state tax refund, including interest; a $45.8 
million gain on the sale of the Company's mortgage banking operations; a 
$25.6 million gain on branch and credit card portfolio sales; a $4.2 million 
gain on the sale of premises; and, $20.8 million in net securities gains.

     Excluding nonrecurring items, noninterest income in 1998 was $2.24 
billion, compared with $1.60 billion in 1997 and $1.43 billion in 1996. 
Excluding nonrecurring items and the effect of the Piper Jaffray acquisition, 
noninterest income increased $237.6 million (15 percent) in 1998. The 
increase resulted principally from growth in credit card revenue of $156.0 
million and trust and investment management fee revenue of $65.0 million. 
Credit card revenue increased primarily due to higher volumes for purchasing 
and corporate cards, and the Northwest Airline WorldPerks program. In 
addition, the Company's revenue base was affected by the renewal of the 
WorldPerks program in late 1997 and the buyout of the third party interest in 
a merchant processing alliance in early 1998. Without these items, credit 
card fees would have increased 27 percent. During the third quarter of 1998, 
the U.S. Government completed its bidding process for agency purchasing card 
contracts for which the Company had been the exclusive provider. The Company 
retained approximately one-half of the business. The new contracts were 
effective December 1, 1998, and, on a pro forma basis, this change represents 
a reduction in earnings per share of $.05, annually. Trust and investment 
management fees, investment products fees and commissions and investment 
banking revenue increased due to core growth in corporate, institutional and 
personal trust businesses and the acquisition of Piper Jaffray. Excluding 
nonrecurring items, noninterest income in 1997 increased $170.5 million (12 
percent) as compared to 1996. The increase was primarily due to growth in 
credit card revenue resulting from higher sales volumes, asset growth in core 
trust businesses and service charges on increasing demand deposit account 
balances.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE Noninterest expense was $2.84 billion in 1998, compared 
with $2.81 billion in 1997 and $2.54 billion in 1996. Total noninterest 
expense included nonrecurring charges of $216.5 million in 1998, compared to 
$511.6 million in 1997 and $206.3 million in 1996 as summarized in Table 6. 
During 1998, the Company incurred $203.8 million of merger-related expenses 
to integrate

USBC and $11.7 million related to the acquisition of Piper Jaffray. These 
merger-related expenses are primarily system conversion costs. As of December 
31, 1998, the Company has substantially completed its integration activities 
associated with the acquisition of USBC with no additional charges expected 
to be incurred. Approximately $20 million ($12 million after-tax) in 
merger-related charges are expected to be incurred with respect to Piper 
Jaffray in 1999. Nonrecurring items in 1997 consisted of merger-related 
charges of $511.6 million incurred in connection with the USBC transaction, 
including: $232.3 million of severance costs; $77.2 million of 
occupancy/equipment writedowns; $43.4 million of capitalized software and 
other asset write-offs; $35.0 million of investment banking and other 
transaction costs; $72.7 million of conversion expenses incurred; and, $51.0 
million of other merger-related expenses. Nonrecurring charges in 1996 
included: merger and integration charges of $49.5 million for the 
acquisitions of FirsTier Financial, Inc., the BankAmerica corporate trust 
business and West One Bancorp; $38.6 million in branch distribution resizing 
expenses; a $29.5 million valuation adjustment to reduce the carrying value 
of credit card and core deposit intangibles to estimated fair value; $10.1 
million for a one-time $750 per-employee bonus; $17.3 million to acquire 
credit card and revolving credit software and to write-off other 
miscellaneous assets; and, a $61.3 million one-time special assessment by the 
FDIC on SAIF deposits. Refer to Note M of the Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements for further information on merger, integration and resizing 
charges.

     Excluding nonrecurring items, 1998 noninterest expense was $2.63 
billion, compared with $2.30 billion in 1997 and $2.33 billion in 1996. 
Without the effect of Piper Jaffray, noninterest expense, before nonrecurring 
items, decreased by $87.8 million in 1998, primarily reflecting the expense 
savings from the integration of USBC. Total salaries and benefits (excluding 
nonrecurring charges) were $1.43 billion in 1998, compared with $1.19 billion 
in 1997 and $1.17 billion in 1996. Average full-time equivalent employees 
increased 3 percent to 26,526 in 1998 from 25,858 in 1997. Amortization of 
goodwill and other intangible assets was $143.7 million in 1998, $113.3 
million in 1997, and $100.6 million in 1996. The increases were a result of 
the Piper Jaffray acquisition plus several small bank and portfolio purchases 
during 1997 and the buyout of a merchant processing alliance. The banking 
efficiency

ratio (the ratio of expenses to revenue without the impact of investment 
banking and brokerage activity), before nonrecurring items, was 44.2 percent 
for 1998, compared with 47.9 percent and 51.5 percent in 1997 and 1996, 
respectively. The keys to this high productivity are a tight cost control 
culture throughout the organization and the successful integration of 
acquisitions.

     Since 1996, the Company has undertaken efforts to address the "Year 
2000" computer problem as discussed in further detail on pages 34 and 35 
under Corporate Risk Profile. In connection with its Year 2000 project, the 
Company has substantially completed the evaluation, replacement, renovation, 
installation and testing of its critical internal computer hardware and 
software and embedded technologies. Remediation and testing of non-critical 
systems is in progress and is expected to be substantially completed during 
1999. The Company estimates that the cost of its Year 2000 project will 
aggregate less than $50 million over the three-year period ending December 
31, 1999. The Company has not deferred any material information technology 
projects as a consequence of its Year 2000 efforts.

INCOME TAX EXPENSE The provision for income taxes was $766.5 million in 1998, 
compared with $552.2 million in 1997 and $725.7 million in 1996. The increase 
in income taxes provided in 1998 from 1997 was primarily the result of 
changes in taxable income due to the nonrecurring items discussed above. The 
Company's effective tax rate was 36.6 percent in 1998, compared to 39.7 
percent in 1997 and 37.3 percent in 1996. The effective rate declined in 1998 
primarily due to $39.1 million of non-deductible merger-related costs 
included in 1997 associated with the acquisition of USBC.

     At December 31, 1998, the Company's net deferred tax asset was $261.3 
million, compared with $108.2 million at December 31, 1997. In determining 
that realization of the deferred tax asset was more likely than not, the 
Company gave consideration to a number of factors, including its recent 
earnings history and available tax carrybacks, its expectations for earnings 
in the future and, where applicable, the expiration dates associated with tax 
carryforwards. For further information on income taxes, refer to Note N of 
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS

LOANS The Company's loan portfolio increased $4.4 billion to $59.1 billion at 
December 31, 1998, from $54.7 billion at December 31, 1997. Excluding 
residential mortgages, average loans for 1998 were $3.4 billion higher than 
1997, reflecting core growth in the commercial, home equity and second 
mortgages and credit card portfolios. Supplementing this core growth, the 
Company acquired $1.4 billion of consumer loans during 1998 from third party 
originators including credit card accounts, home equity and 
high-loan-to-value second mortgages increasing average loan balances by 
$205.4 million from 1997. The Company's loan portfolio carries credit risk, 
which may ultimately result in loan charge-offs. The Company manages this risk

through stringent, centralized credit policies and review procedures, as well 
as diversification along geographic and customer lines. See "Corporate Risk 
Profile" for a more detailed discussion of the management of credit risk 
including the allowance for credit losses.

COMMERCIAL Commercial loans totaled $26.0 billion at year-end 1998, up $2.6 
billion (11 percent) from year-end 1997. Year-end 1997 commercial loans were 
$23.4 billion, up $2.0 billion (9 percent) from year-end 1996. The increase 
was primarily attributable to growth in core commercial loans within all 
industry groups.

     The Company offers a broad array of traditional commercial lending 
products and specialized products such as asset-based lending, agricultural 
credit, correspondent banking and energy lending. The Company monitors and 
manages the portfolio diversification by industry, customer and geography. 
The commercial portfolio reflects the Company's focus of serving middle 
market and larger corporate businesses throughout its 17 state banking region 
and national customers within certain niche industry groups. The Company also 
provides financing to enable customers to grow their businesses through 
acquisitions of existing businesses, buyouts or other recapitalizations. 
These leveraged financings are diversified among industry groups and 
underwritten based on demonstrated historical cash flows of the business.

     Table 8 shows the significant industry groups based on commercial loans 
outstanding at December 31, 1998. This diverse mix of industries is similar 
to 1997 and 1996.

TABLE 9  COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE EXPOSURE BY PROPERTY TYPE AND GEOGRAPHY


- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

U.S. Bancorp                                                                 25




     The Company's Asian exposure at December 31, 1998, was approximately 
$49.0 million consisting primarily of trade letters of credit. Commercial 
credit exposure to other distressed foreign economies including Brazil and 
Russia was minimal at year end.

     The geographical distribution of the commercial portfolio is 
concentrated in the Company's banking region, with approximately 50 percent 
of amounts outstanding to borrowers in Washington, Minnesota and Oregon.

COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE The Company's portfolio of commercial real estate 
mortgages and construction loans grew to $11.3 billion at December 31, 1998, 
compared with $10.4 billion at December 31, 1997, primarily due to an 
increase in construction loans of $710 million related to successful business 
development efforts and general growth in the commercial real estate sector.

     Commercial mortgages outstanding increased to $8.2 billion at December 
31, 1998, compared with $8.0 billion at December 31, 1997. Real estate 
construction loans at December 31, 1998, totaled $3.1 billion compared with 
$2.4 billion from year-end 1997. Table 9 shows the detail of real estate 
exposures by property type and geographic location. The Company maintains the 
real estate construction designation until the project is producing 
sufficient cash flow to service traditional mortgage financing, at which 
time, if retained, the loan is transferred to the commercial mortgage 
portfolio. Approximately $374.8 million of construction loans were 
transferred to the commercial mortgage portfolio in 1998.

     At year-end 1998, real estate secured $160 million of tax-exempt 
industrial development loans and $1.15 billion of standby letters of credit. 
At year-end 1997, these exposures totaled $170 million and $1.02 billion, 
respectively. The Company's commercial real estate mortgages and construction 
loans had combined unfunded commitments of $2.68 billion at December 31, 
1998, and $2.38 billion at December 31, 1997.

     The Company also finances the operations of real estate developers and 
other entities with operations related to real estate. These loans are not 
secured directly by real estate and are subject to terms and conditions 
similar to commercial loans. These loans are included in the commercial loan 
category and totaled $1.78 billion at December 31, 1998, and $1.08 billion at 
December 31, 1997.

CONSUMER Total consumer loan outstandings increased $961 million to $21.9 
billion at December 31, 1998, from $20.9 billion at December 31, 1997. 
Excluding a $1.1 billion (25 percent) decrease in residential mortgage loans, 
consumer loans increased $2.0 billion (12 percent), primarily due to growth 
in home equity and second mortgage loans and core consumer loans. Home equity 
and second mortgages increased $1.6 billion due to the Company's purchase of 
a $900 million portfolio of high-loan-to-value ("high-LTV") second mortgages 
and successful marketing promotions. Both the yields and credit costs 
associated with the purchased loans are expected to be higher than the 
typical home equity loans originated by the Company. The decrease in 
residential mortgages reflects the Company's continuing emphasis on other 
consumer loan products.

     Of total consumer balances outstanding, approximately 85 percent are to 
customers located in the Company's banking region. See "Corporate Risk 
Profile" for a discussion of the general economic conditions within the 
Company's banking region.

SECURITIES At December 31, 1998, available-for-sale securities totaled $5.6 
billion compared with $6.9 billion at December 31, 1997, reflecting both 
maturities and sales of securities. The relative mix of the type of 
available-for-sale securities has not changed significantly from the prior 
year. The objectives of the Company's investment portfolio are to meet 
business line collateral needs and offset interest rate risk positions.

DEPOSITS Noninterest-bearing deposits were $16.4 billion at December 31, 
1998, compared with $14.5 billion at December 31, 1997. The increase in 
noninterest bearing deposits of $1.9 billion reflects core business growth 
and customer preferences to maintain higher account levels as compensating 
balances given the existing interest rate environment. Interest-bearing

deposits totaled $33.7 billion at December 31, 1998, compared with $34.5 
billion at December 31, 1997. The decrease in interest-bearing deposit 
balances reflects customers transferring funds into alternative investment 
vehicles and a reduction in time certificates greater than $100,000 of $461 
million.

BORROWINGS Short-term borrowings, which include federal funds purchased, 
securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other short-term 
borrowings, were $3.4 billion at December 31, 1998, relatively unchanged from 
$3.3 billion at year-end 1997.

     Long-term debt was $13.8 billion at December 31, 1998, up from $10.2 
billion at December 31, 1997. To fund core asset growth, the Company issued 
$4.2 billion of debt, with an average original maturity of 2.9 years, under 
its medium-term and bank note programs during 1998, and increased its Federal 
Home Loan Bank Advances by $800 million. The Company also issued $300 million 
of 6.50 percent fixed rate subordinated notes due February 1, 2008, $300 
million of 6.30 percent fixed rate subordinated notes due July 15, 2008, and 
$400 million of 5.70 percent fixed rate subordinated notes due December 15, 
2008. These issuances were partially offset by $2.6 billion of medium-term 
and bank note maturities.

CORPORATE RISK PROFILE

OVERALL RISK PROFILE Managing risk is an essential part of successfully 
operating a financial services company. The most prominent risk exposures are 
credit quality, interest rate sensitivity, and liquidity. In addition, most 
companies are currently assessing and establishing processes to minimize risk 
exposure associated with the Year 2000. Credit quality risk is the risk of 
not collecting interest and/or the principal balance of a loan or investment 
when it is due. Interest rate risk is the potential reduction of net interest 
income as the result of changes in interest rates. Rate movements can affect 
the repricing of assets and liabilities differently, as well as their market 
value. Liquidity risk is the possible inability to fund obligations to 
depositors, investors and borrowers. The Year 2000 risk is the potential 
business interruption associated with a computer's inability to recognize the 
year 2000 and continue processing activities beyond December 31, 1999.

CREDIT MANAGEMENT The Company's strategy for credit risk management includes 
stringent, centralized credit policies, and standard underwriting criteria 
for specialized lending categories, such as mortgage banking, real estate 
construction, and consumer credit. The strategy also emphasizes 
diversification on both a geographic and customer level, regular credit 
examinations, and quarterly management reviews of large loans and loans 
experiencing deterioration of credit quality. The Company strives to identify 
potential problem loans early, take any necessary charge-offs promptly, and 
maintain strong reserve levels. Commercial banking operations rely on a 
strong credit culture that combines prudent credit policies and individual 
lender accountability. In addition, the commercial lenders generally focus on 
middle-market companies within their regions. In the Company's retail banking 
operations, a standard credit scoring system is used to assess consumer 
credit risks and to price consumer products accordingly.

     In evaluating its credit risk, the Company considers changes in 
underwriting activities, if any, the loan portfolio composition, including 
product mix and geographic, industry or customer-specific concentrations, 
trends in loan performance, assessments of a specific customer's Year 2000 
readiness, the level of allowance coverage, and macroeconomic factors. 
Generally, the domestic economy of the nation is considered strong even 
though financial markets have been more volatile in 1998 than in 1997. Most 
economic indicators in the Company's operating regions are similar to or 
compare favorably with national trends. Approximately 45 percent of the 
Company's loan portfolio consists of credit to businesses and consumers in 
Minnesota, Oregon and Washington. According to federal and state government 
agencies, unemployment rates in Minnesota, Oregon and Washington were 2.5 
percent, 5.5 percent and 4.7 percent, respectively, for the month of December 
1998, compared with the national unemployment rate of 4.3


U.S. Bancorp                                                                  27



percent. Through September 30, 1998, the national foreclosure rate was 1.14 
percent, compared with .53 percent in Minnesota, .38 percent in Oregon, and 
 .60 percent in Washington.

     The Company also engages in non-lending activities that may give rise to 
credit risk, including interest rate swap contracts for balance sheet hedging 
purposes, foreign exchange transactions and interest rate swap contracts for 
customers, and the processing of credit card transactions for merchants. 
These activities are subject to the same credit review, analysis and approval 
processes as those applied to commercial loans. For additional information on 
interest rate swaps, see "Interest Rate Risk Management."

ANALYSIS OF NET LOAN CHARGE-OFFS Net loan charge-offs decreased $15.5 million 
to $434.2 million, compared with $449.7 million in 1997. Included in 1997 net 
charge-offs was $62.3 million of merger-related charge-offs, taken to align 
the classification and charge-off practices of the former USBC with those of 
the Company. Commercial loan net charge-offs for 1998 were $65.2 million, 
compared with $132.9 million, including merger-related charge-offs of $55.3 
million, in 1997. Consumer loan net charge-offs in 1998 were $369.0 million, 
compared with $316.8 million, including merger-related charge-offs of $7.0 
million, in 1997. Excluding these nonrecurring merger-related net 
charge-offs, the level of net charge-offs increased $46.8 million from 1997 
representing a reduction in commercial net charge-offs of $12.4 million 
offset by an increase in consumer net charge-offs of $59.2 million. The 
increase in consumer loan net charge-offs reflects growth in the consumer 
loan portfolio and an increase in credit-related fraud losses. The ratio of 
consumer net charge-offs to average loans in 1998 was 1.79 percent, up from 
1.53 percent in 1997. The Company expects the ratio of consumer net 
charge-offs to increase slightly in 1999 due to higher credit costs 
associated with recently acquired portfolios. The ratio of total net 
charge-offs to average loans was .78 percent in 1998, compared with .84 
percent in 1997.

ANALYSIS OF NONPERFORMING ASSETS Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual 
loans, restructured loans, other real estate and other nonperforming assets 
owned by the Company. At December 31, 1998, nonperforming assets totaled 
$304.3 million, compared with $339.5 million at year-end 1997 and $320.0 
million at year-end 1996. The ratio of nonperforming assets to loans plus 
other real estate was .51 percent at December 31, 1998, compared with .62 
percent at year-end 1997 and .61 percent at year-end 1996.

     In 1998, nonperforming commercial loans decreased $13.4 million 
(7 percent) and nonperforming commercial real estate loans decreased $7.6 
million (13 percent) reflecting improvements in the commercial and commercial 
real estate loan portfolios. Nonperforming other real estate decreased $15.8 
million (52 percent) reflecting declines in real estate foreclosures. 
Interest payments are currently received on approximately 33 percent of the 
Company's nonperforming loans. The payments are typically applied against the 
principal balance and not recorded as income.

     Accruing loans 90 days or more past due totaled $106.8 million, compared 
with $93.8 million at December 31, 1997, and $90.6 million at December 31, 
1996. These loans are not included in nonperforming assets and continue to 
accrue interest because they are secured by collateral and/or are in the 
process of collection and are reasonably expected to result in repayment or 
restoration to current status. Consumer loans 30 days or more past due were 
2.39 percent of the total consumer portfolio at December 31, 1998, compared 
with 2.76 percent of the total consumer portfolio at December 31, 1997. 
Consumer loans 90 days or more past due totaled .75 percent of the total 
consumer loan portfolio at December 31, 1998, compared with .70 percent of 
the total consumer loan portfolio at December 31, 1997.

ANALYSIS AND ALLOCATION OF ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES The allowance for 
credit losses provides coverage for losses inherent in the Company's loan 
portfolio. Management evaluates the allowance each quarter to determine that 
it is adequate to cover inherent losses. The evaluation of each element and 
the overall allowance is based on continuing assessment of problem loans and 
related off-balance sheet items, recent loss experience, and other factors, 
including regulatory guidance and economic conditions. Management has 
determined that the allowance for credit losses is adequate.

     At December 31, 1998, the allowance was $1.00 billion, or 1.69 percent 
of loans. This compares with an allowance of $1.01 billion, or 1.84 percent 
of loans, at year-end 1997, and $992.5 million, or 1.90 percent of loans, at 
December 31, 1996. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to 
nonperforming loans was 359 percent at December 31, 1998, compared to 340 
percent at year-end 1997 and 369 percent at year-end 1996.

relative risk characteristics of the loan portfolio. Table 16 shows the 
allocation of the allowance for credit losses by loan category. Commercial 
allocations are based on a quarterly review of individual loans outstanding 
and binding commitments to lend, including standby letters of credit. An 
analysis of the migration of commercial loans and actual loss experience 
throughout the business cycle is also conducted to assess reserves allocated 
to credits with similar risk characteristics. The allowance allocated to 
commercial loan portfolios declined $29.2 million to $242.6 million in 1998 
reflecting a decline in nonperforming assets. Consumer allocations are based 
on an analysis of product mix, credit scoring and risk composition of the 
portfolio, fraud loss and bankruptcy experiences, and historical and expected 
delinquency and charge-off statistics for each homogenous category or group 
of loans. The allowance allocated to consumer loans increased $117.0 million 
to $470.0 million in 1998 primarily due to expected increases in net 
charge-offs related to acquired portfolios and credit-related fraud.

     Regardless of the extent of the Company analysis of customer 
performance, portfolio evaluations, trends or risk management processes 
established, certain inherent, but undetected losses are probable within the 
loan portfolio. This is due to several factors including inherent delays in 
obtaining information regarding a customer's financial condition or changes 
in their unique business conditions; the judgmental nature of individual loan 
evaluations, collateral assessments and the interpretation of economic 
trends; volatility of economic or customer-specific conditions affecting the 
identification and estimation of losses for larger non-homogeneous credits; 
and the sensitivity of assumptions utilized to establish allocated allowances 
for homogenous groups of loans among other factors. The Company maintains an 
unallocated allowance to recognize the existence of these exposures and for 
the risk in concentrations to specific borrowers, financings of highly 
leveraged transactions, products or industries. The unallocated portion of 
the allowance decreased to $288.3 million at year-end 1998 from $383.9 
million and $392.0 million at December 31, 1997, and 1996. The decrease of 
$95.6 million in 1998 is primarily due to improvements in the commercial loan 
portfolio as reflected in a decline in nonperforming assets, a reduction of 
commitments to Asian and Indonesian markets, less uncertainty of credit risks 
within the loan portfolios of the former U.S. Bancorp of Portland, Oregon, 
and a decline in volatility of commercial portfolio exposures. These 
improvements are partially offset by credit exposures to agricultural and 
timber concentrations given current commodity market prices. Although the 
allocation of the allowance is an important credit management tool, the 
entire allowance for credit losses is available for the entire loan 
portfolio. Refer to Note A of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
for additional information on the allowance for credit losses.

INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT The Company's policy is to maintain a low 
interest rate risk position. The Company limits the exposure of net interest 
income to risks associated with interest rate movements through 
asset/liability management strategies. The Company's Asset and Liability 
Management Committee ("ALCO") uses three methods for measuring and managing 
consolidated interest rate risk: Net Interest Income Simulation Modeling, 
Market Value Simulation Modeling, and Repricing Mismatch

U.S. Bancorp                                                                  31



Analysis. As part of Market Value Simulation Modeling, ALCO uses a 
value-at-risk ("VaR") model to measure and manage market risk in its 
broker/dealer activities.

NET INTEREST INCOME SIMULATION MODELING: The Company uses a net interest 
income simulation model to estimate near-term (next 12 months) risk due to 
changes in interest rates. The model, which is updated monthly, incorporates 
substantially all the Company's assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet 
instruments, together with forecasted changes in the balance sheet and 
assumptions that reflect the current interest rate environment. Balance sheet 
changes are based on expected prepayments of loans and securities and 
forecasted loan and deposit growth. ALCO uses the model to simulate the 
effect of immediate and sustained parallel shifts in the yield curve of one 
percent, two percent and three percent as well as the effect of immediate and 
sustained flattening or steepening of the yield curve. ALCO also calculates 
the sensitivity of the simulation results to changes in key assumptions, such 
as the Prime/LIBOR spread or core deposit pricing. The results from the 
simulation are reviewed by ALCO monthly and are used to guide ALCO's hedging 
strategies. ALCO guidelines, approved by the Company's Board of Directors, 
limit the estimated change in net interest income over the succeeding 12 
months to two percent of forecasted net interest income given a one percent 
change in interest rates. At December 31, 1998, forecasted net interest 
income for the next 12 months would decrease 11 basis points from an 
immediate 100 basis point upward parallel shift in rates and increase 5 basis 
points from a downward shift of similar magnitude.

MARKET VALUE/DURATION ANALYSIS: The net interest income simulation model is 
somewhat limited by its dependence upon accurate forecasts of future business 
activity and the resulting effect on balance sheet assets and liabilities. As 
a result, its usefulness is greatly diminished for periods beyond one or two 
years. To better measure all interest rate risk, both short-term and 
long-term, the Company uses a market value simulation model. This model 
estimates the effect of one, two and three percent rate shocks on the present 
value of all future cash flows of the Company's outstanding assets, 
liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments. The amount of market value 
risk is subject to a limit, approved by the Company's Board of Directors, of 
one percent of assets for an immediate 100 basis point rate shock. 
Historically, the Company's market value risk position has been substantially 
lower than its limits.

     The VaR model used to measure and manage market risk in the 
broker/dealer business uses an estimate of volatility appropriate to each 
instrument and a three standard deviation move in the underlying markets. The 
Company believes the market risk inherent in its broker/dealer activities, 
including fixed income, equities and foreign exchange, is immaterial.

REPRICING MISMATCH ANALYSIS: A traditional gap analysis provides a 
point-in-time measurement of the relationship between the amounts of interest 
rate sensitive assets and liabilities repricing in a given time period. While 
the analysis provides a useful snapshot of interest rate risk, it does not 
capture all aspects of interest rate risk. As a result, ALCO uses the 
repricing mismatch analysis primarily for managing intermediate-term 
interest-rate risk and has established limits, approved by the Company's 
Board of Directors, for gap positions in the one- to two-year and two- to 
three-year time periods of five percent of assets.

USE OF DERIVATIVES TO MANAGE INTEREST RATE RISK: While each of the interest 
rate risk measurements has limitations, taken together they represent a 
comprehensive view of the magnitude of the Company's interest rate risk over 
various time intervals. The Company manages its interest rate risk by 
entering into off-balance sheet transactions (primarily interest rate swaps), 
investing in fixed rate assets or issuing variable rate liabilities. To a 
lesser degree, the Company also uses interest rate caps and floors to hedge 
this risk.

     In 1998, the Company added $3.1 billion of interest rate swaps to reduce 
its interest rate risk. This increase was partially offset by $1.2 billion of 
interest rate swap maturi-

ties. Interest rate swap agreements involve the exchange of fixed and 
floating rate payments without the exchange of the underlying notional amount 
on which the interest payments are calculated. As of December 31, 1998, the 
Company received payments on $7.2 billion notional amount of interest rate 
swap agreements based on fixed interest rates, and made payments based on 
variable interest rates. These swaps had a weighted average fixed rate 
received of 6.17 percent and a weighted average variable rate paid of 5.53 
percent. The remaining maturity of these agreements ranges from 1 month to 10 
years with an average remaining maturity of 3.8 years. Swaps increased net 
interest income for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997, and 1996 by 
$37.9 million, $25.1 million, and $32.2 million, respectively.

     The Company also purchases interest rate caps and floors to minimize the 
impact of fluctuating interest rates on earnings. To hedge against rising 
interest rates, the Company uses interest rate caps. Cap counterparties pay 
the Company when specified rates rise above a specified point or strike 
level. The payment is based on the notional amount and the difference between 
current rates and strike rates. There were no caps outstanding at December 
31, 1998. To hedge against falling interest rates, the Company uses interest 
rate floors. Floor counterparties pay the Company when specified rates fall 
below the strike level. Like caps, the payment is based on the notional 
amount and the difference between current rates and strike rates. The total 
notional amount of floor agreements purchased as of December 31, 1998, all of 
which were LIBOR-indexed, was $500 million. The impact of caps and floors on 
net interest income was not material for the years ended December 31, 1998, 
1997 and 1996. See Notes A and O of the Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements for the Company's accounting policy related to these types of 
transactions.

LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT The objective of liquidity management is to ensure the 
continuous availability of funds to meet the demands of depositors, investors 
and borrowers. ALCO is responsible for structuring the balance sheet to meet 
these needs. It regularly reviews current and

U.S. Bancorp                                                                  33



forecasted funding needs as well as market conditions for issuing debt to 
wholesale investors. Based on this information, ALCO supervises wholesale 
funding activity, as well as the maintenance of contingent funding sources.

     A majority of the Company's funding comes from customer deposits within 
its operating region. While the Company has funded incremental balance sheet 
growth with negotiated funds, its short-term purchased funds index remained 
relatively low at 7.8 percent at December 31, 1998, compared with a peer 
group median of 21.1 percent at September 30, 1998. The index is calculated 
as negotiated funding under one year (which includes Federal Home Loan Bank 
("FHLB") borrowings, foreign branch time deposits, federal funds purchased, 
bank notes, medium-term notes and repurchase agreements), net of federal 
funds sold and resale agreements, divided by loans and securities.

     The Company's ability to raise negotiated funding at competitive prices 
is influenced by rating agencies' views of the Company's credit quality, 
liquidity, capital, and earnings. As of December 31, 1998, Moody's Investors 
Services, Standard & Poors, and Thomson BankWatch rated the Company's senior 
debt as "A1," "A," and "A+," respectively. The debt ratings reflect the 
agencies' recognition of the strong, consistent financial performance of the 
Company and quality of the balance sheet.

     At the parent company, funding primarily consists of long-term debt and 
equity. At December 31, 1998, parent company long-term debt outstanding was 
$3.5 billion, compared with $2.4 billion at December 31, 1997.

     The parent company issued $1.2 billion of medium-term notes during 1998. 
Total parent company debt maturing in 1999 is $629 million. These debt 
obligations are expected to be met through medium-term note issuances, as 
well as $604 million of parent company cash and cash equivalents at December 
31, 1998. It is the Company's practice to maintain liquid assets at the 
parent company sufficient to fund its operating cash needs and near-term debt 
maturities.

     During 1998, the Company issued $350 million of Company-obligated 
mandatorily redeemable preferred securities (the "preferred securities") 
through a wholly-owned subsidiary grantor trust. The preferred securities 
qualify as tier 1 capital for bank holding companies and pay distributions 
periodically.

YEAR 2000 RISK MANAGEMENT The Company has undertaken efforts to address the 
"Year 2000" computer problem, which arose because many computer applications 
worldwide will not properly recognize the date change from December 31, 1999, 
to January 1, 2000, potentially causing production of erroneous data, 
miscalculations, system failures and other operational problems. In the early 
1990s, the Company implemented significant technology changes and replaced 
many of its principal data processing applications with licensed software 
packages. The Company also undertook an organization-wide initiative to 
address the Year 2000 issue, including the formation in 1996 of a dedicated 
project team of employees to evaluate the Year 2000 impact on the Company's 
critical computer hardware and software and embedded technologies in its 
physical plant and automated equipment (such as ATMs, check sorting machines, 
vaults and security systems), and on its customers. In addition to evaluating 
the scope of the Year 2000 issue, the project team prioritized tasks, 
developed implementation plans and established completion and testing 
schedules. As a result, the Company is replacing, modifying or reprogramming 
certain systems, is requiring that new purchased hardware and software be 
Year 2000 compliant, and is testing systems in an isolated environment 
dedicated to Year 2000 testing. Apart from the Company's project, federal 
banking regulators are conducting special examinations of FDIC-insured banks 
and savings associations to determine whether they are taking necessary steps 
to prepare for the Year 2000 issue, and are closely monitoring the progress 
made by these institutions in completing key steps required by their 
individual Year 2000 plans.

     Evaluation, replacement, renovation, installation and testing of the 
Company's critical internal computer hardware and software (including 
software to be remediated by vendors) and embedded technologies have been 
substantially completed, in accordance with bank regulatory guidelines, 
allowing time for necessary refinements and additional testing before 
December 31, 1999. In addition, the remediation and testing of non-critical 
systems is in progress and is expected to be substantially completed during 
1999.

     Ultimately, the potential impact of the Year 2000 issue will depend not 
only on the success of the corrective measures the Company undertakes, but 
also on the way in which the Year 2000 issue is addressed by customers, 
vendors, service providers, counterparties, clearing houses, utilities (e.g. 
power, telecommunication, transportation), governmental agencies (including 
the Federal Reserve, which provides services for processing and settling 
payments and securities transactions between banks) and other entities with 
which the Company does business. The Company is communicating with these 
parties to monitor their efforts in addressing the Year 2000 issue and to 
evaluate any likely impact on the Company. For example, the Company is 
conducting ongoing Year 2000 surveys and evaluations of its corporate and 
middle-market borrowing customers and of other significant funds takers, 
funds providers and capital market/asset management counterparties, and has 
implemented in its lending units uniform criteria for identifying, managing 
and underwriting Year

34                                                                  U.S. Bancorp



2000 credit risk. The Company is reviewing its fiduciary activities for Year 
2000 risk related to marketable securities, special assets and 
counterparties. The Company is scheduling testing with critical service 
providers as necessary and expects such testing to be completed by March 31, 
1999. A prioritized schedule for external testing during 1999 with certain 
large customers also is being established. In addition, the Company expects 
to participate in tests organized by major industry and governmental 
organizations as they are scheduled throughout the remainder of 1999, 
including tests sponsored by the Federal Reserve, the National Automated 
Clearing House Association and the Securities and Exchange Commission.

     Based on the Company's Year 2000 efforts, management presently believes 
that the Year 2000 issue will not result in significant operational problems 
for the Company. In addition, the Company's Year 2000 project has contingency 
plans designed to mitigate the potential effects of system failures in the 
event of reasonably likely worst case scenarios. These contingency plans, 
which are expected to be substantially completed by June 30, 1999, in 
accordance with bank regulatory guidelines, include back-up solutions for 
mission-critical operations and business continuation plans for significant 
vendors and other business partners. For example, the Company has arranged 
for reserve power supplies for certain vital locations, and will have 
available back-up account data and alternative manual processes for certain 
business line functions. The Company also has developed a liquidity 
management plan to address potential increased funding needs that may arise 
as the millennium approaches. Notwithstanding the Company's efforts and such 
contingency plans, however, given the unprecedented nature of the Year 2000 
computer problem, there can be no assurance that Year 2000 issues will not 
arise, or that any such issues will be fully mitigated. Further, the Year 
2000 efforts of third parties are not within the Company's control, and their 
failure to remediate Year 2000 issues successfully could result in, among 
other things, business disruption, operational problems, financial loss, 
increased credit risk and legal liability for the Company. At the present 
time, it is not possible to determine whether any such third-party failures 
are likely to occur, or to quantify any potential negative impact they may 
have on the Company's future results of operations and financial condition.

     The foregoing discussion regarding Year 2000, including the discussion 
of the timing and effectiveness of implementation and cost of the Company's 
Year 2000 project, contains forward-looking statements, which are based on 
management's best estimates derived using various assumptions. These 
forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, and 
actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by such 
statements. Factors that might cause material differences include, but are 
not limited to, the availability and cost of hardware and software and key 
Year 2000 personnel, the Company's ability to locate and correct all relevant 
computer codes and embedded technologies, and its ability to respond to 
unforeseen Year 2000 complications. Such material differences could result in 
business disruption, operational problems, financial loss, legal liability 
and similar adverse effects on the Company, which effects could be material.

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT

The Company is committed to managing capital for maximum shareholder benefit 
and maintaining strong protection for depositors and creditors. At December 
31, 1998, tangible common equity (common equity less goodwill) was $4.5 
billion, or 6.0 percent of assets, compared with 7.0 percent at year-end 1997 
and 6.7 percent at year-end 1996. The tier 1 capital ratio was 6.4 percent at 
December 31, 1998, compared with 7.4 percent at December 31, 1997. This ratio 
was 7.6 percent at December 31, 1996. The total risk-based capital ratio was 
10.9 percent at December 31, 1998, compared with 11.6 percent at December 31, 
1997, and 11.9 percent at December 31, 1996. The leverage ratio was 6.8 
percent at December 31, 1998, compared with 7.3 percent and 7.5 percent at 
December 31, 1997, and December 31, 1996, respectively.

     The measures used to assess capital include the capital ratios 
established by the bank regulatory agencies, including the specific ratios 
for the "well capitalized" designation.

NOTE: THESE BALANCES AND RATIOS WERE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH REGULATORY
ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AS DISCLOSED IN THE SUBSIDIARIES' REGULATORY REPORTS.


The Company manages various capital ratios to maintain appropriate capital 
levels in accordance with Board-approved capital guidelines, ascribing the 
most significance to the tangible common equity ratio. The Company intends to 
maintain sufficient capital in each of its bank subsidiaries to be "well 
capitalized" as defined by the regulatory agencies.

     On June 8, 1998, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the 
repurchase of up to $2.5 billion of the Company's common stock through March 
31, 2000. The shares will be repurchased in the open market or through 
negotiated transactions. The Company repurchased 24.6 million shares for $963 
million in 1998.

     On April 22, 1998, the Company's shareholders authorized an increase in 
the Company's capital stock necessary to implement the three-for-one split of 
the Company's common stock announced February 18, 1998. The number of common 
and preferred shares which the Company has authority to issue was increased 
from 500 million shares and 10 million shares, respectively, to 1.5 billion 
shares and 50 million shares, respectively. The stock split was in the form 
of a 200 percent dividend payable May 18, 1998, to shareholders of record on 
May 4, 1998. The impact of the stock split has been reflected in the 
financial statements for all periods presented and all share and per share 
data included herein.

     On August 1, 1997, the Company issued 329.7 million shares to acquire 
USBC. The Company exchanged 2.265 shares of its common stock for each share 
of USBC common stock. USBC's outstanding stock options were also converted 
into stock options for the Company's common stock. In addition, each 
outstanding share of USBC cumulative preferred stock was converted into one 
share of preferred stock of the combined company, having substantially 
identical terms.

     Approximately 93.0 million common shares were repurchased under 1996 
Board authorizations, including 14.7 million during 1997. These 
authorizations were either completed or rescinded prior to the USBC 
acquisition.

     On November 14, 1997, the Company redeemed all outstanding shares of its 
preferred stock at a redemption price of $25 per share, together with accrued 
and unpaid dividends. On November 29, 1996, the Company called all remaining 
shares of its Series 1991A Convertible Preferred Stock.

DIVIDENDS During 1998, total dividends on common stock were $516.4 million 
compared with $445.7 million in 1997 and $406.9 million in 1996. The Company 
has raised its quarterly dividend rate in each of the past five years. On a 
per share basis, dividends paid to common shareholders totaled $.70 in 1998, 
$.62 in 1997, and $.55 in 1996. On February 17, 1999, the Board of Directors 
increased the quarterly common dividend rate to $.195 from $.175.

     The Company's primary funding sources for common stock dividends are 
dividends received from its bank and nonbank subsidiaries. Payment of 
dividends to the Company by its depository subsidiaries is subject to ongoing 
review by banking regulators and to various statutory limitations. For 
further information, see Note S of the Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements.

ACCOUNTING CHANGES

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME Effective January 1, 1998, the Company adopted SFAS 130, 
"Reporting Comprehensive Income," which establishes standards for the 
reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components in a full 
set of financial statements. The Statement requires that all items that are 
required to be recognized under accounting standards as components of 
comprehensive income be reported in a financial statement that is displayed 
as prominently as other financial statements. The Statement requires the 
classification of items of other comprehensive income by their nature in a 
financial statement and the display of other comprehensive income separately 
from retained earnings and capital surplus in the equity section of the 
balance sheet. All prior periods presented have been restated to conform to 
the provisions of this Statement.

COMPUTER SOFTWARE COSTS Effective January 1, 1998, the Company adopted 
Statement of Position ("SOP") 98-1, "Accounting for the Costs of Computer 
Software Developed

36                                                                  U.S. Bancorp



or Obtained for Internal Use." SOP 98-1 requires the capitalization of 
certain costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining software 
for internal use. Historically, the Company has expensed such costs as 
incurred. Restatement of previously issued annual financial statements or 
adoption by a cumulative catch-up adjustment was prohibited. The adoption of 
SOP 98-1 did not have a material impact on the Company.

SEGMENT DISCLOSURE Effective January 1, 1998, the Company adopted SFAS 131, 
"Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information," which 
requires the disclosure of financial and descriptive information about 
reportable operating segments. Operating segments are components of an 
enterprise about which financial information is available and is evaluated 
regularly in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. The 
Statement requires the disclosure of profit or loss, certain specific revenue 
and expense items, and assets of all operating segments, with reconciliations 
of amounts presented to the financial statements. The Statement also requires 
the disclosure of how the operating segments were determined, the products 
and services provided by the segments, differences between measurements used 
in reporting segment information and those used in the financial statements, 
and changes in the measurement of segment amounts from period to period. All 
prior period disclosures have been restated to conform with the provisions of 
this Statement.

PENSIONS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT DISCLOSURE Effective January 1, 
1998, the Company adopted SFAS 132, "Employers' Disclosures about Pensions 
and Other Postretirement Benefits," which standardizes the disclosure 
requirements for pensions and other postretirement benefits to the extent 
practicable. The Statement supersedes the disclosure requirements of: SFAS 
87, "Employers' Accounting for Pensions"; SFAS 88, "Employers' Accounting for 
Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for 
Termination Benefits"; and SFAS 106, "Employers' Accounting for 
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions." The Statement addresses 
disclosure only and not measurement or recognition. All prior period 
disclosures have been restated to conform to the provisions of this Statement.

ACCOUNTING FOR TRANSFERS AND SERVICING OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND 
EXTINGUISHMENTS OF LIABILITIES Effective January 1, 1997, the Company adopted 
SFAS 125, "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and 
Extinguishments of Liabilities," which establishes criteria, based on legal 
control, to determine whether a transfer of financial assets is considered a 
sale or secured borrowing. Effective January 1, 1998, and in accordance with 
SFAS 127 which amended SFAS 125, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 
125 relating to securities lending, repurchase agreements and other secured 
financing transactions. The adoption of SFAS 125 did not have a material 
effect on the Company.

ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES SFAS 133, 
"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," establishes 
accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including 
certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging 
activities. It requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either 
assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure 
those instruments at fair value. In certain defined conditions, a derivative 
may be specifically designated as a hedge for a particular exposure. The 
accounting for changes in the fair value of the derivative depends on the 
intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. SFAS 133 is 
effective for all quarters of fiscal years beginning after June 15, 1999, 
with earlier application permitted. Retroactive application of this Statement 
to prior periods is prohibited. The adoption of SFAS 133 is not expected to 
have a material impact on the Company.

IMPACT OF INFLATION

The assets and liabilities of a financial institution are primarily monetary 
in nature. Therefore, future changes in prices do not affect the obligations 
to pay or receive fixed and determinable amounts of money. During periods of 
inflation, monetary assets lose value in terms of purchasing power while 
monetary liabilities have corresponding purchasing power gains. Since banks 
generally have an excess of monetary assets over monetary liabilities, 
inflation will, in theory, cause a loss of purchasing power in the value of 
shareholders' equity. However, the concept of purchasing power is not an 
adequate indicator of the effect of inflation on banks because it does not 
take into account changes in interest rates, which are a more important 
determinant of bank earnings.

     Other sections of the Management's Discussion and Analysis provide the 
information necessary for an understanding of the Company's ability to react 
to changing interest rates.

FOURTH QUARTER SUMMARY

In the fourth quarter of 1998, the Company reported operating earnings of 
$377.3 million ($.52 per diluted share), compared with $335.5 million ($.45 
per diluted share) in the fourth quarter of 1997. The results for the fourth 
quarter of 1998 reflected growth in core noninterest income and a decrease in 
core noninterest expense from the fourth quarter of 1997. Including 
nonrecurring items, the Company had net income for the fourth quarter of 1998 
of

TABLE 21  FOURTH QUARTER SUMMARY



*WITHOUT INVESTMENT BANKING AND BROKERAGE ACTIVITY.


$349.2 million ($.48 per diluted share), compared with net income of $288.9 
million ($.39 per diluted share) in the fourth quarter of 1997.

     Fourth quarter net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis 
increased $2.4 million to $787.1 million, compared with fourth quarter of 
1997. The increase was primarily the result of an increase in average earning 
assets of $3.0 billion over the fourth quarter of 1997, driven by core 
commercial and consumer loan growth, partially offset by reductions in 
securities and residential mortgages. The net interest margin on a 
taxable-equivalent basis was 4.78 percent compared with 4.99 percent a year 
ago, reflecting growth in Payment Systems' noninterest-bearing assets, 
including corporate and purchasing card loan balances, the funding required 
for the Piper Jaffray acquisition and the share repurchase program, and 
margin compression in the commercial loan portfolio.

     The provision for credit losses increased to $101.0 million in the 
fourth quarter of 1998, compared with $90.0 million in the fourth quarter of 
1997.

     Noninterest income, before nonrecurring items, increased $199.6 million 
from the same quarter a year ago, to $620.1 million. Without the effect of 
Piper Jaffray, noninterest income, before nonrecurring items, increased $51.3 
million. The improvement resulted from growth in credit card fee revenue, 
trust and investment management fees, and other fees. Credit card fee revenue 
in the fourth quarter of 1998 was affected by the loss of a portion of the 
U.S. Government purchasing card business. Trust and investment management 
fees were up due to growth in the corporate, institutional and personal trust 
businesses and the addition of Piper Jaffray.

     Fourth quarter noninterest expense, before nonrecurring items, totaled 
$701.2 million, an increase of $128.4 million from the fourth quarter of 
1997. Without the effect of Piper Jaffray, noninterest expense, before 
nonrecurring items, decreased by $24.8 million. The favorable variance in 
expense primarily reflects the expense savings from the integration of USBC, 
with year-over-year reductions in salaries and employee benefits, other 
personnel expense, net occupancy, and furniture and equipment. Without the 
impact of all investment banking and brokerage activity, the banking 
efficiency ratio, before nonrecurring items, improved to 43.2 percent from 
46.5 percent for the same quarter last year.

                  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE A  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

U.S. Bancorp (the "Company") is a bank holding company offering a full range 
of financial services through banking offices in 17 states including 
Minnesota, Oregon, Washington, Colorado, California, Idaho, Nebraska, North 
Dakota, Nevada, South Dakota, Montana, Iowa, Illinois, Utah, Wisconsin, 
Kansas, and Wyoming. The Company also engages in credit card and merchant 
processing, insurance, trust and investment management, brokerage, leasing 
and investment banking activities principally in domestic markets.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION The consolidated financial statements include the 
accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. The consolidation eliminates 
all significant intercompany accounts and transactions. Certain items in 
prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.

USES OF ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with 
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make 
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial 
statements and accompanying notes. Actual experience could differ from those 
estimates.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS

Within the Company, financial performance is measured by major lines of 
business based on the products and services provided to customers through its 
distribution channels. The Company has five reportable operating segments:

     Commercial & Business Banking and Private Financial Services includes 
lending, treasury management, and other financial services to middle market, 
large corporate and mortgage banking companies and private banking and 
personal trust clients.

     Retail Banking delivers products and services to the broad consumer 
market and small-businesses through branch offices, telemarketing, direct 
mail, and automated teller machines ("ATMs").

     Payment Systems includes consumer and business credit cards, corporate 
and purchasing card services, card-accessed secured and unsecured lines of 
credit, ATM processing, and merchant processing.

     Corporate Trust and Institutional Financial Services includes 
institutional and corporate trust services and investment management services.

     Investment Banking and Brokerage engages in equity and fixed income 
trading activities, offers investment banking and underwriting services for 
corporate and public sector customers and provides securities, mutual funds, 
annuities and insurance products to consumers and regionally based businesses 
through a network of banking centers and brokerage offices.

SEGMENT RESULTS Accounting policies for the lines of business are the same as 
those used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements with 
respect to activities specifically attributable to each business line. 
However, the preparation of business line results requires management to 
establish methodologies to allocate funding costs and benefits, expenses and 
other financial elements to each line of business. For details of these 
methodologies see "Basis for Financial Presentation" on page 18. Table 2 
"Line of Business Financial Performance" on pages 18 through 20 provides 
details of segment results. This information is incorporated by reference 
into these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

SECURITIES

TRADING ACCOUNT SECURITIES Debt and equity securities held for resale are 
classified as trading account securities and reported at fair value. Realized 
and unrealized gains or losses are recorded in noninterest income.

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES These securities are not trading account 
securities but may be sold before maturity in response to changes in interest 
rates, prepayment risk, and funding sources or terms, or to meet liquidity 
needs. They are carried at fair value with unrealized net gains or losses 
reported in shareholders' equity. When sold, the amortized cost of the 
specific securities is used to compute the gain or loss.

LOANS

Loans are reported net of unearned income. Interest income is accrued on the 
unpaid principal balances. Loan and commitment fees are deferred and 
recognized over the life of the loan and/or commitment period as yield 
adjustments.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES Management determines the adequacy of the 
allowance based on evaluations of the loan portfolio and related off-balance 
sheet commitments, recent loss experience, and other pertinent factors, 
including economic conditions. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it 
requires estimates, including amounts of future cash collections expected on 
nonaccrual loans that may be susceptible to significant change. The allowance 
for credit losses relating to impaired loans is based on the loans' 
observable market price, the collateral for certain collateral-dependent 
loans, or the discounted cash flows using the loans' effective interest rate.

U.S. Bancorp                                                                  43



     The Company allocates the allowance to certain sectors based on relative 
risk characteristics of the loan portfolio and other financial instruments 
with credit exposure. Commercial allocations are based on quarterly reviews 
of individual loans outstanding and binding commitments to lend and an 
analysis of the migration of commercial loans and actual loss experience. 
Consumer allocations are based on an analysis of product mix, risk 
characteristics of the portfolio, fraud loss and bankruptcy experiences, and 
historical losses, adjusted for current trends, for each homogenous category 
or group of loans. The Company adjusted its methodology for allocating the 
allowance for consumer credit exposure and, as such, prior year's amounts 
have been reclassified to conform to this methodology. The reclassification 
of unallocated allowance previously earmarked for consumer exposures, more 
closely reflects certain industry practices for allocating the allowance for 
credit losses. The allowance is increased through provisions charged to 
operating earnings and reduced by net charge-offs.

NONACCRUAL LOANS Generally commercial loans (including impaired loans) are 
placed on nonaccrual status when the collection of interest or principal has 
become 90 days past due or is otherwise considered doubtful. When a loan is 
placed on nonaccrual status, unpaid interest is reversed. Future interest 
payments are generally applied against principal. Consumer loans other than 
residential mortgages are generally charged-off at 120 days past due and are, 
therefore, not placed on non-accrual status.

LEASES Certain subsidiaries engage in both direct and leveraged lease 
financing. The net investment in direct financing leases is the sum of all 
minimum lease payments and estimated residual values less unearned income. 
Unearned income is added to interest income over the terms of the leases to 
produce a level yield.

     The investment in leveraged leases is the sum of all lease payments 
(less nonrecourse debt payments) plus estimated residual values, less 
unearned income. Income from leveraged leases is recognized over the term of 
the leases based on the unrecovered equity investment.

LOANS AND MORTGAGES HELD FOR SALE These loans are carried at the lower of 
cost or market value as determined on an aggregate basis by type of loan.

OTHER REAL ESTATE Other real estate ("ORE"), which is included in other 
assets, is property acquired through foreclosure or other proceedings. ORE is 
initially recorded at fair value and carried at the lower of cost or fair 
value, less estimated selling costs. The property is evaluated regularly and 
any decreases in the carrying amount are included in noninterest expense.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

INTEREST RATE SWAPS AND CONTRACTS The Company uses interest rate swaps and 
contracts (forwards, options, caps and floors) to manage its interest rate 
risk and as a financial intermediary. The Company does not enter into these 
contracts for speculative purposes. Income or expense on swaps and contracts 
designated as hedges of assets or liabilities is recorded as an adjustment to 
interest income or expense. If the swap or contract is terminated, the gain 
or loss is deferred and amortized over the remaining life of the underlying 
asset or liability. If the hedged instrument is disposed of, the swap or 
contract agreement is marked to market with any resulting gain or loss 
included with the gain or loss from the disposition.

     The initial bid/offer spread on intermediated swaps is deferred and 
recognized in trading account profits and commissions over the life of the 
agreement. Intermediated swaps and all other interest rate contracts are 
marked to market and resulting gains or losses are recorded in trading 
account profits and commissions. The Company's derivative trading activities 
are not material to the consolidated financial statements; the cash flows 
from these activities are included in operating activities.

OTHER SIGNIFICANT POLICIES

PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT Premises and equipment are stated at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and amortized primarily on a straight-line method 
basis.

     Capital leases, less accumulated amortization, are included in premises 
and equipment. The lease obligations are included in long-term debt. 
Capitalized leases are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lease term 
and the amortization is included in depreciation expense.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS Goodwill, the price paid over the net fair value of 
acquired businesses, is included in other assets and is amortized over 
periods ranging up to 25 years. Other intangible assets are amortized over 
their estimated useful lives, which range from seven to fifteen years, using 
straight-line and accelerated methods.

INCOME TAXES Deferred taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences on 
future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
and the financial reporting amounts at each year-end.

STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS For the purposes of reporting cash flows, cash 
equivalents include cash and due from banks and federal funds sold.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION The Company grants stock options for a fixed number 
of shares to employees with an exercise price equal to the fair value of the 
shares at the date of grant. The Company accounts for stock option grants in 

44                                                                  U.S. Bancorp



accordance with APB Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to 
Employees," and accordingly recognizes no compensation expense for the stock 
option grants.

PER SHARE CALCULATIONS Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net 
income (less preferred stock dividends) by the weighted average number of 
common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share is 
calculated by adjusting income and outstanding shares, assuming conversion of 
all potentially dilutive securities, using the treasury stock method.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE B  ACCOUNTING CHANGES

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME Effective January 1, 1998, the Company adopted Statement 
of Financial Accounting Standards No. ("SFAS") 130, "Reporting Comprehensive 
Income," which establishes standards for the reporting and display of 
comprehensive income and its components in a full set of financial 
statements. The Statement requires that all items that are required to be 
recognized under accounting standards as components of comprehensive income 
be reported in a financial statement that is displayed as prominently as 
other financial statements. The Statement requires the classification of 
items of other comprehensive income by their nature in a financial statement 
and the display of other comprehensive income separately from retained 
earnings and capital surplus in the equity section of the balance sheet. All 
prior periods presented have been restated to conform to the provisions of 
this Statement.

COMPUTER SOFTWARE COSTS Effective January 1, 1998, the Company adopted 
Statement of Position ("SOP") 98-1, "Accounting for the Costs of Computer 
Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use." SOP 98-1 requires the 
capitalization of certain costs incurred in connection with developing or 
obtaining software for internal use. Historically, the Company has expensed 
such costs as incurred. Restatement of previously issued annual financial 
statements or adoption by a cumulative catch-up adjustment was prohibited. 
The adoption of SOP 98-1 did not have a material effect on the Company.

SEGMENT DISCLOSURE Effective January 1, 1998, the Company adopted SFAS 131, 
"Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information," which 
requires the disclosure of financial and descriptive information about 
reportable operating segments. Operating segments are components of an 
enterprise about which financial information is available and is evaluated 
regularly in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. The 
Statement requires the disclosure of profit or loss, certain specific revenue 
and expense items, and assets of all operating segments, with reconciliations 
of amounts presented in the financial statements. The Statement also requires 
the disclosure of how the operating segments were determined, the products 
and services provided by the segments, differences between measurements used 
in reporting segment information and those used in the financial statements, 
and changes in the measurement of segment amounts from period to period. All 
prior period disclosures have been restated to conform to the provisions of 
this Statement.

PENSIONS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS DISCLOSURE Effective January 1, 
1998, the Company adopted SFAS 132, "Employers' Disclosures about Pensions 
and Other Postretirement Benefits," which standardizes the disclosure 
requirements for pensions and other postretirement benefits to the extent 
practicable. The Statement supersedes the disclosure requirements of: SFAS 
87, "Employers' Accounting for Pensions"; SFAS 88, "Employers' Accounting for 
Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for 
Termination Benefits"; and SFAS 106, "Employers' Accounting for 
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions." The Statement addresses 
disclosure only and not measurement or recognition. All prior period 
disclosures have been restated to conform to the provisions of this Statement.

ACCOUNTING FOR TRANSFERS AND SERVICING OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND 
EXTINGUISHMENTS OF LIABILITIES Effective January 1, 1997, the Company adopted 
SFAS 125, "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and 
Extinguishments of Liabilities," which establishes criteria, based on legal 
control, to determine whether a transfer of financial assets is considered a 
sale or secured borrowing. Effective January 1, 1998, and in accordance with 
SFAS 127 which amended SFAS 125, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 
125 relating to securities lending, repurchase agreements and other secured 
financing transactions. The adoption of SFAS 125 did not have a material 
effect on the Company.

ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES SFAS 133, 
"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," establishes 
accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including 
certain derivative instruments imbedded in other contracts, and for hedging 
activities. It requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either 
assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure 
those instruments at fair value. In certain defined conditions, a derivative 
may be specifically designated as a hedge for a particular exposure. The 
accounting for changes in the fair value of the derivative depends on the 
intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. SFAS 133 is 
effective for all quarters of fiscal years beginning after June 15, 1999, 
with earlier application permitted. Retroactive application of this Statement 
to prior periods is prohibited. The adoption of SFAS 133 is not expected to 
have a material impact on the Company.

U.S. Bancorp                                                                  45



- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE C  BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND DIVESTITURES

U. S. BANCORP On August 1, 1997, First Bank System, Inc. ("FBS") issued 329.7 
million common shares to acquire U. S. Bancorp ("USBC"). As of the 
acquisition date, the combined institution, now known as U.S. Bancorp, had 
approximately $70 billion in assets, $49 billion in deposits and served 
nearly four million households and 475,000 businesses in 17 contiguous states 
from Illinois to Washington. The Company exchanged 2.265 shares of its common 
stock for each share of USBC common stock. USBC's outstanding stock options 
also were converted into stock options for the Company's common stock. In 
addition, each outstanding share of USBC cumulative preferred stock was 
converted into one share of preferred stock of the combined company having 
substantially identical terms. The transaction was accounted for as a 
pooling-of-interests.

PIPER JAFFRAY COMPANIES INC. On May 1, 1998, the Company completed its 
acquisition of Piper Jaffray Companies Inc. ("Piper Jaffray"), a full-service 
investment banking and securities brokerage firm. The acquisition allows the 
Company to offer investment banking and institutional and retail brokerage 
services through a new subsidiary known as U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray Inc. 
The acquisition of Piper Jaffray was accounted for under the purchase method 
of accounting, and accordingly, the purchase price of $738 million (including 
$719 million aggregate cash consideration for Piper Jaffray shares 
outstanding) was allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based 
on their fair market values at the date of acquisition.

OTHER ACQUISITIONS Effective December 15, 1998, the Company completed its 
acquisition of Northwest Bancshares, Inc., a privately-held bank holding 
company headquartered in Vancouver, Washington, with 10 banking locations and 
$344 million in deposits. Effective December 12, 1997, the Company completed 
its acquisition of the $360 million Zappco, Inc., a bank holding company 
headquartered in St. Cloud, Minnesota. Effective April 30, 1997, USBC 
completed its acquisition of the $214 million Business and Professional Bank 
of Sacramento, California. On January 31, 1997, the Company completed its 
acquisition of the bond indenture services and paying agency business of 
Comerica Incorporated. This business serves approximately 860 municipal and 
corporate clients with about 2,400 bond issues. Effective January 1, 1997, 
USBC completed its acquisition of the $70 million Sun Capital Bancorp of St. 
George, Utah. These transactions were accounted for as purchase acquisitions.

NOTE E  RESTRICTIONS ON CASH AND DUE FROM BANKS

Bank subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum average reserve balances 
with the Federal Reserve Bank. The amount of those reserve balances was 
approximately $668 million at December 31, 1998, with an average balance of 
$248 million during the year ended December 31, 1998.

46                                                                  U.S. Bancorp



- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE F  LOANS AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

The composition of the loan portfolio at December 31 was as follows:



*ALL OR PART OF THE STUDENT LOAN PORTFOLIO MAY BE SOLD WHEN THE REPAYMENT
 PERIOD BEGINS.


     Loans of $1.2 billion at December 31, 1998, and $2.7 billion at December 
31, 1997, were pledged at the Federal Home Loan Bank and the Federal Reserve. 
Nonaccrual and renegotiated loans totaled $279 million, $297 million and $269 
million at December 31, 1998, 1997, and 1996, respectively. At December 31, 
1998, and 1997, the Company had $218 million and $239 million, respectively, 
of loans considered impaired under SFAS 114 included in its nonaccrual loans. 
The carrying value of the impaired loans was less than or equal to the 
appraised collateral value or the present value of expected future cash flows 
and, accordingly, no allowance for credit losses was specifically allocated 
to impaired loans. For the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997, and 1996, the 
average recorded investment in impaired loans was approximately $214 million, 
$249 million, and $176 million, respectively. The effect of nonaccrual and 
renegotiated loans on interest income was as follows:



     Commitments to lend additional funds to customers whose loans were
classified as nonaccrual or renegotiated at December 31, 1998, totaled $43.6
million. During 1998, there were $3.6 million in loans that were restructured at
market interest rates and returned to a fully performing status.

Activity in the allowance for credit losses was as follows:



U.S. Bancorp                                                                  47



- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE G  PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT

Premises and equipment at December 31 consisted of the following:




- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE H  LONG-TERM DEBT

Long-term debt (debt with original maturities of more than one year) at December
31 consisted of the following:




     Floating-rate notes due November 15, 1999, are the only assets of the 
U.S. Bancorp Putable Asset Trust 1996-1 (the "1996-1 Trust"). The 1996-1 
Trust entered into a call option, pursuant to which the call holder has the 
right to purchase the notes from the 1996-1 Trust at par on November 15, 
1999. If the call is exercised, the notes would become fixed-rate obligations 
due in 2006. If the call holder does not exercise the call option, the 
Company is required to redeem the notes immediately thereafter. The interest 
rate adjusts quarterly at .15 percent over the London Interbank Offered Rate 
("LIBOR") for three-month United States dollar deposits. At December 31, 
1998, the interest rate was 5.7125 percent.

     Floating-rate subordinated notes due November 30, 2010, may be redeemed 
at par at the Company's option. The annual interest rate for each quarterly 
period is one-eighth of 1 percent above LIBOR for three-month Euro-dollar 
deposits, subject to a minimum of 5.25 percent. At December 31, 1998, the 
interest rate was 5.625 percent.

48                                                                  U.S. Bancorp



     Step-up subordinated notes due August 15, 2005, are issued by the 
Company's subsidiary bank, U.S. Bank National Association (the "Bank"). The 
interest rate on these notes is 6.25 percent through August 14, 2000, and 
7.30 percent thereafter. The notes have a one-time call feature at the option 
of the Bank on August 15, 2000.

     Floating-rate notes due February 27, 2000, are issued by the Bank and 
are the only assets of the U.S. Oregon Pass-Through Asset Trust 1997-1 (the 
"1997-1 Trust"). The 1997-1 Trust entered into a call option, pursuant to 
which the call holder has the right to purchase the notes from the 1997-1 
Trust at par on February 27, 2000. If the call is exercised, the notes would 
become fixed-rate obligations due in 2007. If the call holder does not 
exercise the call option, the Bank is required to redeem the notes 
immediately thereafter. The interest rate adjusts quarterly at .10 percent 
over LIBOR for three-month United States dollar deposits. At December 31, 
1998, the interest rate was 5.35 percent.

     Medium-term notes outstanding at December 31, 1998, mature from February 
1999 through July 2002. The notes bear fixed or floating interest rates 
ranging from 5.41 percent to 6.93 percent. The weighted average interest rate 
at December 31, 1998, was 5.65 percent. Federal Home Loan Bank advances 
outstanding at December 31, 1998, mature from February 1999 through October 
2026. The advances bear fixed or floating interest rates ranging from 5.35 
percent to 9.11 percent. The weighted average interest rate at December 31, 
1998, was 5.59 percent. Bank notes outstanding at December 31, 1998, mature 
from March 1999 through November 2005. The notes bear fixed or floating 
interest rates ranging from 5.16 percent to 6.38 percent. The weighted 
average interest rate at December 31, 1998, was 5.60 percent.

Maturities of long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 1998, were:

        DEBENTURES OF THE PARENT COMPANY

The Company issued $950 million of preferred securities (the "Preferred 
Securities") through three separate issuances by three wholly-owned 
subsidiary grantor trusts, FBS Capital I, U.S. Bancorp Capital I and USB 
Capital II (the "Trusts"). The Preferred Securities accrue and pay 
distributions periodically at specified annual rates as provided in the 
Indentures. The Trusts used the net proceeds from the offerings to purchase a 
like amount of Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures (the 
"Debentures") of the Company. The Debentures are the sole assets of the 
Trusts and are eliminated, along with the related income statement effects, 
in the consolidated financial statements. The Company's obligations under the 
Debentures and related documents, taken together, constitute a full and 
unconditional guarantee by the Company of the obligations of the Trusts. The 
guarantee covers the distributions and payments on liquidation or redemption 
of the Preferred Securities, but only to the extent of funds held by the 
Trusts. The Preferred Securities are mandatorily redeemable upon the maturity 
of the Debentures, or upon earlier redemption as provided in the Indentures. 
The Company has the right to redeem the Debentures in whole, (but not in 
part), on or after specific dates, at a redemption price specified in the 
Indentures plus any accrued but unpaid interest to the redemption date. The 
Company used the proceeds from the sales of the Debentures for general 
corporate purposes.

     USB Capital II completed the sale of $350 million Preferred Securities 
in March 1998. The sole asset of USB Capital II is $361 million principal 
amount 7.20 percent Debentures which mature in April 2028, and are redeemable 
prior to maturity at the option of the Company on or after April 1, 2003.

     U.S. Bancorp Capital I completed the sale of $300 million Preferred 
Securities in December 1996. The sole asset of U.S. Bancorp Capital I is $309 
million principal amount 8.27 percent Debentures which mature in December 
2026, and are redeemable prior to maturity at the option of the Company on or 
after December 15, 2006.

     FBS Capital I completed the sale of $300 million Preferred Securities in 
November 1996. The sole asset of FBS Capital I is $309 million principal 
amount 8.09 percent Debentures which mature in November 2026, and are 
redeemable prior to maturity at the option of the Company on or after 
November 15, 2006.

U.S. Bancorp                                                                  49

NOTE J  SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY

COMMON STOCK At December 31, 1998, the Company had 61.2 million shares of 
common stock reserved for future issuances under the Dividend Reinvestment 
Plan, Employee Stock Purchase Plan, and the Stock Option Plan (see Note L).

     On April 22, 1998, the Company's shareholders authorized an increase in 
the Company's capital stock necessary to implement the three-for-one split of 
the Company's common stock announced on February 18, 1998. The number of 
common and preferred shares which the Company has authority to issue was 
increased from 500 million shares and 10 million shares, respectively, to 1.5 
billion shares and 50 million shares, respectively. The stock split was in 
the form of a 200 percent dividend payable May 18, 1998, to shareholders of 
record on May 4, 1998. The impact of the stock split has been reflected in 
the financial statements for all periods presented and all share and per 
share data included herein. The Company completed several acquisitions since 
1996 with common shares issued in exchange for the stock of the acquired 
banks (see Note C).

     On June 8, 1998, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the 
repurchase of up to $2.5 billion of the Company's common stock through March 
31, 2000. The shares will be repurchased in the open market or through 
negotiated transactions. Through December 31, 1998, the Company repurchased 
24.6 million shares for $962.8 million. Under 1996 Board authorizations, the 
Company repurchased 93.0 million shares, including 14.7 million during 1997. 
These authorizations were either completed or rescinded prior to the USBC 
acquisition.

     The Company's Dividend Reinvestment Plan provides for automatic 
reinvestment of dividends and optional cash purchases of up to $60,000 worth 
of additional shares per calendar year at market price.

PREFERRED STOCK The Company has authorization to issue up to 50 million 
shares of preferred stock. At December 31, 1998, the Company had no preferred 
stock outstanding.

     On November 14, 1997, the Company redeemed all outstanding shares of its 
8 1/8 percent Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series A at a redemption price of 
$25 per share, together with accrued and unpaid dividends.

     On November 29, 1996, the Company called the remaining 1,543,025 shares 
of its Series 1991A Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock. As a result, at 
December 31, 1996, (the redemption date), all remaining shares had been 
redeemed or converted into common stock. Prior to conversion, dividends on 
the Series 1991A shares, which had a $1.00 par value, were 7.125 percent per 
year.

     The preferred dividend requirement used in the calculation of earnings 
per common share was $10.6 million and $18.4 million, for the years 1997 and 
1996, respectively.

NOTE K  EARNINGS PER SHARE

The components of earnings per share were:

NOTE L   EMPLOYEE BENE?TS

RETIREMENT PLANS Pension benefits (Pension Plans) are provided to 
substantially all employees based on years of service and employees' 
compensation while employed with the Company. Employees are fully vested 
after five years of service. The Company's funding policy is to contribute 
amounts to its plans sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirements of 
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, plus such additional 
amounts as the Company determines to be appropriate. The actuarial cost 
method used to compute the pension contribution is the projected unit credit 
method. Prior to their acquisition dates, employees of acquired companies 
were covered by separate, noncontributory pension plans that provided 
benefits based on years of service and compensation. As of December 31, 1998, 
the Company has merged the acquired companies' plans into its own plan with 
the exception of FirsTier, which is expected to be merged in 1999. In 
connection with the merger of the former USBC and West One pension plans into 
the former FBS pension plan, the acquired plans, which determined retirement 
benefits based on the final average compensation of participants were changed 
to a cash balance plan, under which retirement benefits are based on a 
participant's average annual compensation over a career with the Company. 
These changes resulted in a reduction in the benefit obligation during 1998. 
The Company also maintains several unfunded, nonqualified, supplemental 
executive retirement programs that provide additional defined pension 
benefits for certain employees. The assumptions used in computing the present 
value of the accumulated benefit obligation, the projected benefit obligation 
and net pension expense are substantially consistent with those assumptions 
used for the Pension Plans.

OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS In addition to providing pension benefits, the 
Company provides certain health care and death benefits to retired employees. 
Nearly all employees may become eligible for health care benefits at or after 
age 55 if they have completed at least five years of service and their age 
plus years of service is equal to or exceeds 65 while working for the 
Company. The Company subsidizes the cost of coverage for employees who retire 
before age 65 with at least 10 years of service. The amount of the subsidy is 
based on the employee's age and service at the time of retirement and remains 
fixed until the retiree reaches age 65. After age 65 the retiree assumes 
responsibility for the full cost of the coverage. The plan also contains 
other cost-sharing features such as deductibles and coinsurance. The Company 
continues to subsidize the coverage for employees over age 65 who retired 
before a plan change eliminated the subsidy. The estimated cost of retiree 
benefit payments, other than pensions, is accrued during the employees' 
active service. Beginning in 1996, the Company funded the tax deductible 
portion of its outstanding liability. Prior to 1996, the Company funded the 
postretirement benefit costs as incurred.

     Effective in 1998, the Company adopted a change in the measurement date 
of its employee benefit plan from December 31 to September 30. Information 
presented in the tables below reflects a measurement date of September 30, 
1998 for 1998. Prior periods have not been restated; the impact of the change 
is not material.

The following table sets forth the components of net periodic benefit cost 
for the retirement plans.



*IN 1998, $25.6 MILLION IN CURTAILMENT GAINS WAS RECORDED IN NONRECURRING
 MERGER-RELATED CHARGES.

U.S. Bancorp                                                                  51



The following tables summarize benefit obligation and plan asset activity for 
the retirement plans.



The following table sets forth the weighted average plan assumptions:

The following table provides information for pension plans with accumulated 
benefit obligations in excess of plan assets:



EMPLOYEE INVESTMENT PLAN The Company provides a 401(k) Savings Plan formerly 
known as the Capital Accumulation Plan which allows qualified employees, at 
their option, to make contributions up to certain percentages of pre-tax base 
salary through salary deductions under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue 
Code. A portion of these contributions is matched by the Company. All of the 
Company's matching contributions are invested in USB common stock. Employee 
contributions are invested, at the employees' direction, among a variety of 
investment alternatives. Total expense was $35.5 million, $22.5 million and 
$25.6 million in 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.

STOCK INCENTIVE AND PURCHASE PLANS The Company has elected to follow 
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to 
Employees" (APB 25) in accounting for its employee stock incentive and 
purchase plans. Under APB 25, because the exercise price of the Company's 
employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the 
date of grant, no compensation expense is recognized. On the date exercised, 
the option proceeds equal to the par value of the shares are credited to 
common stock and additional proceeds are credited to capital surplus.

     The Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) permits all eligible employees 
with at least one year of service and directors to purchase common stock. 
Plan participants can purchase stock for 85 percent to 100 percent of the 
fair market value, which is based on the price at the beginning or the end of 
the purchase period, whichever is lower. Any discount is determined by a 
committee of the Board of Directors. In 1998, the purchase price was 85 
percent of fair market value. The plan results in no compensation expense to 
the Company.

     In July 1997, the shareholders approved the 1997 Stock Incentive Plan 
(1997 Plan) whereby all former stock incentive plans of FBS and USBC were 
incorporated into the 1997 Plan. All outstanding options, restricted stock 
and other awards subject to the terms of the former FBS and USBC stock 
incentive plans will remain outstanding and subject to the terms and 
conditions of those plans but are counted as part of the total number of 
common shares awarded under the 1997 Plan, subject, in the case of the former 
USBC plans, to adjustment reflecting the conversion of USBC common stock into 
common stock of the Company. An additional 6 million shares were approved for 
issuance by the shareholders under the 1997 Plan to meet the needs of the 
Company over approximately the next two years. The 1997 Plan allows for the 
granting of nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock 
appreciation rights (SARs), restricted stock or stock units (RSUs), 
performance awards, and other stock-based awards at or above 100 percent of 
the market price at the date of grant. The 1997 Plan also provides automatic 
grants of stock options to nonemployee directors. The rights of restricted 
stock and RSU holders to transfer shares are generally limited during the 
restriction period. At December 31, 1998, there were 13.8 million shares 
(subject to adjustment for forfeitures) available for grant under the Plans.

     Options granted are generally exercisable up to 10 years from the date 
of grant and vest over three to five years. Restricted shares vest over three 
to seven years. The vesting of certain options and restricted shares 
accelerate based on the performance of the Company in comparison to the 
performance of a predetermined group of regional banks. Compensation expense 
for restricted stock is based on the market price of the Company stock at the 
time of the grant and amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting 
period. For the performance-based restricted shares, compensation expense is 
amortized using the estimated vesting period. Compensation expense related to 
the restricted stock was $27.8 million, $8.4 million and $4.9 million in 
1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.

     Stock incentive plans of acquired companies are terminated at the merger 
closing dates. Option holders under such plans receive the Company's common 
stock, or options to buy the Company's stock, based on the conversion terms 
of the various merger agreements.

U.S. Bancorp                                                                53


The historical option information presented below has been restated to 
reflect the options originally granted under acquired companies' plans.



Additional information regarding options outstanding as of December 31, 1998, 
is as follows:



     Pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is 
required by SFAS 123, "Accounting and Disclosure of Stock-Based Compensation" 
and has been determined as if the Company had accounted for its employee 
stock option and stock purchase plans (options) under the fair value method 
of that Statement. The fair value of the options was estimated at the grant 
date using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. Option valuation models 
require the input of highly subjective assumptions. Because the Company's 
employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from 
those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input 
assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management's 
opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single 
measure of the fair value of its employee stock options.

54                                                                U.S. Bancorp


     The pro forma disclosures include options granted in 1998, 1997 and 1996 
and are not likely to be representative of the pro forma disclosures for 
future years. The estimated fair value of the options is amortized to expense 
over the options' vesting period.



- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE M  MERGER, INTEGRATION AND RESIZING CHARGES

The Company recorded merger, integration and resizing charges of $216.5 
million, $511.6 million and $88.1 million in 1998, 1997 and 1996, 
respectively. Merger and integration charges in 1998 were primarily due to 
conversion costs related to the USBC acquisition and the acquisitions of 
Piper Jaffray Companies Inc. and Northwest Bancshares. Merger and integration 
charges of $511.6 million recorded in 1997 were associated with the 
acquisition of USBC. Merger and integration charges recorded in 1996 were 
associated with the acquisitions of FirsTier, the BankAmerica corporate trust 
business, and West One Bancorp, and resizing charges associated with the 
Company's streamlining of the branch distribution network and trust 
operations. The components of the charges are shown below:



*    OTHER MERGER-RELATED CHARGES IN 1997 INCLUDED $43.4 MILLION OF CAPITALIZED
     SOFTWARE AND OTHER ASSET WRITEDOWNS, $35.0 MILLION OF INVESTMENT BANKING
     AND OTHER TRANSACTION COSTS AND $51.0 MILLION OF OTHER MERGER-RELATED
     EXPENSES.

     The Company determines merger, integration and resizing charges based on 
its integration strategy and formulated plans. These plans are established as 
of the acquisition date and regularly evaluated during the integration 
process. Severance charges include the cost of severance, other benefits, and 
outplacement costs associated with the termination of employees primarily in 
branch offices and centralized corporate support and data processing 
functions. The severance amounts are determined based on the Company's 
existing severance pay programs and are paid out over a benefit period of up 
to two years from the time of termination. Premise writedowns represent lease 
termination costs and impairment of assets for redundant office space, 
equipment and branches that will be vacated and disposed of as part of the 
integration plan. Systems conversions and other merger-related expenses are 
recorded as incurred and are associated with the preparation and mailing of 
numerous customer communications for the acquisitions and conversion of 
customer accounts, printing and distribution of training materials and policy 
and procedure manuals, outside consulting fees, and similar expenses relating 
to the conversions and integration of acquired branches and operations. The 
following table presents a summary of activity with respect to the Company's 
merger, integration and resizing accrual:



The components of the merger, integration and resizing accrual were as 
follows:



The Company expects to incur an additional $20 million, pretax, of 
merger-related expenses in 1999 related to the Piper Jaffray acquisition.

U.S. Bancorp                                                                55


NOTE N  INCOME TAXES

The components of income tax expense were:



The reconciliation between income tax expense and the amount computed by 
applying the statutory federal income tax rate was as follows:




     At December 31, 1998, for income tax purposes, the Company had federal 
net operating loss carryforwards of $3.4 million available, which expire in 
years 1999 through 2003. In addition, the Company had aggregate state net 
operating loss carryforwards of $123.8 million available, which expire in 
years 1999 through 2004.

     During 1996, the Company received a tax refund of $65 million, including 
interest, from the State of Minnesota relating to the exemption of interest 
income received on investments in U.S. government securities for the period 
1979 to 1983.

     Deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflect the tax effect of 
temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for the same items for 
income tax reporting purposes.

56                                                                U.S. Bancorp


Significant components of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities 
as of December 31 were as follows:



     Realization of the deferred tax asset over time is dependent upon the 
existence of taxable income in carryback periods or the Company generating 
sufficient taxable earnings in future periods. In determining that 
realization of the deferred tax asset was more likely than not, the Company 
gave consideration to a number of factors, including its taxable income 
during carryback periods, its recent earnings history, its expectations for 
earnings in the future and, where applicable, the expiration dates associated 
with tax carrybacks and carryforwards.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE O FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK AND CREDIT
       CONCENTRATIONS

In the normal course of business, the Company uses various off-balance sheet 
financial instruments to meet the needs of its customers and to manage its 
interest rate risk. These instruments carry varying degrees of credit, 
interest rate or liquidity risk. The contract or notional amounts of these 
financial instruments at December 31 were as follows:



U.S. Bancorp                                                                57


COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT Commitments to extend credit are legally binding 
and generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses. The 
contractual amount represents the Company's exposure to credit loss, in the 
event of default by the borrower. The Company manages this credit risk by 
using the same credit policies it applies to loans. Collateral is obtained to 
secure commitments based on management's credit assessment of the borrower. 
The collateral may include marketable securities, receivables, inventory, 
equipment, and real estate. Since the Company expects many of the commitments 
to expire without being drawn, total commitment amounts do not necessarily 
represent the Company's future liquidity requirements. In addition, the 
commitments include consumer credit lines that are cancelable upon 
notification to the consumer.

LETTERS OF CREDIT Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments the 
Company issues to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. 
The guarantees frequently support public and private borrowing arrangements, 
including commercial paper issuances, bond financings, and other similar 
transactions. The Company issues commercial letters of credit on behalf of 
customers to ensure payment or collection in connection with trade 
transactions. In the event of a customer's nonperformance, the Company's 
credit loss exposure is the same as in any extension of credit, up to the 
letter's contractual amount. Management assesses the borrower's credit to 
determine the necessary collateral, which may include marketable securities, 
real estate, accounts receivable, and inventory. Since the conditions 
requiring the Company to fund letters of credit may not occur, the Company 
expects its liquidity requirements to be less than the total outstanding 
commitments.

INTEREST RATE OPTIONS AND SWAPS Interest rate swaps are contracts to exchange 
fixed and floating rate interest payment obligations based on a notional 
principal amount. The Company enters into swaps to hedge its balance sheet 
against fluctuations in interest rates and as an intermediary for customers. 
At December 31, 1998, and 1997, interest rate swaps totaling $7.2 billion and 
$5.3 billion, respectively, hedged loans, deposits and long-term debt.

The Company received fixed rate interest and paid floating rate interest on 
all hedges as of December 31, 1998. Activity with respect to interest rate 
swap hedges was as follows:



     For the hedging portfolio's notional balances and yields by maturity 
date as of year-end 1998, see Table 17 on page 32. For a description of the 
Company's objectives for using derivative financial instruments, refer to Use 
of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate Risk on pages 32 and 33. Such 
information is incorporated by reference into these Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements.

     At December 31, 1998, and 1997, purchased LIBOR based interest rate 
floors totaling $500 million with an average remaining maturity of 2.7 years 
and $550 million with an average remaining maturity of 5 months, 
respectively, hedged floating rate commercial loans. The strike rate on these 
LIBOR based floors was 4.63 percent at December 31, 1998, and ranged from 
3.25 percent to 4.00 percent at December 31, 1997. At December 31, 1997, 
purchased Constant Maturity Treasury (CMT) interest rate floors totaling $200 
million with an average remaining maturity of 12 months hedged the prepayment 
risk of fixed rate residential mortgage loans. The strike rate on these CMT 
floors was 5.60 percent at December 31, 1997. There were no CMT floors 
outstanding as of December 31, 1998. The premium on floors is amortized over 
the life of the contract. The impact of the floors on net interest income was 
not material for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996.

58                                                                U.S. Bancorp


     For swaps and options used as hedges, the Company recognizes interest 
income or expense as it is accrued over the terms of the hedge. The gain or 
loss on a terminated hedge is amortized over the remaining life of the 
original swap or remaining life of the hedged item, whichever is shorter. The 
impact of the amortization of deferred gains and losses on hedges on net 
interest income was not material for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 
and 1996. Net unamortized deferred gains were immaterial at December 31, 1998.

     In addition to utilizing swaps and options as part of its 
asset/liability management strategy, the Company acts as an intermediary for 
swap and option agreements on behalf of its customers. To reduce its market 
risk exposure, the Company generally enters into offsetting positions. The 
total notional amount of customer swap agreements, including the offsetting 
positions, was $740 million and $855 million at December 31, 1998, and 1997, 
respectively. The total notional amount of customer option agreements, 
including the offsetting positions, was $720 million and $516 million at 
December 31, 1998, and 1997, respectively. Market value changes on 
intermediated swaps, options and futures contracts are recognized in income 
in the period of change. Realized gains or losses on intermediated 
transactions were not material for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 
and 1996.

     The credit risk related to interest rate swap and option agreements is 
that counterparties may be unable to meet the contractual terms. The Company 
estimates this risk by calculating the present value of the cost to replace 
all outstanding contracts in a gain position at current market rates, 
reported on a net basis by each counterparty. At December 31, 1998, and 1997, 
the gain position of these contracts, in the aggregate, was approximately 
$217 million and $91 million, respectively.

     The Company manages the credit risk of its interest rate swap and option 
contracts through bilateral collateral agreements, credit approvals, limits, 
and monitoring procedures. Commercial lending officers perform credit 
analyses and establish counterparty limits. Senior Credit Administration 
periodically reviews positions to monitor compliance with the limits. In 
addition, the Company reduces the assumed counterparty credit risk through 
master netting agreements that permit the Company to settle interest rate 
contracts with the same counterparty on a net basis.

FORWARD CONTRACTS AND COMMITMENTS TO SELL MORTGAGE LOANS Forward contracts 
are agreements for the delayed delivery of securities or cash settlement 
money market instruments. The Company enters into these contracts to hedge 
the interest rate risk of its mortgage loans held for sale. At December 31, 
1998, and 1997, forward contracts outstanding were $10 million and $175 
million, respectively. At December 31, 1998, net unamortized deferred gains 
on the forward agreements were not material. The Company manages its credit 
risk on forward contracts, which arises from nonperformance by 
counterparties, through credit approval and limit procedures.

MORTGAGES SOLD WITH RECOURSE The Company is obligated under recourse 
provisions related to the sale of certain residential mortgages. The contract 
amount of these mortgages, excluding the Government National Mortgage 
Association ("GNMA") agreements, was $52 million at December 31, 1998, and 
$74 million at December 31, 1997. Mortgages sold with recourse under 
sale/servicing agreements with GNMA totaled $13 million at December 31, 1997. 
The Company has secondary recourse obligations under these agreements, but 
the liability is not material. There were no mortgages sold with recourse 
under sale/servicing agreements with GNMA at December 31, 1998.

FOREIGN CURRENCY COMMITMENTS The Company uses foreign currency commitments to 
help customers reduce the risks associated with changes in foreign currency 
exchange rates. Through these contracts, the Company exchanges currencies at 
specified rates on specified dates with various counterparties. The Company 
minimizes the market and liquidity risks by taking offsetting positions. In 
addition, the Company controls the market risks by limiting the net exposure 
through policies, procedures, and monitoring. The Company manages its credit 
risk, or potential risk of loss from default by a counterparty, through 
credit limit approval and monitoring procedures. The aggregate replacement 
cost of contracts in a gain position at December 31, 1998, was not 
significant.

COMMITMENTS FROM SECURITIES LENDING The Company participates in securities 
lending activities by acting as a customer's agent involving the loan or sale 
of securities. The Company indemnifies customers for the difference between

collateral received. These transactions are collateralized by cash.

CREDIT CONCENTRATIONS The Company primarily lends to borrowers in the 17 
states where it has banking offices. Approximately 90 percent of the 
Company's commercial loans were made to borrowers, representing a diverse 
range of industries, in this operating region. Collateral may include 
marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventory and equipment.

     For detail of the Company's real estate portfolio by property type and 
geography as of December 31, 1998, and 1997, see Table 9 on page 25. This 
information is incorporated by reference into these Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements. Such loans are collateralized by the related property.

     Approximately 85 percent of the total consumer portfolio consists of 
loans to customers in the Company's operating region. Residential mortgages, 
home equity, and auto loans are secured, but other consumer loans are 
generally not secured. For detail of the Company's consumer loan portfolio 
referenced here, see Table 7 on page 24 under the category "Consumer" as of 
December 31, 1998, and 1997, which is incorporated by reference into these 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE P  FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Financial instruments, both on and off balance sheet, are generally defined 
as cash, equity instruments or investments and contractual obligations to pay 
or receive cash or another financial instrument. The estimated fair value of 
financial instruments is based on quoted market prices. When market quotes 
are unavailable, valuation techniques including discounted cash flow 
calculations and pricing models or services are used.

     Due to the nature of its business and its customers' needs, the Company 
offers a large number of financial instruments, most of which are not 
actively traded. Accordingly, the Company uses several valuation techniques 
and aggregation methods for valuing various products. The Company also uses 
various assumptions, such as the discount rate and cash flow timing and 
amounts. As a result, the fair value estimates can neither be substantiated 
by independent market comparisons, nor realized by the immediate sale or 
settlement of the financial instrument. Also, the estimates reflect a point 
in time and could change significantly based on changes in economic factors, 
such as interest rates. Furthermore, the required disclosures exclude the 
estimated values of certain financial instruments and all nonfinancial 
instrument cash flows. Finally, the fair value disclosure is not intended to 
estimate a market value of the Company as a whole. A summary of the Company's 
valuation techniques and assumptions follows.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS The carrying value of cash, federal funds sold, and 
securities under resale agreements was assumed to approximate fair value.

SECURITIES Generally, trading securities and available-for-sale securities 
were valued using available market quotes. In some instances, for securities 
that are not widely traded, market quotes for comparable securities were used.

LOANS The loan portfolio consists of both variable and fixed rate loans, the 
fair value of which was estimated using discounted cash flow analyses and 
other valuation techniques. To calculate discounted cash flows, the loans 
were aggregated into pools of similar types and expected repayment terms. The 
expected cash flows were reduced for estimated historical prepayment 
experience. Projected cash flows on nonaccrual loans were further reduced by 
the amount of the estimated losses on the portfolio and discounted over an 
assumed average remaining life of one to two years.

COMMERCIAL The fixed rate loans in the commercial portfolio (excluding 
nonaccrual loans) had a weighted average interest rate of 7.4 percent in 1998 
and 7.7 percent in 1997. The duration was 2.3 years in 1998 and 1.7 years in 
1997. The floating rate loans had a weighted average interest rate of 7.6 
percent in 1998 and 8.3 percent in 1997. The high-grade corporate bond yield 
curve was used to arrive at the discount rates applied to these loans.

COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE AND CONSTRUCTION The fixed rate portion of this 
portfolio (excluding nonaccrual loans) had a weighted average interest rate 
of 8.4 percent, with a duration of 3.4 years in 1998; and a weighted average 
interest rate of 8.8 percent, with a duration of 3.1 years in 1997. The 
floating rate loans (excluding nonaccrual loans) had a weighted average 
interest rate of 8.2 percent in 1998 and 8.7 percent in 1997. The high-grade 
corporate bond yield curve was used to arrive at the discount rates applied 
to these loans.

60                                                                U.S. Bancorp


RESIDENTIAL FIRST MORTGAGES These loans were segregated into pools of similar 
coupons and maturities. The pools were matched to similar mortgage-backed 
securities, and market quotes were obtained. The estimated value also 
reflects the related fair value of mortgage servicing rights, which was 
calculated using a discounted cash flow analysis. The fixed rate portion of 
this portfolio had a weighted average interest rate of 7.5 percent in 1998 
and 7.7 percent in 1997. The duration was 1.8 years in 1998 and 2.1 years in 
1997.

CONSUMER INSTALLMENT The fair value of the consumer installment portfolio was 
based on an approach the Company uses in evaluating potential acquisitions. 
Prepayment assumptions ranging from 29 to 37 percent were applied to 
scheduled cash flows, based on the Company's experience. On the fixed rate 
portion, the weighted average rate was 8.8 percent in 1998 and 9.3 percent in 
1997. The duration was 1.5 years in 1998 and 1.6 years in 1997. The floating 
rate portion of the consumer installment portfolio had a weighted average 
interest rate of 7.5 percent in 1998 and 7.9 percent in 1997.

REVOLVING HOME EQUITY LINES, SECOND MORTGAGES AND CONSUMER LINES The fair 
value of revolving home equity lines, second mortgages, and consumer lines 
was based on the approach the Company uses in evaluating potential 
acquisitions of similar portfolios. In 1998, estimated net income adjusted 
for account attrition was discounted using an estimated cost of capital of 
11.0 percent for secured lines and loans and 13.3 percent for unsecured. In 
1997, the estimated cost of capital was 9.9 percent for secured and 13.1 
percent for unsecured. The home equity lines had a weighted average interest 
rate of 8.8 percent in 1998 and 9.8 percent in 1997. Fixed rate second 
mortgages had a weighted average interest rate of 10.0 percent in 1998 and 
9.7 percent in 1997. The duration was 1.8 years in 1998 and 2.7 years in 
1997. Retail credit cards had a weighted average interest rate of 11.6 
percent in 1998 and 11.8 percent in 1997, with a duration of 1.8 years in 
1998 and 2.0 years in 1997. Other revolving lines had a weighted average 
interest rate of 11.8 percent in 1998 and 12.3 percent in 1997.

CORE DEPOSIT INTANGIBLE Core deposits provide a stable, low-cost source of 
funds that can be invested to earn a return that exceeds their cost. The fair 
value of the Company's core deposit intangible was calculated using a 
discounted cash flow model that estimates the present value of the difference 
between the ongoing cost of the core deposits and alternative funds at 
current market rates.

DEPOSIT LIABILITIES The fair value of demand deposits, savings accounts, and 
certain money market deposits is equal to the amount payable on demand at 
year-end. Fair values for fixed rate certificates of deposit were estimated 
using a discounted cash flow analysis based on the discount rates implied by 
the high-grade corporate bond yield curve.

SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS Federal funds purchased, borrowings under repurchase 
agreements, and other short-term borrowings are at variable rates or have 
short-term maturities. Their carrying value is assumed to approximate their 
fair value.

LONG-TERM DEBT AND COMPANY-OBLIGATED MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE PREFERRED 
SECURITIES OF SUBSIDIARY TRUSTS HOLDING SOLELY THE JUNIOR SUBORDINATED 
DEBENTURES OF THE PARENT COMPANY Medium-term notes, bank notes, Federal Home 
Loan Bank Advances, capital lease obligations, and mortgage note obligations 
totaled $10,138 million in 1998 and $7,725 million in 1997. Their estimated 
fair value was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis based on 
current market rates of similar maturity debt securities to discount cash 
flows. Other long-term debt instruments and company-obligated mandatorily 
redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trusts holding solely the 
junior subordinated debentures of the parent company were valued using 
available market quotes.

INTEREST RATE SWAPS, OPTIONS, FLOORS, AND CAPS The interest rate options and 
swap cash flows were estimated using a third party pricing model and 
discounted based on appropriate LIBOR, Eurodollar future, and Treasury Note 
yield curves.

LOAN COMMITMENTS, LETTERS OF CREDIT AND GUARANTEES The Company's commitments 
have variable rates and do not expose the Company to interest rate risk. No 
premium or discount was ascribed to the loan commitments because virtually 
all funding would be at current market rates.

NOTE Q  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

Rental expense for operating leases amounted to $121.0 million in 1998, 
$114.6 million in 1997, and $116.1 million in 1996. Future minimum payments, 
net of sublease rentals, under capitalized leases and noncancelable operating 
leases with initial or remaining terms of one year or more, consisted of the 
following at December 31, 1998:

     Various legal proceedings are currently pending against the Company. Due 
to their complex nature, it may be years before some matters are resolved. In 
the opinion of management, the aggregate liability, if any, will not have a 
material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, liquidity or 
results of operations.

CONDENSED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS


     Transfer of funds (dividends, loans or advances) from bank subsidiaries 
to the Company is restricted. Federal law prohibits loans unless they are 
secured and generally limits any loan to the Company or individual affiliate 
to 10 percent of the bank's equity. In aggregate, loans to the Company and 
all affiliates cannot exceed 20 percent of the bank's equity.

     Dividend payments to the Company by its subsidiary banks are subject to 
regulatory review and statutory limitations and, in some instances, 
regulatory approval. The approval of the Comptroller of the Currency is 
required if total dividends by a national bank in any calendar year exceed 
the bank's net income for that year combined with its retained net income for 
the preceding two calendar years or if the bank's retained earnings are less 
than zero. Furthermore, dividends are restricted by the Comptroller of the 
Currency's minimum capital constraints for all national banks. Within these 
guidelines, all bank subsidiaries have the ability to pay dividends without 
prior regulatory approval.

                              REPORT OF MANAGEMENT
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The financial statements of U.S. Bancorp were prepared by management, which 
is responsible for their integrity and objectivity. The statements have been 
prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
appropriate in the circumstances and include amounts that are based on 
management's best estimates and judgment. All financial information 
throughout the annual report is consistent with that in the financial 
statements.

     The Company maintains accounting and internal control systems that are 
believed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and 
transactions are properly authorized and recorded. To test compliance, the 
Company carries out an extensive audit program. This program includes a 
review for compliance with written policies and procedures and a 
comprehensive review of the adequacy and effectiveness of internal control 
systems. However, there are limits inherent in all systems of internal 
accounting control and management recognizes that errors or irregularities 
may occur. Based on the recognition that the costs of such systems should not 
exceed the benefits to be derived, management believes the Company's system 
provides an appropriate cost/benefit balance.

     The Company's independent auditors, Ernst & Young LLP, have been engaged 
to render an opinion on the financial statements and to assist in carrying 
out the audit program described above. Their opinion on the financial 
statements is based on procedures performed in accordance with generally 
accepted auditing standards, including tests of the accounting records to the 
extent necessary to allow them to report on the fairness of the financial 
statements. Ernst & Young LLP has full access to the Audit Committee and the 
Board of Directors.

     The management of the Company is committed to and has always maintained 
and enforced a philosophy of high ethical standards in the conduct of its 
business. Written policies covering conflicts of interest and other subjects 
are formulated in a Code of Ethics which is uniformly applicable to all 
officers and employees of the Company.

The Board of Directors and Shareholders 
U.S. Bancorp

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of U.S. Bancorp 
and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1998 and 1997, and the related 
consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for 
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1998. These 
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our 
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based 
on our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free 
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, 
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. 
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and 
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall 
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a 
reasonable basis for our opinion.

     In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present 
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of U.S. 
Bancorp and subsidiaries at December 31, 1998 and 1997, and the consolidated 
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years 
in the period ended December 31, 1998, in conformity with generally accepted 
accounting principles.

GENERAL U.S. Bancorp, formerly known as First Bank System, Inc. (the 
"Company"), is the organization created by the acquisition by First Bank 
System, Inc. of U.S. Bancorp of Portland, Oregon. The Company is a regional, 
multi-state bank holding company headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The 
Company was incorporated in Delaware in 1929 and owns 100 percent of the 
capital stock of each of eight banks, and ten trust companies, having 
approximately 1,000 banking offices in 17 Midwestern and Western states. The 
Company offers full-service brokerage services at approximately 100 offices 
through a wholly owned subsidiary. The Company also has various nonbank 
subsidiaries engaged in financial services.

     The banks are engaged in general commercial banking business, 
principally in domestic markets. They range in size from less than $1.0 
million to $49.0 billion in deposits and provide a wide variety of services 
to individuals, businesses, industry, institutional organizations, 
governmental entities, and other financial institutions. Depository services 
include checking accounts, savings accounts, and time certificate contracts. 
Ancillary services such as treasury management and receivable lockbox 
collection are provided for corporate customers. The Company's bank and trust 
subsidiaries provide a full range of fiduciary activities for individuals, 
estates, foundations, business corporations, and charitable organizations.

     The Company provides banking services through its subsidiary banks to 
both domestic and foreign customers and correspondent banks. These services 
include consumer banking, commercial lending, financing of import/export 
trade, foreign exchange, and investment services.

     The Company, through its subsidiaries, also provides services in trust, 
commercial and agricultural finance, data processing, leasing, and brokerage 
services.

     On a full-time equivalent basis, employment during 1998 averaged a total 
of 26,526 employees.

COMPETITION The commercial banking business is highly competitive. Subsidiary 
banks compete with other commercial banks and with other financial 
institutions, including savings and loan associations, mutual savings banks, 
finance companies, mortgage banking companies, credit unions, and investment 
companies. In recent years, competition has increased from institutions not 
subject to the same regulatory restrictions as domestic banks and bank 
holding companies.

GOVERNMENT POLICIES The operations of the Company's various operating units 
are affected by state and federal legislative changes and by policies of 
various regulatory authorities, including those of the several states in 
which they operate, the United States and foreign governments. These policies 
include, for example, statutory maximum legal lending rates, domestic 
monetary policies of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 
United States fiscal policy, international currency regulations and monetary 
policies, and capital adequacy and liquidity constraints imposed by bank 
regulatory agencies.

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION The Company is a registered bank holding company 
under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the "Act") and is subject to the 
supervision of, and regulation by, the Board of Governors of the Federal 
Reserve System (the "Board").

     Under the Act, a bank holding company may engage in banking, managing or 
controlling banks, furnishing or performing services for banks it controls, 
and conducting activities that the Board has determined to be closely related 
to banking. The Company must obtain the prior approval of the Board before 
acquiring more than 5 percent of the outstanding shares of another bank or 
bank holding company, and must provide notice to, and in some situations 
obtain the prior approval of, the Board in connection with the acquisition of 
more than 5 percent of the outstanding shares of a company engaged in a 
"bank-related" business.

     Under the Act, as amended by the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and 
Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 (the "Interstate Act"), the Company may 
acquire banks throughout the United States, subject only to state or federal 
deposit caps and state minimum-age requirements. Effective June 1, 1997, the 
Interstate Act authorized interstate branching by acquisition and 
consolidation in those states that had not opted out by that date.

     National banks are subject to the supervision of, and are examined by, 
the Comptroller of the Currency. All subsidiary banks of the Company are 
members of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"), and as such, 
are subject to examination thereby. In practice, the primary federal 
regulator makes regular examinations of each subsidiary bank subject to its 
regulatory review or participates in joint examinations with other federal 
regulators. Areas subject to regulation by federal authorities include the 
allowance for credit losses, investments, loans, mergers, issuance of 
securities, payment of dividends, establishment of branches and other aspects 
of operations.

PROPERTIES The Company and its significant subsidiaries occupy their 
headquarter offices under long-term leases. The Company also leases three 
freestanding operations centers in St. Paul and Denver, and owns operations 
centers in Fargo and Portland. At December 31, 1998, the Company's 
subsidiaries owned and operated a total of 748 facilities and leased an 
additional 648 facilities, all of which are well maintained. Additional 
information with respect to premises and equipment is presented in Notes G 
and Q to Consolidated Financial Statements.

U.S. Bancorp                                                                75
