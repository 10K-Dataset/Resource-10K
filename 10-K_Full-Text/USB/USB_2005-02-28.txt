FINANCIAL SUMMARY

U.S. BANCORP



LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS

2004 was a year that it all came together for U.S. Bancorp. Service quality levels have
never been higher. Financial results are strong and lead the industry in key measurements. All
lines of business are contributing to revenue and growth.

Fellow Shareholders:

I am pleased to tell you that in 2004,
U.S. Bancorp achieved its goals for the year and
delivered on its promises to you.

STRONG FINANCIAL RESULTS WITH A

FOCUS ON REVENUE GROWTH

We reported record net income of $4.2
billion, a 13 percent increase in diluted earnings
per share, and industry-leading returns on assets
and equity of 2.17 percent and 21.4 percent,
respectively. Credit quality trends continued to
improve as credit losses decreased significantly
from a year ago. And reflecting our priority to
grow revenue, we achieved solid fee income growth.

During the coming year, we will act to sustain those
successes. Revenue growth is our primary focus,
particularly net interest income from improved
commercial lending results. Our consumer lending
business continues to grow, and we have made a number
of changes surrounding our commercial banking and
small business banking lines of business to increase
commercial loan growth. We saw middle market
commercial loan balances move upward in fourth quarter
2004.

We are very disciplined in our acquisitions, focusing
only on those which will enhance revenue growth,
create operating scale, build a more profitable
business line or strengthen a critical competitive
advantage. This strategy has proved very successful,
most notably in our payments business, which reported
10.6 percent net revenue growth in 2004.

Our capital position remains strong, and we repurchased
93.8 million shares during 2004.

INVESTING FOR GROWTH AND SERVICE

We are investing more in our core businesses to
drive revenue growth. Our investments and expertise in
new technology have delivered a new generation of
electronic options for
customers—check imaging, processing, payments, account
management, collections and other service delivery
systems. Of particular note is the expansion of our
merchant processing capabilities in Europe; there are
further details of that expansion on page 16 of this
report. And, we continue to invest in our branch
office network in higher-growth markets. There are
further details of our in-store and traditional branch
expansion program on page 13 of this report.

We continue to support our pledge of guaranteed high
levels of customer service. Investments in delivery
and operational systems allowed us to unify systems,
simplify procedures, streamline processes and increase
the ease of numerous customer transactions and
communications. These investments improved customer
service and increased customer satisfaction and
loyalty, contributing significantly to our ability to
attract and retain customers. We have also improved
hiring and training practices, and service quality is
an integral part of our employees’ performance
evaluation and incentive programs.

RATING AGENCIES VIEW

U.S. BANK FAVORABLY

We are pleased that on January 18, 2005, Moody’s
rating agency upgraded U.S. Bank’s ratings. Long-term
senior debt at the holding company, U.S. Bancorp, was
upgraded to Aa2 from Aa3 while long-term senior
ratings of its subsidiary bank, U.S. Bank National
Association, were upgraded to Aa1 from Aa2. The main
driver behind the


U.S. BANCORP


upgrade was Moody’s view that the corporation’s
business model will generate strong profitability, and
the consistency of that profitability performance is
supported by improving risk management and maintenance
of very good liquidity.

We were also pleased that on September 27, 2004,
Fitch’s rating agency upgraded U.S. Bank’s ratings.
Long- and short-term senior debt at the holding
company, U.S. Bancorp, were upgraded to AA- and F1+,
respectively, from A+ and F1, respectively. The
long-term ratings of its subsidiary bank, U.S. Bank
National Association, were upgraded to AA from AA-.
The main driver behind the upgrade was Fitch’s view
of the corporation’s solid net interest margin,
diverse sources of non-interest income, disciplined
expense management and improved asset quality.

The debt ratings established for U.S. Bank by Moody’s,
Standard and Poor’s, and Fitch reflect the ratings
agencies’ recognition of the strong, consistent
financial performance of the company and the quality
of the balance sheet.

U.S. BANCORP IS A CORPORATION

BUILT ON INTEGRITY

We recognize that our financial results are
only as good as the respect and confidence of the
public and our reputation in the industry and in the
marketplace. We operate with the highest levels of
honesty and integrity, and we have the controls and
monitors in place to ensure that is always true. Our
Corporate Governance Guidelines, our Privacy Pledge,
and our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct can all
be found on our internet website at usbank.com. I
urge you to visit the site.

CREATING SHAREHOLDER VALUE

IS OUR PRIORITY

We delivered on our commitment to return at
least 80 percent of earnings to shareholders,
returning virtually all excess capital to
shareholders, 109 percent of earnings in 2004, in the
form of dividends and share repurchases. We reaffirmed
that commitment with our December 2004 announcement of
a 25 percent dividend increase and the authorization
of a new 150-million share repurchase program.

This corporation has paid a cash dividend for 142
consecutive years, and we have increased the dividend
for 33 consecutive years. That long-time record of
dividend increases earned U.S. Bancorp the designation
of one of the S&P’s 58 “Dividend Aristocrats.” Only
nine other issues have paid a dividend longer than U.S.
Bancorp, which first paid a dividend in 1863.

We manage this corporation to increase the value of
your investment in U.S. Bancorp. It’s the reason we come
to work each day.

Sincerely,

Jerry A. Grundhofer

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer

ADVANTAGEOUS BUSINESS MIX

13.1 million customers rely on U.S. Bancorp as their financial partner.
From a simple personal checking account to sophisticated corporate
transactions, U.S. Bancorp has the products and services, the talent, the
technologies and the expertise to help our customers achieve their goals.

WHOLESALE

BANKING

With relationship managers who understand the
companies, the markets and the industries of our
commercial, corporate and correspondent customers, no
bank brings more to the table than U.S. Bank.

Whether it’s finding the right financing and
capital for growth and expansion, accelerating
receivables, expediting transactions, managing employee
benefits programs or structuring transactions to
finance foreign trade, U.S. Bank has the business
solutions that build businesses and futures.

After several years of lackluster demand, in 2004 we
saw an increase, albeit modest, in commercial and
corporate lending, particularly in the areas of
commercial and industrial lending and commercial real
estate. Economic trends across most markets are
positive overall and we expect to see continued
improvement in 2005. Interest rates, while rising, are
affordable, and companies appear more ready than at any
time in the past several years to invest in their
businesses.

Significant changes within our organization position us
well to be more visible and active in every market,
with more streamlined procedures and more competitive
pricing. These changes augment the high level of
customer service and industry expertise already
provided to our customers.

There is strong momentum in merchant processing,

the expansion of existing relationships with
current

Built on our strong technology platform and superior

distribution and scale following our two most recent
acquisitions. We reported to you last year about our
acquisition of the State Street corporate trust

throughout the Midwest. It is our sixth corporate
trust acquisition since 1999, reflecting our
approach of acquisitions to grow revenue and
businesses capable of competing with anyone.

of this lower cost distribution channel, last year U.S.
Bank began a major expansion of in-store branches in
fast-growing markets such as Arizona, California,
Nevada and Utah. These new branches continue to exceed
expectations for profitability.

In 2003, we opened six new Nashville Publix and 32 new
Safeway, Vons, Smith’s, Pak N Save and Pavilion
branches, plus additional branches with other valued
partners. We continued to grow in 2004, opening 112 new
in-store branches. By the end of 2005, U.S. Bank will
have opened 185 new in-store branches as part of the
newest expansion initiative, for a total overall of 478
in-store branches in 19 states.

NOVA’s new Electronic Check Service processing
streamlines check acceptance and mitigates risk for our

We have upgraded and image-enabled key lockbox sites
for both wholesale and retail payment processing, and
introduced a suite of check conversion products and
services including On-Site Electronic Deposit and
Electronic Cash Letter.

Institutional Trust has launched Health Savings
Accounts (HSA) to client companies. HSAs are
tax-exempt trust or custodial accounts to be used
exclusively for future medical expenses. Similar to
IRAs, they are special tax-sheltered savings accounts
for medical bills for those employees who qualify.

Our new generation of ATMs integrates customization and information delivery
with ATM transactions. Customers will have access to personalized messages, customized
“fast cash” preferences, and more. These ATMs provide a faster, easier to use, and more

MARKET DEVELOPMENT
Our Asset Management business is performance
driven, and on this foundation, we have created
investment products attractive not only to our own
investors, but also products that will be competitive
and attractive in third party retail and institutional
distribution. We will expand into these new
distribution channels in 2005.



U.S. Bancorp Fund Services (USBFS), long a
recognized administrator for U.S.-based mutual funds,
is gaining name recognition and reputation as a third

investment industry as well. USBFS has made
investments in the specialized technology and
accounting systems to support servicing both the
simple and complex investments held by hedge funds.


NOVA continues its merchant processing expansion in
Europe through its EuroConex business, headquartered
in Ireland. Growing through acquisitions and
alliances, EuroConex now supports more than 100,000
merchants across eight European countries. As a
specialized business with notable competitive
advantages, and one that benefits from economies of
scale, we see considerable potential for further
European expansion. NOVA also launched a Canadian
merchant processing product in October 2004. We
anticipate that many current U.S. customers will
consolidate their U.S. and Canadian merchant
processing with NOVA and that Canadian merchants will
switch from fragmented processing systems to NOVA as a
single source of top-rated processing and customer
service.

non-banks, technological developments or bank regulatory reform; (vii) changes in consumer spending
and savings habits could adversely affect our results of operations; (viii) changes in the
financial performance and condition of our borrowers could negatively affect repayment of such
borrowers’ loans; (ix) acquisitions may not produce revenue enhancements or cost savings at levels

U.S. BANCORP



MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS

OVERVIEW

In 2004, U.S. Bancorp and its subsidiaries
(the “Company”) continued to demonstrate its financial
strength and shareholder focus. We began the year with several
specific financial objectives. The first goal was a focus on
organic revenue growth. While growth in net interest income has
been challenging for the banking industry due to rising interest
rates and sluggish commercial loan growth, the Company
experienced strong growth in its fee-based revenues,
particularly in payment processing services. The Company
generated fee-based revenue growth of 11.0 percent in 2004.
By year-end, commercial loan balances also displayed encouraging
trends as the Company experienced its first year-over-year
growth in quarterly average balances since mid-2001. Retail
loans continued to display strong growth in 2004. In 2005, the
Company will continue to focus on revenue growth driven by
disciplined strategic business initiatives, customer service and
an emphasis on payment processing, retail banking and commercial
lending. The second goal was to continue improving the credit
quality of our loan portfolios. During the year nonperforming
assets declined 34.8 percent from a year ago and total net
charge-offs decreased to .63 percent of average loans
outstanding in 2004, compared with 1.06 percent in 2003. By
year end 2004, the credit risk profile of the Company had
improved to pre-2001 levels. In 2005, the Company will continue
to focus on credit quality and minimizing volatility of
credit-related losses. Finally, effectively managing costs is
always a goal for the Company. During 2004, our efficiency ratio
(the ratio of noninterest expense to taxable-equivalent net
revenue excluding net securities gains or losses) improved to
45.3 percent, compared with 45.6 percent in 2003, and
continues to be a leader in the banking industry. The
Company’s results for 2004 reflect the achievement of these
operating objectives and help to position the Company to achieve
its long-term goal of 10 percent or greater growth in
earnings per diluted share.

The Company’s strong performance is also
reflected in our capital levels and the improving outlook by our
credit rating agencies relative to a year ago. Equity capital of
the Company continued to be strong at 6.4 percent of
tangible common assets at December 31, 2004, compared with
6.5 percent at December 31, 2003. Credit ratings for
the Company were upgraded by Fitch Ratings in September 2004 and
Moody’s Investors Service in January 2005. Credit ratings
assigned by various credit rating agencies reflect the favorable
rating agency views of the direction of the Company’s
credit quality, risk management, liquidity and capital
management practices and our ability to generate capital through
earnings.

In concert with achieving our stated financial
objectives, the Company exceeded its objective to return at
least 80 percent of earnings to shareholders in the form of
dividends and share repurchases by returning 109 percent of
2004 earnings to shareholders. In December 2004, we announced an
expanded share repurchase program and further increased our cash
dividend resulting in a 25.0 percent increase from the
dividend rate in the fourth quarter of 2003. We continue to
affirm our goal of returning at least 80 percent of
earnings to shareholders.

Earnings Summary

The
Company reported net income of $4.2 billion in 2004, or
$2.18 per diluted share, compared with $3.7 billion,
or $1.93 per diluted share, in 2003. The 13.0 percent
increase in earnings per diluted share principally reflected
growth in fee-based revenues and lower credit costs. Return on
average assets and return on average equity were
2.17 percent and 21.4 percent, respectively, in 2004,
compared with returns of 1.99 percent and
19.2 percent, respectively, in 2003. Net income in 2003
included after-tax income from discontinued operations of
$22.5 million, or $.01 per diluted share.

In 2004, the Company had income from continuing
operations, net of tax, of $4.2 billion, or $2.18 per
diluted share, compared with $3.7 billion, or
$1.92 per diluted share, in 2003. The Company’s
results from continuing operations in 2004 reflected slightly
lower net interest income, strong fee-based revenue growth and
lower credit costs. During 2004, certain elements of the
Company’s operating results included the impact of
management actions or specific events. In 2004, the Company
undertook several asset/liability management actions in response
to changing interest rates, including sales of investment
securities and the prepayment of certain long-term debt. These
actions enabled the Company to maintain an interest rate risk
position that is relatively neutral to rising interest rates;
however, the Company incurred $104.9 million of net
securities losses in 2004, a net reduction of
$349.7 million from 2003, and debt prepayment costs of
$154.8 million in 2004. Also resulting from changes in
interest rates, the Company incurred a $56.8 million
impairment of its portfolio of mortgage servicing rights
(“MSR”), a favorable reduction in other intangibles
expenses of $151.9 million relative to 2003. Included in
the provision for credit losses in 2004 was a reduction in the
allowance for credit losses of $98.5 million, reflecting
continued improvement in credit quality and economic conditions.
In addition, the Company’s effective income tax rate
declined to


U.S. BANCORP


32.5 percent in 2004, from 34.4 percent
in 2003, principally due to changes in estimated tax liabilities
related to the resolution of certain federal and state tax
examinations. Year-over-year results were also impacted by a
reduction in merger and restructuring-related charges of
$46.2 million, reflecting the completion of all significant
business integration activities in 2003.

Total net revenue, on a taxable-equivalent basis,
was $12.7 billion in 2004, compared with $12.5 billion
in 2003, a year-over-year increase of $128.6 million
(1.0 percent). The increase in net revenue was comprised of
a 3.9 percent increase in noninterest income and a
1.1 percent decline in net interest income. The
3.9 percent net increase in noninterest income was driven
by strong growth in fee-

based products and services (11.0 percent),
particularly in payment processing revenue, offset by a
$349.7 million reduction in gains (losses) on sales of
securities. The 1.1 percent decline in net interest income
reflected modest growth in average earning assets, offset by
lower net interest margins. Also contributing to the
year-over-year decline in net interest income was a reduction in
loan fees, the result of fewer loan prepayments during a rising
rate environment. In 2004, average earning assets increased
$7.3 billion (4.5 percent), compared with 2003,
primarily due to growth in residential mortgages, retail loans
and investment securities, partially offset by a decline in
commercial loans and loans held for sale related to mortgage
banking activities. The net interest margin in 2004 was
4.25 percent, compared with 4.49 percent in 2003. The
decline in net interest margin primarily reflected the
competitive credit pricing environment, a preference to acquire
adjustable-rate securities for asset/liability management
purposes, lower prepayment fees, a modest increase in the
percent of total earning assets funded by wholesale sources of
funding and higher rates paid on wholesale funding due to the
impact of rising rates. In addition, the net interest margin
declined year-over-year as a result of consolidating high credit
quality, low margin loans from Stellar, a commercial loan
conduit, onto the Company’s balance sheet beginning in the
third quarter of 2003.

Total noninterest expense was $5.8 billion
in 2004, compared with $5.6 billion in 2003. The increase
in total noninterest expense of $187.6 million
(3.4 percent), primarily reflected a $154.8 million
charge related to the prepayment of a portion of the
Company’s long-term debt. The expense growth also reflected
increases in compensation, employee benefits, professional
services, marketing and business development, technology and
communications and other operating expense, as well as expenses
related to the expansion of the merchant acquiring business in
Europe. These unfavorable variances were partially offset by a
favorable change in impairment charges related to the MSR
portfolio of $151.9 million and a $46.2 million
reduction in merger and restructuring-related charges. Refer to
“Acquisition and Divestiture Activity” for further
information on the timing of acquisitions. The efficiency ratio
(the ratio of noninterest expense to taxable-equivalent net
revenue excluding net securities gains or losses) was
45.3 percent in 2004, compared with 45.6 percent
in 2003.

The provision for credit losses was
$669.6 million for 2004, compared with
$1,254.0 million for 2003, a decrease of
$584.4 million (46.6 percent). The decrease in the
provision for credit losses reflected improving credit quality
and economic conditions relative to 2003. Net charge-offs during
2004 were $767.1 million, compared with net charge-offs of
$1,251.7 million during 2003, a reduction of
$484.6 million. The decline in net charge-offs was
primarily the result of declining levels of stressed and
nonperforming loans, continuing collection efforts and improving
economic conditions. In response to improving credit conditions,
the Company made a decision in 2004 to reduce the allowance for
credit losses. Refer to “Corporate Risk Profile” for
further information on the provision for credit losses, net
charge-offs, nonperforming assets and factors considered by the
Company in assessing the credit quality of the loan portfolio
and establishing the allowance for credit losses.

Acquisition and Divestiture Activity

On December 31, 2003, the Company
announced that it had completed the tax-free distribution of
Piper Jaffray Companies representing substantially all of the
Company’s capital markets business line. The Company
distributed to our shareholders one share of Piper Jaffray
common stock for every 100 shares of U.S. Bancorp
common stock, by means of a special dividend of
$685 million. This distribution did not include brokerage,
financial advisory or asset management services offered to
customers through other business units. The Company continues to
provide asset management services to its customers through the
Private Client, Trust and Asset Management business segment and
access to investment products and services through its extensive
network of licensed financial advisors within the retail
brokerage platform of the Consumer Banking business segment. In
connection with the spin-off of Piper Jaffray, historical
financial results related to Piper Jaffray have been segregated
and accounted for in the Company’s financial statements as
discontinued operations.

On June 29, 2004, the Company purchased the
remaining 50 percent ownership interest in EuroConex
Technologies Ltd (“EuroConex”) from the Bank of
Ireland. In addition, during the second and fourth quarters of
2004, the Company completed three separate transactions to
acquire merchant processing businesses in Poland, the United
Kingdom and Norway. In connection with these transactions,
EuroConex and its affiliates provide debit and credit card
processing services to merchants, directly and through alliances
with banking partners in these European markets. These
transactions represented total assets acquired of
$377 million and total liabilities assumed of
$115 million at the closing date. Included in total assets
were contract and other intangibles with a fair value of
$163 million and goodwill of $105 million. The
goodwill reflected the strategic value of these businesses to
the Company’s European merchant processing business and
anticipated economies of scale that will result from these
transactions.

On December 31, 2002, the Company acquired
the corporate trust business of State Street Bank and Trust
Company (“State Street Corporate Trust”) in a cash


U.S. BANCORP


transaction valued at $720 million. State
Street Corporate Trust was a leading provider, particularly in
the Northeast, of corporate trust and agency services to a
variety of municipalities, corporations, government agencies and
other financial institutions serving approximately 20,000 client
issuances representing over $689 billion of assets under
administration. The transaction represented total assets
acquired of $677 million and total liabilities assumed of
$39 million. Included in total assets were contract and
other intangibles with a fair value of $218 million and
goodwill of $520 million. The goodwill reflected the
strategic value of the combined organization’s leadership
position in the corporate trust business and processing
economies of scale resulting from the transaction.

On November 1, 2002, the Company acquired
57 branches and a related operations facility in northern
California from Bay View Bank (“Bay View”), a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Bay View Capital Corporation, in a
cash transaction. The transaction represented total assets
acquired of $853 million and total liabilities assumed
(primarily retail and small business deposits) of
$3.3 billion. Included in total assets were approximately
$336 million of select loans primarily with depository
relationships, core deposit intangibles of $56 million and
goodwill of $427 million. The goodwill reflected the
strategic value of expanding the Company’s market within
the San Francisco Bay area.

On April 1, 2002, the Company acquired
Cleveland-based The Leader Mortgage Company, LLC
(“Leader”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of First
Defiance Financial Corp., in a cash transaction. The transaction
represented total assets acquired of $531 million and total
liabilities assumed of $446 million. Included in total
assets were mortgage servicing rights and other intangibles of
$173 million and goodwill of $18 million. Leader
specializes in acquiring servicing of loans originated for state
and local housing authorities.

STATEMENT OF INCOME ANALYSIS

Net Interest Income

Net interest income, on a
taxable-equivalent basis, was $7.1 billion in 2004,
compared with $7.2 billion in 2003 and $6.8 billion in
2002. The decline in net interest income in 2004 reflected
modest growth in average earning assets, more than offset by
lower net interest margins. Also contributing to the
year-over-year decline in net interest income was a
$37.6 million reduction in loan fees, the result of fewer
loan prepayments in a rising rate environment. Average earning
assets were $168.1 billion for 2004, compared with
$160.8 billion and $147.4 billion for 2003 and 2002,
respectively. The $7.3 billion (4.5 percent) increase
in average earning assets for 2004, compared with 2003, was
primarily driven by increases in residential mortgages, retail
loans and investment securities, partially offset by a decline
in commercial loans and loans held for sale related to mortgage
banking activities. The decline in average commercial loans from
a year ago reflected soft loan demand in 2003 and through the
third quarter of 2004. The Company began to experience growth in
commercial

loans in late 2004 as economic conditions
continued to improve. The net interest margin in 2004 was
4.25 percent, compared with 4.49 percent and
4.65 percent in 2003 and 2002, respectively. The
24 basis point decline in 2004 net interest margin,
compared with 2003, primarily reflected the competitive credit
pricing environment, a preference to acquire adjustable-rate
securities which have lower yields and a decline in prepayment
fees. The net interest margin was also impacted by a modest
increase in the percent of total earning assets funded by
wholesale sources of funding and higher rates paid on wholesale
funding due to the impact of rising rates. The shift towards
wholesale funding reflects, in part, slower growth in deposits
as growth in mortgage banking escrows and government-related
deposits declined. It also reflects asset/liability decisions to
issue longer-term fixed-rate borrowings given the rising rate
environment. In addition, the net interest margin declined
year-over-year as a result of consolidating high credit quality,
low margin loans from the Stellar commercial loan conduit onto
the Company’s balance sheet beginning in the third quarter
of 2003.

Total average loans of $122.1 billion in
2004 were $3.8 billion (3.2 percent) higher, compared
with 2003, reflecting growth in average residential mortgages,
average retail loans and average commercial real estate loans of
$2.6 billion (22.5 percent), $3.0 billion
(7.9 percent) and $.1 billion (.5 percent),
respectively. Growth in these categories was offset somewhat by
an overall decline in average commercial loans of
$2.0 billion (4.8 percent). Although the consolidation
of loans from the Stellar commercial loan conduit had a positive
impact on average loan balances year-over-year, excess liquidity
and improving cash flows among corporate borrowers led to the
overall decrease in total commercial loans. The Company began to
experience growth in average commercial loans in the fourth
quarter of 2004.

Average investment securities were
$5.8 billion (15.5 percent) higher in 2004, compared
with 2003, reflecting the reinvestment of proceeds from
declining average commercial loan balances and loans held for
sale. The Company utilizes the investment portfolio as part of
its overall asset/liability management practices to minimize
structural interest rate and market valuation risks associated
with changes in interest rates. During 2004, the Company
received proceeds from prepayments and maturities of investment
securities of $12.3 billion. Also, the Company made a
decision to sell $8.2 billion of fixed-rate securities,
classified as available-for-sale, as part of interest rate risk
management actions given changes in rates during the year,
recognizing a $104.9 million loss on the sale of securities.

    changes in the mix of assets and liabilities. The change in
    interest not solely due to changes in volume or rates has been
    allocated on a pro-rata basis to volume and
    yield/rate.


U.S. BANCORP


Given the soft commercial loan demand in early
2004, the Company acquired $19.6 billion of investment
securities, representing principally adjustable and shorter-term
fixed-rate mortgage-backed securities, giving consideration to
the Company’s overall asset/liability position. Refer to
the “Interest Rate Risk Management” section for
further information on the sensitivity of net interest income to
changes in interest rates.

Average noninterest-bearing deposits of
$29.8 billion in 2004 were lower by $1.9 billion
(6.0 percent), compared with 2003. While average
branch-based noninterest-bearing deposits increased by
2.7 percent from a year ago, mortgage-related escrow
balances and business-related noninterest-bearing deposits,
including corporate banking, mortgage banking and government
deposits, declined. Average interest-bearing deposits of
$86.4 billion in 2004 were higher by $1.6 billion
(1.8 percent), compared with 2003. The year-over-year
increase in average interest-bearing deposits included increases
in average savings products deposits of $2.6 billion
(4.6 percent) and time deposits greater than $100,000 of
$1.4 billion (11.0 percent), partially offset by a
decrease in time certificates of deposit less than $100,000 of
$2.4 billion (15.6 percent). The decrease in time
certificates of deposit less than $100,000 was primarily due to
pricing decisions by management in connection with the
Company’s overall funding and risk management activities.

Average net free funds increased $.3 billion
from a year ago, including a decrease in average
noninterest-bearing deposits, other liabilities and other assets
of $1.9 billion (6.0 percent), $1.3 billion
(16.7 percent) and $3.1 billion (10.5 percent),
respectively, in 2004, compared with 2003. The decrease in other
assets and liabilities principally reflects the impact of the
spin-off of Piper Jaffray Companies.

The increase in net interest income in 2003,
compared with 2002, was driven by an increase in average earning
assets, growth in average net free funds and favorable changes
in the Company’s average funding mix. Also contributing to
the year-over-year increase in net interest income were various
acquisitions, including Leader, State Street Corporate Trust and
Bay View, which accounted for approximately $71.9 million
of the increase during 2003. Average earning assets were
$160.8 billion for 2003, compared with $147.4 billion
for 2002. The $13.4 billion (9.1 percent) increase in
average earning assets for 2003, compared with 2002, was
primarily driven by increases in investment securities, loans
held for sale, residential mortgages and retail loans, partially
offset by a decline in commercial loans. The 16 basis point
decline in 2003 net interest margin, compared with 2002,
primarily reflected growth in lower-yielding investment
securities as a percent of total earning assets, changes in loan
mix and a decline in the margin benefit from net free funds due
to lower average interest rates. In addition, the net interest
margin declined year-over-year as a result of consolidating high
credit quality, low margin loans from Stellar, a commercial loan
conduit, onto the Company’s balance sheet in the third
quarter of 2003. The $3.9 billion (3.4 percent)
increase in total average loans for 2003, compared with 2002,
reflected growth in average residential mortgages, retail loans
and commercial real estate loans of $3.3 billion
(39.0 percent), $1.7 billion (4.6 percent) and
$1.4 billion (5.5 percent), respectively, offset
somewhat by an overall decline in average commercial loans of
$2.5 billion (5.7 percent). Average investment
securities were $8.4 billion (29.2 percent) higher in
2003, compared with 2002, reflecting the reinvestment of
proceeds from loan sales, declining commercial loan balances and
deposits assumed in connection with the Bay View transaction.
Average interest-bearing deposits of $84.8 billion in 2003
were higher by $8.4 billion (11.0 percent), compared
with 2002. Approximately $3.0 billion of the year-over-year
increase in average interest-bearing deposits was due to
acquisitions, while the remaining growth was driven by increases
in savings balances. The increase in savings balances reflected
product initiatives, increasing government banking deposits and
customer decisions to maintain liquidity. Average net free funds
increased $3.1 billion from the prior year, including an
increase in average noninterest-bearing deposits of
$3.0 billion (10.4 percent) in 2003, compared with
2002. The increase in noninterest-bearing deposits was primarily
due to mortgage banking activities during early 2003 and higher
liquidity among corporate customers maintained in demand deposit
balances year-over-year.

Provision for Credit Losses

The provision for credit losses is
recorded to bring the allowance for credit losses to a level
deemed appropriate by management based on factors discussed in
the “Analysis and Determination of Allowance for Credit
Losses” section. The provision for credit losses was
$669.6 million in 2004, compared with $1,254.0 million
and $1,349.0 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively.

The decline in the provision for credit losses of
$584.4 million in 2004 reflected continuing improvement in
the credit quality of the loan portfolio and changing economic
conditions. The changes in credit quality continued to be
broad-based across most industries resulting in improving credit
risk ratings, a decline in nonperforming assets and lower total
net charge-offs. While general economic conditions improved
somewhat in 2003, commercial loan demand continued to be soft in
most markets within the banking footprint during much of 2004.
In the fourth quarter of 2004, the Company began to experience
growth in commercial loans, indicating that

U.S. BANCORP



economic conditions within the Company’s
markets were expanding. In response to improving credit
performance and economic conditions, the Company made a decision
to reduce the allowance for credit losses.

The decline in the provision for credit losses of
$95.0 million in 2003 primarily reflected an improving
credit risk profile resulting in lower nonperforming loans and
commercial and retail loan losses. The decline in nonperforming
loans and commercial loan net charge-offs was broad-based across
most industries within the commercial loan portfolio. Retail
loan delinquency ratios continued to improve across most retail
loan portfolios, reflecting improving economic conditions and
the Company’s ongoing collection efforts and risk
management activities. These were also the principal factors
resulting in lower levels of retail net charge-offs during 2003.

Refer to “Corporate Risk Profile” for
further information on the provision for credit losses, net
charge-offs, nonperforming assets and other factors considered
by the Company in assessing the credit quality of the loan
portfolio and establishing the allowance for credit losses.

Noninterest Income

Noninterest income in 2004 was
$5.5 billion, compared with $5.3 billion in 2003 and
$5.2 billion in 2002. The increase in noninterest income of
$206.2 million (3.9 percent) in 2004, compared with
2003, was driven by strong organic growth in most fee-based
products and services categories (11.0 percent),
particularly in payment processing revenue. Partially offsetting
the increase in fee-based revenue growth in 2004 was a
year-over-year reduction in net securities gains (losses) of
$349.7 million.

Credit and debit card revenue, corporate payment
products revenue and ATM processing services revenue were higher
in 2004, compared with 2003, by $88.6 million
(15.8 percent), $45.5 million (12.6 percent) and
$9.4 million (5.7 percent), respectively. Although
credit and debit card revenue increased year-over-year, the
growth was somewhat muted due to the impact of the settlement of
the antitrust litigation brought against VISA USA and MasterCard
by Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., Sears Roebuck & Co. and other
retailers, which lowered interchange rates on signature debit
transactions beginning in August 2003. The year-over-year impact
of VISA’s settlement on debit card revenue for 2004 was
approximately $32.8 million. This change in the interchange
rate, in addition to higher customer loyalty rewards expenses,
however, were more than offset by growth in transaction volumes
and other rate changes. The corporate payment products revenue
growth reflected growth in sales, card usage and rate changes.
The favorable variance in ATM processing services revenue was
also due to increases in transaction volumes and sales. Merchant
processing services revenue was higher in 2004 by
$113.2 million (20.2 percent), compared with 2003,
reflecting an increase in same store sales volume, new business
and the recent expansion of the Company’s merchant
acquiring business in Europe. These recent European acquisitions
accounted for approximately $58.6 million of the total
increase. Deposit service charges increased in 2004 by
$90.6 million (12.7 percent), primarily due to account
growth, revenue enhancement initiatives and transaction-related
fees. Trust and investment management fees increased by
$27.3 million (2.9 percent), compared with 2003, as
gains from equity market valuations were partially offset by
lower fees, partially due to a change in mix of fund balances
and customers’ migration from money market mutual funds to
interest-bearing deposits with marginally better pricing.
Treasury management fees were relatively flat from a year ago.
Increased fees driven by a change in the Federal
government’s payment methodology for treasury management
services to fees for services rather than maintaining
compensating balances in the third quarter of 2003 were offset
by higher interest earnings credit on customers’
compensating balances and the impact of an

industry-wide shift of payments from paper-based
to electronic and card-based transactions. During 2004,
commercial products revenue increased $31.7 million
(7.9 percent), primarily due to syndication fees and
commercial leasing revenue. An increase in loan servicing
revenues from a year ago contributed to an increase of
$30.2 million (8.2 percent) in mortgage banking
revenue during 2004. The growth in mortgage servicing revenues
was offset somewhat by lower gains from the sale of mortgage
loan production. Investment products fees and commissions
revenue increased in 2004 by $11.1 million
(7.7 percent), compared with 2003, primarily due to higher
sales activity in the Consumer Banking business line. The
increase in sales activities reflected improving equity market
conditions in late 2003 and 2004. Other noninterest income
increased by $107.9 million (29.1 percent) from 2003,
principally due to improving retail lease residual values
resulting in lower end-of-term residual losses, a residual value
insurance recovery of $17.2 million during the third
quarter of 2004 and improving equity investment valuations.

In 2003, noninterest income increased
$102.3 million (2.0 percent), compared with 2002,
driven by strong growth in payment services revenue, trust and
investment management fees, deposit service charges, treasury
management fees, mortgage banking revenue and investment
products fees and commissions attributable to both organic
growth and acquisitions. Partially offsetting the increase in
noninterest income in 2003 was a year-over-year decrease in net
securities gains of $55.1 million. The favorable impact on
noninterest income from acquisitions, which included Leader, Bay
View and State Street Corporate Trust, was approximately
$122.7 million during 2003. Credit and debit card revenue,
corporate payment products revenue and ATM processing services
revenue were higher in 2003, compared with 2002, by
$43.7 million (8.5 percent), $35.6 million
(10.9 percent) and $5.3 million (3.3 percent),
respectively. Credit and debit card revenue growth in 2003 was
somewhat muted ($19.4 million) due to the impact of the
settlement of the antitrust litigation brought against VISA USA
and MasterCard by Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., Sears
Roebuck & Co. and other retailers beginning in August
2003. This change in the interchange rate in the third quarter
of 2003, in addition to higher customer loyalty rewards
expenses, however, were more than offset by increases in
transaction volumes and other pricing enhancements. Corporate
payment products revenue and ATM processing services revenue
were higher in 2003, primarily reflecting growth in sales and
card usage during the year. Merchant processing services revenue
was lower in 2003 by $5.9 million (1.0 percent),
compared with 2002, primarily due to lower processing spreads
resulting from pricing changes that occurred in late 2002 and
changes in the mix of merchants. The favorable variance in trust
and investment management fees in 2003 of $61.8 million
(6.9 percent), compared with 2002, was driven by the
acquisition of State Street Corporate Trust, which contributed
$83.7 million in fees during 2003. Treasury management fees
grew by $49.4 million (11.8 percent) in 2003, compared
with 2002, with the majority of the increase occurring within
the Wholesale Banking line of business. The increase in treasury
management fees during 2003 was driven by growth in product
sales, pricing enhancements and the relatively low earnings
credit rates to customers. The growth was also driven by a
change in the Federal government’s payment methodology for
treasury management services from compensating balances,
reflected in net interest income, to fees during the third
quarter of 2003. During 2003, commercial products revenue
declined $78.7 million (16.4 percent), principally
reflecting lower commercial loan conduit servicing fees
resulting, in part, from consolidating the Stellar commercial
loan conduit. Mortgage banking revenue had a year-over-year
increase of $36.9 million (11.2 percent) during 2003,
principally due to higher mortgage originations, servicing and
secondary market sales and the acquisition of Leader, which
contributed $16.5 million of the favorable variance in
2003. Investment products fees and commissions revenue increased
in 2003 by $12.2 million (9.2 percent), compared with
2002, primarily due to increased retail brokerage activity given
more favorable equity capital market conditions relative to
2002. Deposit service charges increased in 2003 by
$25.5 million (3.7 percent), compared with 2002,
primarily due to net new growth in checking accounts and fee
enhancements principally within the Consumer Banking line of
business. Other noninterest income decreased by
$28.4 million (7.1 percent) from 2002, which included
$67.4 million of gains on the sales of two co-branded
credit card portfolios.

Noninterest Expense

Noninterest expense in 2004 was
$5.8 billion, compared with $5.6 billion and
$5.7 billion in 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase
of $187.6 million (3.4 percent) in 2004, compared with
2003, principally reflected a $154.8 million charge related
to the prepayment of a portion of the Company’s long-term
debt, costs related to business initiatives and incremental
expenses of $62.8 million due to the expansion of
EuroConex. These increases were offset somewhat by a net
reduction in MSR impairments of $151.9 million and lower
merger and restructuring-related charges. In 2003, noninterest
expense included $46.2 million of merger and
restructuring-related costs related to acquisitions completed in
prior years. Compensation expense increased in 2004, compared
with 2003, due to increases in salaries and stock-based
compensation. The increase in salaries reflected business

U.S. BANCORP



expansion of in-store branches, the expansion of
the Company’s merchant acquiring business in Europe and
other initiatives. Stock-based compensation was higher due to
lower employee stock-award forfeitures relative to prior years.
Employee benefits increased primarily as a result of higher
payroll taxes and pension expense; pension and retirement
expense increased $34.6 million in 2004, principally
reflecting recognition of actuarial losses resulting from lower
expected returns in prior years. Marketing and business
development increased $13.2 million in 2004, compared with
2003, related to corporate brand advertising and an increase in
product marketing campaigns. Technology and communications
expense was higher year-over-year by $12.2 million in 2004,
compared with 2003, reflecting technology investments that
increased software amortization and the write-off of capitalized
software being replaced. Included in 2004 results were charges
of $154.8 million related to the prepayment of a portion of
the Company’s long-term debt. Other expense increased
$54.1 million in 2004, compared with 2003. The increase was
related to higher fraud and operating losses, insurance costs,
operating costs associated with affordable housing investments
and merchant processing costs for payment services products, the
result of the EuroConex expansion and increases in transaction
volume year-over-year.

The decrease in noninterest expense in 2003,
compared with 2002, of $143.6 million (2.5 percent)
was primarily the result of business initiatives, cost savings
from integration activities and lower merger and
restructuring-related charges, partially offset by an increase
in MSR impairments, incremental pension and retirement expense
of $39.9 million and expenses related to acquisitions.
Noninterest expense related to merger and restructuring-related
charges declined by $275.0 million (85.6 percent) in
2003, compared with 2002. The decline in merger and
restructuring-related charges was primarily due to the
completion of integration activities in 2002 associated with the
merger of Firstar and the former U.S. Bancorp of
Minneapolis (“USBM”). During 2003, noninterest expense
included an MSR impairment of $208.7 million, a net
increase of $22.6 million, compared with 2002. The
year-over-year changes in the valuation of MSRs were caused by
fluctuations in mortgage interest rates and related prepayment
speeds due to refinancing activities. Acquisitions in 2002,
including Leader, Bay View and State Street Corporate Trust,
accounted for an increase of $124.9 million in noninterest
expense from 2002 to 2003.

Pension Plans

Because of the long-term nature of
pension plans, the administration and accounting for pensions is
complex and can be impacted by several factors, including
investment and funding policies, accounting methods and the
plan’s actuarial assumptions. The Company and its
Compensation Committee have an established process for
evaluating the plans, their performance and significant plan
assumptions, including the assumed discount rate and the
long-term rate of return (“LTROR”). At least annually,
an independent consultant is engaged to assist
U.S. Bancorp’s Compensation Committee in evaluating
plan objectives, funding policies and investment policies
considering its long-term investment time horizon and asset
allocation strategies. Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements provides further information on funding
practices, investment policies and asset allocation strategies.

Periodic pension expense (or credits) includes
service costs, interest costs based on the assumed discount
rate, the expected return on plan assets based on an actuarially
derived market-related value and amortization of actuarial gains
and losses. The Company’s pension accounting policy follows
guidance outlined in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 87, “Employer’s Accounting for Pension
Plans” (“SFAS 87”), and reflects the
long-term nature of benefit obligations and the investment
horizon of

Table 5

plan assets. This accounting guidance has the
effect of reducing earnings volatility related to short-term
changes in interest rates and market valuations. Actuarial gains
and losses include the impact of plan amendments and various
unrecognized gains and losses which are deferred and amortized
over the future service periods of active employees. The
market-related value utilized to determine the expected return
on plan assets is based on fair value adjusted for the
difference between expected returns and actual performance of
plan assets. The unrealized difference between actual experience
and expected returns is included in the market-related value
ratably over a five-year period. At September 30, 2004, the
accumulated unrecognized loss approximated $139 million and
will ratably impact the actuarially derived market-related value
of plan assets through 2009. The impact to pension expense of
the unrecognized asset gains or losses will incrementally
increase (decrease) pension costs in each year from 2005 to
2009, by approximately $28.9 million, $39.4 million,
$6.3 million, $(11.4) million and $(4.1) million,
respectively. This assumes that the performance of plan assets
equals the assumed LTROR. Actual results will vary depending on
the performance of plan assets and changes to assumptions
required in the future. Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the
Company’s accounting policies for pension plans.

In 2004, the Company recognized a pension cost of
$9.0 million compared with pension credits of
$23.9 million in 2003 and $63.8 million in 2002. The
$32.9 million increase in pension costs in 2004 was driven
by a recognition of deferred actuarial (gains) losses and the
impact of a lower discount rate, partially offset by the benefit
of higher investment income related to the pension contributions
made in 2003. In 2003, pension costs increased by
$39.9 million, compared with 2002, driven by a
$46.4 million reduction in the expected return on assets
and a lower discount rate utilized to determine the projected
benefit obligation given the declining rate environment. Also,
contributing to the increase in pension costs was a one-time
curtailment gain in 2002 of $9.0 million related to a
nonqualified pension plan compared with a settlement loss of
$3.5 million related to nonqualified pension payments in
2003. Somewhat offsetting the increase in pension costs was an
expected benefit of approximately $19.0 million associated
with lower interest costs related to cash balance accounts and
actual changes in employment demographics, such as retirement
age.

In 2005, the Company anticipates that pension
costs will increase by approximately $23.5 million. The
increase will be driven by the lower discount rate and
amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses from prior years.

Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements provides a summary of the significant
pension plan assumptions. Because of the subjective nature of
plan assumptions, a sensitivity analysis to hypothetical changes
in the LTROR and the discount rate is provided below:

Due to the complexity of forecasting pension plan
activities, the accounting method utilized for pension plans,
management’s ability to respond to factors impacting the
plans and the hypothetical nature of this information, the
actual changes in periodic pension costs could be significantly
different than the information provided in the sensitivity
analysis.

Income Tax Expense

The provision for income taxes was
$2,009.6 million (an effective rate of 32.5 percent)
in 2004, compared with $1,941.3 million (an effective rate
of 34.4 percent) in 2003 and $1,707.5 million (an
effective rate of 34.6 percent) in 2002. The improvement in
the effective tax rate in 2004, compared with 2003, was
primarily due to changes in estimated tax liabilities of
$90.0 million related to the resolution of federal tax
examinations covering substantially all of the Company’s
legal entities for the years 1995 through 1999 and
$16.3 million related to the resolution of a state tax
examination for tax years through 2000. The improvement in the
effective tax rate in 2003, compared with 2002, was primarily
driven by a change in unitary state tax apportionment factors
driven by a shift in business mix as a result of the impact of
acquisitions, market demographics, the mix of product revenue
and an increase in federal and state tax credits.

For further information on income taxes, refer to
Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS

Average earning assets were $168.1 billion
in 2004, compared with $160.8 billion in 2003. The increase
in average earning assets of $7.3 billion
(4.5 percent) was primarily driven by growth in residential
mortgages, retail loans and investment securities, partially
offset by a decline in commercial loans and loans held for sale
related to mortgage banking activities. The increase in average
earning assets was principally funded by increases of
$1.6 billion in interest-bearing deposits and
$5.5 billion in wholesale funding.

For average balance information, refer to
Consolidated Daily Average Balance Sheet and Related Yields and
Rates on pages 112 and 113.

Loans

The
Company’s total loan portfolio was $126.3 billion at
December 31, 2004, an increase of $8.1 billion
(6.8 percent) from December 31, 2003. The increase in
total loans was driven by strong growth in retail loans
(10.7 percent) and residential mortgages
(14.2 percent) and to a lesser extent by commercial loans
(4.3 percent) and commercial real estate loans
(1.3 percent). The increase in retail loans was across most
loan categories while the increase in residential mortgages was
primarily the result of asset/liability management decisions to
retain a greater portion of the Company’s adjustable-rate
loan production. Table 6 provides a summary of the loan
distribution by product type. Table 8 provides a summary of
selected loan maturity distribution by loan category. Average
total loans increased $3.8 billion (3.2 percent) in
2004, compared with 2003. Growth in average retail loans and
residential mortgages, compared to 2003, was partially offset by
a decline in average commercial loans.

Commercial

Commercial loans, including lease
financing, totaled $40.2 billion at December 31, 2004,
compared with $38.5 billion at December 31, 2003, an
increase of

$1.6 billion (4.3 percent). The
increase in commercial loans was driven by new customer
relationships, increases in

corporate card balances and to a lesser extent,
increased utilization under lines of credit by commercial
customers. The growth of corporate and industrial and corporate
card loan categories was tempered somewhat by lower mortgage
loans held for sale from a year ago due to declining mortgage
banking volume. Although general economic conditions experienced
some improvement in 2003, commercial loan demand continued to be
soft in the Company’s markets throughout the first half of
2004. As a result, average commercial loans in 2004 decreased by
$2.0 billion (4.8 percent) from 2003, despite the
positive impact on average balances from the consolidation of
loans from the Stellar commercial loan conduit in the third

quarter of 2003. Commercial loans began to
display encouraging trends in the Company’s markets during
the fourth quarter of 2004 with quarterly average commercial
loan balances increasing for the first time since the second
quarter of 2001.

Table 7 provides a summary of commercial loans by
industry and geographical locations.

Commercial Real Estate

The Company’s portfolio of
commercial real estate loans, which includes commercial
mortgages and construction loans, was $27.6 billion at
December 31, 2004, compared with $27.2 billion at
December 31, 2003, a modest increase of $343 million
(1.3 percent). Specifically, construction and development
loans increased by $652 million (9.9 percent) as
developers continued to take advantage of relatively low
interest rates. Commercial mortgages outstanding decreased
modestly by $309 million (1.5 percent) as growth in
Small Business Administration (“SBA”) real estate
mortgages was more than offset by reductions in traditional
commercial real estate mortgages. Average commercial real estate
loans increased by $125 million (.5 percent) in 2004,
compared with 2003, primarily driven by growth in SBA commercial
real estate mortgage loans. Table 9 provides a summary of
commercial real estate by property type and geographical
locations.

The Company maintains the real estate
construction designation until the completion of the
construction phase and, if retained, the loan is reclassified to
the commercial mortgage category. Approximately
$638 million of construction loans were permanently
financed and reclassified to the commercial mortgage loan
category in 2004. At year-end 2004, $202 million of
tax-exempt industrial development loans were secured by real
estate. The Company’s commercial real estate mortgages and
construction loans had unfunded commitments of $7.9 billion
at December 31, 2004, compared with $7.3 billion at
December 31, 2003. The Company also finances the operations
of real estate developers and other entities with operations
related to real estate. These loans are not secured directly by
real estate and are subject to terms and conditions similar to
commercial loans. These loans were included in the commercial
loan category and totaled $1.1 billion at December 31,
2004.

Residential Mortgages

Residential mortgages held in the loan
portfolio were $15.4 billion at December 31, 2004, an
increase of $1.9 billion (14.2 percent) from
December 31,

Table 9

2003. The increase in residential mortgages was
primarily the result of asset/liability risk management
decisions to retain a greater portion of the Company’s
adjustable-rate loan production. This growth was partially
offset by approximately $.5 billion in residential loan
sales during 2004 primarily representing fixed-rate mortgage
loans. Average residential mortgages increased $2.6 billion
(22.5 percent) to $14.3 billion in 2004, primarily due
to retaining adjustable-rate residential mortgages throughout
2004 and growth in first-lien home equity loans of
20.0 percent.

Retail

Total retail
loans outstanding, which include credit card, retail leasing,
home equity and second mortgages and other retail loans, were
$43.2 billion at December 31, 2004, compared with
$39.0 billion at December 31, 2003. The increase of
$4.2 billion (10.7 percent) was driven by an increase
in home equity lines of credit, credit cards, retail leasing,
automobile loans and installment loans, which increased
$2,275 million, $670 million, $1,137 million,
$254 million and $387 million, respectively, during
2004. The increases in these loan categories were offset
somewhat by a reduction in home equity loans of
$634 million during the year. Average retail loans
increased $3.0 billion (7.9 percent) to
$41.2 billion in 2004, reflecting growth in home equity
lines, retail leasing, installment loans and credit card. Of the
total retail loans and residential mortgages outstanding,
approximately 87.4 percent are to customers located in the
Company’s primary banking regions.

Loans Held for Sale

At December 31, 2004, loans held
for sale, consisting of residential mortgages to be sold in the
secondary market, were $1.4 billion. This asset category
was essentially unchanged relative to loans held for sale at
December 31, 2003, despite $4.4 billion of mortgage
loan production during the fourth quarter of 2004, compared with
$3.9 billion in fourth quarter 2003. Average loans held for
sale declined to $1.6 billion in 2004, compared with
$3.6 billion in 2003, due to the impact of rising interest
rates on mortgage loan production.

Investment Securities

The Company uses its investment
securities portfolio for several purposes. It serves as a
vehicle to manage interest rate and prepayment risk, generates
interest and dividend income from the investment of excess funds
depending on loan demand, provides liquidity and is used as
collateral for public deposits and wholesale funding sources.
While it is the Company’s intent to hold its investment
securities indefinitely, the Company may take actions in
response to structural changes in interest rate risks and to
meet liquidity requirements.

At December 31, 2004, investment securities,
both available-for-sale and held-to-maturity, totaled
$41.5 billion, compared with $43.3 billion at
December 31, 2003. The $1.9 billion (4.3 percent)
year-over-year decrease primarily reflected the sale of
$8.2 billion of fixed-rate investment securities, along
with maturities and prepayments of $12.3 billion, partially
offset by purchases of $19.6 billion of securities.
Investment securities purchases were principally adjustable and
shorter-term fixed-rate mortgage-backed securities, giving
consideration to the Company’s overall asset/liability
position, actual and projected changes in the mix and
characteristics of the balance sheet and in interest rates. At
December 31, 2004, approximately 38.9 percent of the
investment securities portfolio represented adjustable-rate
financial instruments, compared with 22.2 percent as of
December 31, 2003. Adjustable-rate financial instruments
include variable-rate collateralized mortgage obligations,
mortgage-backed securities, agency securities, adjustable-rate
money market accounts and asset-backed securities. Average
investment securities were $43.0 billion in 2004, compared
with $37.2 billion in 2003. The increase principally
reflects the timing of securities transactions in early 2004 as
proceeds from loan repayments and deposit growth were reinvested
in this asset category.

The weighted-average yield of the
available-for-sale portfolio was 4.43 percent at
December 31, 2004, compared with 4.27 percent at
December 31, 2003. The average maturity of the
available-for-sale portfolio declined to 4.5 years at
December 31, 2004, down from 5.1 years at
December 31, 2003. The relative mix of the type of
investment securities maintained in the portfolio is provided in
Table 10. At December 31, 2004, the available-for-sale
portfolio included a $271 million net unrealized loss,
compared with a net unrealized loss of $259 million at
December 31, 2003.

Deposits

Total
deposits were $120.7 billion at December 31, 2004, an
increase of $1.7 billion (1.4 percent) from
December 31, 2003. The increase in total deposits was
primarily the result of an increase in time deposits greater
than $100,000, partially offset by decreases in
noninterest-bearing deposits, savings deposits and time
certificates of deposit less than $100,000. Average total
deposits were $116.2 billion in 2004, declining
$331 million from $116.6 billion in 2003. The decline
in average total deposits was primarily due to lower average
noninterest-bearing deposits and time certificates of deposit
less than $100,000. The reductions in these categories were
offset somewhat by growth in average savings deposits and time
deposits greater than $100,000.

Noninterest-bearing deposits were
$30.8 billion at December 31, 2004, compared with
$32.5 billion at December 31, 2003, a decrease of
$1.7 billion (5.3 percent). The decrease in
noninterest-bearing deposits was primarily attributable to
declining deposits related to corporate business deposits,
mortgage banking businesses and

U.S. BANCORP



government banking deposits in the Wholesale
Banking business line relative to a year ago. The decline also
included certain product changes to migrate high-value customers
with balances of $1.3 billion to the Company’s Silver
Elite interest checking product to further enhance

customer retention. Corporate business deposits
are declining as business customers utilize their deposit
liquidity to fund business growth. Mortgage banking activities
continue to decline directly related to the upward movement in
interest rates since mid-2003. Government banking deposits have
also declined. Average noninterest-bearing deposits were
$29.8 billion in 2004, a decrease of $1.9 billion
(6.0 percent), compared with 2003. While average
branch-based noninterest-bearing deposits increased
2.7 percent from a year ago, business-related
noninterest-bearing deposits, including government, corporate
banking and mortgage banking deposits, and mortgage-related
escrow balances declined.

Interest-bearing savings deposits totaled
$59.4 billion at December 31, 2004, a decrease of
$1.7 billion (2.7 percent)

from December 31, 2003. The decrease in
interest-bearing savings deposits was primarily due to decreases
in money market accounts of $3.5 billion
(10.4 percent), partially offset by an increase of
$1.8 billion (8.3 percent) in interest checking. The
increase in interest checking reflects the migration of
noninterest-bearing deposits to the Silver Elite interest
checking product. The decrease in money market savings account
balances, in part, reflects pricing decisions by the Company
given the profitability of certain business accounts and modest
commercial loan growth and business customer decisions to
utilize deposit liquidity during 2004. A portion of money market
balances migrated to time deposits greater than $100,000 as
interest rates increased for these products. Average
interest-bearing savings deposits were $59.7 billion in
2004, an increase of $2.6 billion (4.6 percent),
compared with 2003. The increase in average interest-bearing
savings deposits from 2003 to 2004 was primarily driven by
increases in interest checking of $1.8 billion
(9.6 percent), along with increases in money market
accounts of $.5 billion (1.7 percent) and savings
accounts of $.3 billion (4.5 percent).

Interest-bearing time deposits were
$30.6 billion at December 31, 2004, compared with
$25.5 billion at December 31, 2003, an increase of
$5.1 billion (19.9 percent). The increase in
interest-bearing time deposits was driven by an increase of
$6.2 billion (52.5 percent) in time deposits greater
than $100,000, partially offset by a decrease in the higher cost
time certificates of deposits less than $100,000 of
$1.1 billion (8.4 percent). Changes in these deposit
categories were principally due to pricing decisions based on
the relative cost of funding. Time certificates of deposit less
than $100,000 were essentially unchanged in the fourth quarter
and represent a source of fixed-rate funding in a rising rate
environment. Average time deposits greater than $100,000
increased $1.4 billion (11.0 percent) and average time
certificates of deposit less than $100,000 declined
$2.4 billion (15.6 percent) during 2004. Time deposits
greater than $100,000 are largely viewed as purchased funds and
are managed to levels deemed appropriate given alternative
funding sources.

Borrowings

The
Company utilizes both short-term and long-term borrowings to
fund growth of earning assets in excess of deposit growth.
Short-term borrowings, which include federal funds purchased,
securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other
short-term borrowings, were $13.1 billion at
December 31, 2004, compared with $10.9 billion at
December 31, 2003. Short-term funding is managed to levels
deemed appropriate given alternative funding sources. The
increase of $2.2 billion in short-term borrowings reflected
wholesale funding associated with the Company’s earning
asset growth.

Long-term debt was $34.7 billion at
December 31, 2004, compared with $33.8 billion at
December 31, 2003, an increase of $.9 billion. The
increase in long-term debt

was primarily driven by the issuance of
$12.2 billion of bank notes and $1.0 billion of
subordinated notes, partially offset by maturities of
$8.0 billion and prepayments of $4.7 billion of
Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) advances. The
prepayments of FHLB advances during the first and fourth
quarters of 2004 and the issuance of predominantly fixed-rate
funding were principally done in connection with asset/liability
management activities. Refer to Note 15 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information
regarding long-term debt and the “Liquidity Risk
Management” section for discussion of liquidity management
of the Company.

CORPORATE RISK PROFILE

Overview

Managing
risks is an essential part of successfully operating a financial
services company. The most prominent risk exposures are credit,
residual, operational, interest rate, market and liquidity risk.
Credit risk is the risk of not collecting the interest and/or
the principal balance of a loan or investment when it is due.
Residual risk is the potential reduction in the end-of-term
value of leased assets or the residual cash flows related to
asset securitization and other off-balance sheet structures.
Operational risk includes risks related to fraud, legal and
compliance risk, processing errors, technology, breaches of
internal controls and business continuation and disaster
recovery risk. Interest rate risk is the potential reduction of
net interest income as a result of changes in interest rates.
Rate movements can affect the repricing of assets and
liabilities differently, as well as their market value. Market
risk arises from fluctuations in interest rates, foreign
exchange rates, and equity prices that may result in changes in
the values of financial instruments, such as trading and
available-for-sale securities that are accounted for on a
mark-to-market basis. Liquidity risk is the possible inability
to fund obligations to depositors, investors or borrowers. In
addition, corporate strategic decisions, as well as the risks
described above, could give rise to reputation risk. Reputation
risk is the risk that negative publicity or press, whether true
or not, could result in costly litigation or cause a decline in
the Company’s stock value, customer base or revenue.

Credit Risk Management

The Company’s strategy for credit
risk management includes well-defined, centralized credit
policies, uniform underwriting criteria, and ongoing risk
monitoring and review processes for all commercial and consumer
credit exposures. The strategy also emphasizes diversification
on a geographic, industry and customer level, regular credit
examinations and management reviews of loans experiencing
deterioration of credit quality. The credit risk management
strategy also includes a credit risk assessment process,
independent of business line managers, that performs assessments
of compliance with commercial and consumer credit policies, risk
ratings, and other critical credit information. The Company
strives to identify potential problem loans early, take any
necessary charge-offs promptly and maintain adequate reserve
levels for probable loan losses inherent in the portfolio.
Commercial banking operations rely on a strong credit culture
that combines prudent credit policies and individual lender
accountability. Lenders are assigned lending grades based on
their level of experience and customer service requirements.
Lending grades represent the level of approval authority for the
amount of credit exposure and level of risk. Credit officers
reporting to an independent credit administration function have
higher levels of lending grades and support the business units
in their credit decision process. Loan decisions are documented
as to the borrower’s business, purpose of the loan,
evaluation of the repayment source and the associated risks,
evaluation of collateral, covenants and monitoring requirements,
and risk rating rationale. The Company utilizes a credit risk
rating system to measure the credit quality of individual
commercial loan transactions. The Company uses the risk rating
system for regulatory reporting, determining the frequency of
review of the credit exposures, and evaluation and determination
of specific allowance for commercial credit losses. The Company
regularly forecasts potential changes in risk ratings,
nonperforming status and potential for loss and the estimated
impact on the allowance for credit losses. In the Company’s
retail banking operations, standard credit scoring systems are
used to assess credit risks of consumer, small business and
small-ticket leasing customers and to price consumer products
accordingly. The Company conducts the underwriting and
collections of its retail products in loan underwriting and
servicing centers specializing in certain retail products.
Forecasts of delinquency levels, bankruptcies and losses in
conjunction with projection of estimated losses by delinquency
categories and vintage information are regularly prepared and
are used to evaluate underwriting and collection and determine
the specific allowance for credit losses for these products.
Because business processes and credit risks associated with
unfunded credit commitments are essentially the same as for
loans, the Company utilizes similar processes to estimate its
liability for unfunded credit commitments. The Company also
engages in non-lending activities that may give rise to credit
risk, including interest rate swap and option contracts for
balance sheet hedging purposes, foreign exchange transactions,
deposit overdrafts and interest rate swap contracts for
customers, and settlement risk, including Automated Clearing
House transactions, and the processing of credit card
transactions for merchants. These activities are also subject to
credit review, analysis and approval processes.

Economic Overview

In evaluating its credit risk, the
Company considers changes, if any, in underwriting activities,
the loan portfolio composition (including product mix and
geographic, industry or customer-specific concentrations),
trends in loan performance, the level of allowance coverage
relative to similar banking institutions and macroeconomic
factors. Beginning in 2000, the domestic economy experienced
slower growth. During 2001, corporate earnings weakened and
credit quality indicators among certain industry sectors
deteriorated. The stagnant economic growth was evidenced by the
Federal Reserve Board’s (“FRB”) actions to
stimulate economic growth through a series of interest rate
reductions from mid-2001 through late 2002. In addition, events
of September 11, 2001, had a profound impact on credit
quality due to changes in consumer confidence and related
spending, governmental priorities and business activities. In
response to declining economic conditions, company-specific
portfolio trends, and the Firstar/ USBM merger, the Company
initiated several actions during 2001 including aligning the
risk management practices and charge-off policies of the
companies and restructuring and disposing of certain portfolios
that did not align with the credit risk profile of the combined
company. The Company also implemented accelerated loan workout
strategies for certain commercial credits and increased the
provision for credit losses in 2001.

By the end of 2002, economic conditions had
stabilized somewhat, although the banking sector continued to
experience elevated levels of nonperforming assets and net
charge-offs, especially with respect to certain industry
segments. Unemployment rates had increased slightly and consumer
spending and confidence levels had declined during that year.
Economic conditions began to improve in early to mid-2003 as
evidenced by stronger earnings across many corporate sectors,
higher equity valuations, stronger retail sales and consumer
spending, and improving economic indicators. Also, unemployment
rates stabilized and began to decline in late 2003. However, the
banking industry continued to have elevated levels of
nonperforming assets and net charge-offs compared with the late
1990’s. Conditions within certain industries, including
manufacturing and airline transportation sectors, lagged behind
the growth in the broader economy especially in some markets
served by the Company.

During 2004, unemployment rates and bankruptcy
levels continued to improve. The trends related to consumer
spending for retail goods and services continued to expand
throughout the year. While corporate profits continued to be
strong, the index of corporate profits retreated somewhat in the
second quarter of 2004. As a result, equity markets stalled in
the second and third quarters of 2004 due to uncertainty related
to corporate profits and world events. Within the Company’s
customer base, commercial loan demand continued to be somewhat
soft through mid-2004. In the fourth quarter of 2004, most
economic indicators again began to expand and commercial loan
balances for the Company displayed year-over-year quarterly
growth for the first time since mid-2001.

Credit Diversification

The Company manages its credit
risk, in part, through diversification of its loan portfolio. As
part of its normal business activities, it offers a broad array
of traditional commercial lending products and specialized
products such as asset-based lending, commercial lease
financing, agricultural credit, warehouse mortgage lending,
commercial real estate, health care and correspondent banking.
The Company also offers an array of retail lending products
including credit cards, retail leases, home equity, revolving
credit, lending to students and other consumer loans. These
retail credit products are primarily offered through the branch
office network, specialized trust, home mortgage and loan
production offices, indirect distribution channels, such as
automobile dealers and a consumer finance division. The Company
monitors and manages the portfolio diversification by industry,
customer and geography. Table 6 provides information with
respect to the overall product diversification and changes in
the mix during 2004.

The commercial portfolio reflects the
Company’s focus on serving small business customers, middle
market and larger corporate businesses throughout its 24-state
banking region and large national customers within certain niche
industry groups. Table 7 provides a summary of the significant
industry groups and geographic locations of commercial loans
outstanding at December 31, 2004 and 2003. The commercial
loan portfolio is diversified among various industries with
somewhat higher concentrations in consumer products and
services, financial services, commercial services and supplies,
capital goods (including manufacturing and commercial
construction-related businesses) and agricultural industries.
Additionally, the commercial portfolio is diversified across the
Company’s geographical markets with 84.1 percent of
total commercial loans within the 24-state banking region.
Credit relationships outside of the Company’s banking
region are specifically targeted industries including the
mortgage banking and the leasing businesses. Loans to mortgage
banking customers are primarily warehouse lines which are
collateralized with the underlying mortgages. The Company
regularly monitors its mortgage collateral position to manage
its risk exposure.

Certain industry segments within the commercial
loan portfolio, including transportation and manufacturing have
experienced economic stress since 2001. Additionally, highly
leveraged enterprise-value financings have under-performed

U.S. BANCORP



due to changes in cash flows during softer
economic conditions. At December 31, 2004, the
transportation sector represented 4.0 percent of the total
commercial loan portfolio. Since 2001, the sector has been
impacted by airline travel, slower economic activity and changes
in fuel prices. In general, the credit risk profile of the
trucking, railroad and shipping segments have improved from a
year ago; however, the airline segment continues to be sluggish.
At year-end 2004, the Company’s transportation portfolio
consisted of airline and airfreight businesses
(28.2 percent of the sector), trucking businesses
(46.4 percent of the sector) and the remainder in the
railroad and shipping businesses (25.4 percent of the
sector). Capital goods represented 9.5 percent of the total
commercial portfolio at December 31, 2004. Included in this
sector were approximately 21.5 percent of loans related to
building products while engineering and construction equipment
and machinery businesses were 34.8 percent and
30.2 percent, respectively. During 2004, economic
conditions improved and production levels increased resulting in
an improvement in the credit quality of the manufacturing
sectors from a year ago. With respect to certain construction
and building-related businesses, the recent changes in the
interest rate environment may somewhat hamper their future
profitability; however, these credits continued to perform well
as of December 31, 2004.

Within its commercial lending business, the
Company also provides financing to enable customers to grow
their businesses through acquisitions of existing businesses,
buyouts or other recapitalizations. During a business cycle with
slower economic growth, businesses with leveraged capital
structures may experience insufficient cash flows to service
their debt. The Company manages leveraged enterprise-value
financings by maintaining well-defined underwriting standards,
portfolio diversification and actively managing the customer
relationship. Regardless of these actions, leveraged
enterprise-value financings often exhibit stress during a
recession or period of slow economic growth and will have higher
inherent loss rates than other commercial loans. The Company
actively monitors the credit quality of these customers and
develops action plans accordingly. Such leveraged
enterprise-value financings approximated $1.7 billion in
loans outstanding at December 31, 2004, compared with
approximately $1.8 billion outstanding at December 31,
2003. The Company’s portfolio of highly leveraged
enterprise-value financings is included in Table 7 and is
diversified among industry groups similar to the total
commercial loan portfolio, except for higher concentrations in
telecommunications and cable.

The commercial real estate portfolio reflects the
Company’s focus on serving business owners within its
footprint as well as regional and national investment-based real
estate. At December 31, 2004, the Company had commercial
real estate loans of $27.6 billion, or 21.8 percent of
total loans, compared with $27.2 billion at
December 31, 2003. Within commercial real estate loans,
different property types have varying degrees of credit risk.
Table 9 provides a summary of the significant property types and
geographic locations of commercial real estate loans outstanding
at December 31, 2004 and 2003. At December 31, 2004,
approximately 31.0 percent of the commercial real estate
loan portfolio represented business owner-occupied properties
that tend to exhibit credit risk characteristics similar to the
middle market commercial loan portfolio. Generally, the
investment-based real estate mortgages are diversified among
various property types with somewhat higher concentrations in
multi-family, office and retail properties. While
investment-based commercial real estate continues to perform
with relatively strong occupancy levels and cash flows, these
categories of loans can be adversely impacted during a rising
rate environment. Included in commercial real estate at year end
2004 was approximately $.4 billion in land held for
development and $1.4 billion of loans related to
residential and commercial acquisition and development
properties. These loans are subject to quarterly monitoring for
changes in local market conditions due to a higher credit risk
profile. Acquisition and development loans continued to perform
well with strong market conditions; however, these loans can be
adversely impacted by a slow down in the housing market and
softening of demand. The commercial real estate portfolio is
diversified across the Company’s geographical markets with
92.6 percent of total commercial real estate loans
outstanding at December 31, 2004, within the 24-state
banking region.

Analysis of Nonperforming Assets

The level of nonperforming assets
represents a key indicator, among other considerations, of the
potential for future credit losses. Nonperforming assets include
nonaccrual loans, restructured loans not performing in
accordance with modified terms and other real estate and other
nonperforming assets owned by the Company. Interest payments
collected from assets on nonaccrual status are typically applied
against the principal balance and not recorded as income. At
December 31, 2004, total nonperforming assets were
$748.4 million, compared with $1,148.1 million at
year-end 2003 and $1,373.5 million at year-end 2002. The
ratio of total nonperforming assets to total loans and other
real estate decreased to .59 percent at December 31,
2004, compared with .97 percent and 1.18 percent at
the end of 2003 and 2002, respectively.

The $399.7 million decrease in total
nonperforming assets in 2004 reflected a decrease of
$374.3 million in nonperforming commercial and commercial
real estate loans


U.S. BANCORP


and a $8.0 million decrease in nonperforming
retail loans, partially offset by an increase of
$2.8 million in nonperforming residential mortgages. The
decrease in nonperforming assets in 2004 was broad-based across
most industry sectors within the commercial loan portfolio
including capital goods, consumer-related sectors, manufacturing
and certain segments of transportation. While airline travel has
increased from a year ago, the industry continues to be
economically stressed and has had difficulty improving cash
flows from operations. Certain health care facilities providers
continue to experience operational stress leading to some
deterioration in credit quality within that sector. While
nonperforming assets are expected to continue to decline
slightly during the next few quarters, the ongoing level of
nonperforming assets is not expected to decline much further
after mid-2005.

The $225.4 million decrease in total
nonperforming assets in 2003, as compared with 2002, reflected a
decrease of $204.9 million in nonperforming commercial and
commercial real estate loans, a decrease of $11.5 million
in nonperforming residential mortgages and a $.9 million
decrease in nonperforming retail loans. The decrease in
nonperforming assets in 2003 was also broad-based across most
industry sectors within the commercial loan portfolio including
capital goods, consumer-related sectors, manufacturing,
telecommunications, and certain segments of transportation.

Table 13

Delinquent Loan Ratios as a Percent of Ending
    Loan Balances

(a)

Delinquent loan ratios exclude advances made
    pursuant to servicing agreements to Government National Mortgage
    Association (“GNMA”) mortgage pools whose repayments
    are insured by the Federal Housing Administration or guaranteed
    by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Including the guaranteed
    amounts, the ratio of residential mortgages 90 days or more past
    due was 5.19 percent and 6.07 percent at December 31, 2004
    and 2003, respectively. Information prior to 2003 is not
    available.

The Company had $68.2 million and
$58.5 million of restructured loans as of December 31,
2004 and 2003, respectively. Commitments to lend additional
funds under restructured loans were $11.9 million and
$8.2 million as of December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. Restructured loans performing under the
restructured terms beyond a specific timeframe are reported as
accruing. Of the Company’s total restructured loans at
December 31, 2004, $10.2 million were reported as
accruing.

Accruing loans 90 days or more past due
totaled $294.0 million at December 31, 2004, compared
with $329.4 million at December 31, 2003, and
$426.4 million at December 31, 2002. These loans were
not included in nonperforming assets and continue to accrue
interest because they are adequately secured by collateral,
and/or are in the process of collection and are reasonably
expected to result in repayment or restoration to current
status. The ratio of delinquent loans to total loans declined to
..23 percent at December 31, 2004, compared with
..28 percent at December 31, 2003. Improving economic
conditions and the Company’s continued focus on improving
the credit process were the primary factors for the favorable
change from a year ago. Given the relative level of loans
90 days or more past due, the Company does not anticipate
significant reductions in future periods.

To monitor credit risk associated with retail
loans, the Company monitors delinquency ratios in the various
stages of collection including nonperforming status.


U.S. BANCORP


The following table provides summary delinquency
information for residential mortgages and retail loans:

The decline in residential mortgage delinquencies
from December 31, 2003, to December 31, 2004,
reflected the general improvement in economic conditions,
collection efforts and the effect of portfolio growth on
delinquency ratios reported on a concurrent basis. The decline
in retail loan delinquencies from a year ago, reflected
improving economic conditions as well as ongoing collection
efforts, risk management actions taken by the Company and the
effect of portfolio growth on delinquency ratios reported on a
concurrent basis.

Analysis of Loan Net Charge-Offs

Total loan net charge-offs
decreased $484.6 million to $767.1 million in 2004,
compared with $1,251.7 million in 2003 and
$1,373.0 million in 2002. The ratio of total loan net
charge-offs to average loans was .63 percent in 2004,
compared with 1.06 percent in 2003 and 1.20 percent in
2002. The overall level of net charge-offs in 2004 reflected the
Company’s ongoing efforts to reduce the overall risk
profile of the organization, improved economic conditions,
higher commercial loan recoveries, refinancing by higher risk
customers with other companies and higher asset valuations. Net
charge-offs are expected to increase modestly as the level of
commercial loan recoveries declines to more normalized levels in
2005. The improvement in net charge-offs in 2003, compared with
2002, was due to credit risk management initiatives taken by the
Company that improved the credit risk profile of the loan
portfolio. These initiatives along with better economic
conditions resulted in improving credit risk classifications and
lower levels of nonperforming assets and consumer loan
delinquencies.

Commercial and commercial real estate loan net
charge-offs for 2004 were $195.7 million (.29 percent
of average loans outstanding), compared with $608.7 million

    representing probable credit losses determined in accordance
    with policies and methods utilized to determine the allowance
    for credit losses is included in net charge-offs. The remaining
    portion of the losses was reported separately as a reduction of
    the allowance for credit losses under “Losses from loan
    sales/transfers.” Had the entire amount of the loss been
    reported as charge-offs, total net charge-offs would have been
    $1,875.8 million (1.59 percent of average loans) for
    the year ended December 31, 2001.

(.89 percent of average loans outstanding)
in 2003 and $679.9 million (.98 percent of average
loans outstanding) in 2002. The improvement from 2003 was
broad-based and extended across most industries within the
commercial loan portfolio and reflected higher levels of
commercial loan recoveries principally within the Wholesale
Banking line of business. These higher levels of recoveries are
not expected to continue throughout 2005. The decrease in
commercial and commercial real estate loan net charge-offs in
2003, when compared with 2002, was experienced within most
industries in the commercial portfolio. In addition, net
charge-offs related to the equipment-leasing portfolio declined
to 1.65 percent of average leases outstanding from
2.67 percent in 2002. In 2002, higher levels of net
charge-offs related to the leasing portfolio included airline
and other transportation related losses.

Retail loan net charge-offs in 2004 were
$542.7 million (1.32 percent of average loans
outstanding), compared with $616.1 million
(1.61 percent of average loans outstanding) in 2003 and
$674.0 million (1.85 percent of average loans
outstanding) in 2002. Lower levels of retail loan net
charge-offs in 2004, compared with 2003, principally reflected
changes by the Company in underwriting, ongoing collection
efforts and other risk management activities. The decline also
reflected lower delinquency ratios from a year ago as the
economy continued to improve. Lower levels of retail loan net
charge-offs in 2003, compared with 2002, were primarily due to
the implementation of uniform underwriting standards and
processes across the entire Company, improvement in ongoing
collection efforts and changes in other risk management
practices. The favorable change in credit card losses also
reflected the impact of two portfolio sales in late 2002.

The Company’s retail lending business
utilizes several distinct business processes and channels to
originate retail credit including traditional branch credit,
indirect lending and a consumer finance division. Each distinct
underwriting and origination activity manages unique credit risk
characteristics and prices its loan production commensurate with
the differing risk profiles. Within Consumer Banking,
U.S. Bank Consumer Finance (“USBCF”) participates
in all facets of the Company’s consumer lending activities.
USBCF specializes in serving channel-specific and alternative
lending markets in residential mortgages, home equity and
installment loan financing. USBCF manages loans originated
through a broker network, correspondent relationships and
U.S. Bank branch offices. Generally, loans managed by the
Company’s consumer finance division exhibit higher credit
risk characteristics, but are priced commensurate with the
differing risk profile.

The following table provides an analysis of net
charge-offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding managed
by the consumer finance division, compared with traditional
branch related loans:

Consumer finance category included credit
    originated and managed by USBCF, as well as home equity loans
    and second mortgages with a loan-to-value greater than 100
    percent that were originated in the branches.

Analysis and Determination of the Allowance
for Credit Losses

The allowance
for loan losses provides coverage for probable and estimable
losses inherent in the Company’s loan and lease portfolio.
Management evaluates the allowance each quarter to determine
that it is adequate to cover these inherent losses. The
evaluation of each element and the overall allowance is based on
a continuing assessment of problem loans, recent loss experience
and other factors, including regulatory guidance and economic
conditions. Because business processes and credit risks
associated with unfunded credit commitments are essentially the
same as for loans, the Company utilizes similar processes to
estimate its liability for unfunded credit commitments, which is
included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Both the allowance for loan losses and the liability for
unfunded credit commitments are included in the Company’s
analysis of credit losses.

Table 16

Elements of the Allowance for Credit Losses

At December 31, 2004, the allowance for
credit losses was $2,269.3 million (1.80 percent of
loans). This compares with an allowance of $2,368.6 million
(2.00 percent of loans) at December 31, 2003, and
$2,422.0 million (2.08 percent of loans) at
December 31, 2002. The ratio of the allowance for credit
losses to nonperforming loans was 354 percent at year-end
2004, compared with 232 percent at year-end 2003 and
196 percent at year-end 2002. The ratio of the allowance
for credit losses to loan net charge-offs was 296 percent
at year-end 2004, compared with 189 percent at year-end
2003 and 176 percent at year-end 2002. Management
determined that the allowance for credit losses was adequate at
December 31, 2004.

Several factors were taken into consideration in
evaluating the allowance for credit losses in 2004, including
the improving credit risk profile of the portfolios and
declining net charge-offs during the period, the lower level of
nonperforming assets and relative size of accruing loans
90 days or more past due and improving delinquency ratios
in most loan categories compared with December 31, 2003.
Management also considered the uncertainty related to certain
industry sectors, including the transportation sector, the
extent of credit exposure to highly leveraged enterprise-value
borrowers within the portfolio. In addition, concentration risks
associated with commercial real estate and the mix of loans,
including credit cards, loans originated through the consumer
finance division and lower residential mortgages balances, and
their relative credit risk was evaluated compared with other
banks. Finally, the Company considered the improving economic
trends, including improving corporate earnings, changes in
unemployment rates, the level of bankruptcies and general
economic indicators. Management determines the allowance that is
required for specific loan categories based on relative risk
characteristics of the loan portfolio. On an ongoing basis,
management evaluates its methods for determining the allowance
for each element of the portfolio and makes enhancements
considered appropriate. Table 16 shows the amount of the
allowance for credit losses by portfolio category.

The allowance recorded for commercial and
commercial real estate loans is based on a regular review of
individual credit relationships. The Company’s risk rating
process is an integral component of the methodology utilized in
determining these elements of the allowance for credit losses.
An allowance for credit losses is established for pools of
commercial and commercial real estate loans and unfunded
commitments based on the risk ratings assigned. An analysis of
the migration of commercial and commercial real estate loans and
actual loss experience throughout the business cycle is also
conducted quarterly to assess the exposure for credits with
similar risk characteristics. During 2004, the Company enhanced
the process of determining specific allowances for commercial
and commercial real estate credit facilities by further
segmenting these portfolios based upon risk characteristics and
historical performance. Additionally, the Company reassessed the
historical timeframe considered in developing inherent loss
ratios to more effectively consider the implications of the last
business cycle. These enhancements had the effect of increasing
inherent loss ratios for higher risk leveraged financings and
transportation leases while


U.S. BANCORP


reducing inherent loss rates for commercial real
estate and traditional corporate lending. On a composite basis,
inherent loss rates for commercial credit facilities increased
slightly for most risk rating categories relative to a year ago.
In addition to its risk rating process, the Company separately
analyzes the carrying value of impaired loans to determine
whether the carrying value is less than or equal to the
appraised collateral value or the present value of expected cash
flows. Based on this analysis, an allowance for credit losses
may be specifically established for impaired loans. The
allowance established for commercial and commercial real estate
loan portfolios, including impaired commercial and commercial
real estate loans, was $940.7 million at December 31,
2004, compared with $1,015.0 million and
$1,090.4 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. The decline in the allowance for commercial and
commercial real estate loans of $74.3 million reflected a
$143.1 million reduction due to improvements in the risk
classifications, offset somewhat by the impact of growth in the
portfolios and a $68.8 million increase related to changes
in loss severity rates. The increase in loss severity rates is
driven by enhancements to the Company’s migration analysis
offset somewhat by recent loss experience.

The allowance recorded for the residential
mortgages and retail loan portfolios is based on an analysis of
product mix, credit scoring and risk composition of the
portfolio, loss and bankruptcy experiences, economic conditions
and historical and expected delinquency and charge-off
statistics for each homogenous group of loans. Based on this
information and analysis, an allowance was established
approximating a rolling twelve-month estimate of net
charge-offs. The allowance established for residential mortgages
was $33.1 million at December 31, 2004, compared with
$33.3 million and $34.2 million at December 31,
2003 and 2002, respectively. The slight decrease in the
allowance for the residential mortgage portfolio year-over-year
was primarily due to lower expected loss severity resulting from
the more uniform underwriting processes and standards associated
with the portfolio, partially offset by inherent losses due to
growth in the first lien home equity portfolio during 2004. The
allowance established for retail loans was $610.3 million
at December 31, 2004, compared with $650.3 million and
$699.7 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. The decline in the allowance for the retail
portfolio in 2004 reflected improved credit quality favorably
impacting inherent loss ratios and declining delinquency trends,
partially offset by the impact of portfolio growth.

Regardless of the extent of the Company’s
analysis of customer performance, portfolio trends or risk
management processes, certain inherent but undetected losses are
probable within the loan portfolios. This is due to several
factors, including inherent delays in obtaining information
regarding a customer’s financial condition or changes in
their unique business conditions, the judgmental nature of
individual loan evaluations, collateral assessments and the
interpretation of economic trends. Volatility of economic or
customer-specific conditions affecting the identification and
estimation of losses from larger non-homogeneous credits and the
sensitivity of assumptions utilized to establish allowances for
homogeneous groups of loans, loan portfolio concentrations, and
other subjective considerations are among other factors. Because
of these subjective factors, the process utilized to determine
each element of the allowance for credit losses by specific loan
category has some imprecision. As such, the Company estimates a
range of inherent losses in the portfolio based on statistical
analyses and management judgment, and maintains an
“allowance available for other factors” that is not
allocated to a specific loan category. The statistical analysis
attempts to measure the extent of imprecision by determining the
volatility of losses over time across loan categories. Also,
management judgmentally considers loan concentrations, risks
associated with specific industries, the stage of the business
cycle, economic conditions and other qualitative factors. Based
on this process, the amount of the allowance available for other
factors was $685.2 million at December 31, 2004 compared
with $670.0 million at December 31, 2003 and
$597.7 million at December 31, 2002. At
December 31, 2004, approximately $500 million was related
to estimated imprecision as described above. Of this amount,
commercial and commercial real estate represented approximately
72 percent while residential and retail loans represented
approximately 28 percent. The remaining allowance available
for other factors of $185 million was related to concentration
risk, including risks associated with the sluggish airline
industry, relative size of the consumer finance and commercial
real estate portfolios and highly leveraged enterprise-value
credits and other qualitative factors. Given the many subjective
factors affecting the credit portfolio, changes in the allowance
for other factors may not directly coincide with changes in the
risk ratings or the credit portfolio.

Although the Company determines the amount of
each element of the allowance separately and this process is an
important credit management tool, the entire allowance for
credit losses is available for the entire loan portfolio. The
actual amount of losses incurred can vary significantly from the
estimated amounts. Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for accounting policies
related to the allowance for credit losses.

Residual Risk Management

The Company manages its risk to
changes in the residual value of leased assets through
disciplined residual valuation setting at the inception of a

U.S. BANCORP



lease, diversification of its leased assets,
regular asset valuation reviews and monitoring of residual value
gains or losses upon the disposition of assets. Commercial lease
originations are subject to the same well-defined underwriting
standards referred to in the “Credit Risk Management”
section which includes an evaluation of the residual risk.
Retail lease residual risk is mitigated further by originating
longer-term vehicle leases and effective end-of-term marketing
of off-lease vehicles. Also, to reduce the financial risk of
potential changes in vehicle residual values, the Company
maintains residual value insurance. The catastrophic insurance
maintained by the Company provides for the potential recovery of
losses on individual vehicle sales in an amount equal to the
difference between: (a) 105 percent or
110 percent of the average wholesale auction price for the
vehicle at the time of sale and (b) the vehicle residual
value specified by the Automotive Lease Guide (an authoritative
industry source) at the inception of the lease. The potential
recovery is calculated for each individual vehicle sold in a
particular policy year and is reduced by any gains realized on
vehicles sold during the same period. The Company will receive
claim proceeds under this insurance program if, in the
aggregate, there is a net loss for such period. In addition, the
Company obtains separate residual value insurance for all
vehicles at lease inception where end of lease term settlement
is based solely on the residual value of the individual leased
vehicles. Under this program, the potential recovery is computed
for each individual vehicle sold and does not allow the
insurance carrier to offset individual determined losses with
gains from other leases. This individual vehicle coverage is
included in the calculation of minimum lease payments when
making the capital lease assessment. To reduce the risk
associated with collecting insurance claims, the Company
monitors the financial viability of the insurance carrier based
on insurance industry ratings and available financial
information.

Included in the retail leasing portfolio was
approximately $4.0 billion of retail leasing residuals at
December 31, 2004, compared with $3.3 billion at
December 31, 2003. The Company monitors concentrations of
leases by manufacturer and vehicle “make and model.”
At year-end 2004, no vehicle-type concentration exceeded five
percent of the aggregate portfolio. Because retail residual
valuations tend to be less volatile for longer-term leases,
relative to the estimated residual at inception of the lease,
the Company actively manages lease origination production to
achieve a longer-term portfolio. At December 31, 2004, the
weighted-average origination term of the portfolio was
52 months. During the period from 1998 through 2002, the
used vehicle market experienced pricing stress that adversely
impacted lease residual valuations. Several factors contributed
to this competitive business cycle. Aggressive leasing programs
by automobile manufacturers and competitors within the banking
industry included a marketing focus on monthly lease payments,
enhanced residuals at lease inception, shorter-term leases and
low mileage leases. These practices created a cyclical
oversupply of certain off-lease vehicles causing significant
declines in used vehicle prices during that period. Since late
2002, residual values for used cars have improved. Economic
pressures during 2001 and 2002 moderated new car sales volumes
to some degree. As a result, production levels declined from
record levels in 2000, reducing the supply of newer model years.
Another factor that has affected residual values is the growth
of “certified” used car programs. Certified cars are
low mileage, newer model vehicles that have been inspected,
reconditioned, and usually have a warranty program. The
Company’s exposure to residual values has benefited from
certified car programs that receive premium pricing from dealers
at auction. In addition, competition within the new car market
continues to cause manufacturers to offer a record number of
different makes and models in an attempt to target smaller
segments of the consumer market. Also, consumers are purchasing
vehicles with more content as former optional equipment becomes
standard on more vehicles. These trends tend to favorably impact
vehicle prices. Within the new car market, higher levels of
incentive spending continue to exist. While this supports higher
sales volumes, certain vehicle models will continue to see some
downward pressure on the initial residual values of new leases,
reducing the risk of end-of-term residual valuation losses as
lessees purchase off-lease vehicles. Within vehicle categories,
residual values for automobiles have performed better than
trucks, experiencing an increase in average wholesale prices of
5.2% during 2004, while trucks have seen a decline of 1.6%. The
decline in truck values is attributed to a market decline in
demand for full size sport utility vehicles. These models have
experienced price declines due to increased competition in the
segment as well as the impact of higher gas prices on consumer
buying patterns. These factors, along with the mix of the
Company’s lease residual portfolio have reduced the
exposure to retail lease residual impairments relative to a year
ago.

At December 31, 2004, the commercial leasing
portfolio had $769 million of residuals, compared with
$816 million at December 31, 2003. At year-end 2004,
lease residuals related to trucks and other transportation
equipment were 29.8 percent of the total residual
portfolio. Railcars represented 16.5 percent of the
aggregate portfolio, while aircraft and business and office
equipment were 16.3 percent and 12.7 percent,
respectively. No other significant concentrations of more than
10 percent existed at December 31, 2004. In 2004,
reduced airline travel and


U.S. BANCORP


higher fuel costs continued to adversely impact
aircraft and transportation equipment lease residual values.

Operational Risk Management

Operational risk represents the risk
of loss resulting from the Company’s operations, including,
but not limited to, the risk of fraud by employees or persons
outside the Company, the execution of unauthorized transactions
by employees, errors relating to transaction processing and
technology, breaches of the internal control system and
compliance requirements and business continuation and disaster
recovery. This risk of loss also includes the potential legal
actions that could arise as a result of an operational
deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable
regulatory standards, adverse business decisions or their
implementation, and customer attrition due to potential negative
publicity.

The Company operates in many different businesses
in diverse markets and relies on the ability of its employees
and systems to process a high number of transactions.
Operational risk is inherent in all business activities, and the
management of this risk is important to the achievement of the
Company’s objectives. In the event of a breakdown in the
internal control system, improper operation of systems or
improper employees’ actions, the Company could suffer
financial loss, face regulatory action and suffer damage to its
reputation.

The Company manages operational risk through a
risk management framework and its internal control processes.
Within this framework, the Corporate Risk Committee (“Risk
Committee”) provides oversight and assesses the most
significant operational risks facing the Company within its
business lines. Under the guidance of the Risk Committee,
enterprise risk management personnel establish policies and
interact with business lines to monitor significant operating
risks on a regular basis. Business lines have direct and primary
responsibility and accountability for identifying, controlling,
and monitoring operational risks embedded in their business
activities. Business managers maintain a system of controls with
the objective of providing proper transaction authorization and
execution, proper system operations, safeguarding of assets from
misuse or theft, and ensuring the reliability of financial and
other data. Business managers ensure that the controls are
appropriate and are implemented as designed.

Each business line within the Company has
designated risk managers. These risk managers are responsible
for, among other things, coordinating the completion of ongoing
risk assessments and ensuring that operational risk management
is integrated into business decision-making activities. Business
continuation and disaster recovery planning is also critical to
effectively manage operational risks. Each business unit of the
Company is required to develop, maintain and test these plans at
least annually to ensure that recovery activities, if needed,
can support mission critical functions including technology,
networks and data centers supporting customer applications and
business operations. The Company’s internal audit function
validates the system of internal controls through risk-based,
regular and ongoing audit procedures and reports on the
effectiveness of internal controls to executive management and
the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.

Customer-related business conditions may also
increase operational risk or the level of operational losses in
certain transaction processing business units, including
merchant processing activities. Ongoing risk monitoring of
customer activities and their financial condition and
operational processes serve to mitigate customer-related
operational risk. Refer to Note 24 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on
merchant processing.

While the Company believes that it has designed
effective methods to minimize operational risks, there is no
absolute assurance that business disruption or operational
losses would not occur in the event of a disaster. On an ongoing
basis, management makes process changes and investments to
enhance its systems of internal controls and business continuity
and disaster recovery plans.

Interest Rate Risk Management

In the banking industry, a significant
risk exists related to changes in interest rates. To minimize
the volatility of net interest income and of the market value of
assets and liabilities, the Company manages its exposure to
changes in interest rates through asset and liability management
activities within guidelines established by its Asset Liability
Policy Committee (“ALPC”) and approved by the Board of
Directors. ALPC has the responsibility for approving and
ensuring compliance with ALPC management policies, including
interest rate risk exposure. The Company uses Net Interest
Income Simulation Analysis and Market Value of Equity Modeling
for measuring and analyzing consolidated interest rate risk.

Net Interest Income Simulation Analysis

One of the primary tools used to
measure interest rate risk and the effect of interest rate
changes on rate sensitive income and net interest income is
simulation analysis. The monthly analysis incorporates
substantially all of the Company’s assets and liabilities
and off-balance sheet instruments, together with forecasted
changes in the balance sheet and assumptions that reflect the
current interest rate environment. Through these simulations,
management estimates the impact on interest rate sensitive
income of a 300 basis point upward or downward gradual
change of market interest rates over a one-year period. The
simulations also estimate the effect of immediate and sustained
parallel shifts in the yield curve of 50 basis points as
well as the effect of immediate and sustained flattening

U.S. BANCORP



Sensitivity of Net Interest Income and Rate
Sensitive Income

Given the current level of interest rates, a
    downward 300 basis point scenario can not be
    computed.

or steepening of the yield curve. These
simulations include assumptions about how the balance sheet is
likely to be affected by changes in loan and deposit growth.
Assumptions are made to project interest rates for new loans and
deposits based on historical analysis, management’s outlook
and repricing strategies. These assumptions are validated on a
periodic basis. A sensitivity analysis is provided for key
variables of the simulation. The results are reviewed by ALPC
monthly and are used to guide hedging strategies. ALPC policy
guidelines limit the estimated change in interest rate sensitive
income to 5.0 percent of forecasted interest rate sensitive
income over the succeeding 12 months.

The table above summarizes the interest rate risk
of net interest income and rate sensitive income based on
forecasts over the succeeding 12 months. At
December 31, 2004, the Company’s overall interest rate
risk position was substantively neutral to changes in interest
rates. Rate sensitive income includes net interest income as
well as other income items that are sensitive to interest rates,
including asset management fees, mortgage banking and the impact
from compensating deposit balances. The Company manages its
interest rate risk position by holding assets on the balance
sheet with desired interest rate risk characteristics,
implementing certain pricing strategies for loans and deposits
and through the selection of derivatives and various funding and
investment portfolio strategies. The Company manages the overall
interest rate risk profile within policy limits. At
December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company was within its
policy guidelines.

Market Value of Equity Modeling

The Company also utilizes the
market value of equity as a measurement tool in managing
interest rate sensitivity. The market value of equity measures
the degree to which the market values of the Company’s
assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments will
change given a change in interest rates. ALPC guidelines limit
the change in market value of equity in a 200 basis point
parallel rate shock to 15 percent of the market value of
equity assuming interest rates at December 31, 2004. The up
200 basis point scenario resulted in a 2.7 percent
decrease in the market value of equity at December 31,
2004, compared with a 3.1 percent decrease at
December 31, 2003. The down 200 basis point scenario
resulted in a 4.2 percent decrease in the market value of
equity at December 31, 2004. Given the low level of
interest rates, the down 200 basis point scenario was not
computed for December 31, 2003. ALPC reviews other down
rate scenarios to evaluate the impact of falling interest rates.
The down 100 basis point scenario resulted in a
..7 percent decrease at December 31, 2004, and a
1.3 percent increase at December 31, 2003. At
December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company was within its
policy guidelines.

The valuation analysis is dependent upon certain
key assumptions about the nature of indeterminate maturity of
assets and liabilities. Management estimates the average life
and rate characteristics of asset and liability accounts based
upon historical analysis and management’s expectation of
rate behavior. These assumptions are validated on a periodic
basis. A sensitivity analysis of key variables of the valuation
analysis is provided to ALPC monthly and is used to guide
hedging strategies. The results of the valuation analysis as of
December 31, 2004, were well within policy guidelines. The
Company also uses duration of equity as a measure of interest
rate risk. The duration of equity is a measure of the net market
value sensitivity of the assets, liabilities and derivative
positions of the Company. The duration of assets was
1.68 years at December 31, 2004, compared with
1.91 years at December 31, 2003. The duration of
liabilities was 2.02 years at December 31, 2004,
compared with 2.18 years at December 31, 2003. After
giving effect to the Company’s derivative positions, the
estimated duration of equity was .12 years at
December 31, 2004, compared with 1.35 years at
December 31, 2003. The duration of equity measure shows
that sensitivity of the market value of equity of the Company
was relatively neutral to changes in interest rates.

Use of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate
Risk

In the ordinary course of
business, the Company enters into derivative transactions to
manage its interest rate, prepayment and foreign currency risks
(“asset and liability management positions”) and to
accommodate the business requirements of its customers
(“customer-related positions”). To manage its interest
rate risk, the Company may enter into interest rate swap
agreements and interest rate options such as caps and floors.
Interest rate swaps involve the exchange of fixed-rate and
variable-rate payments without the exchange of the underlying
notional amount on which the interest payments are calculated.
Interest rate caps protect against rising interest rates while


U.S. BANCORP


interest rate floors protect against declining
interest rates. In connection with its mortgage banking
operations, the Company enters into forward commitments to sell
mortgage loans related to fixed-rate mortgage loans held for
sale and fixed-rate mortgage loan commitments. The Company also
acts as a seller and buyer of interest rate contracts and
foreign exchange rate contracts on behalf of customers. The
Company minimizes its market and liquidity risks by taking
similar offsetting positions.

All interest rate derivatives that qualify for
hedge accounting are recorded at fair value as other assets or
liabilities on the balance sheet and are designated as either
“fair value” or “cash flow” hedges. The
Company performs an assessment, both at inception and quarterly
thereafter, when required, to determine whether these
derivatives are highly effective in offsetting changes in the
value of the hedged items. Hedge ineffectiveness for both cash
flow and fair value hedges is recorded in noninterest income.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as fair
value hedges, and changes in the fair value of the hedged items,
are recorded in earnings. Changes in the fair value of
derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in other
comprehensive income until income from the cash flows of the
hedged items is realized. Customer-related interest rate swaps,
foreign exchange rate contracts, and all other derivative
contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recorded
at fair value and resulting gains or

losses are recorded in trading account gains or
losses or mortgage banking revenue.

By their nature, derivative instruments are
subject to market risk. The Company does not utilize derivative
instruments for speculative purposes. Of the Company’s
$34.5 billion of total notional amount of asset and
liability management derivative positions at December 31,
2004, $32.1 billion was designated as either fair value or
cash flow hedges. The cash flow hedge positions are interest
rate swaps that hedge the forecasted cash flows from the
underlying variable-rate LIBOR loans and floating-rate debt. The
fair value hedges are primarily interest rate contracts that
hedge the change in fair value related to interest rate changes
of underlying fixed-rate debt and subordinated obligations. In
addition, the Company uses forward commitments to sell
residential mortgage loans to hedge its interest rate risk
related to residential mortgage loans held for sale. The Company
commits to sell the loans at specified prices in a future
period, typically within 90 days. The Company is exposed to
interest rate risk during the period between issuing a loan
commitment and the sale of the loan into the secondary market.
Related to its mortgage banking operations, the Company held
$1.1 billion of forward commitments to sell mortgage loans
and $1.0 billion of unfunded mortgage loan commitments that
were derivatives in accordance with the provisions of the
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133,
“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedge
Activities.” The unfunded mortgage loan commitments are
reported at fair value as options in Table 17.

Derivative instruments are also subject to credit
risk associated with counterparties to the derivative contracts.
Credit risk associated with derivatives is measured based on the
replacement cost should the counterparties with contracts in a
gain position to the Company fail to perform under the terms of
the contract. The Company manages this risk through
diversification of its derivative positions among various
counterparties, requiring collateral agreements with
credit-rating thresholds, entering into master netting
agreements in certain cases and entering into interest rate swap
risk participation agreements. These agreements are credit
derivatives that transfer the credit risk related to interest
rate swaps from the Company to an unaffiliated third-party. The
Company also provides credit protection to third-parties with
risk participation agreements, for a fee, as part of a loan
syndication transaction.

At December 31, 2004, the Company had
$113.4 million in accumulated other comprehensive income
related to unrealized gains on derivatives classified as cash
flow hedges. The unrealized gains will be reflected in earnings
when the related cash flows or hedged transactions occur and
will offset the related performance of the hedged items. The
estimated amount of gain to be reclassified from accumulated
other comprehensive income into earnings during the next
12 months is $65.8 million.

Gains or losses on customer-related derivative
positions were not material in 2004. The change in fair value of
forward commitments attributed to hedge ineffectiveness recorded
in noninterest income was an increase of $.7 million in
2004. The change in the fair value of all other asset and
liability management derivative positions attributed to hedge
ineffectiveness was not material in 2004.

Beginning in the second quarter of 2004, the
Company entered into derivatives to protect its net investment
in certain foreign operations. The Company uses forward
commitments to sell specified amounts of certain foreign
currencies to hedge its capital volatility risk associated with
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The net amount
of gains or losses included in the cumulative translation
adjustment for 2004 was not material.

Table 17 summarizes information on the
Company’s derivative positions at December 31, 2004.
Refer to Notes 1 and 22 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for significant accounting policies and
additional information regarding the Company’s use of
derivatives.

Market Risk Management

In addition to interest rate risk, the
Company is exposed to other forms of market risk as a
consequence of conducting normal trading activities. Business
activities that contribute to market risk include, among other
things, proprietary trading and foreign exchange positions.
Value at Risk (“VaR”) is a key measure of market risk
for the Company. Theoretically, VaR represents the maximum
amount that the Company has placed at risk of loss, with a
ninety-ninth percentile degree of confidence, to adverse market
movements in the course of its risk taking activities.

VaR modeling of trading activities is subject to
certain limitations. Additionally, it should be recognized that
there are assumptions and estimates associated with VaR
modeling, and actual results could differ from those assumptions
and estimates. The Company mitigates these uncertainties through
regular monitoring of trading activities by management and other
risk management practices, including stop-loss and position
limits related to its trading activities. Stress-test models are
used to provide management with perspectives on market events
that VaR models do not capture.

The Company establishes market risk limits,
subject to approval by the Company’s Board of Directors.
The Company’s VaR limit was $20 million at
December 31, 2004 and $40 million at December 31,
2003. The market valuation risk inherent in its customer-based
derivative trading, mortgage banking pipeline and foreign
exchange, as estimated by the VaR analysis, was
$1.8 million at


U.S. BANCORP

Debt Ratings

December 31, 2004, and $1.5 million at
December 31, 2003.

Liquidity Risk Management

ALPC establishes policies, as well as
analyzes and manages liquidity, to ensure that adequate funds
are available to meet normal operating requirements in addition
to unexpected customer demands for funds, such as high levels of
deposit withdrawals or loan demand, in a timely and
cost-effective manner. The most important factor in the
preservation of liquidity is maintaining public confidence that
facilitates the retention and growth of a large, stable supply
of core deposits and wholesale funds. Ultimately, public
confidence is generated through profitable operations, sound
credit quality and a strong capital position. The Company’s
performance in these areas has enabled it to develop a large and
reliable base of core funding within its market areas and in
domestic and global capital markets. Liquidity management is
viewed from long-term and short-term perspectives, as well as
from an asset and liability perspective. Management monitors
liquidity through a regular review of maturity profiles, funding
sources, and loan and deposit forecasts to minimize funding risk.

The Company maintains strategic liquidity and
contingency plans that are subject to the availability of asset
liquidity in the balance sheet. Monthly, ALPC reviews the
Company’s ability to meet funding requirements due to
adverse business events. These funding needs are then matched
with specific asset-based sources to ensure sufficient funds are
available. Also, strategic liquidity policies require
diversification of wholesale funding sources to avoid
concentrations in any one market source. Subsidiary banks are
members of various Federal Home Loan Banks
(“FHLB”) that provide a source of funding through FHLB
advances. The Company maintains a Grand Cayman branch for
issuing eurodollar time deposits. The Company also issues
commercial paper through its Canadian branch. In addition, the
Company establishes relationships with dealers to issue national
market retail and institutional savings certificates and short-
and medium-term bank notes. The Company’s subsidiary banks
also have significant correspondent banking networks and
corporate accounts. Accordingly, the Company has access to
national fed funds, funding through repurchase agreements and
sources of more stable, regionally-based certificates of deposit
and commercial paper.

The Company’s ability to raise negotiated
funding at competitive prices is influenced by rating
agencies’ views of the Company’s credit quality,
liquidity, capital and earnings. On September 27, 2004,
Fitch Ratings upgraded the Company’s senior long-term debt
rating to “AA-” and raised the Company’s
short-term debt rating to “F1+”. The long-term ratings
of U.S. Bank National Association were upgraded to
“AA” from “AA-”. On January 18, 2005,
Moody’s Investors Service upgraded the Company’s
senior long-term debt rating to “Aa2” and
U.S. Bank National Association’s long-term debt and
deposit ratings to “Aa1”. At January 18, 2005,
the credit ratings outlook for the Company was considered
“Stable” by Moody’s Investors Service,
Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings. The debt
ratings noted in Table 18, updated for the Moody’s
January of 2005 upgrade, reflect the rating agencies’
recognition of the strong, consistent financial performance of
the Company and the quality of its balance sheet.

The parent company’s routine funding
requirements consist primarily of operating expenses, dividends
to shareholders, debt service, repurchases of common stock and
funds used for acquisitions. The parent company obtains funding
to meet its obligations from dividends collected from its
subsidiaries and the issuance of debt securities. On
April 1, 2003, USB Capital II, a subsidiary of
U.S. Bancorp, redeemed 100 percent, or
$350 million, of its 7.20 percent Trust Preferred
Securities.

At December 31, 2004, parent company
long-term debt outstanding was $6.9 billion, compared with
$7.9 billion at December 31, 2003. The change in
long-term debt during 2004 was driven by medium-term note
maturities of $.8 billion and fixed-rate subordinated note
prepayments of $.1 billion. Total parent company debt
scheduled to mature

U.S. BANCORP



in 2005 is $1.3 billion. These debt
obligations may be met through medium-term note issuances and
dividends from subsidiaries, as well as from parent company cash
and cash equivalents. Federal banking laws regulate the amount
of dividends that may be paid by banking subsidiaries without
prior approval. The amount of dividends available to the parent
company from its banking subsidiaries was approximately
$1.2 billion at December 31, 2004. For further
information, see Note 25 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Refer to Table 19 for further information on
significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2004.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Off-balance sheet arrangements
include any contractual arrangement to which an unconsolidated
entity is a party, under which the Company has an obligation to
provide credit or liquidity enhancements or market risk support.
Off-balance sheet arrangements include certain defined
guarantees, asset securitization trusts and conduits.
Off-balance sheet arrangements also include any obligation under
a variable interest held by an unconsolidated entity that
provides financing, liquidity, credit enhancement or market risk
support.

In the ordinary course of business, the Company
enters into an array of commitments to extend credit, letters of
credit, lease commitments and various forms of guarantees that
may be considered off-balance sheet arrangements. The nature and
extent of these arrangements are provided in Note 24 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Asset securitization and conduits represent a
source of funding for the Company through off-balance sheet
structures. Credit, liquidity, operational and legal structural
risks exist due to the nature and complexity of asset
securitizations and other off-balance sheet structures. ALPC
regularly monitors the performance of each off-balance sheet
structure in an effort to minimize these risks and ensure
compliance with the requirements of the structures. The Company
utilizes its credit risk management systems to evaluate the
credit quality of underlying assets and regularly forecasts cash
flows to evaluate any potential impairment of retained
interests. Also, regulatory guidelines require consideration of
asset securitizations in the determination of risk-based capital
ratios. The Company does not rely significantly on off-balance
sheet arrangements for liquidity or capital resources.

The Company sponsors an off-balance sheet conduit
to which it transferred high-grade investment securities, funded
by the issuance of commercial paper. The conduit held assets of
$5.7 billion at December 31, 2004, and
$7.3 billion at December 31, 2003. These investment
securities include primarily (i) private label asset-backed
securities, which are insurance “wrapped” by AAA/
Aaa-rated monoline insurance companies and (ii) government
agency mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage
obligations. The conduit had commercial paper liabilities of
$5.7 billion at December 31, 2004, and
$7.3 billion at December 31, 2003. The Company
provides a liquidity facility to the conduit. Utilization of the
liquidity facility would be triggered if the conduit is unable
to, or does not, issue commercial paper to fund its assets. A
liability for the estimate of the potential risk of loss the
Company has as the liquidity facility provider is recorded on
the balance sheet in other liabilities. The liability is
adjusted downward over time as the underlying assets pay down
with the offset recognized as other noninterest income. The
liability for the liquidity facility was $32.4 million and
$47.3 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. In addition, the Company recorded at fair value
its retained residual interest in the investment securities
conduit of $56.8 million and $89.5 million at
December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

The Company also has an asset-backed
securitization to fund an unsecured small business credit
product. The unsecured small business credit securitization
trust held assets of $375.3 million at December 31,
2004, of which the Company retained $85.0 million of
subordinated securities and a residual interest-only strip of
$36.1 million. This compared with $497.5 million in
assets at December 31, 2003, of which the Company retained
$112.4 million of subordinated securities and a residual

interest-only strip of $34.4 million. The
securitization trust issued asset-backed variable funding notes
in various tranches. The Company provides credit enhancement in
the form of subordinated securities and reserve accounts. The
Company’s risk, primarily from losses in the underlying
assets, was considered in determining the fair value of the
Company’s retained interests in this securitization. The
Company recognized income from subordinated securities, an
interest-only strip and servicing fees from this securitization
of $33.2 million during 2004 and $29.8 million during
2003. The unsecured small business credit securitization held
average assets of $438.9 million and $571.4 million in
2004 and 2003, respectively.

Capital Management

The Company is committed to managing
capital for maximum shareholder benefit and maintaining strong
protection for depositors and creditors. The Company has
targeted returning 80 percent of earnings to our
shareholders through a combination of dividends and share
repurchases. In keeping with this target, the Company returned
109 percent of earnings in 2004. The Company continually
assesses its business risks and capital position. The Company
also manages its capital to exceed regulatory capital
requirements for well-capitalized bank holding companies. To
achieve these capital goals, the Company employs a variety of
capital management tools including dividends, common share
repurchases, and the issuance of subordinated debt and other
capital instruments. Total shareholders’ equity was
$19.5 billion at December 31, 2004, compared with
$19.2 billion at December 31, 2003. The increase was
the result of corporate earnings and option exercises, offset
primarily by the payment of dividends and the repurchase of
common stock.

On December 21, 2004, the Company increased
its dividend rate per common share by 25.0 percent, from
$.24 per quarter to $.30 per quarter. On
December 16, 2003, the Company increased its dividend rate
per common share by 17.1 percent, from $.205 per
quarter to $.24 per quarter. On March 12, 2003, the
Company increased its dividend rate per common share by
5.1 percent, from $.195 per quarter to $.205 per
quarter.

On December 18, 2001, the Board of Directors
approved an authorization to repurchase 100 million
shares of common stock through 2003. In 2003, the Company
repurchased 7.0 million shares of common stock under the
plan, which expired in 2003. On December 16, 2003, the
Board of Directors approved an authorization to
repurchase 150 million shares of common stock over the
following 24 months. During 2003, the Company purchased
8.0 million shares under the December 2003 plan. The
average price paid for the 15.0 million shares repurchased
during 2003 was $27.84 per share. In 2004, the Company
repurchased 88.8 million shares of common stock under the
December 2003 plan. On December 21, 2004, the Board of
Directors approved an authorization to
repurchase 150 million shares of common stock during
the next 24 months. This new authorization replaces the
December 16, 2003 authorization. In 2004, the Company
purchased 5.0 million shares of common stock under the
plan. The average price paid for the 93.8 million shares
repurchased during 2004 was $28.34 per share. For a

Banking regulators define minimum capital
requirements for banks and financial services holding companies.
These requirements are expressed in the form of a minimum
Tier 1 capital ratio, total risk-based capital ratio, and
Tier 1 leverage ratio. The minimum required level for these
ratios is 4.0 percent, 8.0 percent, and
4.0 percent, respectively. The Company targets its
regulatory capital levels, at both the bank and bank holding
company level, to exceed the “well-capitalized”
threshold for these ratios of 6.0 percent,
10.0 percent, and 5.0 percent, respectively. As of
December 31, 2004, the Company’s Tier 1 capital,
total risk-based capital, and Tier 1 leverage ratio were
8.6 percent, 13.1 percent, and 7.9 percent,
respectively. These ratios compare to 9.1 percent,
13.6 percent, and 8.0 percent, respectively, as of
December 31, 2003. All regulatory ratios, at both the bank
and bank holding company level, continue to be in excess of
stated “well-capitalized” requirements.

The Company uses tangible common equity expressed
as a percent of tangible common assets as an additional measure
of its capital. At December 31, 2004, the Company’s
tangible common equity ratio was 6.4 percent, compared with
6.5 percent at year-end 2003. Table 20 provides a summary
of capital ratios as of December 31, 2004 and 2003,
including Tier 1 and total risk-based capital ratios, as
defined by the regulatory agencies.

FOURTH QUARTER SUMMARY

The Company reported net income of
$1,056.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2004, or
$.56 per diluted share, compared with $977.0 million,
or $.50 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2003.
Return on average assets and return on average equity were
2.16 percent and 21.2 percent, respectively, for the
fourth quarter of 2004, compared with returns of
2.05 percent and 19.4 percent, respectively, for the
fourth quarter of 2003. The Company’s results for the
fourth quarter of 2004 improved over the fourth quarter of 2003,
primarily due to lower credit costs and growth in fee-based
products and services. Net income from continuing operations was
$1,056.0 million, or $.56 per diluted share, compared
with $970.3 million, or $.50 per diluted share for the
fourth quarter of 2003, representing an 8.8 percent annual
growth rate. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2003 also
included after-tax merger and restructuring-related items of
$5.0 million ($7.6 million on a pre-tax basis).

Total net revenue, on a taxable-equivalent basis,
was $3,235.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2004,
compared with $3,113.3 million for the fourth quarter of
2003, an increase of $121.7 million (3.9 percent) from
a year ago. The increase reflected growth in the majority of
fee-based revenue categories, particularly in payment processing
revenue. The expansion of the Company’s merchant acquiring
business in Europe, including the purchase of the remaining
50 percent shareholder interest in EuroConex and the
acquisition of several European merchant acquiring businesses,
accounted for approximately $24.2 million of the favorable
variance in total net revenue year-over-year. Fee-based revenue
growth was offset somewhat by the unfavorable variance in
securities gains (losses) of $20.4 million and net interest
income.

Fourth quarter net interest income, on a
taxable-equivalent basis was $1,799.8 million, compared
with $1,816.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2003. The
$16.9 million (.9 percent) decrease in net interest
income was driven by lower net interest margins, partially
offset by growth in average earning assets. Average earning
assets increased by $7.2 billion (4.4 percent),
primarily driven by continued strong growth in retail loans, as
well as increases in residential mortgages, investment
securities, commercial and commercial real estate loans. The
growth in earning assets contributed approximately
$83.8 million of net interest income relative to a year
ago. The positive impact of earning asset growth was more than
offset by an unfavorable rate variance, which reduced net
interest income by $89.0 million, primarily driven by the
higher cost of wholesale funding relative to the fourth quarter
of 2003. Also contributing to the year-over-year decline was an
$11.6 million reduction in loan fees, the result of fewer
loan prepayments. The net interest margin for the fourth quarter
of 2004 was 4.20 percent, compared with 4.42 percent
in the fourth quarter of 2003. The year-over-year decline in net
interest margin primarily reflected competitive credit pricing,
a preference to acquire lower yielding, adjustable rate
securities, lower prepayment fees and the higher cost of
wholesale funding relative to the fourth quarter of 2003 due to
rising interest rates.

Fourth quarter 2004 noninterest income increased
10.7 percent from the same period of a year ago. The
increase was driven by favorable variances in the majority of
fee income categories, slightly offset by an increase in


U.S. BANCORP


losses on the sales of securities of
$20.4 million. Credit and debit card revenue and corporate
payment products revenue were higher in the fourth quarter of
2004 than the fourth quarter of 2003 by $31.0 million
(20.2 percent) and $12.1 million (13.6 percent),
respectively. The growth in credit and debit card revenue
reflected increases in transaction volumes and other rate
adjustments, partially offset by higher customer loyalty reward
expenses. The corporate payment products revenue growth
reflected growth in sales, card usage and rate changes. ATM
processing services revenue was higher by $2.7 million
(6.7 percent), compared with 2003, due to increases in
transaction volumes and sales. Merchant processing services
revenue was higher in the fourth quarter of 2004 than the same
quarter of 2003 by $34.9 million (23.9 percent),
reflecting an increase in same store sales volume, new business
and the recent expansion of the Company’s merchant
acquiring business in Europe. The recent European acquisitions
accounted for approximately $25.5 million of the total
increase. Deposit service charges were higher year-over-year by
$25.1 million (13.5 percent) due to account growth,
revenue enhancement initiatives and transaction-related fees.
Commercial products revenue increased by $9.2 million
(9.3 percent) over the fourth quarter of 2003, primarily
due to syndication fees and commercial leasing revenue. The
favorable variance year-over-year in mortgage banking revenue of
$4.1 million (4.5 percent) was primarily due to higher
loan servicing revenue. The $1.2 million (3.3 percent)
increase in investment product fees and commissions reflected
higher sales activity in the Consumer Banking business line.
Other income was higher year-over-year by $51.1 million
(55.4 percent), primarily due to a favorable change in
end-of-term lease residual gains (losses) and revenue from
equity investments relative to the same quarter of 2003.
Partially offsetting these positive variances were trust and
investment management fees, which declined by $5.9 million
(2.4 percent) in the fourth quarter of 2004 from the same
period of 2003, and treasury management fees, which declined by
$6.5 million (5.6 percent) year-over-year. Trust and
investment management fees declined as gains from equity market
valuations were more than offset by lower fees, partially due to
a change in the mix of fund balances and customers’
migration from paying for services with fees to paying with
compensating balances. The decrease in treasury management fees
was primarily due to higher earnings credit on customers’
compensating balances and the impact of an industry-wide shift
of payments from paper-based to electronic and card-based
transactions.

Total noninterest expense was
$1,578.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2004, compared
with $1,342.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2003. The
increase in noninterest expense of $235.6 million
(17.6 percent) was primarily driven by a
$112.5 million charge related to the prepayment of the
Company’s long-term debt and a $31.9 million
unfavorable change in the valuation of mortgage servicing

rights, as well as operating expenses related to
the expansion of the Company’s merchant acquiring business
in Europe of $24.2 million. The MSR impairment results from
a flattening yield curve despite recent increases in short-term
interest rates. The expense growth also reflected increases in
compensation, employee benefits, technology and communications
and postage, printing and supplies. Compensation expense was
higher year-over-year by $39.8 million (7.4 percent)
due to increases in salaries and stock-based compensation. The
increase in salaries reflected business expansion of in-store
branches, the expansion of the Company’s merchant acquiring
business in Europe and other initiatives. Stock-based
compensation was higher due to lower forfeitures relative to
prior years. Employee benefits increased year-over-year by
$16.7 million (20.5 percent), primarily as a result of
a $13.5 million increase in pension expense and higher
payroll taxes. Technology and communications expense rose by
$9.4 million (8.8 percent), reflecting technology
investments that increased software expense amortization and the
write-off of capitalized software being replaced. Postage,
printing and supplies expense was higher by $3.1 million
(5.0 percent), primarily due to new consumer credit card
accounts. The fourth quarter of 2004 included
$112.5 million of charges related to the prepayment of a
portion of the Company’s long-term debt. Other expense was
higher in the fourth quarter than the same quarter of 2003 by
$25.1 million (15.2 percent). The year-over-year
increase reflected increases in loan-related expense, affordable
housing operating costs and processing costs for payment
services products, the result of increases in transaction volume
year-over-year. Slightly offsetting these unfavorable variances
was marketing and business development expense, which was lower
by $1.9 million (3.7 percent), reflecting the timing
of marketing campaigns.

The provision for credit losses was
$65.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2004 and
$286.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2003, a decrease
of $221.0 million (77.3 percent). Net charge-offs in
the fourth quarter of 2004 were $163.6 million, compared
with net charge-offs of $285.1 million during the fourth
quarter of 2003. The decline from a year ago primarily reflected
the release of the allowance for credit losses of
$98.5 million, improving credit quality and changing
economic conditions.

LINE OF BUSINESS FINANCIAL REVIEW

Within the Company, financial performance is
measured by major lines of business, which include Wholesale
Banking, Consumer Banking, Private Client, Trust and Asset
Management, Payment Services, and Treasury and Corporate
Support. These operating segments are components of the Company
about which financial information is available and is evaluated
regularly in deciding how to allocate resources and assess
performance.

Basis for Financial Presentation

Business line results are derived from
the Company’s business unit profitability reporting systems
by specifically attributing managed balance sheet assets,
deposits and other liabilities and their related income or
expense. Funds transfer-pricing methodologies are utilized to
allocate a cost of funds used or credit for funds provided to
all business line assets and liabilities using a matched funding
concept. Also, the business unit is allocated the
taxable-equivalent benefit of tax-exempt products. Noninterest
income and expenses directly managed by each business line,
including fees, service charges, salaries and benefits, and
other direct costs are accounted for within each segment’s
financial results in a manner similar to the consolidated
financial statements. Occupancy costs are allocated based on
utilization of facilities by the lines of business. Noninterest
expenses incurred by centrally managed operations or business
lines that directly support another business line’s
operations are charged to the applicable business line based on
its utilization of those services primarily measured by the
volume of customer activities. These allocated expenses are
reported as net shared services expense. Certain corporate
activities that do not directly support the operations of the
lines of business are not charged to the lines of business.
Goodwill and other intangible assets are assigned to the lines
of business based on the mix of business of the acquired entity.
The provision for credit losses within the Wholesale Banking,
Consumer Banking, Private Client, Trust and Asset Management and
Payment Services lines of business is based on net charge-offs,
while Treasury and Corporate Support reflects the residual
component of the Company’s total consolidated provision for
credit losses determined in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States. Income taxes
are assessed to each line of business at a standard tax rate
with the residual tax expense or benefit to arrive at the
consolidated effective tax rate included in Treasury and
Corporate Support. Merger and restructuring-related charges,
discontinued operations and cumulative effects of changes in
accounting principles are not identified by or allocated to
lines of business. Within the Company, capital levels are
evaluated and managed centrally; however, capital is allocated
to the operating segments to support evaluation of business
performance. Capital allocations to the business lines are based
on the amount of goodwill and other intangibles, the extent of
off-balance sheet managed assets and lending commitments and the
ratio of on-balance sheet assets relative to the total Company.
Certain lines of business, such as Trust and Asset Management,
have no significant balance sheet components. For these business


U.S. BANCORP


units, capital is allocated taking into
consideration fiduciary and operational risk, capital levels of
independent organizations operating similar businesses, and
regulatory requirements.

Designations, assignments and allocations change
from time to time as management systems are enhanced, methods of
evaluating performance or product lines change or business
segments are realigned to better respond to our diverse customer
base. During 2004, certain organization and methodology changes
were made and, accordingly, 2003 results were restated and
presented on a comparable basis. Due to organizational and
methodology changes, the Company’s basis of financial
presentation differed in 2002. The presentation of comparative
business line results for 2002 is not practical and has not been
provided.

Wholesale Banking

offers lending, depository, treasury
management and other financial services to middle market, large
corporate and public sector clients. Wholesale Banking
contributed $1,079.6 million of the Company’s
operating earnings in 2004 and $850.3 million in 2003. The
increase in operating earnings in 2004 was driven by reductions
in the provision for credit losses and total noninterest
expense, partially offset by a decline in total net revenue,
compared with 2003.

Total net revenue decreased $65.2 million
(2.7 percent) in 2004, compared with 2003. Net interest
income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, decreased
$55.9 million (3.4 percent), compared with 2003, as
average loans decreased $2.0 billion (4.6 percent) in
2004, average non-interest bearing deposits decreased
$2.1 billion (13.9 percent) and average savings
products declined $1.2 billion, compared with 2003. The
decline in average loans in 2004 was driven in part by soft
commercial loan demand through mid 2004, in addition to the
Company’s decisions to tighten credit availability to
certain types of lending products, industries and customers and
reductions due to asset workout strategies. This decline was
partially offset by the consolidation of the commercial loan
conduit onto the Company’s balance sheet during the third
quarter of 2003. Loan spreads declined from a year ago due in
part to competitive pricing and the consolidation of the high
credit quality, low margin loans from the commercial loan
conduit during 2003, partially offset by higher interest
recoveries in 2004 on previously charged-off loans. While
average noninterest-bearing deposits decreased 13.9 percent
in 2004, compared with 2003, due to reductions in government and
mortgage-related deposits, the net interest spread on total
deposits increased due to the funding benefit associated with
the impact of rising interest rates over the second half of
2004. The decline in mortgage-related deposits reflected lower
production of mortgage banking businesses while the decline in
government deposits was primarily due to a decision by the
Federal government to pay fees for treasury management services
rather than maintain compensating balances. Noninterest income
decreased $10.8 million (1.4 percent) in 2004 to
$750.1 million, compared to 2003 noninterest income of
$760.9 million. The decrease in noninterest income in 2004
was principally due to lower commercial products revenue
resulting from the consolidation of the commercial loan conduit
in 2003. This revenue reduction was partially offset by growth
in treasury management-related fees, international banking,
syndication and customer derivative fees, equipment leasing and
foreign exchange revenue. Treasury management-related fees were
higher primarily due to a change in the Federal
government’s payment methodology for treasury management
services to fees for services rather than maintaining
compensating balances in the third quarter of 2003, partially
offset by higher interest earnings credit on customers’
compensating balances and the impact of an industry-wide shift
of payments from paper-based to electronic and card-based
transactions.

Noninterest expense was $643.5 million in
2004, compared with $686.1 million in 2003. The
$42.6 million decrease (6.2 percent) was primarily
driven by lower personnel-related costs, software expenses, loan
workout expenses and net shared services expense. Loan workout
expenses declined in 2004 as the credit quality of the loan
portfolio has improved. Net shared services expenses were lower
due to changes in transaction volumes related to customer
accounts.

The provision for credit losses was
$22.6 million and $405.5 million in 2004 and 2003,
respectively, a decline of $382.9 million
(94.4 percent). The favorable change in the provision for
credit losses for Wholesale Banking business is due to improving
net charge-offs, which declined to .05 percent of average
loans in 2004 from .91 percent of average loans in 2003.
The reduction in net charge-offs was attributable, in part, to
increased levels of commercial loan recoveries, in addition to
improvements in credit quality driven by initiatives taken by
the Company during the past three years, including asset workout
strategies and reductions in commitments to certain industries
and customers. Commercial loan recoveries are anticipated to
return to more normalized levels during future periods.
Nonperforming assets within Wholesale Banking were
$391.1 million at December 31, 2004, compared with
$743.6 million at December 31, 2003. Nonperforming
assets as a percentage of end-of-period loans were
..90 percent at December 31, 2004 and 1.76 percent
at December 31, 2003. Refer to the “Corporate Risk
Profile” section for further information on factors
impacting the credit quality of the loan portfolios.

U.S. BANCORP



Consumer Banking

delivers products and services to the
broad consumer market and small businesses through banking
offices, telemarketing, on-line services, direct mail and
automated teller machines (“ATMs”). It encompasses
community banking, metropolitan banking, small business banking,
including lending guaranteed by the Small Business
Administration, small-ticket leasing, consumer lending, mortgage
banking, workplace banking, student banking, 24-hour banking and
investment product and insurance sales. Consumer Banking
contributed $1,465.0 million of the Company’s
operating earnings for 2004 and $1,333.7 million for 2003,
a 9.8 percent increase over 2003. The increase in operating
earnings in 2004 was driven by strong fee-based revenues, lower
noninterest expense and reductions in the provision for credit
losses, compared with 2003. Within Consumer Banking, the retail
banking business grew operating earnings by 23.1 percent,
offset somewhat by a lower contribution from the mortgage
banking business, compared with the same periods of 2003.

Total net revenue increased $24.4 million
(.5 percent) in 2004, compared with 2003, as growth in net
interest income and noninterest income was partially offset by a
reduction in securities gains (losses) associated with the
mortgage banking business. Net interest income, on a
taxable-equivalent basis, increased $57.8 million
(1.6 percent). Fee-based revenue increased
$243.8 million (15.7 percent) and securities gains
(losses) decreased $277.2 million. The year-over-year
increase in net interest income was due to growth in average
loan balances, improved spreads on commercial and commercial
real estate loans, growth in noninterest-bearing and savings
product deposit balances and the funding benefit of total
deposits due to rising interest rates. Partially offsetting
these increases was the decline in average mortgage loans held
for sale, reduced spreads on retail loans due to the competitive

pricing for consumer loans and lower loan fees.
The increase in average loan balances of 8.7 percent
reflected retail loan growth of 8.0 percent and growth in
residential mortgages of 23.0 percent in 2004, compared
with 2003. Included within the retail loan category are
second-lien home equity loans that had a growth rate of
5.3 percent. The category of residential mortgages includes
first-lien home equity loans, which had a growth rate of
19.1 percent in 2004, compared with 2003. On a combined
basis, first and second-lien home equity products increased
$1.5 billion, or 9.2 percent, compared with a year
ago. The year-over-year growth of traditional residential
mortgages was $1.7 billion, or 25.8 percent reflecting
the Company’s decisions to retain adjustable-rate
residential mortgages. Commercial real estate loan balances
increased 6.3 percent while commercial loans decreased
5.4 percent in 2004, compared with 2003. The year-over-year
decrease in average deposits (.6 percent) was due to a
reduction in time deposit balances (13.5 percent), offset
by growth in noninterest-bearing deposits (1.6 percent),
interest checking (11.3 percent), savings
(4.5 percent) and money market account (.3 percent)
balances. The decline in lower margin time deposits primarily
reflected a shift in product mix towards savings products.

Fee-based noninterest income was
$1,794.2 million in 2004, $243.8 million
(15.7 percent) higher compared with 2003. The
year-over-year growth in fee-based revenue was driven by deposit
service charges, mortgage banking revenue, commercial products
revenue, investment products fees and commissions, lower
end-of-term lease residual losses and a residual value insurance
recovery, partially offset by lower treasury management revenue.
Securities gains (losses) were $(83.8) million in 2004, a
net decrease of $277.2 million from a year ago. The Company
utilizes its investment portfolio as a balance sheet economic
hedge against the valuation risk of the portfolio of mortgage
servicing rights.

U.S. BANCORP



Noninterest expense was $2,668.8 million in
2004, compared with $2,794.6 million for 2003, a decrease
of $125.8 million (4.5 percent). The year-over-year
decrease in noninterest expense was primarily attributable to
lower levels of MSR impairment, reductions in intangible
amortization, depreciation and software expense and net shared
services expense, partially offset by increases in compensation
and occupancy costs related to new in-store branch expansion
along with higher amortization costs from growth in the mortgage
servicing portfolio. MSR impairment was $56.8 million in
2004, compared with $208.7 million in 2003, a decrease of
$151.9 million year-over-year. The change in MSR valuations
was driven by declining interest rates and refinancing
activities in early 2004, partially offset by rising interest
rates and slower prepayment speeds in late 2004, compared with
the declining interest rates and refinancing activities of 2003.

The provision for credit losses decreased
$56.0 million (13.0 percent) in 2004, compared with
2003. The improvement in the provision for credit losses in 2004
was primarily attributable to lower net charge-offs. As a
percentage of average loans, net charge-offs declined to
..59 percent in 2004, compared with .74 percent in
2003. The decline in net charge-offs included the commercial,
commercial real estate and retail loan portfolios. The
improvement in commercial and commercial real estate loan net
charge-offs within Consumer Banking of $19.7 million was
broad-based across most industry and geographical regions.
Retail loan net charge-offs declined by $40.3 million,
primarily resulting from ongoing collection efforts and risk
management activities. Nonperforming assets within Consumer
Banking were $348.9 million at December 31, 2004,
compared with $393.4 million at December 31, 2003.
Nonperforming assets as a percentage of end-of-period loans were
..56 percent at December 31, 2004 and .69 percent
at December 31, 2003. Refer to the “Corporate Risk
Profile” section for further information on factors
impacting the credit quality of the loan portfolios.

Private Client, Trust and Asset Management

provides trust, private banking,
financial advisory, investment management and mutual fund
servicing through five businesses: Private Client Group,
Corporate Trust, Asset Management, Institutional Trust and
Custody and Fund Services, LLC. Private Client, Trust and
Asset Management contributed $439.5 million of the
Company’s operating earnings in 2004 and
$388.6 million in 2003, an increase of $50.9 million
(13.1 percent) compared with 2003. The growth was
attributable to higher total net revenue and lower noninterest
expense, partially offset by an increase in the provision for
credit losses.

Total net revenue was $1,348.1 million in
2004, an increase of 6.2 percent, compared with 2003. Net
interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, increased
$49.1 million (15.7 percent) in 2004, compared with
2003. The increase in net interest income in 2004 was due to
growth in total average deposits of 25.4 percent
attributable to growth in noninterest-bearing deposits, savings
products and time deposits primarily within corporate trust and
private banking, the favorable impact of rising interest rates
on the funding benefit of customer deposits and higher average
loans (3.8 percent), partially offset by a decline in loan
spreads. Noninterest income increased $30.1 million
(3.1 percent) in 2004, compared with 2003. The increase in
noninterest income was primarily attributable to improvement in
equity capital market conditions and related fees, partially
offset by a change in customer payment methodology for certain
corporate trust services clients from fees to compensating
balances.

Noninterest expense decreased $4.5 million
(.7 percent) in 2004, compared with 2003, primarily
attributable to reductions in personnel-related costs, lower
intangible amortization and net shared services expense
partially offset by higher losses and outside data processing
costs.

The provision for credit losses increased
$3.7 million (56.9 percent) in 2004, compared with
2003. The year-over-year increase in the provision for credit
losses was primarily due to higher commercial loan net
charge-offs in 2004 partially offset by lower retail loan net
charge-offs. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans
were .21 percent in 2004, compared with .14 percent in
2003.

Payment Services

includes consumer and business credit
cards, debit cards, corporate and purchasing card services,
consumer lines of credit, ATM processing and merchant
processing. Payment Services contributed $716.5 million of
the Company’s operating earnings in 2004 and
$596.0 million in 2003, a 20.2 percent increase over
2003. The increases were due to growth in total net revenue
driven by higher transaction volumes and reductions in the
provision for credit losses, partially offset by increases in
total noninterest expense.

Total net revenue was $2,446.3 million in
2004, a 10.6 percent increase, compared with 2003. Net
interest income decreased 5.3 percent in 2004, compared
with 2003, primarily due to higher corporate payment card
balances, higher corporate card rebates, a reduction in customer
late fees and a lower percentage of revolving credit card
balances relative to a year ago. The impact of these factors was
partially offset by total average consumer loan growth of
6.3 percent in 2004, compared with 2003. Noninterest income
increased 16.6 percent in 2004, compared with 2003. The
increase in fee-based revenue in 2004 was driven by strong
growth in credit card and debit card revenue
(16.0 percent), corporate payment product revenues
(12.6 percent), ATM processing services revenue


U.S. BANCORP


(8.7 percent) and merchant processing
revenue (20.1 percent). The $89.0 million growth in
credit and debit card revenue was muted somewhat by the impact
of the settlement of the debit card antitrust litigation brought
against VISA USA and MasterCard by Wal-Mart stores, Sears
Roebuck and Co. and other retailers, which lowered interchange
rates on signature debit transactions beginning in August 2003.
The change in interchange rate, in addition to higher customer
loyalty rewards expense, was more than offset by higher
transaction volumes and rate changes. Corporate payment products
revenue increased $45.5 million due to increases in sales
volume and pricing enhancements. ATM processing services revenue
increased $9.5 million due to transaction growth and new
product sales. Merchant processing revenue increased
$113.1 million due to increases in sales and transaction
processing volumes and the expansion of the merchant acquiring
business in Europe, which accounted for approximately
$58.6 million of the revenue growth. Other revenue
increased $8.1 million in 2004, compared with 2003, due to
increases in insurance product revenue and EuroConex.

Noninterest expense was $957.2 million in
2004, an increase of $94.9 million (11.0 percent),
compared with 2003. The increase in noninterest expense was
primarily attributable to higher compensation and employee
benefit costs for processing associated with increased credit
and debit card transaction volumes, corporate payment products
and merchant processing sales volumes, in addition to higher
merchant acquiring costs resulting from the expansion of the
merchant acquiring business in Europe, which accounted for
approximately $56.8 million of the increase in 2004.

The provision for credit losses was
$362.6 million in 2004, a decrease of $50.1 million
(12.1 percent), compared with 2003, due to lower net
charge-offs of the business line. As a percentage of average
loans, net charge-offs were 3.42 percent in 2004, compared
with 4.13 percent of average loans in 2003. The favorable
change in credit losses was due to improvements in ongoing
collection efforts and risk management activities, as well as
improvements in economic conditions from a year ago.

Treasury and Corporate Support

includes the Company’s investment
portfolios, funding, capital management and asset securitization
activities, interest rate risk management, the net effect of
transfer pricing related to average balances and the residual
aggregate of expenses associated with business activities
managed on a corporate basis, including enterprise-wide
operations and administrative support functions. Operational
expenses incurred by Treasury and Corporate Support on behalf of
the other business lines are allocated back primarily based on
customer transaction volume and account activities to the
appropriate business unit and are identified as net shared
services expense. Treasury and Corporate Support recorded
operating earnings of $466.2 million in 2004, a decrease of
18.5 percent, compared with 2003.

Total net revenue was $1,154.6 million in
2004, compared with total net revenue of $1,298.7 million
in 2003. The year-over-year decline of $144.1 million
(11.1 percent) in total net revenue in 2004 was
attributable to reductions in net interest income of
$96.6 million (9.2 percent) and securities gains
(losses) of $74.0 million, partially offset by increases in
fee-based noninterest income of $26.5 million
(13.7 percent). The decrease in net interest income was
primarily attributable to the Company’s asset/liability
management decisions to invest in adjustable-rate securities and
utilize higher-cost fixed-rate funding given the current rising
interest rate environment. It also reflects the residual effect
of transfer pricing caused by changes in the mix of earning
assets and the yield curve from a year ago. The increase in
fee-based noninterest income was primarily attributable to
higher equity investment revenue. Net securities losses of
$22.6 million in 2004 were principally related to
asset/liability decisions, compared with net securities gains of
$51.4 million in 2003.

Noninterest expense was $868.0 million in
2004, compared with $556.2 million in 2003, a
$311.8 million increase (56.1 percent). The increase
in noninterest expense was principally driven by several
factors. Stock-based compensation was higher by
$33.8 million primarily due to lower employee stock-award
forfeitures relative to a year ago. Pension expenses increased
$35.5 million reflecting recognition of deferred actuarial
(gains) losses resulting from lower asset returns in prior
years. Debt prepayment costs of $154.8 million were
incurred as a result of prepaying borrowings in connection with
asset/liability management activities during 2004. Corporate
insurance costs increased by $17.0 million from a year ago
primarily due to premium increases by insurance carriers.
Additionally, operating costs associated with incremental
investments in affordable housing increased $20.4 million
from a year ago. Finally, the residual in costs associated with
centralized support functions that were not allocated to other
business lines increased by $27.7 million.

The provision for credit losses for this business
unit represents the residual aggregate of the net credit losses
allocated to the reportable business units and the
Company’s recorded provision determined in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
The provision for credit losses was a net recovery of
$100.9 million in 2004, compared with a net recovery of
$1.8 million in 2003. The favorable variance is primarily
due to the Company’s decision to reduce the allowance for
credit losses by approximately $98.5 million in 2004,
reflecting the continued improvement in credit quality and

U.S. BANCORP



economic conditions. Refer to the “Corporate
Risk Profile” section for further information on the
provision for credit losses, nonperforming assets and factors
considered by the Company in assessing the credit quality of the
loan portfolio and establishing the allowance for credit losses.

Income taxes are assessed to each line of
business at a standard tax rate with the residual tax expense or
benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate
included in Treasury and Corporate Support.

ACCOUNTING CHANGES

Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements discusses accounting standards recently
issued but not yet required to be adopted and the expected
impact of the changes in accounting standards. To the extent the
adoption of new accounting standards affects the Company’s
financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, the
impacts are discussed in the applicable section(s) of the
Management’s Discussion and Analysis and the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

On January 8, 2004, the Company elected to
adopt the “fair value” method of accounting for
stock-based compensation. The Company implemented this
accounting change utilizing the “retroactive restatement
method,” requiring all prior periods to be restated to
recognize compensation expense for the estimated fair value of
all employee stock awards including stock options granted,
modified or settled in fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 1994.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The accounting and reporting policies of the
Company comply with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States and conform to general practices within the
banking industry. The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to make estimates and assumptions. The
financial position and results of operations can be affected by
these estimates and assumptions, which are integral to
understanding the Company’s financial statements. Critical
accounting policies are those policies that management believes
are the most important to the portrayal of the Company’s
financial condition and results, and require management to make
estimates that are difficult, subjective or complex. Most
accounting policies are not considered by management to be
critical accounting policies. Several factors are considered in
determining whether or not a policy is critical in the
preparation of financial statements. These factors include,
among other things, whether the estimates are significant to the
financial statements, the nature of the estimates, the ability
to readily validate the estimates with other information
including third-parties or available prices, and sensitivity of
the estimates to changes in economic conditions and whether
alternative accounting methods may be utilized under generally
accepted accounting principles. Management has discussed the
development and the selection of critical accounting policies
with the Company’s Audit Committee.

Significant accounting policies are discussed in
Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Those policies considered to be critical accounting policies are
described below.

Allowance for Credit Losses

The allowance for credit losses is
established to provide for probable losses inherent in the
Company’s credit portfolio. The methods utilized to
estimate the allowance for credit losses, key assumptions and
quantitative and qualitative information considered by
management in determining the adequacy of the allowance for
credit losses are discussed in the “Credit Risk
Management” section.

Management’s evaluation of the adequacy of
the allowance for credit losses is often the most critical of
accounting estimates for a banking institution. It is an
inherently subjective process impacted by many factors as
discussed throughout the Management’s Discussion and
Analysis section of the Annual Report. Although risk management
practices, methodologies and other tools are utilized to
determine each element of the allowance, degrees of imprecision
exist in these measurement tools due in part to subjective
judgments involved and an inherent lagging of credit quality
measurements relative to the stage of the business cycle. Even
determining the stage of the business cycle is highly
subjective. As discussed in the “Analysis and Determination
of Allowance for Credit Losses” section, management
considers the effect of imprecision and many other factors in
determining the allowance for credit losses by establishing an
“allowance for other factors” that is not specifically
allocated to a category of loans. If not considered, inherent
losses in the portfolio related to imprecision and other
subjective factors could have a dramatic adverse impact on the
liquidity and financial viability of a bank.

Given the many subjective factors affecting the
credit portfolio, changes in the allowance for credit losses may
not directly coincide with changes in the risk ratings of the
credit portfolio reflected in the risk rating process. This is
in part due to the timing of the risk rating process in relation
to changes in the business cycle, the exposure and mix of loans
within risk rating categories, levels of nonperforming loans and
the timing of charge-offs and recoveries. For example, the
amount of loans within specific risk ratings may change,
providing a leading indicator of improving credit quality, while
nonperforming loans and net charge-offs continue at elevated
levels. Also, inherent loss ratios,


U.S. BANCORP


determined through migration analysis and
historical loss performance over the estimated business cycle of
a loan, may not change to the same degree as net charge-offs.
Because risk ratings and inherent loss ratios primarily drive
the allowance specifically allocated to commercial loans, the
amount of the allowance for commercial and commercial real
estate loans might decline; however, the degree of change
differs somewhat from the level of changes in nonperforming
loans and net charge-offs. Also, management would maintain an
adequate allowance for credit losses by increasing the allowance
for other factors during period of economic uncertainty or
changes in the business cycle.

Some factors considered in determining the
adequacy of the allowance for credit losses are quantifiable
while other factors require qualitative judgment. Management
conducts analysis with respect to the accuracy of risk ratings
and the volatility of inherent losses, and utilizes this
analysis along with qualitative factors including uncertainty in
the economy from changes in unemployment rates, the level of
bankruptcies, concentration risks, including risks associated
with the transportation sector and highly leveraged
enterprise-value credits, in determining the overall level of
the allowance for credit losses. The Company’s
determination of the allowance for commercial and commercial
real estate loans is sensitive to the assigned credit risk
ratings and inherent loss rates at December 31, 2004. In
the event that 10 percent of loans within these portfolios
experienced downgrades of two risk categories, the allowance for
commercial and commercial real estate would increase by
approximately $250 million at December 31, 2004. In
the event that inherent loss or estimated loss rates for these
portfolios increased by 10 percent, the allowance
determined for commercial and commercial real estate would
increase by approximately $95 million at December 31,
2004. The Company’s determination of the allowance for
residential and retail loans is sensitive to changes in
estimated loss rates. In the event that estimated loss rates
increased by 10%, the allowance for residential and retail loans
would increase by approximately $65 million at
December 31, 2004. Because several quantitative and
qualitative factors are considered in determining the allowance
for credit losses, these sensitivity analyses do not necessarily
reflect the nature and extent of future changes in the allowance
for credit losses. They are intended to provide insights into
the impact of adverse changes in risk rating and inherent losses
and do not imply any expectation of future deterioration in the
risk rating or loss rates. Given current processes employed by
the Company, management believes the risk ratings and inherent
loss rates currently assigned are appropriate. It is possible
that others, given the same information, may at any point in
time reach different reasonable conclusions that could be
significant to the Company’s financial statements. Refer to
the “Analysis and Determination of the Allowance for Credit
Losses” section for further information.

Mortgage Servicing Rights

MSRs are capitalized as separate
assets when loans are sold and servicing is retained. The total
cost of loans sold is allocated between the loans sold and the
servicing assets retained based on their relative fair values.
MSRs that are purchased from others are initially recorded at
cost. The carrying value of the MSRs is amortized in proportion
to and over the period of estimated net servicing revenue and
recorded in noninterest expense as amortization of intangible
assets. The carrying value of these assets is periodically
reviewed for impairment using a lower of carrying value or fair
value methodology. For purposes of measuring impairment, the
servicing rights are stratified based on the underlying loan
type and note rate and the carrying value for each stratum is
compared to fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis,
utilizing current prepayment speeds and discount rates. Events
that may significantly affect the estimates used are changes in
interest rates and the related impact on mortgage loan
prepayment speeds and the payment performance of the underlying
loans. If the carrying value is greater than fair value,
impairment is recognized through a valuation allowance for each
impaired stratum and recorded as amortization of intangible
assets. The reduction in the fair value of MSRs at
December 31, 2004, to immediate 25 and 50 basis point
adverse changes in interest rates would be approximately
$133 million and $258 million, respectively. An upward
movement in interest rates at December 31, 2004, of 25 and
50 basis points would increase the value of the MSRs by
approximately $109 million and $177 million,
respectively. Refer to Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information regarding MSRs.

Goodwill and Other Intangibles

The Company records all assets and
liabilities acquired in purchase acquisitions, including
goodwill and other intangibles, at fair value as required by
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141,
“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” Goodwill and
indefinite-lived assets are no longer amortized but are subject,
at a minimum, to annual tests for impairment. Under certain
situations, interim impairment tests may be required if events
occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not
reduce the fair value of a reporting segment below its carrying
amount. Other intangible assets are amortized over their
estimated useful lives using straight-line and accelerated
methods and are subject to impairment if events or circumstances
indicate a possible inability to realize the carrying amount.

The initial recognition of goodwill and other
intangible assets and subsequent impairment analysis require

U.S. BANCORP



management to make subjective judgments
concerning estimates of how the acquired assets will perform in
the future using valuation methods including discounted cash
flow analysis. Additionally, estimated cash flows may extend
beyond ten years and, by their nature, are difficult to
determine over an extended timeframe. Events and factors that
may significantly affect the estimates include, among others,
competitive forces, customer behaviors and attrition, changes in
revenue growth trends, cost structures, technology, changes in
discount rates and specific industry and market conditions. In
determining the reasonableness of cash flow estimates, the
Company reviews historical performance of the underlying assets
or similar assets in an effort to assess and validate
assumptions utilized in its estimates.

In assessing the fair value of reporting units,
the Company may consider the stage of the current business cycle
and potential changes in market conditions in estimating the
timing and extent of future cash flows. Also, management often
utilizes other information to validate the reasonableness of its
valuations including public market comparables, and multiples of
recent mergers and acquisitions of similar businesses. Valuation
multiples may be based on revenue, price-to-earnings and
tangible capital ratios of comparable public companies and
business segments. These multiples may be adjusted to consider
competitive differences including size, operating leverage and
other factors. The carrying amount of a reporting unit is
determined based on the capital required to support the
reporting unit’s activities including its tangible and
intangible assets. The determination of a reporting unit’s
capital allocation requires management judgment and considers
many factors including the regulatory capital regulations and
capital characteristics of comparable public companies in
relevant industry sectors. In certain circumstances, management
will engage a third-party to independently validate its
assessment of the fair value of its business segments.

The Company’s annual assessment of potential
goodwill impairment was completed during the second quarter of
2004. Based on the results of this assessment, no goodwill
impairment was recognized.

Income Taxes

The Company estimates income tax
expense based on amounts expected to be owed to various tax
jurisdictions. Currently, the Company files tax returns in
approximately 140 federal, state and local domestic
jurisdictions and 6 foreign jurisdictions. The estimated income
tax expense is reported in the Consolidated Statement of Income.
Accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due or to be
received from taxing jurisdictions either currently or in the
future and are reported in other assets or other liabilities on
the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In estimating accrued taxes, the
Company assesses the relative merits and risks of the
appropriate tax treatment considering statutory, judicial and
regulatory guidance in the context of the tax position. Because
of the complexity of tax laws and regulations, interpretation
can be difficult and subject to legal judgment given specific
facts and circumstances. It is possible that others, given the
same information, may at any point in time reach different
reasonable conclusions regarding the estimated amounts of
accrued taxes.

Changes in the estimate of accrued taxes occur
periodically due to changes in tax rates, interpretations of tax
laws, the status of examinations being conducted by various
taxing authorities, and newly enacted statutory, judicial and
regulatory guidance that impact the relative merits and risks of
tax positions. These changes, when they occur, affect accrued
taxes and can be significant to the operating results of the
Company. Refer to Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information regarding income
taxes.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Under the supervision and with the participation
of the Company’s management, including its principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, the Company
has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of
its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”)). Based upon this
evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal
financial officer have concluded that, as of the end of the
period covered by this report, the Company’s disclosure
controls and procedures were effective to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports
that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms.

During the most recently completed fiscal
quarter, there was no change made in the Company’s internal
controls over financial reporting (as defined in
Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that
has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting.

The annual report of the Company’s
management on internal control over financial reporting is
provided on page 106. The attestation report of Ernst &
Young LLP, the Company’s independent accountants, regarding
the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is
provided on page 107.

STATEMENTS

Note 1

Significant Accounting Policies

U.S. Bancorp and its subsidiaries (the
“Company”) is a multi-state financial services holding
company headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The Company
provides a full range of financial services including lending
and depository services through banking offices principally in
24 states. The Company also engages in credit card,
merchant, and ATM processing, mortgage banking, insurance, trust
and investment management, brokerage, and leasing activities
principally in domestic markets.

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. The
consolidation eliminates all significant intercompany accounts
and transactions. Certain items in prior periods have been
reclassified to conform to the current presentation.

Uses of Estimates

The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
accompanying notes. Actual experience could differ from those
estimates.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS

Within the Company, financial performance is
measured by major lines of business based on the products and
services provided to customers through its distribution
channels. The Company has five reportable operating segments:

Wholesale Banking

offers lending, depository, treasury
management and other financial services to middle market, large
corporate and public sector clients.

Consumer Banking

delivers products and services to the
broad consumer market and small businesses through banking
offices, telemarketing, on-line services, direct mail and
automated teller machines (“ATMs”).

Private Client, Trust and Asset Management

provides trust, private banking,
financial advisory, investment management and mutual fund
servicing to affluent individuals, businesses, institutions and
mutual funds.

Payment Services

includes consumer and business credit
cards, debit cards, corporate and purchasing card services,
consumer lines of credit, ATM processing and merchant
processing. Customized products and services, coupled with
cutting-edge technology are provided to consumer and business
customers, government clients, correspondent financial
institutions, merchants and co-brand partners.

Treasury and Corporate Support

includes the Company’s investment
portfolios, funding, capital management and asset securitization
activities, interest rate risk management, the net effect of
transfer pricing related to average balances, and the residual
aggregate of expenses associated with business activities
managed on a corporate basis, including enterprise-wide
operations and administrative support functions.

Segment Results

Accounting policies for the lines of
business are the same as those used in preparation of the
consolidated financial statements with respect to activities
specifically attributable to each business line. However, the
preparation of business line results requires management to
establish methodologies to allocate funding costs and benefits,
expenses and other financial elements to each line of business.
For details of these methodologies and segment results, see
“Basis for Financial Presentation” and Table 22
“Line of Business Financial Performance” included in
Management’s Discussion and Analysis which is incorporated
by reference into these Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

SECURITIES

Realized gains or losses on securities are
determined on a trade date basis based on the specific carrying
value of the investments being sold.

Trading Securities

Debt and equity securities held for
resale are classified as trading securities and reported at fair
value. Realized gains or losses are reported in noninterest
income.

Available-for-sale Securities

These securities are not trading
securities but may be sold before maturity in response to
changes in the Company’s interest rate risk profile,
funding needs or demand for collateralized deposits by public
entities. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair
value with unrealized net gains or losses reported within other
comprehensive income in shareholders’ equity. When sold,
the amortized cost of the specific securities is used to compute
the gain or loss. Declines in fair value that are deemed
other-than-temporary, if any, are reported in noninterest income.

Held-to-maturity Securities

Debt securities for which the Company
has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are
reported at historical cost adjusted for amortization of
premiums and accretion of discounts.


U.S. BANCORP


Declines in fair value that are deemed other than
temporary, if any, are reported in noninterest income.

Securities Purchased Under Agreements to
Resell and Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase

Securities purchased under agreements
to resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are
generally accounted for as collateralized financing transactions
and are recorded at the amounts at which the securities were
acquired or sold, plus accrued interest. Securities pledged as
collateral under these financing arrangements cannot be sold or
repledged by the secured party. The fair value of collateral
received is continually monitored and additional collateral
obtained or requested to be returned to the Company as deemed
appropriate.

EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN OPERATING ENTITIES

Equity investments in public entities in which
ownership is less than 20 percent are accounted for as
available-for-sale securities and carried at fair value. Similar
investments in private entities are accounted for using the cost
method. Investments in entities where ownership interest is
between 20 percent and 50 percent are accounted for
using the equity method with the exception of limited
partnerships and limited liability companies where an ownership
interest of greater than 5 percent requires the use of the
equity method. If the Company has a voting interest greater than
50 percent, the consolidation method is used. All equity
investments are evaluated for impairment at least annually and
more frequently if certain criteria are met.

LOANS

Loans are reported net of unearned income.
Interest income is accrued on the unpaid principal balances as
earned. Loan and commitment fees and certain direct loan
origination costs are deferred and recognized over the life of
the loan and/or commitment period as yield adjustments.

Commitments to Extend Credit

Unfunded residential mortgage loan
commitments entered into in connection with mortgage banking
activities are considered derivatives and recorded on the
balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value recorded
in income. All other unfunded loan commitments are generally
related to providing credit facilities to customers of the bank
and are not actively traded financial instruments. These
unfunded commitments are disclosed as off-balance sheet
financial instruments in Note 24 in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Allowance for Credit Losses

Management determines the adequacy of
the allowance based on evaluations of the loan portfolio, recent
loss experience, and other pertinent factors, including economic
conditions. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it
requires estimates, including amounts of future cash collections
expected on nonaccrual loans, which may be susceptible to
significant change. The allowance for credit losses relating to
impaired loans is based on the loan’s observable market
price, the collateral for certain collateral-dependent loans, or
the discounted cash flows using the loan’s effective
interest rate.

The Company determines the amount of the
allowance required for certain sectors based on relative risk
characteristics of the loan portfolio. The allowance recorded
for commercial loans is based on quarterly reviews of individual
credit relationships and an analysis of the migration of
commercial loans and actual loss experience. The allowance
recorded for homogeneous consumer loans is based on an analysis
of product mix, risk characteristics of the portfolio,
bankruptcy experiences, and historical losses, adjusted for
current trends, for each homogenous category or group of loans.
The allowance is increased through provisions charged to
operating earnings and reduced by net charge-offs.

The Company also assesses the credit risk
associated with off-balance sheet loan commitments and letters
of credit and determines the appropriate amount of credit loss
liability that should be recorded. The liability for off-balance
sheet credit exposure related to loan commitments is included in
the allowance for credit losses.

Nonaccrual Loans

Generally commercial loans (including
impaired loans) are placed on nonaccrual status when the
collection of interest or principal has become 90 days past
due or is otherwise considered doubtful. When a loan is placed
on nonaccrual status, unpaid accrued interest is reversed.
Future interest payments are generally applied against
principal. Revolving consumer lines and credit cards are charged
off by 180 days past due and closed-end consumer loans
other than loans secured by 1-4 family properties are charged
off at 120 days past due and are, therefore, generally not
placed on nonaccrual status.

Impaired Loans

A
loan is considered to be impaired when, based on current
information and events, it is probable that the Company will be
unable to collect all amounts due (both interest and principal)
according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement.

Restructured Loans

In cases where a borrower experiences
financial difficulties and the Company makes certain
concessionary modifications to contractual terms, the loan is
classified as a restructured loan. Loans restructured at a rate
equal to or greater than that of a new loan with comparable risk
at the time the contract is modified may be excluded from
restructured loans in the calendar years subsequent to the
restructuring if they are in compliance with the modified terms.

U.S. BANCORP



Generally, a nonaccrual loan that is restructured
remains on nonaccrual for a period of six months to demonstrate
that the borrower can meet the restructured terms. However,
performance prior to the restructuring, or significant events
that coincide with the restructuring, are considered in
assessing whether the borrower can meet the new terms and may
result in the loan being returned to accrual status at the time
of restructuring or after a shorter performance period. If the
borrower’s ability to meet the revised payment schedule is
not reasonably assured, the loan remains classified as a
nonaccrual loan.

Leases

The Company
engages in both direct and leveraged lease financing. The net
investment in direct financing leases is the sum of all minimum
lease payments and estimated residual values, less unearned
income. Unearned income is added to interest income over the
terms of the leases to produce a level yield.

The investment in leveraged leases is the sum of
all lease payments (less nonrecourse debt payments) plus
estimated residual values, less unearned income. Income from
leveraged leases is recognized over the term of the leases based
on the unrecovered equity investment.

Residual values on leased assets are reviewed
regularly for other-than-temporary impairment. Residual
valuations for retail automobile leases are based on independent
assessments of expected used car sales prices at the
end-of-term. Impairment tests are conducted based on these
valuations considering the probability of the lessee returning
the asset to the Company, re-marketing efforts, insurance
coverage and ancillary fees and costs. Valuations for commercial
leases are based upon external or internal management
appraisals. When there is other than temporary impairment in the
estimated fair value of the Company’s interest in the
residual value of a leased asset, the carrying value is reduced
to the estimated fair value with the writedown recognized in the
current period in commercial products revenue or other
noninterest income.

Loans Held for Sale

Loans held for sale (“LHFS”)
represent mortgage loan originations intended to be sold in the
secondary market and other loans that management has an active
plan to sell. LHFS are carried at the lower of cost or market
value as determined on an aggregate basis by type of loan. In
the event management decides to sell loans receivable, the loans
are transferred at the lower of cost or fair value. The
Interagency Guidance on Certain Loans Held for Sale, dated
March 26, 2001, requires loans transferred to LHFS to be
marked-to-market (“MTM”) at the time of transfer. MTM
losses related to the sale/transfer of non-homogeneous loans
that are predominantly credit-related are reflected in
charge-offs. With respect to homogeneous loans, the amount of
“probable” credit loss determined in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5,
“Accounting for Contingencies,” methodologies utilized
to determine the specific allowance allocation for the portfolio
is also included in charge-offs. Any incremental loss determined
in accordance with MTM accounting, that includes consideration
of other factors such as estimates of inherent losses, is
reported separately from charge-offs as a reduction to the
allowance for credit losses. Subsequent decreases in fair value
are recognized in noninterest income.

Other Real Estate

Other real estate (“ORE”),
which is included in other assets, is property acquired through
foreclosure or other proceedings. ORE is carried at fair value,
less estimated selling costs. The property is evaluated
regularly and any decreases in the carrying amount are included
in noninterest expense.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

In the ordinary course of business, the Company
enters into derivative transactions to manage its interest rate,
foreign currency and prepayment risk and to accommodate the
business requirements of its customers. All derivative
instruments are recorded as either other assets, other
liabilities or short-term borrowings at fair value. Subsequent
changes in a derivative’s fair value are recognized
currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria
are met.

All derivative instruments that qualify for hedge
accounting are recorded at fair value and classified either as a
hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability
(“fair value” hedge) or as a hedge of the variability
of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized
asset or liability or a forecasted transaction (“cash
flow” hedge). Changes in the fair value of a derivative
that is highly effective and designated as a fair value hedge
and the offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged item
are recorded in income. Changes in the fair value of a
derivative that is highly effective and designated as a cash
flow hedge are recognized in other comprehensive income until
income from the cash flows of the hedged item is recognized. The
Company performs an assessment, both at the inception of the
hedge and on a quarterly basis thereafter, when required, to
determine whether these derivatives are highly effective in
offsetting changes in the value of the hedged items. Any change
in fair value resulting from hedge ineffectiveness is
immediately recorded in noninterest income.

If a derivative designated as a hedge is
terminated or ceases to be highly effective, the gain or loss is
amortized to earnings over the remaining life of the hedged
asset or liability (fair value hedge) or over the same period(s)
that the forecasted hedged transactions impact earnings (cash
flow hedge). If the hedged item is disposed of, or the
forecasted transaction is no longer probable, the derivative


U.S. BANCORP


is recorded at fair value with any resulting gain
or loss included in the gain or loss from the disposition of the
hedged item or, in the case of a forecasted transaction that is
no longer probable, included in earnings immediately.

OTHER SIGNIFICANT POLICIES

Intangible Assets

The price paid over the net fair value
of the acquired businesses (“goodwill”) is not
amortized. Other intangible assets are amortized over their
estimated useful lives, using straight-line and accelerated
methods. The recoverability of goodwill and other intangible
assets is evaluated annually, at a minimum, or on an interim
basis if events or circumstances indicate a possible inability
to realize the carrying amount. The evaluation includes
assessing the estimated fair value of the intangible asset based
on market prices for similar assets, where available, and the
present value of the estimated future cash flows associated with
the intangible asset.

Income Taxes

Deferred taxes are recorded to reflect
the tax consequences on future years of differences between the
tax basis of assets and liabilities and the financial reporting
amounts at each year-end.

Mortgage Servicing Rights

Mortgage servicing rights
(“MSRs”) are capitalized as separate assets when loans
are sold and servicing is retained. The total cost of loans sold
is allocated between the loans sold and the servicing assets
retained based on their relative fair values. MSRs that are
purchased from others are initially recorded at cost. The
carrying value of the MSRs is amortized in proportion to, and
over the period of, estimated net servicing revenue and recorded
in noninterest expense as amortization of intangible assets. The
carrying value of these assets is periodically reviewed for
impairment using a lower of carrying value or fair value
methodology. For purposes of measuring impairment, the servicing
rights are stratified based on the underlying loan type and note
rate and the carrying value of each stratum is compared to fair
value based on a discounted cash flow analysis, utilizing
current prepayment speeds and discount rates. Events that may
significantly affect the estimates used are changes in interest
rates and the related impact on mortgage loan prepayment speed
and the payment performance of the underlying loans. If the
carrying value is greater than fair value, impairment is
recognized through a valuation allowance for each impaired
stratum and recorded as amortization of intangible assets. The
valuation allowance is adjusted each subsequent period to
reflect any increase or decrease in the indicated impairment.
The Company reviews mortgage servicing rights for
other-than-temporary impairment each quarter and recognizes a
direct write-down when the recoverability of a recorded
valuation allowance is determined to be remote. In determining
whether other-than-temporary impairment has taken place, the
Company considers historical trends in pay off activity and the
potential for impairment recovery. Unlike a valuation allowance,
a direct write-down permanently reduces the carrying value of
the mortgage servicing rights, precluding subsequent reversals.

Pensions

For
purposes of its retirement plans, the Company utilizes a
measurement date of September 30. At the measurement date,
plan assets are determined based on fair value, generally
representing observable market prices. The actuarial cost method
used to compute the pension liabilities and related expense is
the projected unit credit method. The projected benefit
obligation is principally determined based on the present value
of projected benefit distributions at an assumed discount rate.
The discount rate utilized is based on match-funding maturities
and interest payments of high quality corporate bonds available
in the market place to projected cash flows as of the
measurement date for future benefit payments. Periodic pension
expense (or credits) includes service costs, interest costs
based on the assumed discount rate, the expected return on plan
assets based on an actuarially derived market-related value and
amortization of actuarial gains and losses. Pension accounting
reflects the long-term nature of benefit obligations and the
investment horizon of plan assets and can have the effect of
reducing earnings volatility related to short-term changes in
interest rates and market valuations. Actuarial gains and losses
include the impact of plan amendments and various unrecognized
gains and losses which are deferred and amortized over the
future service periods of active employees. The market-related
value utilized to determine the expected return on plan assets
is based on fair value adjusted for the difference between
expected returns and actual performance of plan assets. The
unrealized difference between actual experience and expected
returns is included in the market-related value ratably over a
five-year period.

Premises and Equipment

Premises and equipment are stated at
cost less accumulated depreciation and depreciated primarily on
a straight-line basis over the estimated life of the assets.
Estimated useful lives range up to 40 years for newly
constructed buildings and from 3 to 20 years for furniture
and equipment.

Capitalized leases, less accumulated
amortization, are included in premises and equipment. The lease
obligations are included in long-term debt. Capitalized leases
are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and
the amortization is included in depreciation expense.

Statement of Cash Flows

For purposes of reporting cash flows,
cash and cash equivalents include cash and money market
investments, defined as interest-bearing amounts due

U.S. BANCORP



from banks, federal funds sold and securities
purchased under agreements to resell.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company grants stock awards
including restricted stock and options to purchase common stock
of the Company. Stock option grants are for a fixed number of
shares to employees and directors with an exercise price equal
to the fair value of the shares at the date of grant. The
Company recognizes stock-based compensation in its results of
operations utilizing the fair value method under Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard No. 123, “Accounting for
Stock-based Compensation” (“SFAS 123”).
Stock-based compensation is recognized using an accelerated
method of amortization for awards with graded vesting features
and on a straight-line basis for awards with cliff vesting. The
amortization of stock-based compensation reflects estimated
forfeitures adjusted for actual forfeiture experience. As
compensation expense is recognized, a deferred tax asset is
recorded that represents an estimate of the future tax deduction
from exercise or release of restrictions. At the time stock
options are exercised, cancelled or expire, the Company may be
required to recognize an adjustment to tax expense.

Per Share Calculations

Earnings per share is calculated by
dividing net income by the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share
is calculated by adjusting income and outstanding shares,
assuming conversion of all potentially dilutive securities,
using the treasury stock method. All per share amounts have been
restated for stock splits.

Note 2

Accounting Changes

Stock-Based Compensation

In December 2002, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 148 (“SFAS 148”),
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation —
Transition and Disclosure,” an amendment of SFAS 123.
SFAS 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a
voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting
for stock-based employee compensation. In previous years, the
Company accounted for stock-based employee compensation under
the intrinsic based method and provided disclosure of the impact
of the fair value based method on reported income. For its 2003
financial statements, the Company elected to adopt the fair
value method using the retroactive restatement approach. All
prior periods presented have been restated to reflect the
compensation cost that would have been recognized had the
recognition provisions of SFAS 123 been applied to all
awards granted to employees after January 1, 1995, that
remained unvested at the beginning of the first period presented.

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 123 (revised 2004)
(“SFAS 123R”), “Share-Based Payment” a
revision of SFAS 123. SFAS 123R requires companies to
measure the cost of employee services in exchange for an award
of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the
award. This statement eliminates the use of the alternative
intrinsic value method of accounting that was allowed when
SFAS 123 was originally issued. The provisions of this
statement are effective in the first interim reporting period
beginning after June 15, 2005. Because the Company
retroactively adopted the fair value method in 2003, the revised
statement will not have a significant impact on the
Company’s financial statements.

Loan Commitments

On
March 9, 2004, the Securities and Exchange Commission staff
issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 105
(“SAB 105”), “Application of Accounting
Principles to Loan Commitments,” which provides guidance
regarding loan commitments accounted for as derivative
instruments and is effective for commitments entered into after
March 31, 2004. The guidance clarifies that expected future
cash flows related to the servicing of the loan may be
recognized only when the servicing asset has been contractually
separated from the underlying loan by sale with servicing
retained. The adoption of SAB 105 did not have a material
impact on the Company’s financial statements.

Note 3

Business Combinations

On June 29, 2004, the Company purchased the
remaining 50 percent ownership interest of EuroConex
Technologies Ltd (“EuroConex”) from the Bank of
Ireland. In addition, during the second and fourth quarter of
2004, the Company completed three separate transactions to
acquire merchant processing businesses in Poland, the United
Kingdom and Norway. In connection with these transactions,
EuroConex and its affiliates provide debit and credit card
processing services to merchants, directly and through alliances
with banking partners in these European markets. These
transactions represented total assets acquired of
$377 million and total liabilities assumed of
$115 million at the closing date. Included in total assets
were contract and other intangibles with a fair value of
$163 million and goodwill of $105 million. The
goodwill reflected the strategic value of these businesses to
the Company’s European merchant processing business and
anticipated economies of scale that will result from these
transactions.

On December 31, 2002, the Company acquired
the corporate trust business of State Street Bank and
Trust Company (“State Street Corporate Trust”) in
a cash transaction valued at $720 million. State Street
Corporate Trust was a leading provider, particularly in the
Northeast,


U.S. BANCORP


of corporate trust and agency services to a
variety of municipalities, corporations, government agencies and
other financial institutions serving approximately 20,000 client
issuances representing over $689 billion of assets under
administration. With this acquisition, the Company is among the
nation’s leading providers of a full range of corporate
trust products and services. The transaction represented total
assets acquired of $677 million and total liabilities
assumed of $39 million at the closing date. Included in
total assets were contract and other intangibles with a fair
value of $218 million and goodwill of $520 million.
The goodwill reflected the strategic value of the combined
organization’s leadership position in the corporate trust
business and processing economies of scale resulting from the
transaction.

In addition to these business acquisitions, the
Company completed other strategic acquisitions to enhance its
presence in certain markets and businesses.

The following table summarizes significant
acquisitions by the Company completed since January 1, 2002:

(a)

Assets acquired do not include purchase
    accounting adjustments.

Note 4

Discontinued Operations

On December 31, 2003, the Company completed
the distribution of all the outstanding shares of common stock
of Piper Jaffray Companies to its shareholders. This non-cash
distribution was tax-free to the Company, its shareholders and
Piper Jaffray Companies. In connection with the
December 31, 2003 distribution, the results of Piper
Jaffray Companies are reported in the Company’s
Consolidated Statement of Income separately as discontinued
operations.

The following table represents the condensed
results of operations for discontinued operations:

(a)

The $27.6 million of disposal costs
    related to discontinued operations primarily represents legal,
    investment banking and other costs directly related to the
    distribution.

U.S. BANCORP



The distribution was treated as a dividend to
shareholders for accounting purposes and, as such, reduced the
Company’s retained earnings by $685 million. At
December 31, 2003, the Consolidated Balance Sheet reflects

the non-cash dividend and corresponding reduction
in assets and liabilities at that date. A summary of the assets
and liabilities of the discontinued operations is as follows:

(a)

Includes customer margin account receivables,
    due from brokers/dealers and other assets.

(b)

Includes accrued expenses, due to
    brokers/dealers and other liabilities.

Following the distribution, the Company’s
wholly-owned subsidiary, USB Holdings, Inc. holds a
$180 million subordinated debt facility with Piper
Jaffray & Co., a broker-dealer subsidiary of Piper
Jaffray Companies. In addition, the Company provides an
indemnification in an amount up to $17.5 million with
respect to certain specified liabilities resulting from
third-party claims relating to research analyst independence and
from certain regulatory investigations, as defined in the
separation and distribution agreement entered into with Piper
Jaffray Companies at the time of the distribution. Through
December 31, 2004, the Company has paid approximately
$3.3 million to Piper Jaffray Companies under this
indemnification agreement.

Note 5

Merger and Restructuring-Related Items

The Company recorded pre-tax merger and
restructuring-related charges of $46.2 million and
$321.2 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. In 2003,
merger-related items were incurred in connection with the NOVA
Corporation acquisition and the Company’s various other
acquisitions, primarily Bay View and State Street Corporate
Trust. In 2002, merger-related items included costs associated
with the Firstar/ former U.S. Bancorp of Minneapolis
(“USBM”) merger, NOVA and other smaller acquisitions.


U.S. BANCORP


The components of the merger and
restructuring-related items are shown below:

(a)

In 2003 and 2002, “Other” primarily
    included merger and restructuring-related items pertaining to
    the Bay View acquisition, State Street Corporate Trust and the
    Lyon Financial acquisition.

The Company determines merger and
restructuring-related items and related accruals based on its
integration strategy and formulated plans. These plans are
established as of the acquisition date and are regularly
evaluated during the integration process.

Severance and employee-related charges include
the cost of severance, other benefits and outplacement costs
associated with the termination of employees primarily in branch
offices and centralized corporate support and data processing
functions. The severance amounts are determined based on the
Company’s existing severance pay programs and are paid out
over a benefit period of up to two years from the time of
termination. In 2002, the Company recognized additional
severance costs of $13.1 million in connection with the
USBM merger offset by net curtailment and settlement gains of
$9.0 million related to changes in certain non-qualified
pension plans. Changes in severance costs for NOVA primarily
reflected a change in estimate in the liability given the mix of
employees terminated. Severance and employee-related costs for
identified groups of acquired employees are included in the
determination of goodwill at closing. Severance and
employee-related costs are recorded as incurred for groups of
employees not specifically identified at the time of closing or
acquired in business combinations accounted for as
“poolings.”

Systems conversions and integration costs are
recorded as incurred and are associated with the preparation and
mailing of numerous customer communications for the acquisitions
and conversion of customer accounts, printing and distribution
of training materials and policy and procedure manuals, outside
consulting fees, and other expenses related to systems
conversions and the integration of acquired branches and
operations.

Asset write-downs and lease terminations
represent lease termination costs and impairment of assets for
redundant office space, branches that will be vacated and
equipment disposed of as part of the integration plan. These
costs are recognized in the accounting period that contract
terminations occur or the asset becomes impaired and is
abandoned. In 2002, this category included $38.2 million of
signage write-offs, $26.9 million of software and equipment
write-offs, $32.0 million of lease and contract
cancellations and $6.9 million of leasehold and other
related items associated with the Firstar/ USBM merger.

Other merger-related items in 2002 of
$(31.6) million primarily represented asset gains and
changes to conform accounting policies implemented at the time
of systems conversions related to the Firstar/ USBM merger and
other acquired entities. During 2002, the Company recognized
asset gains related to the sale of a non-strategic investment in
a sub-prime lending business of $28.7 million and a
mark-to-market recovery of $10.1 million associated with
the liquidation of U.S. Bancorp Libra’s investment
portfolio.

The adequacy of the accrued liabilities is
reviewed regularly taking into consideration actual and
projected payments. Adjustments are made to increase or decrease
these accruals as needed. Reversals of expenses can reflect a
lower utilization of benefits by affected staff, changes in
initial assumptions as a result of subsequent mergers and
alterations of business plans.

U.S. BANCORP



The components of the merger and
restructuring-related accruals for all acquisitions were as
follows:

The merger and restructuring-related accruals by
significant acquisition or business restructuring was as follows:

At December 31, 2002, the integration of
Firstar and USBM was completed. The only activity in the USBM
liability during 2004 was related to the payout of severance
costs. In 2003, the integration of merchant processing platforms
and business processes of U.S Bank National Association and
NOVA, as well as systems conversions for the acquisitions of the
State Street Corporate Trust business and Bay View were
completed.

Restrictions on Cash and Due from Banks

Bank subsidiaries are required to maintain
minimum average reserve balances with the Federal Reserve Bank.
The amount of those reserve balances was approximately
$169 million at December 31, 2004.

Note 7

Investment Securities

The detail of the amortized cost, gross
unrealized holding gains and losses, and fair value of
held-to-maturity and available-for-sale securities at
December 31 was as follows:

(a)

Held-to-maturity securities are carried at
    historical cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and
    accretion of discounts.

(b)

Available-for-sale securities are carried at
    fair value with unrealized net gains or losses reported within
    other comprehensive income in shareholders’
    equity.

The fair value of available-for-sale securities
shown above includes securities totaling $4.8 billion with
unrealized losses of $148.8 million which have been in an
unrealized loss position for greater than 12 months. All
principal and interest payments on available-for-sale debt
securities in an unrealized loss position for greater than
12 months are expected to be collected given the high
credit quality of the U.S. government agency debt
securities and


U.S. BANCORP


bank holding company issuers and the
Company’s ability and intent to hold the securities until
such time as the value recovers or maturity. All other
available-for-sale securities with unrealized losses have an
aggregate fair value of $26.1 billion and have been in an
unrealized loss position for less than 12 months and
represent both fixed-rate securities and adjustable-rate
securities with temporary impairment resulting from increases in
interest rates since the purchase of the securities.

The weighted average maturity of the
available-for-sale investment securities was 4.45 years at
December 31, 2004, compared with 5.12 years at
December 31, 2003. The corresponding weighted average
yields were 4.43 percent and 4.27 percent, respectively. The
weighted average maturity of the held-to-maturity investment
securities was 6.19 years at December 31, 2004,
compared with 6.16 years at December 31, 2003.

Securities carried at $28.0 billion at
December 31, 2004, and $31.0 billion at
December 31, 2003, were pledged to secure public, private
and trust deposits and for other purposes required by law.
Securities sold under agreements to repurchase were
collateralized by securities with an amortized cost of
$4.8 billion at December 31, 2004, and
$3.6 billion at December 31, 2003.

Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses

The composition of the loan portfolio at
December 31 was as follows:

Loans are presented net of unearned interest and
deferred fees and costs, which amounted to $1.4 billion and
$1.5 billion at December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. The Company had loans of $38.3 billion at
December 31, 2004, and $28.7 billion at
December 31, 2003, pledged at the Federal Home
Loan Bank. Loans of $10.3 billion at December 31,
2004, and $12.1 billion at December 31, 2003, were
pledged at the Federal Reserve Bank.

The Company primarily lends to borrowers in the
24 states in which it has banking offices. Collateral for
commercial loans may include marketable securities, accounts
receivable, inventory and equipment. For details of the
Company’s commercial portfolio by industry group and
geography as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, see
Table 7 included in Management’s Discussion and
Analysis which is incorporated by reference into these Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

For detail of the Company’s commercial real
estate portfolio by property type and geography as of
December 31, 2004 and 2003, see Table 9 included in
Management’s Discussion and Analysis which is incorporated

Statements. Such loans are collateralized by the related
property.

Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans,
restructured loans not performing in accordance with modified
terms, other real estate and other nonperforming assets owned by
the Company. For details of the Company’s nonperforming
assets as of December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, see
Table 12 included in Management’s Discussion and
Analysis which is incorporated by reference into these Notes to

Activity in the allowance for credit losses was
as follows:

(a)

Included in this analysis is activity related
    to the Company’s liability for unfunded commitments, which
    is separately recorded in other liabilities in the Consolidated
    Balance Sheet.

A portion of the allowance for credit losses is
allocated to loans deemed impaired. All impaired loans are
included in nonperforming assets. A summary of these loans and
their related allowance for credit losses is as follows:

Commitments to lend additional funds to customers
whose loans were classified as nonaccrual or restructured at
December 31, 2004, totaled $61.2 million. During 2004
there were $10.2 million of loans that were restructured at
market interest rates and returned to an accruing status.

Included in noninterest income, primarily in
mortgage banking revenue, for the years ended December 31,
2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company had net gains on the sale of
loans of $171.0 million, $162.9 million and

Note 10

Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of
    Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities

FINANCIAL ASSET SALES

When the Company sells financial assets, it may
retain interest-only strips, servicing rights, residual rights
to a cash reserve account, and/or other retained interests in
the sold financial assets. The gain or loss on sale depends in
part on the previous carrying amount of the financial assets
involved in the transfer and is allocated between the assets
sold and the retained interests based on their relative fair
values at the date of transfer. Quoted market prices are used to
determine retained interest fair values when readily available.
Since quotes are generally not available for retained interests,
the Company estimates fair value based on the present value of
future expected cash flows using management’s best
estimates of the key assumptions including credit losses,
prepayment speeds, forward yield curves, and discount rates
commensurate with the risks involved. Retained interests and
liabilities are recorded at fair value using a discounted cash
flow methodology at inception and are evaluated at least
quarterly thereafter.

Conduits and Securitization

The Company sponsors an off-balance
sheet conduit to which it transferred high-grade investment
securities, funded by the issuance of commercial paper. The
conduit, a qualifying special purpose entity, held assets of
$5.7 billion at December 31, 2004 and
$7.3 billion in assets at December 31, 2003. These
investment securities include primarily (i) private label
asset-backed securities, which are insurance “wrapped”
by AAA/Aaa-rated monoline insurance companies and
(ii) government agency mortgage-backed securities and
collateralized mortgage obligations. The conduit had commercial
paper liabilities of $5.7 billion at December 31, 2004
and $7.3 billion at December 31, 2003. The Company
benefits by transferring the investment securities into a
conduit that provides diversification of funding sources in a
capital-efficient manner and the generation of income.

The Company provides a liquidity facility to the
conduit. Utilization of the liquidity facility would be
triggered if the conduit is unable to, or does not, issue
commercial paper to fund its assets. A liability for the
estimate of the potential risk of loss the Company has as the
liquidity facility provider is recorded on the balance sheet in
other liabilities. The liability is adjusted downward over time
as the underlying assets pay down with the offset recognized as
other noninterest income. The liability for the liquidity
facility was $32.4 million at December 31, 2004 and
$47.3 million at December 31, 2003. In addition, the
Company recorded at fair value its retained residual interest in
the investment securities conduit of $56.8 million at
December 31, 2004 and $89.5 million at
December 31, 2003. The Company recorded $24.9 million
from the conduit during 2004 and $30.5 million during 2003,
for revenues related to the conduit including fees for
servicing, management, administration and accretion income from
retained interests.

The Company also has an asset-backed
securitization to fund an unsecured small business credit
product. The unsecured small business credit securitization
trust held assets of $375.3 million at December 31,
2004, of which the Company retained $85.0 million of
subordinated securities and a residual interest-only strip of
$36.1 million. This compared with $497.5 million in
assets at December 31, 2003, of which the Company retained
$112.4 million of subordinated securities and a residual
interest-only strip of $34.4 million. The qualifying
special purpose entity issued asset-backed variable funding
notes in various tranches. The Company provides credit
enhancement in the form of subordinated securities and reserve
accounts. The Company’s risk, primarily from losses in the
underlying assets, was considered in determining the fair value
of the Company’s retained interests in this securitization.
The Company recognized income from subordinated securities, an
interest-only strip and servicing fees from this securitization
of $33.2 million during 2004 and $29.8 million during
2003. The unsecured small business credit securitization held
average assets of $438.9 million in 2004, and
$571.4 million in 2003.

During 2003, the Company undertook several
actions with respect to off-balance sheet structures. In January
2003, the Company exercised a cleanup call option on an indirect
automobile loan securitization, with the remaining assets from
the securitization recorded on the Company’s balance sheet
at fair value. The indirect automobile securitization held
$156.1 million in assets at December 31, 2002.


U.S. BANCORP


During the third quarter of 2003, the Company did
not reissue more than 90 percent of the commercial paper
funding of Stellar Funding Group, Inc. (“Stellar”), a
commercial loan conduit. This action caused the conduit to lose
its status as a qualifying special purpose entity. As a result,
the Company recorded all of Stellar’s assets and
liabilities at fair value and the results of operations in the
consolidated financial statements of the Company. Given the
floating-rate nature and high credit quality of the assets
within the conduit, the impact to the Company’s financial
statements was not significant. In the third quarter of 2003,
average commercial loan balances increased by approximately
$2 billion and the resulting increase in net interest
income was offset by a similar decline in conduit fee income
within commercial products revenue. Prior to December 31,
2003, the remaining commercial paper borrowings held by
third-party investors matured and the conduit was legally
dissolved.

Sensitivity Analysis

At December 31, 2004, key
economic assumptions and the sensitivity of the current fair
value of residual cash flows to immediate 10 percent and
20 percent adverse changes in those assumptions were as
follows:

(a)

For the small business receivables a monthly
    principal payment rate assumption is used to value the residual
    interests.

(b)

Credit losses are zero for the investment
    securities conduit as the investments are all AAA/ Aaa rated or
    insured investments.

(c)

For the small business receivables interest
    income is base on Prime + contractual spread.

(d)

The investment securities conduit is mostly
    match funded. Therefore, interest rate movements create no
    material impact to the value of the residual interest.

These sensitivities are hypothetical and should
be used with caution. As the figures indicate, changes in fair
value based on a 10 percent variation in assumptions
generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the
change in the assumptions to the change in fair value may not be
linear. Also, in this table the effect of a variation in a
particular assumption on the fair value of the retained interest
is calculated without changing any other assumptions; in
reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another
(for example, increases in market interest rates may result in
lower prepayments and increased credit losses), which might
magnify or counteract the sensitivities.

Cash Flow Information

The table below summarizes certain
cash flows received from and paid to conduit or structured

Changes in net carrying value of capitalized
mortgage servicing rights are summarized as follows:

The key economic assumptions used to estimate the
value of the mortgage servicing rights portfolio were as follows:

The estimated sensitivity of the fair value of
the mortgage servicing rights portfolio to changes in interest
rates at December 31, 2004, was as follows:

The fair value of mortgage servicing rights and
its sensitivity to changes in interest rates is influenced by
the mix of the servicing portfolio and characteristics of each
segment of the portfolio. In the current interest rate
environment, mortgage loans originated as part of government
agency and state loan programs tend to experience slower
prepayment speeds and better cash flows than conventional
mortgage loans. The Company’s servicing portfolio consists
of the distinct portfolios of Mortgage Revenue Bond Programs
(“MRBP”), government-related mortgages and
conventional mortgages. The MRBP division specializes in
servicing loans made under state and local housing authority
programs. These programs provide mortgages to low and moderate
income borrowers and are generally under government insured
programs with down payment or closing cost assistance. The
conventional and government servicing portfolios are
predominantly comprised of fixed-rate agency loans (FNMA, FHLMC,
GNMA, FHLB and various housing agencies) with limited
adjustable-rate or jumbo mortgage loans.

A summary of the Company’s mortgage
servicing rights and related characteristics by portfolio as of
December 31, 2004, was as follows:

Note 13

Intangible Assets

The Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 142 (“SFAS 142”),
“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” on
January 1, 2002. The most significant changes made by
SFAS 142 are that goodwill and other indefinite lived
intangible assets are no longer amortized and will be tested for
impairment at least annually. The amortization provisions of
SFAS 142 apply to goodwill and intangible assets acquired
after June 30, 2001. With respect to goodwill and
intangible assets acquired prior to July 1, 2001, the
amortization provisions of SFAS 142 were effective upon
adoption of SFAS 142.

Prior to the adoption of SFAS 142, the
Company evaluated goodwill for impairment under a projected
undiscounted cash flow model. As a result of the initial
impairment test from the adoption of SFAS 142, the Company
recognized an impairment loss of $58.8 million resulting in
an after-tax loss of $37.2 million in the first quarter of
2002. The impairment was primarily related to the purchase of a
transportation leasing company in 1998 by the equipment leasing
business. This charge was recognized as a “cumulative
effect of accounting change” in the income statement. The
fair value of that reporting unit was estimated using the
present value of future expected cash flows.

Net income and earnings per share adjusted for
the exclusion of asset impairments related to goodwill are as
follows:

carrying value of goodwill for the years ended December 31,

Long-Term Debt

Long-term debt (debt with original maturities of
more than one year) at December 31 consisted of the
following:

In April 2003, the Company’s subsidiary
U.S. Bank National Association (“USBNA”) issued
$500 million of fixed-rate subordinated notes due
April 15, 2015. The interest rate is 4.80 percent, per
annum. In October of 2004, USBNA issued floating-rate
subordinated notes of $350 million, due October 14,
2014. These notes bear floating-rate interest of three-month
LIBOR plus .28 percent. The interest rate at
December 31, 2004 was 2.34 percent. In October of
2004, USBNA also issued $650 million of fixed-rate
subordinated notes due October 30, 2014. The interest rate
is 4.95 percent, per annum.

Medium-term notes (“MTNs”) outstanding
at December 31, 2004, mature from March 2005 through March
2008. The MTNs bear fixed or floating interest rates ranging
from 2.63 percent to 5.10 percent. The
weighted-average interest rate of MTNs at December 31,
2004, was 3.51 percent.

Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”)
advances outstanding at December 31, 2004, mature from
February 2005 through October 2026. The advances bear fixed or
floating interest rates ranging from .50 percent to
8.25 percent. The Company has an arrangement with the FHLB
whereby based on collateral available (residential and
commercial mortgages), the Company could have borrowed an
additional $19.3 billion at December 31, 2004. The
weighted-average interest rate of FHLB advances at
December 31, 2004, was 2.64 percent. The Euro
medium-term notes matured on April 13, 2004.


U.S. BANCORP


Bank notes outstanding at December 31, 2004,
mature from January 2005 through March 2009. The bank notes bear
fixed or floating interest rates ranging from 1.20 percent
to 5.63 percent. The weighted-average interest rate of Bank
notes at December 31, 2004, was 2.47 percent.

During 2004 the Company prepaid long-term debt,
principally representing FHLB advances, of $4.8 billion in
connection with asset/liability management decisions, incurring
$154.8 million in prepayment charges.

Junior Subordinated Debentures

The Company sponsors and wholly owns 100% of the
common equity of eight trusts that were formed for the purpose
of issuing Company-obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred
securities (“Trust Preferred Securities”) to
third-party investors and investing the proceeds from the sale
of the Trust Preferred Securities solely in junior
subordinated debt securities of the Company (the
“Debentures”). The Debentures held by the trusts,
which total $2.6 billion, are the sole assets of each
trust. The Company’s obligations under the Debentures and
related documents, taken together, constitute a full and
unconditional guarantee by the Company of the obligations of the
Trusts. The guarantee covers the distributions and payments on
liquidation or redemption of the Trust Preferred
Securities, but only to the extent of funds held by the Trusts.
The Company used the proceeds from the sales of the Debentures
for general corporate purposes.

The Company has the right to redeem retail
Debentures in whole or in part, on or after specific dates, at a
redemption price specified in the indentures plus any accrued
but unpaid interest to the redemption date. The Company has the
right to redeem institutional Debentures in whole, (but not in
part), on or after specific dates, at a redemption price
specified in the indentures plus any accrued but unpaid interest
to the redemption date. The Debentures are redeemable in 2006
and 2007 in the amounts of $2.3 billion and
$310 million, respectively.

In March 2004, as a result of adopting the
provisions of Interpretation No. 46 (revised December
2003), “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities”,
an interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51,
“Consolidated Financial Statements”, the Company was
required to de-consolidate these subsidiary trusts from its
financial statements. The de-consolidation of the net assets and
results of operations of the trusts had an insignificant impact
on the Company’s financial statements and liquidity
position since the Company continues to be obligated to repay
the Debentures held by the trusts and guarantees repayment of
the Trust Preferred Securities issued by the trusts. The
consolidated debt obligation related to the trusts increased
$79 million upon de-consolidation with the increase
representing the Company’s common equity ownership in the
trusts. The Trust Preferred Securities held by the trusts
qualify as Tier 1 capital for the Company under the Federal
Reserve Board guidelines. The banking regulatory agencies have
issued guidance that would continue the current regulatory
capital treatment for Trust Preferred Securities.

Shareholders’ Equity

At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company
had authority to issue 4 billion shares of common stock and
10 million shares of preferred stock. The Company had
1,857.6 million and 1,922.9 million shares of common
stock outstanding at December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. At December 31, 2004, the Company had
170.5 million shares of common stock reserved for future
issuances, primarily under stock option plans.

The Company has a preferred share purchase rights
plan intended to preserve the long-term value of the Company by
discouraging a hostile takeover of the Company. Under the plan,
each share of common stock carries a right to purchase one
one-thousandth of a share of preferred stock. The rights become
exercisable in certain limited circumstances involving a
potential business combination transaction or an acquisition of
shares of the Company and are exercisable at a price of
$100 per right, subject to adjustment. Following certain
other events, each right entitles its holder to purchase for
$100 an amount of common stock of the Company, or, in certain
circumstances, securities of the acquirer, having a then-current
market value of twice the exercise price of the right. The
dilutive effect of the rights on the acquiring company is
intended to encourage it to negotiate with the Company’s
Board of Directors prior to attempting a takeover. If the Board
of Directors believes a proposed acquisition is in the best
interests of the Company and its shareholders, the Board may
amend the plan or redeem the rights for a nominal amount in
order to permit the acquisition to be completed without
interference from the plan. Until a right is exercised, the
holder of a right has no rights as a shareholder of the Company.
The rights expire on February 27, 2011.

On December 18, 2001, the Board of Directors
approved an authorization to repurchase 100 million shares
of common stock through 2003. In 2003, the Company repurchased
7.0 million shares of common stock under the plan, which
expired in December of 2003. On December 16, 2003, the
Board of Directors approved an authorization to repurchase
150 million shares of common stock during the following
24 months. During 2003, the Company repurchased
8.0 million shares of common stock under the December 2003
plan. In 2004, the Company repurchased 88.8 million shares
of common stock under the plan. On December 21, 2004, the
Board of Directors approved an authorization to repurchase
150 million shares of common stock during the following
24 months. This new repurchase program replaces the
Company’s December 16, 2003 program. In 2004, the
Company repurchased 5.0 million shares of common stock
under the plan.

common stock repurchased in each of the last three years:

Employee Benefits

Employee Investment Plan

The Company has a defined contribution
retirement savings plan which allows qualified employees, at
their option, to make contributions up to 50 percent of
pre-tax base salary through salary deductions under
Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Employee
contributions are invested, at the employees’ direction,
among a variety of investment alternatives. Employee
contributions are 100 percent matched by the Company, up to
the first four percent of an employee’s compensation. The
Company’s matching contribution vests immediately; however,
a participant must be employed on December 31st to receive
that year’s matching contribution. Although the matching
contribution is initially invested in the Company’s common
stock, an employee can reinvest the matching contributions among
various investment alternatives. Total expense was
$49.1 million, $48.5 million and $50.5 million in
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Pension Plans

Pension benefits are provided to
substantially all employees based on years of service and
employees’ compensation while employed with the Company.
Employees are fully vested after five years of service. Under
the plan’s benefit structure, a participant’s future
retirement benefits are based on a participant’s highest
five-year average annual compensation during his or her last
10 years before retirement or termination from the Company.
Plan assets primarily consist of various equity mutual funds and
other miscellaneous assets.

In addition to the funded qualified retirement
plan, the Company maintains a non-qualified plan that is
unfunded and the aggregate accumulated benefit obligation
exceeds the assets. The assumptions used in computing the
present value of the accumulated benefit obligation, the
projected benefit obligation and net pension expense are
substantially consistent with those assumptions used for the
funded qualified plan. The Company recognized a settlement loss
of $3.5 million on this plan in 2003, related to the level
of payouts made from the plan. In 2002, the Company recognized
combined curtailment and settlement gains of $11.7 million
related to changes in the non-qualified pension plans in
connection with the mergers of the prior plans.

In general, the Company’s pension plan
objectives include maintaining a funded status sufficient to
meet participant benefit obligations over time while reducing
long-term funding requirements and pension costs. The Company
has an established process for evaluating all the plans, their
performance and significant plan assumptions, including the
assumed discount rate and the long-term rate of return
(“LTROR”). At least annually, an independent
consultant is engaged to assist U.S. Bancorp’s
Compensation Committee in evaluating plan objectives, funding
policies and plan investment policies considering its long-term
investment time horizon and asset allocation strategies. The
process also evaluates significant plan assumptions. Although
plan assumptions are established annually, the Company may
update its analysis on an interim basis in order to be
responsive to significant events that occur during the year,
such as plan mergers and amendments.

Funding Practices

The Company’s funding policy
is to contribute amounts to its plans sufficient to meet the
minimum funding requirements of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, plus such additional amounts as the
Company determines to be appropriate. In 2003, the Company made
a contribution of $310.8 million to the qualified pension
plan in accordance with this policy. No contributions were made
in 2004. In 2005, the Company anticipates no minimum funding
requirement and therefore does not expect to make any
contributions to the plan. Contributions made to the plan were
invested in accordance with established investment policies and
asset allocation strategies.

Investment Policies and Asset Allocation

In establishing its investment
policies and asset allocation strategies, the Company considers
expected returns and the volatility associated with different
strategies. The independent consultant performs modeling that
projects numerous outcomes using a broad range of possible
scenarios, including a mix of possible rates of inflation and
economic growth. Some of the scenarios included are: low
inflation and high growth (ideal growth), low inflation and low
growth (recession), high inflation and low growth
(stagflation) and high inflation and high growth
(inflationary growth). Starting with current economic
information, the model bases its projections on past
relationships between inflation, fixed income rates and equity
returns when these types of economic conditions have existed
over the previous 30 years, both in the U.S. and in foreign
countries.

Based on an analysis of historical performance by
asset class, over any 20-year period since the mid-1940’s,
investments in equities have outperformed other investment
classes but are subject to higher volatility. While an asset
allocation including bonds and other assets generally has lower
volatility and may provide protection in a declining interest
rate environment, it limits the pension plan’s long-term
up-side potential. Given the pension plan’s investment
horizon and the financial viability of the Company to meet


U.S. BANCORP


its funding objectives, the Committee has
determined that an asset allocation strategy investing in
100 percent equities diversified among various domestic
equity categories and international equities is appropriate.

The following unaudited table provides a summary
of asset allocations adopted by the Company compared with a
typical asset allocation alternative:

(a)

The target asset allocation was modified in
    December 2003, effective January 1, 2004, to reduce the
    potential volatility of the portfolio without significantly
    reducing the expected returns. The change in the allocation was
    completed by the second quarter of 2004 and the year end
    variations from the target allocation were a result of that
    change.

(b)

The LTROR assumed for the target asset
    allocation strategy of 8.9 percent is based on a range of
    estimates evaluated by the Company including the compound
    expected return of 8.5 percent and the average expected
    return of 10.0 percent.

(c)

The Sharpe ratio is a direct measure of
    reward-to-risk. The Sharpe ratio for these asset allocation
    strategies is considered to be within acceptable
    parameters.

In accordance with its existing practices, the
independent pension consultant utilized by the Company updated
the analysis of expected rates of return and evaluated peer
group data, market conditions and other factors relevant to
determining the LTROR assumptions for pension costs for 2003 and
2004. The analysis performed late in 2004 indicated that the
LTROR assumption of 8.9 percent, used in both 2003 and
2004, continued to be in line with expected returns based on
current economic conditions and the Company expects to continue
using this LTROR in 2005. The LTROR was first reduced to the
current LTROR of 8.9 percent in 2003 to reflect the longer
impact of the poor market performance of equities in 2001 and
2002. Regardless of the extent of the Company’s analysis of
alternative asset allocation strategies, economic scenarios and
possible outcomes, plan assumptions developed for the LTROR are
subject to imprecision and changes in economic factors. As a
result of the modeling imprecision and uncertainty, the Company
considers a range of potential expected rates of return,
economic conditions for several scenarios, historical
performance relative to assumed rates of return and asset
allocation and LTROR information for a peer group in
establishing its assumptions.

Post-Retirement Medical Plans

In addition to providing pension
benefits, the Company provides health care and death benefits to
certain retired employees through several retiree medical
programs. The Company adopted one retiree medical program for
all future retirees on January 1, 2002. For certain
eligible employees, the provisions of the USBM retiree medical
plan and the Mercantile retiree medical plan remained in place
until December 31, 2002. Generally, all employees may
become eligible for retiree health care benefits by meeting
defined age and service requirements. The Company may also
subsidize the cost of coverage for employees meeting certain age
and service requirements. The medical plan contains other
cost-sharing features such as deductibles and coinsurance. The
estimated cost of these retiree benefit payments is accrued
during the employees’ active service.

In December 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act) was enacted.
The Act established a prescription drug benefit under Medicare,
known as “Medicare Part D”, and a federal subsidy
to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a
benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare
Part D. As a result, the Company recognized the expected
benefit of the Act on its retiree medical plan on a prospective
basis in 2004 and reduced the liability by $34.6 million.

    respect to asset values, a reduction in the LTROR, discount
    rates, census data and other relevant factors. As a result of

Stock-based Compensation

As part of its employee and director compensation
programs, the Company may grant certain stock awards under the
provisions of the existing stock compensation plans, including
plans assumed in acquisitions. The plans provide for grants of
options to purchase shares of common stock at a fixed price
generally equal to the fair value of the underlying stock at the
date of grant. Option grants are generally exercisable up to ten
years from the date of grant. In addition, the plans provide for
grants of shares of common stock or stock units that are subject
to restriction on transfer. Most stock awards vest over three to
five years and are subject to forfeiture if certain vesting
requirements are not met.

Stock incentive plans of acquired companies are
generally terminated at the merger closing dates. Option holders
under such plans receive the Company’s common stock, or
options to buy the Company’s stock, based on the conversion
terms of the various merger agreements. The historical stock
award information presented below has been restated to reflect
the options originally granted under acquired companies’
plans.

At December 31, 2004, there were
35.2 million shares (subject to adjustment for forfeitures)
available for grant under various plans.

outstanding as of December 31, 2004, is as follows:

Stock-based compensation was $175.6 million
in 2004, compared with $158.1 million and
$185.0 million in 2003 and 2002, respectively. At the time
employee stock options expire, are exercised or cancelled, the
Company determines the tax benefit associated with the stock
award and under certain circumstances may be required to
recognize an adjustment to tax expense. On an after-tax basis,
stock-based compensation was $138.5 million in 2004,
compared with $123.4 million and $113.3 million in
2003 and 2002, respectively.

Stock-based compensation expense is based on the
fair value of the award at the date of grant or modification.
The fair value of options was estimated using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model requiring the use of subjective valuation
assumptions. Because employee stock options have characteristics
that differ from those of traded options, including vesting
provisions and trading limitations that impact their liquidity,
the determined value used to measure compensation expense may
vary from their actual fair value.

The following table provides a summary of the
valuation assumptions utilized by the Company to determine the
estimated value of stock option grants:

Income Taxes

The components of income tax expense were:

A reconciliation of expected income tax expense
at the federal statutory rate of 35% to the Company’s
applicable income tax expense follows:

The tax effects of fair value adjustments on
securities available-for-sale, derivative instruments in cash
flow hedges and certain tax benefits related to stock options
are recorded directly to shareholders’ equity as part of
other comprehensive income.

In preparing its tax returns, the Company is
required to interpret complex tax laws and regulations and
utilize income and cost allocation methods to determine its
taxable income. On an ongoing basis, the Company is subject to
examinations by federal and state taxing authorities that may
give rise to differing interpretations of these complex laws,
regulations and methods. Due to the nature of the examination
process, it generally takes years before these examinations are
completed and matters are resolved. During 2004 the Company
resolved federal income tax examinations covering substantially
all of the Company’s legal entities for the years 1995
through 1999 and certain state tax examinations for the years
1995 through 2000. These examinations were resolved through a
series of negotiations held between the Company and
representatives of the various taxing authorities at both the
examination and appellate levels. The resolution of these
matters and the taxing authorities’ acceptance of submitted
claims and tax return adjustments resulted in a reduction of
accrued income tax expense of $106.3 million. At
December 31, 2004, the Company is in various stages of the
examination process for federal tax return matters of
U.S. Bancorp and its predecessor companies for periods
dating back to 2000. In addition, examinations by various state
taxing authorities date back to 1997. At year-end, the Company
believes the aggregate amount of any additional tax liabilities
that may result from these examinations, if any, will not have a
material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of
operations or cash flows of the Company.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities
reflect the tax effect of temporary differences between the
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial
reporting purposes and the amounts used for the same items for
income tax reporting purposes.


U.S. BANCORP


The significant components of the Company’s
net deferred tax liability as of December 31 were:

The Company has established a valuation allowance
to offset deferred tax assets related to state net operating
loss carryforwards which are expected to expire unused. The
Company has approximately $134 million of net operating
loss carryforwards which expire at various times through 2009.

Certain events covered by Internal Revenue Code
section 593(e), which was not repealed, will trigger a
recapture of base year reserves of acquired thrift institutions.
The base year reserves of acquired thrift institutions would be
recaptured if an entity ceases to qualify as a bank for federal
income tax purposes. The base year reserves of thrift
institutions also remain subject to income tax penalty
provisions that, in general, require recapture upon certain
stock redemptions of, and excess distributions to, stockholders.
At December 31, 2004, retained earnings included
approximately $101.8 million of base year reserves for
which no deferred federal income tax liability has been
recognized.

Note 22

Derivative Instruments

In the ordinary course of business, the Company
enters into derivative transactions to manage its interest rate,
prepayment and foreign currency risks and to accommodate the
business requirements of its customers. The Company does not
enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes.
Refer to Note 1 “Significant Accounting Policies”
in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a
discussion of the Company’s accounting policies for
derivative instruments. For information related to derivative
positions held for asset and liability management purposes and
customer-related derivative positions, see Table 17
“Derivative Positions,” included in Management’s
Discussion and Analysis, which is incorporated by reference in
these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

ASSET AND LIABILITY MANAGEMENT POSITIONS

Cash Flow Hedges

The
Company has $24.3 billion of designated cash flow hedges at
December 31, 2004. These derivatives are interest rate
swaps that are hedges of the forecasted cash flows from the
underlying variable-rate LIBOR loans and floating-rate debt. All
cash flow hedges are highly effective for the year ended
December 31, 2004, and the change in fair value attributed
to hedge ineffectiveness was not material.

At December 31, 2004 and 2003, accumulated
other comprehensive income included a deferred after-tax net
gain of $113.4 million and $174.9 million,
respectively, related to derivatives used to hedge cash flows.
The unrealized gain will be reflected in earnings when the
related cash flows or hedged transactions occur and will offset
the related performance of the hedged items. The occurrence of
these

U.S. BANCORP



related cash flows and hedged transactions
remains probable. The estimated amount of after-tax gain to be
reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into
earnings during 2005 is $65.8 million, which includes gains
related to hedges that were terminated early when the associated
forecasted transactions were still probable.

Fair Value Hedges

The Company has $7.8 billion of
designated fair value hedges at December 31, 2004. These
derivatives are primarily interest rate contracts that hedge the
change in fair value related to interest rate changes of
underlying fixed-rate debt and trust preferred securities. In
addition, the Company uses forward commitments to sell
residential mortgage loans to hedge its interest rate risk
related to residential mortgage loans held for sale. The Company
commits to sell the loans at specified prices in a future
period, typically within 90 days. The Company is exposed to
interest rate risk during the period between issuing a loan
commitment and the sale of the loan into the secondary market.

All fair value hedges are considered highly
effective for the year ended December 31, 2004. The change
in fair value attributed to hedge ineffectiveness was a gain of
$.7 million, related to the Company’s mortgage loans
held for sale and its 2004 production volume of
$17.4 billion.

Net Investment Hedges

In 2004, the Company entered into
derivatives to protect its net investment in certain foreign
operations. The Company uses forward commitments to sell
specified amounts of certain foreign currencies to hedge its
capital volatility risk associated with fluctuations in foreign
currency exchange rates. The net amount of gains or losses
included in the cumulative translation adjustment for 2004 was
not significant.

Other Asset and Liability Management
Derivative Positions

The Company has
derivative positions that are used for interest rate risk and
other risk management purposes but are not designated as cash
flow hedges or fair value hedges in accordance with the
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities.” At December 31, 2004, the Company
had $1.1 billion of forward commitments to sell residential
mortgage loans to hedge the Company’s interest rate risk
related to $1.0 billion of unfunded residential loan
commitments. Gains and losses on mortgage banking derivatives
and the unfunded loan commitments are included in mortgage
banking revenue on the Consolidated Statement of Income.

CUSTOMER-RELATED POSITIONS

The Company acts as a seller and buyer of
interest rate contracts and foreign exchange rate contracts on
behalf of customers. At December 31, 2004, the Company had
$20.0 billion of aggregate customer derivative positions,
including $15.8 billion of interest rate swaps, caps, and
floors and $4.2 billion of foreign exchange rate contracts.
The Company minimizes its market and liquidity risks by taking
similar offsetting positions. Gains or losses on
customer-related transactions were not significant for the year
ended December 31, 2004.

Note 23

Fair Values of Financial Instruments

Due to the nature of its business and its
customers’ needs, the Company offers a large number of
financial instruments, most of which are not actively traded.
When market quotes are unavailable, valuation techniques
including discounted cash flow calculations and pricing models
or services are used. The Company also uses various aggregation
methods and assumptions, such as the discount rate and cash flow
timing and amounts. As a result, the fair value estimates can
neither be substantiated by independent market comparisons, nor
realized by the immediate sale or settlement of the financial
instrument. Also, the estimates reflect a point in time and
could change significantly based on changes in economic factors,
such as interest rates. Furthermore, the disclosure of certain
financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities are not
required. Finally, the fair value disclosure is not intended to
estimate a market value of the Company as a whole. A summary of
the Company’s valuation techniques and assumptions follows.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The carrying value of cash, amounts
due from banks, federal funds sold and securities purchased
under resale agreements was assumed to approximate fair value.

Securities

Investment securities were valued
using available market quotes. In some instances, for securities
that are not widely traded, market quotes for comparable
securities were used.

Loans

The loan
portfolio includes adjustable and fixed-rate loans, the fair
value of which was estimated using discounted cash flow analyses
and other valuation techniques. To calculate discounted cash
flows, the loans were aggregated into pools of similar types and
expected repayment terms. The expected cash flows of loans
considered historical prepayment experiences and estimated
credit losses for nonperforming loans and were discounted using
current rates offered to borrowers of similar credit
characteristics. The fair value of floating-rate loans are
assumed to be equal to their carrying value.

Deposit Liabilities

The fair value of demand deposits,
savings accounts and certain money market deposits is equal to
the amount payable on demand at year-end. The fair value of
fixed-rate certificates of deposit was estimated


U.S. BANCORP


by discounting the contractual cash flow using
the discount rates implied by the high-grade corporate bond
yield curve.

Short-term Borrowings

Federal funds purchased, securities
sold under agreements to repurchase, commercial paper and other
short-term funds borrowed are at floating rates or have
short-term maturities. Their carrying value is assumed to
approximate their fair value.

Long-term Debt

The
estimated fair value of medium-term notes, bank notes, Federal
Home Loan Bank advances, capital lease obligations and mortgage
note obligations was determined using a discounted cash flow
analysis based on current market rates of similar maturity debt
securities to discount cash flows. Other long-term debt
instruments were valued using available market quotes.

Interest Rate Swaps, Equity Contracts, Basis
Swaps and Options

The interest rate
options and swap cash flows were estimated using a third-party
pricing model and discounted based on appropriate LIBOR,
eurodollar futures, swap, treasury note yield curves and equity
market prices.

Loan Commitments, Letters of Credit and
Guarantees

The fair value of
commitments, letters of credit and guarantees represents the
estimated costs to terminate or otherwise settle the obligations
with a third-party. Residential mortgage commitments are
actively traded and the fair value is estimated using available
market quotes. Other loan commitments, letters of credit and
guarantees are not actively traded. Substantially all loan
commitments have floating rates and do not expose the Company to
interest rate risk assuming no premium or discount was ascribed
to loan commitments because funding could occur at market rates.
The Company estimates the fair value of loan commitments,
letters of credit and guarantees based on the related amount of
unamortized deferred commitment fees adjusted for the probable
losses for these arrangements.

The estimated fair values of the Company’s
financial instruments at December 31 are shown in the table
below.

The fair value of unfunded commitments, standby
letters of credit and other guarantees is approximately equal to
their carrying value. The carrying value of unfunded commitments
and standby letters of credit was $253.8 million. The
carrying value of other guarantees was $74.9 million.

U.S. BANCORP



Note 24

Guarantees and Contingent Liabilities

COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT

Commitments to extend credit are legally binding
and generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination
clauses. The contractual amount represents the Company’s
exposure to credit loss, in the event of default by the
borrower. The Company manages this credit risk by using the same
credit policies it applies to loans. Collateral is obtained to
secure commitments based on management’s credit assessment
of the borrower. The collateral may include marketable
securities, receivables, inventory, equipment and real estate.
Since the Company expects many of the commitments to expire
without being drawn, total commitment amounts do not necessarily
represent the Company’s future liquidity requirements. In
addition, the commitments include consumer credit lines that are
cancelable upon notification to the consumer.

LETTERS OF CREDIT

Standby letters of credit are commitments the
Company issues to guarantee the performance of a customer to a
third-party. The guarantees frequently support public and
private borrowing arrangements, including commercial paper
issuances, bond financings and other similar transactions. The
Company issues commercial letters of credit on behalf of
customers to ensure payment or collection in connection with
trade transactions. In the event of a customer’s
nonperformance, the Company’s credit loss exposure is the
same as in any extension of credit, up to the letter’s
contractual amount. Management assesses the borrower’s
credit to determine the necessary collateral, which may include
marketable securities, receivables, inventory, equipment and
real estate. Since the conditions requiring the Company to fund
letters of credit may not occur, the Company expects its
liquidity requirements to be less than the total outstanding
commitments. The maximum potential future payments guaranteed by
the Company under standby letter of credit arrangements at
December 31, 2004, were approximately $10.6 billion
with a weighted-average term of approximately 22 months.
The estimated fair value of standby letters of credit was
approximately $75.5 million at December 31, 2004.

The contract or notional amounts of commitments
to extend credit and letters of credit at December 31,
2004, were as follows:

(a)

Discretionary facilities are included in less
    than one year.

LEASE COMMITMENTS

Rental expense for operating leases amounted to
$184.6 million in 2004, $205.0 million in 2003 and
$201.5 million in 2002. Future minimum payments, net of
sublease rentals, under capitalized leases and noncancelable
operating leases with initial or remaining terms of one year or
more, consisted of the following at December 31, 2004:

GUARANTEES

Guarantees are contingent commitments issued by
the Company to customers or other third-parties. The
Company’s guarantees primarily include parent guarantees
related to subsidiaries’ third-party borrowing
arrangements; third-party performance guarantees inherent in the
Company’s business operations such as indemnified
securities lending programs and merchant charge-back guarantees;
indemnification or buy-back provisions related to certain asset
sales; and contingent consideration arrangements related to
acquisitions. For certain guarantees, the Company has recorded a
liability related to the potential obligation, or has access to
collateral to support the guarantee or through the exercise of
other recourse provisions can offset some or all of the maximum
potential future payments made under these guarantees.

Third-Party Borrowing Arrangements

The Company provides guarantees to
third-parties as a part of certain


U.S. BANCORP


subsidiaries’ borrowing arrangements,
primarily representing guaranteed operating or capital lease
payments or other debt obligations with maturity dates extending
through 2013. The maximum potential future payments guaranteed
by the Company under these arrangements were approximately
$1.9 billion at December 31, 2004. The Company’s
recorded liabilities as of December 31, 2004, included
$10.7 million representing outstanding amounts owed to
these third-parties and required to be recorded on the
Company’s balance sheet in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States.

Commitments from Securities Lending

The Company participates in securities
lending activities by acting as the customer’s agent
involving the lending of securities. The Company indemnifies
customers for the difference between the market value of the
securities lent and the market value of the collateral received.
Cash collateralizes these transactions. The maximum potential
future payments guaranteed by the Company under these
arrangements were approximately $11.4 billion at
December 31, 2004, and represented the market value of the
securities lent to third-parties. At December 31, 2004, the
Company held assets with a market value of $11.7 billion as
collateral for these arrangements.

Asset Sales

The
Company has provided guarantees to certain third-parties in
connection with the sale of certain assets, primarily loan
portfolios and low-income housing tax credits. These guarantees
are generally in the form of asset buy-back or make-whole
provisions that are triggered upon a credit event or a change in
the tax-qualifying status of the related projects, as
applicable, and remain in effect until the loans are collected
or final tax credits are realized, respectively. The maximum
potential future payments guaranteed by the Company under these
arrangements were approximately $487.5 million at
December 31, 2004, and represented the total proceeds
received from the buyer in these transactions where the buy-back
or make-whole provisions have not yet expired. Recourse
available to the Company includes guarantees from the Small
Business Administration (for SBA loans sold), recourse against
the correspondent that originated the loan or to the private
mortgage issuer, the right to collect payments from the debtors,
and/or the right to liquidate the underlying collateral, if any,
and retain the proceeds. Based on its established loan-to-value
guidelines, the Company believes the recourse available is
sufficient to recover future payments, if any, under the loan
buy-back guarantees.

Merchant Processing

The Company, through its subsidiaries
NOVA Information Systems, Inc. and NOVA European Holdings
Company, provides merchant processing services. Under the rules
of credit card associations, a merchant processor retains a
contingent liability for credit card transactions processed.
This contingent liability arises in the event of a billing
dispute between the merchant and a cardholder that is ultimately
resolved in the cardholder’s favor. In this situation, the
transaction is “charged back” to the merchant and the
disputed amount is credited or otherwise refunded to the
cardholder. If the Company is unable to collect this amount from
the merchant, it bears the loss for the amount of the refund
paid to the cardholder.

A cardholder, through its issuing bank, generally
has until the latter of up to four months after the date the
transaction is processed or the receipt of the product or
service to present a charge-back to the Company as the merchant
processor. The absolute maximum potential liability is estimated
to be the total volume of credit card transactions that meet the
associations’ requirements to be valid charge-back
transactions at any given time. Management estimates that the
maximum potential exposure for charge-backs would approximate
the total amount of merchant transactions processed through the
credit card associations for the last four months. For the last
four months this amount totaled approximately
$51.5 billion. In most cases, this contingent liability is
unlikely to arise, as most products and services are delivered
when purchased and amounts are refunded when items are returned
to merchants. However, where the product or service is not
provided until a future date (“future delivery”), the
potential for this contingent liability increases. To mitigate
this risk, the Company may require the merchant to make an
escrow deposit, may place maximum volume limitations on future
delivery transactions processed by the merchant at any point in
time, or may require various credit policy enhancements
(including letters of credit and bank guarantees). Also,
merchant processing contracts may include event triggers to
provide the Company more financial and operational control in
the event of financial deterioration of the merchant. At
December 31, 2004, the Company held $35.7 million of
merchant escrow deposits as collateral.

The Company currently processes card transactions
for several of the largest airlines in the United States. In the
event of liquidation of these airlines, the Company could become
financially liable for refunding tickets purchased through the
credit card associations under the charge-back provisions.
Charge-back risk related to an airline is evaluated in a manner
similar to credit risk assessments and merchant processing
contracts consider the potential risk of default. At
December 31, 2004, the value of future delivery airline
tickets purchased was approximately $1.9 billion, and the
Company held collateral of $191.9 million in escrow
deposits and letters of credit related to airline customer
transactions.

U.S. BANCORP



In the normal course of business, the Company has
unresolved charge-backs that are in process of resolution. The
Company assesses the likelihood of its potential liability based
on the extent and nature of unresolved charge-backs and its
historical loss experience. At December 31, 2004, the
Company had a recorded liability for potential losses of
$31.8 million. In addition, the Company had a
$53.8 million liability for obligations associated with its
airline processing business.

Other Guarantees

The
Company provides liquidity and credit enhancement facilities to
a Company-sponsored conduit, as more fully described in the Note
10. Although management believes a draw against these facilities
is remote, the maximum potential future payments guaranteed by
the Company under these arrangements were approximately
$5.7 billion at December 31, 2004. The recorded fair
value of the Company’s liability for the credit enhancement
recourse obligation and liquidity facility was
$32.4 million at December 31, 2004, and was included
in other liabilities.

OTHER CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

In connection with the spin-off of Piper Jaffray
Companies, the Company has agreed to indemnify Piper Jaffray
Companies against losses that may result from third-party claims
relating to certain specified matters. The Company’s
indemnification obligation related to these specified matters is
capped at $17.5 million and can be terminated by the
Company if there is a change in control event for Piper Jaffray
Companies. Through December 31, 2004, the Company has paid
approximately $3.3 million to Piper Jaffray Companies under
this agreement.

The Company is subject to various other
litigation, investigations and legal and administrative cases
and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of its
businesses. Due to their complex nature, it may be years before
some matters are resolved. While it is impossible to ascertain
the ultimate resolution or range of financial liability with
respect to these contingent matters, the Company believes that
the aggregate amount of such liabilities will not have a
material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of
operations or cash flows of the Company.

Transfer of funds (dividends, loans or advances)
from bank subsidiaries to the Company is restricted. Federal law
prohibits loans unless they are secured and generally limits any
loan to the Company or individual affiliate to 10 percent
of each bank’s unimpaired capital and surplus. In
aggregate, loans to the Company and all affiliates cannot exceed
20 percent of each bank’s unimpaired capital and
surplus.

Dividend payments to the Company by its
subsidiary banks are subject to regulatory review and statutory
limitations and, in some instances, regulatory approval. The
approval of the Comptroller of the Currency is required if total
dividends by a national bank in any calendar year exceed the
bank’s net income for that year combined with its retained
net income for the preceding two calendar years or if the
bank’s retained earnings are less than zero. Furthermore,
dividends are restricted by the Comptroller of the
Currency’s minimum capital constraints for all national
banks. Within these guidelines, all bank subsidiaries have the
ability to pay dividends without prior regulatory approval. The
amount of dividends available to the parent company from the
bank subsidiaries at December 31, 2004, was approximately
$1.2 billion.

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT

Responsibility for the financial statements and
other information presented throughout the Annual Report on
Form 10-K rests with the management of U.S. Bancorp. The
Company believes that the consolidated financial statements have
been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States and present the substance of
transactions based on the circumstances and management’s
best estimates and judgment.

In meeting its responsibilities for the
reliability of the financial statements, management is
responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system
of internal control over financial reporting as defined by
Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934. The Company’s system of internal controls is
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
publicly filed financial statements in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

To test compliance, the Company carries out an
extensive audit program. This program includes a review for
compliance with written policies and procedures and a
comprehensive review of the adequacy and effectiveness of the
internal control system. Although control procedures are
designed and tested, it must be recognized that there are limits
inherent in all systems of internal control and, therefore,
errors and irregularities may nevertheless occur. Also,
estimates and judgments are required to assess and balance the
relative cost and expected benefits of the controls. Projection
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The Board of Directors of the Company has an
Audit Committee composed of directors who are independent of
U.S. Bancorp. The committee meets periodically with
management, the internal auditors and the independent
accountants to consider audit results and to discuss internal
accounting control, auditing and financial reporting matters.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal controls over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2004. In making this assessment, management
used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission in its Internal
Control-Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment and those
criteria, management believes that the Company designed and
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2004.

The Company’s independent accountants,
Ernst & Young LLP, have been engaged to render an
independent professional opinion on the financial statements and
issue an attestation report on management’s assessment of
the Company’s system of internal control over financial
reporting. Their opinion on the financial statements appearing
on page 105 and their attestation on the system of internal
controls over financial reporting appearing on page 107 are
based on procedures conducted in accordance with auditing
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States).

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC
ACCOUNTING FIRM ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL
REPORTING

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of U.S.
Bancorp:

We have audited management’s assessment,
included in the accompanying Report of Management, that
U.S. Bancorp maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on
criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).
U.S. Bancorp’s management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the
effectiveness of the company’s internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance
with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that
U.S. Bancorp maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, is fairly
stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria.
Also, in our opinion, U.S. Bancorp maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on the COSO
criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States), the consolidated balance sheets of
U.S. Bancorp as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the
related consolidated statements of income, shareholders’
equity, and cash flows for each of the two years in the period
ended December 31, 2004 and our report dated
February 18, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

U.S. BANCORP


General Business Description

U.S. Bancorp is a multi-state
financial holding company headquartered in Minneapolis,
Minnesota. U.S. Bancorp was incorporated in Delaware in 1929 and
operates as a financial holding company and a bank holding
company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. U.S. Bancorp
provides a full range of financial services, including lending
and depository services, cash management, foreign exchange and
trust and investment management services. It also engages in
credit card services, merchant and automated teller machine
(“ATM”) processing, mortgage banking, insurance,
brokerage, leasing and investment banking.

U.S. Bancorp’s banking subsidiaries are
engaged in the general banking business, principally in domestic
markets. The subsidiaries range in size from $25 million to
$128 billion in deposits and provide a wide range of
products and services to individuals, businesses, institutional
organizations, governmental entities and other financial
institutions. Commercial and consumer lending services are
principally offered to customers within the Company’s
domestic markets, to domestic customers with foreign operations
and within certain niche national venues. Lending services
include traditional credit products as well as credit card
services, financing and import/export trade, asset-backed
lending, agricultural finance and other products. Leasing
products are offered through bank leasing subsidiaries.
Depository services include checking accounts, savings accounts
and time certificate contracts. Ancillary services such as
foreign exchange, treasury management and receivable lock-box
collection are provided to corporate customers.
U.S. Bancorp’s bank and trust subsidiaries provide a
full range of asset management and fiduciary services for
individuals, estates, foundations, business corporations and
charitable organizations.

U.S. Bancorp’s non-banking subsidiaries
primarily offer investment and insurance products to the
Company’s customers principally within its markets and
mutual fund processing services to a broad range of mutual funds.

Banking and investment services are provided
through a network of 2,370 banking offices principally operating
in 24 states in the Midwest and West. The Company operates
a network of 4,620 branded ATMs and provides 24-hour, seven day
a week telephone customer service. Mortgage banking services are
provided through banking offices and loan production offices
throughout the Company’s markets. Consumer lending products
may be originated through banking offices, indirect
correspondents, brokers or other lending sources, and a consumer
finance division. The Company is also one of the largest
providers of Visa® corporate and purchasing card services
and corporate trust services in the United States. A
wholly-owned subsidiary, NOVA Information Systems, Inc.
(“NOVA”), provides merchant processing services
directly to merchants and through a network of banking
affiliations. Affiliates of NOVA provide similar merchant
services in Canada and segments of Europe. These foreign
operations are not significant to the Company.

On a full-time equivalent basis, as of
December 31, 2004, U.S. Bancorp employed 48,831 persons.

Competition

The
commercial banking business is highly competitive. Subsidiary
banks compete with other commercial banks and with other
financial institutions, including savings and loan associations,
mutual savings banks, finance companies, mortgage banking
companies, credit unions and investment companies. In recent
years, competition has increased from institutions not subject
to the same regulatory restrictions as domestic banks and bank
holding companies.

Government Policies

The operations of the Company’s
various operating units are affected by state and federal
legislative changes and by policies of various regulatory
authorities, including those of the numerous states in which
they operate, the United States and foreign governments. These
policies include, for example, statutory maximum legal lending
rates, domestic monetary policies of the Board of Governors of
the Federal Reserve System, United States fiscal policy,
international currency regulations and monetary policies, U.S.
Patriot Act and capital adequacy and liquidity constraints
imposed by bank regulatory agencies.

Supervision and Regulation

As a registered bank holding company
and financial holding company under the Bank Holding Company
Act, U.S. Bancorp is subject to the supervision of, and
regulation by, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System.

Under the Bank Holding Company Act, a financial
holding company may engage in banking, managing or controlling
banks, furnishing or performing services for banks it controls,
and conducting other financial activities. U.S. Bancorp
must obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board
before acquiring more than 5 percent of the outstanding shares
of another bank or bank holding company, and must provide notice
to, and in some situations obtain the prior approval of, the
Federal Reserve Board in connection with engaging in, or
acquiring more than 5 percent of the outstanding shares of
a company engaged in, a new financial activity.

Under the Bank Holding Company Act,
U.S. Bancorp may acquire banks throughout the United
States, subject only to state or federal deposit caps and state
minimum age requirements.

National banks are subject to the supervision of,
and are examined by, the Comptroller of the Currency. All
subsidiary banks of the Company are members of the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation and are subject to

U.S. BANCORP



examination by the FDIC. In practice, the primary
federal regulator makes regular examinations of each subsidiary
bank subject to its regulatory review or participates in joint
examinations with other federal regulators. Areas subject to
regulation by federal authorities include the allowance for
credit losses, investments, loans, mergers, issuance of
securities, payment of dividends, establishment of branches and
other aspects of operations.

Properties

U.S. Bancorp and its significant
subsidiaries occupy headquarter offices under a long-term lease
in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The Company also leases eight
freestanding operations centers in St. Paul, Portland,
Milwaukee and Denver. The Company owns six principal operations
centers in Cincinnati, St. Louis, Fargo, Milwaukee and
St. Paul. At December 31, 2004, the Company’s
subsidiaries owned and operated a total of 1,484 facilities and
leased an additional 1,462 facilities, all of which are well
maintained. The Company believes its current facilities are
adequate to meet its needs. Additional information with respect
to premises and equipment is presented in Notes 11 and 24
of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Equity Compensation Plan Information

The following table summarizes
information regarding equity compensation plans in effect as of
December 31, 2004.

(a)

No shares are available for the granting of
    future awards under the U.S. Bancorp 1998 Executive Stock
    Incentive Plan or the U.S. Bancorp 1991 Executive Stock
    Incentive plan. The 35,154,782 shares available under the
    U.S. Bancorp 2001 Stock Incentive Plan may become the subject of
    future awards in the form of stock options, stock appreciation
    rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance
    awards or other stock-based awards, except that only 7,476,383
    of these shares are available for future grants of awards other
    than stock options or stock appreciation rights.

(b)

Includes shares underlying stock options and
    restricted stock units (convertible into shares of the
    Company’s common stock on a one-for-one basis) under the
    U.S. Bancorp 2001 Stock Incentive Plan, the U.S. Bancorp 1998
    Executive Stock Incentive Plan and the U.S. Bancorp 1991
    Executive Stock Incentive Plan. Excludes 43,728,386 shares
    underlying outstanding stock options and warrants assumed by
    U.S. Bancorp in connection with acquisitions by U.S. Bancorp. Of
    the excluded shares, 39,283,290 underlie stock options granted
    under equity compensation plans of the former U.S. Bancorp that
    were approved by the shareholders of the former U.S.
    Bancorp.

(c)

Includes 3,585,410 shares of common stock
    issuable pursuant to the U.S. Bancorp Deferred Compensation
    Plan. All of the remaining identified shares underlie stock
    options granted to a broad-based employee population pursuant to
    the U.S. Bancorp 2001 Employee Stock Incentive plan, the Firstar
    Corporation 1999 Employee Stock Incentive Plan, the Firstar
    Corporation 1998 Employee Stock Incentive Plan and the Star Banc
    Corporation 1996 Starshare Stock Incentive Plan for
    Employees.

(d)

The weighted-average exercise price does not
    include any assumed price at issuance of shares that may be
    issuable pursuant to the Deferred Compensation Plan.

The U.S. Bancorp Deferred Compensation Plan
allows non-employee directors and members of our senior
management, including all of our executive officers, to defer
all or part of their compensation until retirement or earlier
termination of employment. The deferred compensation is deemed
to be invested in one of several investment alternatives at the
option of the participant, including shares of U.S. Bancorp
common stock. Deferred compensation deemed to be invested in
U.S. Bancorp stock may be received at the time of distribution
at the election of the participant, in the form of shares of
U.S. Bancorp common stock. The 3,585,410 shares included in the
table assumes that participants in the plan whose deferred
compensation had been deemed to be invested in U.S. Bancorp
common stock had elected to receive all of that deferred
compensation in shares of U.S. Bancorp common stock on
December 31, 2004.

Under the U.S. Bancorp 2001 Employee Stock
Incentive Plan (“2001 Plan”), 11,678,800 shares are
authorized for issuance pursuant to the grant of nonqualified
stock options to any full-time or part-time employee actively
employed by U.S. Bancorp on the grant date, other than
individuals eligible to participate in any of the Company’s
executive stock incentive plans or in U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray
Inc.’s annual option plan. As of December 31, 2004,
options to purchase an aggregate of 4,506,987 shares were
outstanding under the plan. All options under the plan were
granted on February 27, 2001.

As of December 31, 2004, options to purchase
an aggregate of 1,355,214 shares of the Company’s common
stock were outstanding under the Firstar Corporation 1999
Employee Stock Incentive Plan (“1999 Plan”). Under
this plan, stock options were granted to each full-time or
part-time employee actively employed by Firstar Corporation on
the grant date, other than managers who participated in an
executive stock incentive plan.

As of December 31, 2004, options to purchase
an aggregate of 2,041,696 shares of the Company’s common
stock were outstanding under the Firstar Corporation 1998
Employee Stock Incentive Plan (“1998 Plan”). Under
this plan, stock options were granted to each full-time or
part-time employee actively employed by Firstar Corporation on
the grant date, other than managers who participated in an
executive stock incentive plan.

As of December 31, 2004, options to purchase
an aggregate of 288,376 shares of the Company’s common


U.S. BANCORP


stock were outstanding under the Star Banc
Corporation 1996 Starshare Stock Incentive Plan for Employees
(“1996 Plan”). Under the plan, stock options were
granted to each employee of Star Banc Corporation, a predecessor
company, other than managers who participated in an executive
stock incentive plan.

No further options will be granted under any of
these plans. Under all of the plans, the exercise price of the
options equals the fair market value of the underlying common
stock on the grant date. All options granted under the plan have
a term of 10 years from the grant date and become
exercisable over a period of time set forth in the plan or
determined by the committee administering the plan. Options
granted under the plan are nontransferable and, during the
optionee’s lifetime, are exercisable only by the optionee.

If an optionee is terminated as a result of his
or her gross misconduct or offense, all options terminate
immediately, whether or not vested. Under the 2001 Plan, the
1999 Plan and the 1998 Plan, in the event an optionee is
terminated immediately following a change in control (as defined
in the plans) of U.S. Bancorp, and the termination is due to
business needs resulting from the change in control and not as a
result of the optionee’s performance or conduct, all of the
optionee’s outstanding options will become immediately
vested and exercisable as of the date of such termination. Under
the 1996 Plan, all outstanding options vest and become
exercisable immediately following a change in control.

If the outstanding shares of common stock of
U.S. Bancorp are changed into or exchanged for a different
number or kind of shares of stock or other securities as a
result of a reorganization, recapitalization, stock dividend,
stock split, combination of shares, reclassification, merger,
consolidation or similar event, the number of shares underlying
outstanding options also may be adjusted. The plans may be
terminated, amended or modified by the Board of Directors at any
time.
