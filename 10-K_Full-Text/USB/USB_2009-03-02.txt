Capital
    Covenants

The Company has entered into several transactions involving the
    issuance of capital securities (“Capital Securities”)
    by Delaware statutory trusts formed by the Company (the
    “Trusts”), the issuance by the Company of preferred
    stock (“Preferred Stock”) or the issuance by an
    indirect subsidiary of U.S. Bank National Association of
    preferred stock exchangeable for the Company’s Preferred
    Stock under certain circumstances (“Exchangeable Preferred
    Stock”). Simultaneously with the closing of each of those
    transactions, the Company entered into a replacement capital
    covenant (each, a “Replacement Capital Covenant” and
    collectively, the “Replacement Capital Covenants”) for
    the benefit of persons that buy, hold or sell a specified series
    of long-term indebtedness of the Company or U.S. Bank
    National Association (the “Covered Debt”). Each of the
    Replacement Capital Covenants provides that neither the Company
    nor any of its subsidiaries (including any of the Trusts) will
    repay, redeem or purchase any of the Preferred Stock,
    Exchangeable Preferred Stock or the Capital Securities and the
    securities held by the Trust (the “Other Securities”),
    as applicable, on or before the date specified in the applicable
    Replacement Capital Covenant, with certain limited exceptions,
    except to the extent that, during the 180 days prior to the
    date of that repayment, redemption or purchase, the Company has
    received proceeds from the sale of qualifying securities that
    (i) have equity-like characteristics that are the same as,
    or more equity-like than, the applicable characteristics of the
    Preferred Stock, the Exchangeable Preferred Stock, the Capital
    Securities or Other Securities, as applicable,


at the time of repayment, redemption or purchase, and
    (ii) the Company has obtained the prior approval of the
    Federal Reserve Board, if such approval is then required by the
    Federal Reserve Board or, in the case of the Exchangeable
    Preferred Stock, the approval of the Office of the Comptroller
    of the Currency.

The Company will provide a copy of any Replacement Capital
    Covenant to a holder of the relevant Covered Debt. For copies of
    any of these documents, holders should write to Investor
    Relations, U.S. Bancorp, 800 Nicollet Mall,
    Minneapolis, Minnesota 55402, or call

(866) 775-9668.

    each transaction, (ii) issuer, (iii) series of Capital

As of December 31, 2008, options to purchase an aggregate
    of 1,563,985 shares were outstanding under the 2001 Plan.
    Under the 2001 Plan, nonqualified stock options were granted to
    full-time or part-time employees actively employed by
    U.S. Bancorp on the grant date, other than individuals
    eligible to participate in any of the Company’s executive
    stock incentive plans. All options outstanding under the plan
    were granted on February 27, 2001.

As of December 31, 2008, options to purchase an aggregate
    of 379,315 shares of the Company’s common stock were
    outstanding under the 1999 Plan. Under this plan, stock options
    were granted to each full-time or part-time employee actively
    employed by Firstar Corporation on the grant date, other than
    managers who participated in an executive stock incentive plan.

As of December 31, 2008, options to purchase an aggregate
    of 27,792 shares of the Company’s common stock were
    outstanding under the 1998 Plan. Under this plan, stock options
    were granted to each full-time or part-time


employee actively employed by Firstar Corporation on the grant
    date, other than managers who participated in an executive stock
    incentive plan.

No further options will be granted under the 2001 Plan, the 1999
    Plan or the 1998 Plan. Under all of these plans, the exercise
    price of the options equals the fair market value of the
    underlying common stock on the grant date. All options granted
    under the plans have a term of 10 years from the grant date
    and become exercisable over a period of time set forth in the
    relevant plan or as determined by the committee administering
    the relevant plan. Options granted under the plans are
    nontransferable and, during the optionee’s lifetime, are
    exercisable only by the optionee.

If an optionee is terminated as a result of his or her gross
    misconduct or offense, all options terminate immediately,
    whether or not vested. Under the 2001 Plan, the 1999 Plan and
    the 1998 Plan, in the event an optionee is terminated
    immediately following a change in control (as defined in the
    plans) of U.S. Bancorp, and the termination is due to
    business needs resulting from the change in control and not as a
    result of the optionee’s performance or conduct, all of the
    optionee’s outstanding options will become immediately
    vested and exercisable as of the date of termination.

If the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock are
    changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of
    stock or other securities as a result of a reorganization,
    recapitalization, stock dividend, stock split, combination of
    shares, reclassification, merger, consolidation or similar
    event, the number of shares underlying outstanding options also
    may be adjusted. The plans may be terminated, amended or
    modified by the Board of Directors at any time.

The deferred compensation plans allow non-employee directors and
    members of the Company’s senior management to defer all or
    part of their compensation until the earlier of retirement or
    termination of employment. The deferred compensation is deemed
    to be invested in one of several investment alternatives at the
    option of the participant, including shares of U.S. Bancorp
    common stock. Deferred compensation deemed to be invested in
    U.S. Bancorp stock may be received at the time of
    distribution at the election of the participant, in the form of
    shares of U.S. Bancorp common stock. The
    2,813,292 shares included in the table assumes that
    participants in the plans whose deferred compensation had been
    deemed to be invested in U.S. Bancorp common stock had
    elected to receive all of that deferred compensation in shares
    of U.S. Bancorp common stock on December 31, 2008. The
    U.S. Bancorp 2005 Executive Employees Deferred Compensation
    Plan and the U.S. Bancorp 2005 Outside Directors Deferred
    Compensation Plan are the Company’s only deferred
    compensation plans under which compensation may currently be
    deferred.
