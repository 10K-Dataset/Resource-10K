ARTHUR J. GALLAGHER & CO.

ANNUAL
REPORT ON FORM 10-K

FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER
31, 2004

INDEX



PART I

Item 1. Business.

General

Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to
as “Gallagher” unless the context otherwise requires) are engaged in providing insurance brokerage, risk management and related services to clients in the United States and abroad. Gallagher’s principal activity is the negotiation and
placement of insurance for its clients. Gallagher also specializes in furnishing risk management services. Risk management involves assisting clients in analyzing risks and determining whether proper protection is best obtained through the purchase
of insurance or through retention of all or a portion of those risks and the adoption of corporate risk management policies and cost-effective loss control and prevention programs. Risk management services also include claims management, loss
control consulting and property appraisals. Gallagher believes that its ability to deliver comprehensively structured risk management and brokerage services is one of its major strengths. In addition, Gallagher has a financial services operation
that manages its investment portfolio.

Gallagher operates
through a network of more than 250 sales and service offices located throughout the United States and seven countries abroad and through a network of correspondent brokers and consultants in more than 100 countries around the world. Some of these
offices are fully staffed with sales, marketing, claims and other service personnel; others function as servicing offices for the brokerage and risk management service operations of Gallagher. Gallagher’s international operations include a
Lloyd’s of London broker and affiliated companies in England and other facilities in Australia, Bermuda, Canada, Malaysia, Scotland and Singapore.

Gallagher was founded in 1927 and was reincorporated as a Delaware corporation in 1972. Gallagher’s executive offices are located at Two Pierce
Place, Itasca, Illinois 60143-3141, and its telephone number is (630) 773-3800.

Information Concerning Forward-Looking Statements

This annual report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of that term in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Act”) found at Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Additional written or oral forward-looking statements may be made by Gallagher from time to time in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), press
releases, or otherwise. Statements contained in this report that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Act.

Forward-looking statements may include, but are not limited to, discussions concerning revenues, expenses, earnings, cash
flow, capital structure, financial losses, as well as market and industry conditions, premium rates, financial markets, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, contingencies and matters relating to Gallagher’s operations and income taxes. In
addition, when used in this report, the words “anticipates,” “believes,” “should,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans” and variations thereof and similar expressions are
intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are based on available current market and industry material, experts’ reports and opinions and long-term trends, as well as management’s expectations
concerning future events impacting Gallagher.

Forward-looking
statements made by or on behalf of Gallagher are subject to risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to the following: Gallagher’s commission revenues are highly dependent on premiums charged by insurers, which are subject to
fluctuation; lower interest rates reduce Gallagher’s income earned on invested funds; the alternative insurance market continues to grow which could unfavorably impact commission and favorably impact fee revenue, though not necessarily to the
same extent; Gallagher’s revenues vary significantly from period to period as a result of the timing of policy inception dates and the net effect of new and lost business production; the insurance brokerage industry is subject to a great deal
of uncertainty due to investigations into its business practices by various governmental authorities and related private litigation; the general level of economic activity can have a substantial impact on Gallagher’s renewal business;
Gallagher’s operating results, returns on investments and financial position may be adversely impacted by exposure to various market risks such as interest rate, equity pricing, foreign exchange rates and the competitive environment or the
outcome of litigation concerning Gallagher’s Syn/Coal production, Gallagher’s revenues and net earnings may be subject to reduction due to the elimination of contingent commission arrangements in 2005 and related developments in the
insurance industry; and Gallagher’s effective income tax rate may be subject to increase as a result of changes in income tax laws, unfavorable interpretations of such laws or developments resulting in the loss or unavailability of Syn/Coal
Credits. Gallagher’s ability to grow has been enhanced through acquisitions, which may or may not be available on acceptable terms in the future and which, if consummated, may or may not be advantageous to Gallagher. Accordingly, actual results
may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.



Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements contained in this
report, which speak only as of the date set forth on the signature page hereto. Gallagher undertakes no obligation to publicly release the result of any revisions to these forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect events or
circumstances after such date or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.

Operating Segments

Gallagher has identified three operating segments: Brokerage, Risk Management and Financial Services. The Brokerage segment, for commission or fee compensation, primarily places commercial property/casualty (P/C) and employee
benefit-related insurance on behalf of its customers. The Risk Management segment provides P/C and health claim third-party administration, loss control and risk management consulting and insurance property appraisals. Third party administration is
principally the management and processing of claims for self-insurance programs of Gallagher’s clients or clients of other brokers. The Financial Services segment is responsible for managing Gallagher’s investment portfolio.

The two major sources of operating revenues for Gallagher are commissions
from brokerage operations and service fees from brokerage and risk management operations. Information with respect to all sources of revenue, by operating segment, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004, is as follows (in
millions):

See Note 19 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements of Gallagher’s 2004 Financial Statements, which are incorporated herein by reference for additional financial information, including earnings before income taxes and identifiable assets, by operating segment,
for 2004, 2003 and 2002.

During 2004, 2003 and 2002,
Gallagher’s total revenues and expenses each increased sequentially from quarter-to-quarter within the calendar years, except for third quarter 2002, which was negatively impacted by $28.9 million of investment write-downs. However, commission
and fee revenues and the related expenses can vary from quarter-to-quarter as a result of the timing of policy inception dates that historically are heaviest in third and fourth quarters. Alternatively, salaries and employee benefits, rent,
depreciation and amortization expenses generally tend to be more uniform throughout the year. In addition, the timing of acquisitions will also impact the trends in Gallagher’s quarterly operating results. See Note 18 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements of Gallagher’s 2004 Financial Statements, which are incorporated herein by reference for unaudited quarterly operating results for 2004 and 2003.

Brokerage

The Brokerage segment comprises three operating divisions: the Brokerage Services-Retail Division (BSD), Specialty Marketing and International (SMI) and
Gallagher Benefit Services (GBS).

BSD places insurance for and
services commercial, industrial, institutional, governmental, religious and personal accounts throughout the United States and abroad. SMI places insurance for and services commercial, industrial, institutional, governmental, religious and personal
accounts throughout the United States and abroad. BSD and SMI act as agents in soliciting,



negotiating and effecting contracts of insurance through insurance companies worldwide, as brokers in procuring contracts of insurance on behalf of insureds,
and as administrators in setting up and managing self-insured programs. In addition, SMI places insurance on behalf of other brokers. BSD and SMI both have the capability to handle insurable risks and related coverages for all forms of P/C products.
SMI also places surplus lines coverages, which are coverages for various specialized risks not available from insurance companies licensed by the states in which the risks are located. In addition, SMI’s reinsurance intermediary operations
place reinsurance coverages for its insurance company clients.

GBS specializes in the management of employee benefit programs through fully insured and self-insured programs. GBS provides services in connection with the design, financing, implementation, administration and communication of compensation
and employee benefit programs (including pension and profit-sharing plans, group life, health, accident and disability insurance programs and income tax deferral plans), and provides other professional services in connection therewith.

The primary source of Gallagher’s compensation for its Brokerage
segment is commissions paid by insurance companies which are usually based upon a percentage of the premium paid by insureds. Commission rates are dependent on a number of factors including the type of insurance, the particular insurance company and
the capacity in which Gallagher acts. In some cases, Gallagher is compensated for brokerage or advisory services directly by fees from clients. Historically, Gallagher also has received contingent commissions which are based on the estimated profit
the underwriting insurance company earns and/or the overall volume of business placed by Gallagher in a given period of time. Occasionally, Gallagher shares commissions with other brokers who have participated with Gallagher in placing insurance or
servicing insureds. GBS receives a fee for acting in the capacity of advisor and administrator with respect to employee benefit programs and receives commissions in connection with the placement of insurance under such programs. On October 26, 2004,
Gallagher announced that it will not enter into any new volume-based or profit-based contingent commissions agreements as a retail broker effective January 1, 2005. Accordingly, it is expected that future contingent commission revenues could be
substantially reduced.

Risk Management

The Risk Management segment comprises two wholly-owned subsidiaries:
Gallagher Bassett Services (GB) and Gallagher Benefit Administrators (GBA). Approximately 90% of this segment’s total revenues are generated by GB.

GB provides a full range of risk management services including claims management, risk control consulting services, information management, and property
appraisals on a totally integrated or select, stand-alone basis. GB provides these services for Gallagher’s clients through a network of service offices located throughout the United States, Canada, England, Scotland and Australia.

GB primarily markets its risk management services directly to clients on
an unbundled basis independent of Gallagher. GB also markets these services to BSD and SMI clients who use P/C risk management related services.

In connection with its risk management services, GB provides “self-insurance” programs for large institutions, risk sharing pools and
associations, and large commercial and industrial customers. Self-insurance, as administered by GB, is a program in which the client assumes a manageable portion of its insurance risks, usually (although not always) placing the less predictable and
larger loss exposures with an insurance carrier that specializes in these less predictable exposures.

GBA is a third-party administrator that serves the self-funded employee health benefit marketplace by integrating managed care and quality assurance
programs with claims administration services. The employee health benefit services provided by GBA are, in many instances, directly supported by GBS.

GB’s and GBA’s revenues for risk management services are substantially in the form of fees. These fees are typically negotiated in advance on an
annual basis based upon the estimated volume of the services to be performed.

Financial Services

Financial Services is
primarily responsible for Gallagher’s investment portfolio, which includes tax advantaged investments, real estate partnerships, an investment in Allied World Assurance Holdings, Ltd., an alternative investment fund manager, notes receivable
from investees and an investment in an airplane leasing company that leases two cargo airplanes to the French Postal Service. Financial Services manages the invested assets of Gallagher in order to maximize the long-term after-tax return to
Gallagher. During first quarter 2003, Gallagher decided to withdraw virtually all continued support for its venture capital investments, except to the limited extent needed to realize value from the remaining assets. Without Gallagher’s
support, it was doubtful that these operations would be able to execute their business plans. Therefore, Gallagher’s venture capital



investments were determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired resulting in a $25.7 million pretax charge in first quarter 2003. In addition, effective
July 1, 2003, Gallagher early adopted FASB Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46), “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,” which required Gallagher to consolidate one partially-owned entity, that was determined to be a variable interest
entity (VIE) and previously not consolidated because it was not controlled by Gallagher through a majority voting interest. The adoption of FIN 46 did not result in any additional debt on Gallagher’s consolidated balance sheet nor did it have
any impact on its 2003 consolidated net earnings or December 31, 2003 stockholders’ equity. During third quarter 2004, Gallagher sold a portion of its interest in this investment, which eliminated the requirement to consolidate the investment
under the FIN 46 rules. This investment is now accounted for using equity method accounting. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of Gallagher’s 2004 Financial Statements, which are incorporated herein by reference for a summary
of Gallagher’s investments.

Gallagher’s overall
non-fiduciary investment strategy going forward will be primarily focused on tax advantaged investments and real estate partnerships. Gallagher uses the limited partnership or limited liability company forms of legal ownership to fund many of its
investments in order to obtain favorable tax treatment with respect to gains, losses and distributions, while limiting its liability. Based on the ownership structure of these investments, management believes that Gallagher’s exposure to losses
related to these investments is limited to the combination of its net carrying value, letters of credit, financial guarantees and funding commitments. In the event that certain of these limited partnerships or limited liability companies were to
default on their debt obligations and Gallagher’s net carrying value became impaired, the amount to be written-off could have a material effect on Gallagher’s consolidated financial position or operating results. In some cases, Gallagher
may be at risk for tax credits taken in previous years, which may also be material to its operations. See Note 3 and Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of Gallagher’s 2004 Financial Statements, which are incorporated herein by
reference for a summary of outstanding letters of credit, financial guarantees and funding commitments and Note 7 for a summary of outstanding debt and contingent commitments. In addition, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a
summary of Gallagher’s tax credit exposure.

International Operations

Total revenues by geographic area for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2004 are as follows (in millions):

The Brokerage
segment’s international operations comprise the following: a Lloyd’s of London broker and an insurance brokerage and risk management operation in the United Kingdom; an insurance brokerage operation and two “rent-a-captive”
insurance company facilities in Bermuda; reinsurance intermediary operations in Australia and Singapore; and a network of correspondent brokers and consultants in more than 100 countries around the world.

Arthur J. Gallagher (UK) (AJG UK) is a wholly-owned London-based subsidiary
of Gallagher. It provides brokerage and other services to clients primarily located outside the United Kingdom. The principal activity of AJG UK is to negotiate and place insurance and reinsurance with London underwriters and insurance companies
worldwide. In addition, AJG UK is a Financial Services Authority (FSA) registered broker and an approved Lloyd’s of London broker. AJG UK’s brokerage services encompass most classes of business within the general categories of aviation,
marine, reinsurance (treaty and facultative) and P/C. The thrust of AJG UK’s business development has been with non-United Kingdom brokers, agents and insurers rather than domestic United Kingdom retail business. Its clients are primarily
insurance and reinsurance companies, underwriters at Lloyd’s of London, Gallagher’s non-United Kingdom subsidiaries, other independent agents and brokers and major business corporations requiring direct insurance and reinsurance
placements.

Risk Management Partners (RMP) is a wholly-owned
London-based subsidiary of Gallagher that markets customized insurance and risk management products and services to United Kingdom public entities through offices in England and Scotland. RMP was formed in 1994 and Gallagher believes that RMP is now
the third largest provider of insurance brokerage related services to the public entity market in the United Kingdom.



Arthur J. Gallagher (Bermuda) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gallagher that provides clients with direct
access to the risk-taking capacity of foreign insurers for both direct and reinsurance placements. It also acts as a wholesaler to Gallagher’s marketing efforts by accessing global insurance and reinsurance companies in the placement of United
States and foreign risks. In addition, it provides services relating to the formation and management of offshore captive insurance companies.

Gallagher has ownership interests in two Bermuda-based insurance companies that operate “rent-a-captive” facilities: Artex Insurance Company, a
partially owned joint-venture, and Protected Insurance Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary. Rent-a-captives enable clients to receive the benefits of owning a captive insurance company without certain disadvantages of ownership. Captive insurance
companies are created for clients to insure their risks and capture underwriting profit and investment income, which is then available for use by the insured generally for reducing future costs of their insurance programs.

Arthur J. Gallagher Australasia is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gallagher
that is headquartered in Sydney, Australia. This subsidiary provides reinsurance placements for international or local Australian companies, and specialty programs and coverages for Australian and other clients through underwriting facilities with
Lloyd’s of London underwriters.

Arthur J. Gallagher Asia
is a 51% owned joint-venture of AJG UK that is based in Singapore. It specializes in treaty and facultative reinsurance placements for insurance companies located throughout Asia. These placements are made directly with reinsurance companies or
through Gallagher’s subsidiaries and encompass several lines of business. Gallagher also has brokerage operations in Malaysia that are not material to Gallagher’s Brokerage segment.

The Brokerage segment also has strategic alliances with a variety of
international brokers in countries where Gallagher does not have a physical presence. Through a network of correspondent brokers and consultants in more than 100 countries globally, Gallagher is able to fully serve its clients’ coverage and
service needs in virtually any geographic area where their operations are located.

The Risk Management segment’s international operations principally comprise risk management companies in the United Kingdom and Australia.

Gallagher Bassett International (UK) (GB UK), a wholly-owned subsidiary of GB, provides risk management services for foreign
operations, as well as United States operations that are foreign controlled. Headquartered in London with additional offices in England and Scotland, GB UK works with insurance companies, reinsurance companies, overseas brokers, and risk managers of
overseas organizations. Services include consulting, claims management, information management, loss control and property valuations.

Wyatt Gallagher Bassett is a wholly-owned subsidiary of GB that is headquartered in Brisbane, Australia with additional facilities located throughout
Australia. Wyatt Gallagher Bassett is principally engaged in providing claims adjusting and risk management services in Australia. Services include consulting, claims management, crisis management, information management, loss control and property
valuations.

Gallagher also has risk management service
facilities in Canada that are not material to Gallagher’s Risk Management segment.

See Note 17 and Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of Gallagher’s 2004 Financial Statements, which are incorporated herein by reference for additional financial information related to
Gallagher’s foreign operations, including earnings before income taxes and identifiable assets, by operating segment, for 2004, 2003 and 2002.

Markets and Marketing

A large portion of the commission and fee business of Gallagher is derived from all types of business institutions, not-for-profit organizations,
associations and municipal and other governmental entities. Gallagher’s clients include United States and multi-national corporations engaged in a broad range of commercial and industrial businesses. Gallagher also places insurance for
individuals. Gallagher services its clients through its network of more than 250 sales and service offices in the United States and seven countries abroad. No material part of Gallagher’s business is dependent upon a single customer or on a few
customers. The loss of any one customer would not have a materially adverse effect on Gallagher. In 2004, the largest single customer represented less than 2% of total revenues.



Gallagher believes that its ability to deliver comprehensively structured risk management and brokerage
services, including the placement of insurance and reinsurance, is one of its major strengths. Gallagher also believes that its risk management business enhances and attracts insurance brokerage business due to the nature and strength of business
relationships that it forms with clients when providing a variety of risk management services on an ongoing basis.

Gallagher requires its employees serving in a sales or marketing capacity, including all executive officers of Gallagher, to enter into agreements with
Gallagher restricting disclosure of confidential information and solicitation of clients and prospects of Gallagher upon their termination of employment. The confidentiality and non-solicitation provisions of such agreements terminate in the event
of a hostile change in control of Gallagher, as defined therein.

Competition

According to

Business
Insurance

magazine (July 19, 2004 edition), Gallagher is the fourth largest insurance broker worldwide (third largest in the United States) in terms of total revenues. The insurance brokerage and service business is highly competitive and there
are many insurance brokerage and service organizations as well as individuals on a global basis who actively compete with Gallagher in every area of its business. Three competing firms are significantly larger, two of which have several times the
commission and/or fee revenues of Gallagher. There are firms in a particular region or locality that are as large or larger than the particular local office of Gallagher. Gallagher believes that the primary factors determining its competitive
position with other organizations in its industry are the quality of the services rendered and the overall costs to its clients.

Gallagher is also in competition with certain insurance companies that write insurance directly for their customers. Government benefits relating to
health, disability, and retirement are also alternatives to private insurance and hence indirectly compete with the business of Gallagher. To date, such direct writing and government benefits have had, in the opinion of Gallagher, relatively little
effect on its business and operations, but Gallagher can make no prediction as to their effect in the future.

Regulation

In every
state and foreign jurisdiction in which Gallagher does business, Gallagher or an employee is required to be licensed or receive regulatory approval in order for Gallagher to conduct business. In addition to licensing requirements applicable to
Gallagher, most jurisdictions require that individuals who engage in brokerage and certain insurance service activities be personally licensed.

Gallagher’s insurance brokerage and risk management operations depend on its continued good standing under the licenses and approvals pursuant to
which it operates. Licensing laws and regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In all jurisdictions, the applicable licensing laws and regulations are subject to amendment or interpretation by regulatory authorities. Generally such
authorities are vested with relatively broad and general discretion as to the granting, renewing and revoking of licenses and approvals.

Business Combinations

In 2004, Gallagher acquired the net assets of nineteen insurance brokerage firms (eighteen asset purchases and one stock purchase) in exchange for its
common stock and/or cash and accounted for as business combinations. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of Gallagher’s 2004 Financial Statements, which are incorporated herein by reference for a summary of the 2004
acquisitions, the amount and nature of the consideration paid and the dates of acquisition.

The following acquisitions accounted for as business combinations occurred since December 31, 2004:

Effective on January 1, 2005, Gallagher acquired substantially all of the net assets of Marine Insurance Service, LLC, a corporation engaged in the
insurance brokerage and services business, in exchange for cash of $1.5 million and a contingent earnout obligation of $0.8 million that, if any is earned, will be paid in cash or stock.

Effective on January 1, 2005, Gallagher acquired substantially all of the net assets of Horton Insurance Agency, Inc. of
Oklahoma, a corporation engaged in the insurance brokerage and services business, in exchange for cash of $4.0 million and a contingent earnout obligation of $2.8 million that, if any is earned, will be paid in cash or stock.



Gallagher believes that the net effect of these acquisitions has been and will be to expand the volume of
general services rendered by Gallagher and the geographical areas in which Gallagher renders such services and not to change substantially the nature of the services performed by Gallagher.

Gallagher is considering and intends to consider from time to time,
additional acquisitions and divestitures on terms that it deems advantageous. Gallagher at this time is engaged in preliminary discussions with a number of candidates for possible future acquisitions. No assurances can be given that any additional
acquisitions or divestitures will be consummated, or, if consummated, will be advantageous to Gallagher.

Employees

As of
December 31, 2004, Gallagher employed approximately 8,200 employees, none of whom is represented by a labor union. Gallagher continuously reviews benefits and other matters of interest to its employees and considers its relations with its employees
to be satisfactory.
