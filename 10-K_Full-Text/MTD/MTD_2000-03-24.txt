ITEM 1.       BUSINESS

Overview

         Mettler-Toledo  is a leading global supplier of precision  instruments.
We are the world's largest manufacturer and marketer of weighing instruments for
use in laboratory,  industrial and food retailing applications.  We hold leading
market positions in several related  analytical  instruments,  and are a leading
provider of  automated  chemistry  systems  used in drug and  chemical  compound
discovery and  development.  For  instance,  we hold one of the top three global
market positions in the following  analytical  instruments:  titrators,  thermal
analysis  systems,  automatic lab reactors,  automated  synthesis  products,  pH
meters and electrodes.  In addition, we are the world's largest manufacturer and
marketer of metal  detection  systems used in the  production  and  packaging of
goods  in  industries  such  as  food  processing,  pharmaceutical,   cosmetics,
chemicals and other industries.





         Market leadership and technology  leadership are critical components of
our  success,  and we have used  these  advantages  to build our  business.  For
instance,  using our leading  position in weighing  instruments  as our base, we
have added other products, such as analytical  instruments,  automated chemistry
systems and metal  detectors,  that appeal to our  existing  customer  base.  In
addition, we focus on the high value-added segments of our markets by delivering
innovation to the  marketplace.  Some examples of our  innovations  include more
accurate forms of measurement, an increased use of automation or robotics in our
products and the use of custom-designed software or open-system architectures to
allow data gathered by our  instruments  to be more easily  integrated  into our
customers' management information systems.

         We believe  our ability to  maintain  and  enhance the  strength of our
leadership position in high value-added  segments is due in part to the strength
of our brand name and the quality of our global sales and service  organization.
We  service  a  worldwide  customer  base  through  our own  sales  and  service
organization and we have a global  manufacturing  presence in Europe, the United
States and Asia. Overall, we estimate the global market for weighing instruments
to  be  approximately   $4.5  billion  and  the  market  for  other  measurement
instruments to be approximately $1.5 billion.

         In 1999,  our sales  were  $1.1  billion.  Of this  total 46% came from
Europe,  43% from North and South America and 11% from Asia and other countries.
For additional information regarding our segment disclosure,  see Note 16 to our
audited  consolidated  financial  statements.  We attribute  the strength of our
sales  growth  to the  non-cyclical  nature  of our  two  largest  markets,  the
pharmaceutical  and food and  beverage  industries.  Moreover,  the  diversified
nature  of our  customer  base and  product  offerings  provides  an  additional
competitive strength on a global basis and limits our exposure to local economic
trends.

History

         We  trace  our  roots to the  invention  of the  single-pan  analytical
balance by Dr.  Erhard  Mettler  and the  formation  of Mettler  Instruments  AG
("Mettler")  in  1945.  During  the  1970s  and  1980s,  Mettler  expanded  from
laboratory balances into industrial and food retailing products,  and introduced
the first fully electronic  precision balance in 1973. The Toledo Scale Company,
which we acquired in 1989,  was founded in 1901 and  developed a leading  market
position in the  industrial  weighing  market in the United  States.  During the
1970s,  Toledo Scale expanded into the food retailing  market.  When we acquired
Toledo  Scale,  our name was changed to  Mettler-Toledo  to reflect the combined
strengths of the two companies and to capitalize on their  historic  reputations
for quality and innovation.  During the past two decades,  we have grown through
additional  acquisitions  intended to complement our existing geographic markets
and products.  For instance, in 1986, we acquired the Ingold Group of companies,
which  manufacture  electrodes,  and Garvens  Kontrollwaagen  AG,  which  builds
dynamic checkweighers.  Toledo Scale acquired Hi-Speed Checkweigher Co. in 1981.
In 1990, we acquired Ohaus Corporation,  which manufactures laboratory balances.
More  recently,  in 1997 we  acquired  Safeline,  in  1998  we  acquired  Bohdan
Automation,  Applied Systems and Myriad Synthesizer  Technology,  and in 1999 we
acquired the Testut-Lutrana group.

         Mettler-Toledo International Inc. was incorporated in December 1991 and
was  recapitalized  in connection  with the October 15, 1996  acquisition of the
Mettler-Toledo group of companies from Ciba-Geigy.  In the acquisition,  we paid
cash  consideration of  approximately  SFr 505.0 million  (approximately  $402.0
million at October 15, 1996),  including  dividends of  approximately  SFr 109.4
million (approximately $87.1 million at October 15, 1996), paid




approximately  $185.0  million  to  settle  amounts  due to  Ciba-Geigy  and its
affiliates and incurred  expenses in connection with the acquisition and related
financing of approximately $29.0 million. We financed the acquisition  primarily
with (i) borrowings  under a credit  agreement in the amount of $307.0  million,
(ii) the issuance of $135.0  million of senior  subordinated  notes and (iii) an
equity  contribution  of $190.0 million  primarily from AEA Investors  Inc., its
shareholder-investors and our executive officers and other employees.  Following
the  completion of our initial  public  offering in November  1997,  management,
employees  and Company  sponsored  benefit funds held  approximately  18% of the
Company's shares on a fully diluted basis.

         During the fourth  quarter of 1997,  we  completed  our initial  public
offering  of  7,666,667  shares of common  stock,  including  the  underwriters'
over-allotment  options, at a per share price of $14.00. The offering raised net
proceeds,  after underwriters'  commissions and expenses, of approximately $97.3
million. Concurrently with the offering, we refinanced our prior credit facility
and used  proceeds  from the  refinancing  and the  offering to repay the senior
subordinated notes of our wholly owned subsidiary, Mettler-Toledo, Inc.

         In 1999 and 1998,  certain  selling  shareholders  completed  secondary
offerings of 6,099,250 and 11,464,400 shares of our common stock,  respectively,
including the underwriters'  over-allotment  options.  Neither we nor any of our
directors,  executive  officers or other  employees  sold shares or received any
proceeds from these offerings.

Recent Acquisitions

         In  May  1999,  we  acquired  the   Testut-Lutrana   group,  a  leading
manufacturer  and marketer of  industrial  and retail  weighing  instruments  in
France  with  annual  sales  of  approximately  $50  million.  We  believe  this
acquisition is an excellent strategic fit given Testut-Lutrana's extensive sales
and service network in France and excellent brand recognition. By virtue of this
acquisition,  we have  assumed the leading  position in food retail  weighing in
Europe  and are well  positioned  to meet the  rapidly  changing  demands of our
European customer base.

         In April 1999 we  announced  that we had signed an agreement to convert
our 60% joint venture in Changzhou,  China, into a legal structure that provides
us with full control through this change in ownership,  we will be able to fully
leverage this low cost manufacturing base for international  markets.  This move
further  demonstrates  our  strategic  commitment  to Asia and our belief in the
fundamental growth factors for the region.

         In 1998, we decided to pursue  opportunities  in the automated drug and
chemical compound discovery and development  market, and build on our leadership
position as a provider of automated lab reactors and reaction calorimeters.

         In December 1998, we announced that we had acquired two technologically
advanced   instrument   companies,   Applied  Systems  and  Myriad   Synthesizer
Technology.  Applied  Systems  designs,  assembles and markets  instruments  for
in-process  molecular  analysis,   which  is  primarily  used  for  researching,
developing and  monitoring  chemical  processes.  Applied  Systems'  proprietary
sensors,  together with its innovative  Fourier transform  infrared  technology,
enable  chemists to analyze  chemical  reactions  as they  occur,  which is more
efficient than pulling samples. Myriad Synthesizer Technology designs, assembles
and markets  instruments  that  facilitate  and automate the  synthesis of large
numbers of chemical compounds in parallel, which




is a key  step in the  chemical compound  discovery process. Its products can be
used in all stages of synthesis in drug discovery.

         In July 1998, we also  extended our product  offerings to the automated
drug and  chemical  compound  discovery  market with our  acquisition  of Bohdan
Automation  Inc.  Bohdan is a leading  supplier  of  laboratory  automation  and
automated synthesis products used in research for life science  applications for
pharmaceutical  and agricultural  products and in other applications in the food
and chemicals industries.

         These acquisitions  enable us to offer a strong and comprehensive array
of  solutions,   from  sample  preparation  to  compound  synthesis  to  process
development.  We believe that our customers want solutions in this market from a
company like  Mettler-Toledo,  with a reputation  for innovation and quality and
with a global presence and service network.

         In May 1997,  we  acquired  Safeline  Limited for  (pound)63.7  million
(approximately  $104.4 million at May 30, 1997). Safeline is the world's largest
manufacturer and marketer of metal detection  systems for companies that produce
and package goods in the food processing,  pharmaceutical,  cosmetics, chemicals
and other  industries.  Safeline's metal detectors can also be combined with our
checkweighing  products  for  important  quality  and  safety  checks  in  these
industries.

Market Leadership

         We believe that we have a leading position in each of our markets,  and
at least 80% of our product sales are from products that are the global  leaders
in their segment. In the weighing instruments market, we are the only company to
offer  products  for  laboratory,  industrial  and food  retailing  applications
globally  and we believe that we hold a market share more than twice that of our
nearest  competitor.  We believe  that in 1999 we had  approximately  45% of the
global market for  laboratory  balances,  including the largest  market share in
each of Europe, the United States and Asia (excluding Japan), and the number two
position in Japan. In the industrial and food retailing  markets,  we believe we
have the largest market share in Europe and the United States.  In Asia, we have
a substantial  industrial  and food  retailing  business which has gained market
share  in  recent  years.   This  business  is  supported  by  our   established
manufacturing  presence in China. In addition, we also have one of the top three
positions  in the global  market for several  analytical  instruments  including
titrators, thermal analysis systems, automatic lab reactors, automated synthesis
products, pH meters and electrodes. We attribute our worldwide market leadership
positions to the following competitive strengths:


o         Global  Brand  and  Reputation.   The  Mettler-Toledo  brand  name  is
          identified  worldwide  with  accuracy,   reliability  and  innovation.
          Customers value these characteristics  because precision  instruments,
          particularly weighing and analytical instruments, significantly impact
          customers'  product  quality,   productivity,   costs  and  regulatory
          compliance.  Furthermore, precision instruments generally constitute a
          small percentage of customers' aggregate expenditures. As a result, we
          believe customers focus on accuracy,  product  reliability,  technical
          innovation,  service  quality,  reputation  and past  experience  when
          choosing  precision  instruments.  We also believe that our  customers
          experience  high  switching  costs if they attempt to change  vendors.
          Mettler-Toledo has one of the strongest brand names in the laboratory.
          In fact  laboratory  balances  are often  generically  referred  to as
          "Mettlers".  The  strength  of  this  brand  name  has  allowed  us to
          successfully  extend our  laboratory  product  line to  include  other
          laboratory instruments.



o         Technological  Innovation.  We have a long and successful track record
          of innovation and remain at the forefront of technological development
          by  focusing  on the high  value-added  segments  of our  markets.  We
          believe  that we are the global  leader in our  industry in  providing
          innovative   instruments,   in  integrating   our   instruments   into
          application-specific  solutions for customers and in facilitating  the
          processing  of data  gathered by our  instruments  and the transfer of
          this  data  to  customers'   management   information   systems.   Our
          technological   innovation  efforts  benefit  from  our  manufacturing
          expertise in sensor technology,  precision  machining and electronics,
          as well as our strength in software development.

o         Comprehensive,  High Quality  Product  Range.  We  manufacture  a more
          comprehensive   range  of  weighing   instruments   than  any  of  our
          competitors. Our broad product line addresses a wide range of weighing
          applications   across  and  within  many   industries   and   regions.
          Furthermore,  our analytical  instruments and metal detection  systems
          complement  our  weighing  products,  enabling us to offer  integrated
          solutions.  We manufacture our products in modern facilities,  most of
          which are ISO 9001 certified. Our broad range of high quality products
          and the ability to provide integrated  solutions allows us to leverage
          our sales and service organization, product development activities and
          manufacturing and distribution capabilities.

o         Global  Sales and  Service.  We have the only global sales and service
          organization among weighing instruments manufacturers,  and we believe
          that this capability is a major competitive advantage. At December 31,
          1999,  this  organization  consisted  of  more  than  3,800  employees
          organized  into locally  based,  customer-focused  groups that provide
          prompt  service  and  support to our  customers  and  distributors  in
          virtually all major markets  around the world.  The local focus of our
          sales  and  service   organization   enables  us  to  provide  timely,
          responsive  support to our customers  worldwide and provides  feedback
          for manufacturing and product development.  When we survey our current
          and potential customers on their needs, they often name service as the
          most important  criteria for choosing their instrument  suppliers.  In
          addition to the service  capability,  this global  infrastructure also
          allows us to capitalize on growth opportunities in emerging markets.

o         Largest  Installed Base. We believe that we have the largest installed
          base of weighing  instruments in the world.  From this installed base,
          we obtain service  contracts  that provide a strong,  stable source of
          recurring service revenue.  Service revenue represented  approximately
          17% of net sales in 1999, of which approximately 8% was derived solely
          from service contracts and repairs with the remainder derived from the
          sale of spare parts.  We believe that our  installed  base of weighing
          instruments  represents a competitive advantage with respect to repeat
          purchases and purchases of related  analytical  instruments  and metal
          detection  systems,  because  customers  tend  to  remain  with  their
          existing  suppliers.  In  addition,  switching  to  a  new  instrument
          supplier entails additional costs to the customer for training,  spare
          parts,   service   and   systems   integration   requirements.   Close
          relationships  and frequent  contact with our broad customer base also
          provide us with sales leads and new product and application ideas.


o         Geographical,  Product and Customer Diversification.  Our revenue base
          is diversified by geographic region, product range and customer.  Many
          different  industries,  including  chemicals,   pharmaceuticals,  food
          processing,  food  retailing  and  transportation  utilize  our  broad
          product  range.  We supply  customers  all over the world,  and no one
          customer  accounted for more than 3% of net sales in 1999. Our diverse
          revenue  base  reduces our



          exposure to regional or industry-specific economic conditions, and our
          presence in many different  geographic  markets,  product  markets and
          industries  enhances our attractiveness as a supplier to multinational
          customers.

Growth Strategies

         We are implementing  strategies  relating to expanding our  technology
leadership,  increasing our market share and  capitalizing on  opportunities  in
developed markets,  capitalizing on opportunities in emerging markets,  pursuing
selected  acquisition  opportunities and re-engineering and cost savings.  These
strategies  are  designed to reduce our overall cost  structure  and enhance our
position as a global  market  leader.  The  successful  implementation  of these
strategies has contributed to an improvement in Adjusted Operating Income (gross
profit less research and  development  and selling,  general and  administrative
expenses before  amortization and non-recurring  costs) from $39.5 million (4.6%
of net sales) for 1995 to $123.7  million  (11.6% of net sales) for 1999. We are
committed  to  improving  our   performance   and  are  pursuing  the  following
strategies:

         Expanding Our Technology Leadership. We attribute a significant portion
of our recent margin  improvement to our research and  development  efforts.  We
intend  to  continue  to  invest  in  product  innovation  in order  to  provide
technologically  advanced  products  to  our  customers  for  existing  and  new
applications. Over the last three years, we have invested more than $150 million
in research and development.  Our research and development efforts fall into two
categories:

         o    technology advancements, which increase the value of our products.
              These  may  be  in  the  form  of  enhanced   functionality,   new
              applications  for our  technologies,  more  accurate  or  reliable
              measurement,  additional software capability or automation through
              robotics or other means

         o    cost reductions, which reduce the manufacturing cost of our
              products through better overall design

         Our research and development  efforts have contributed to a pipeline of
innovative and new products, significant reductions in product costs and reduced
time to  market  for new  products.  Examples  of recent  product  introductions
include:

         o    a family of highly automated parallel synthesis systems for drug
              and new chemical compound discovery

         o    ALLex, an automated liquid/liquid extraction system, incorporating
              robotics and unique sample handling technology

         o    additional modules for our high performance modular thermal
              analysis system

         o    WinBridge, our global software solution for vehicle weighing

         o    FormWeigh,   our  global  software  solution  handling   automated
              industrial  batching  processes  (certified  interface  to SAP ERP
              software)

         o    FreeWeigh, our latest generation software package for integrated
              process validation and statistical process control




         o    S-Line, our new open system modular checkweigher family for end-
              of-line inspection in chemical, pharmaceutical, cosmetic and  food
              packaging processes

         o    OPRA, the first internet-enabled retail scale, based on open PC
              architecture and Windows platforms

         o    VIPER, an innovative compact scale family for basic industrial
              process application

         o    CountWeigh, our global software solution linking into integrated
              parts inventory control systems

         o    a fully integrated metal detector and checkweigher (Combichecker)

         o    a new density and refractometry measurement technology

         o    a higher performance Karl Fischer titrator

         o    the first Chinese-designed and manufactured laboratory balance
              line

         o    a cost reduced basic level laboratory balance product family

         o    a number of industrial and retail products that deploy open-system
              architecture

         Increasing  Our  Market  Share and  Capitalizing  on  Opportunities  in
Developed  Markets.  We recognize that to be a successful  company,  we must not
only  develop  excellent  products,  but we  must  market  and  distribute  them
effectively- more  effectively than our competitors.  We utilize what we believe
are the most sophisticated marketing and sales techniques in our industry. These
techniques  include the development and utilization of marketing  databases.  We
develop these databases to better understand the full potential of our market by
customer,  location,  industry,  instrument  and  related  application.  We then
utilize this data to more efficiently  direct our field resources and complement
our direct and distributor  sales forces with targeted mailing and telemarketing
campaigns to more fully exploit our market's  potential.  We also utilize a dual
brand  strategy  for certain  market  segments  to improve  our  overall  market
penetration.  For  example,  we sell  balances  under the Ohaus brand name as an
alternative to the Mettler-Toledo brand name in certain distribution channels.

         We believe that service  capabilities  are a critical success factor in
our business.  Our service capabilities,  which provide support to our customers
and  distributors  in virtually all major  markets  across the globe and include
around-the-clock  availability of well-trained technicians, are highly valued by
our  customers.   We  believe  that  no  other  competitor  has  global  service
capabilities.

         The combination of our sophisticated marketing and sales techniques and
service capabilities help us capitalize on growth opportunities in our developed
markets. These opportunities include:

         o    integrating information from our measurement instruments into our
              customers' data management software systems




         o    automating and/or improving process control, in part by developing
              integrated   solutions  which  combine   instruments  and  related
              technologies to optimize manufacturing processes

         o    harmonization of national weighing standards across countries

         o    increasing   standardization   of  manufacturing   and  laboratory
              practices  programs like ISO 9001, Good  Laboratory  Practices and
              Good Manufacturing Practices

         o    increasing recognition by our customers of the importance of
              preventive maintenance in reducing down time

         Capitalizing  on  Opportunities  in Emerging  Markets.  We believe that
emerging  markets will continue to provide  growth  opportunities  for us in the
long term.  These growth  opportunities  are being driven  primarily by economic
development  and  global  manufacturers'  utilization  of  additional  and  more
sophisticated  precision  instruments as they shift production to these markets.
In addition,  we believe that over the long term, the trend toward international
quality standards,  the need to upgrade mechanical scales to electronic versions
and the establishment of local production facilities by our multinational client
base will add to the  opportunities  in emerging  markets.  To date our emerging
market expansion has primarily  focused on Asia. In Asia (excluding  Japan),  we
are the market leader in laboratory weighing  instruments and have a substantial
industrial  and food  retailing  business that has gained market share in recent
years. For instance, we have two profitable operations in China: a facility that
manufactures  and sells  industrial and food  retailing  products and a facility
that manufactures and distributes laboratory products.  Both of these operations
serve the  domestic and export  markets.  We have also opened  direct  marketing
organizations  in Taiwan,  Korea,  Hong Kong,  Thailand,  Malaysia  and  Eastern
Europe. Recognizing the strategic importance of Asia, we created a new executive
committee  position  to head  our  Asian  business.  Beyond  Asia,  we are  also
expanding  our sales and service  presence in Latin  America and other  emerging
markets.

         We believe  that to  succeed in  emerging  markets,  there are  several
advantages we must offer to our customer base:

         o    to our  multinational  customers,  we must offer the same level of
              service  and  problem-solving  capabilities  that we offer them in
              developed   countries.   We  accomplish  this  through   extensive
              training, including factory training, of our employees

         o    to our local customers,  we must offer lower cost and less complex
              products than are required by our  customers in Japan,  Europe and
              North America.  We accomplish this through the increased  research
              and development and manufacturing  capabilities at our two Chinese
              production facilities

         o    we  must  have  a  direct  local   presence  to  ensure  that  our
              combination   of  quality   products  and  excellent   service  is
              effectively  carried  out at a local  level so that we achieve the
              same level of brand awareness in emerging markets that we enjoy in
              developed   markets.   We  have   accomplished  this  in  part  by
              establishing  ten new sales and  service  operations  in  emerging
              markets since 1996

         Pursuing Selected Acquisition Opportunities. We believe that the
combination of our market leadership, our strong brand name and our
comprehensive sales and distribution network




supports an attractive platform for acquisitions. We are interested in acquiring
companies that provide us with:

         o    complementary  products  that will benefit from our brand name and
              global  distribution  channels.  An example is our drug  discovery
              acquisitions  that we made in 1998 and whose  products we have now
              added to our global distribution network. We offer these companies
              the  infrastructure  to expand  globally and take advantage of the
              Mettler-Toledo brand name

         o    integrated technology solutions, which we can combine with our own
              technologies   to  create  an  overall  better  solution  for  our
              customers.  An example is Safeline  Limited,  which we acquired in
              1997.  We  combined  its  metal   detection   equipment  with  our
              checkweighers to create one instrument,  featuring integrated data
              management,   a  smaller   footprint  and  only  one   man-machine
              interface- a  better  solution  for  many  of our  customers  than
              separate products

         o    consolidation   opportunities  in  fragmented  markets.  Examples
              include our recent  acquisition  of the  Testut-Lutrana  group in
              France and our acquisitions of a number of independent industrial
              and retail weighing distributors in the United States

         o    geographic  expansion  into markets where we do not have a direct
              presence. For example, in 1998 we established a small presence in
              India by acquiring a local manufacturer


         Re-engineering and Cost Savings.  We have improved our profitability in
recent years partly through a series of  initiatives  aimed at reducing our cost
structure.  We plan to take similar  initiatives  in the future with the goal of
further improving our operating margins. These initiatives include:

         o    moving  the  production  of  certain  product  lines to lower cost
              locations and consolidating the production of others. For example,
              in 2000 we are  planning  to  transfer  production  lines from the
              Americas  to China and  Europe  and close  facilities  in order to
              continue to exploit our low cost  Chinese  manufacturing  base and
              better utilize existing capacity in Europe

         o    our worldwide procurement project, launched last year, is expected
              to bring us  substantial  cost savings.  To take full advantage of
              our global  purchasing  power,  we are working to eliminate  price
              differences between units, leverage  high-potential  opportunities
              to  increase  buying  power and  establish  a  worldwide  sourcing
              arrangement

         o    increasing  sales  force   productivity   through   telemarketing,
              increased training and other focused initiatives.  For example, we
              have  recently  initiated  an internet  sales  channel for certain
              product  categories  and have  also  significantly  increased  our
              telemarketing initiatives.  We believe both of these programs will
              increase the productivity of our sales force

         o    reducing distribution costs by using existing  infrastructure more
              efficiently  and  centralizing  processes where economies of scale
              can be obtained. For example, we recently consolidated most of our
              North  American order  processing  and billing  functions into one
              location




         o    reducing product cost through  research and development,  improved
              manufacturing   processes  and  reducing  the  purchased  cost  of
              components. For example, we will introduce a number of products in
              2000 with lower costs than the  previous  generation,  including a
              number manufactured at our Chinese facilities

         o    continually reviewing operations to identify additional
              opportunities to reduce costs

         We believe that these  initiatives will place us in a position to build
on our recent improvement in profitability.  Furthermore, we believe that we can
leverage our existing  infrastructure,  particularly  our recent  investments in
Asia, to obtain  continued  sales growth  without  significant  additions to our
overall cost base.

Drug Discovery

         Virtually all our efforts center on improving customers' processes.  By
working side-by-side with customers,  we gain an in-depth understanding of their
processes and how we can help them become more efficient.

         Increasingly,  the answer is automation. And, frequently, the tools are
Mettler-Toledo's  advanced robotics,  intelligent software, and/or a combination
of  technologies  into  integrated,  more  powerful  instruments.  Our automated
solutions  provide  excellent value and paybacks,  ranging from time savings and
better yields to higher-quality products and tighter inventory control.

         We offer products with advanced automation in areas from food retailing
to  packaged  goods.  Where we are  making  the  greatest  difference  is in the
high-growth  field of drug discovery.  Each day that automation  accelerates the
introduction  of a blockbuster  drug can  translate  into millions of additional
sales for a pharmaceutical  company.  Such tremendous  payback  opportunities on
automation are driving our  pharmaceutical  customers to significantly  increase
their spending on these techniques.

         With a comprehensive  array of automated  solutions for drug discovery,
we can help customers achieve  "leapfrog"  improvements in efficiency.  One such
solution,  our Myriad  synthesizer,  uses  robotics and software to automate the
generation of large  libraries of compounds for screening.  The benefits of this
automation  are  dramatic.  A chemist can  manually  synthesize  about 50 to 200
compounds per year; with Myriad, he or she can synthesize as many as 100,000. By
freeing  scientists from  time-consuming,  routine tasks, our synthesizer allows
them to focus on  intellectually  demanding  elements  of their  work and pursue
other value-creating activities.

         In addition,  we are establishing another unprecedented market position
by combining  our  technologies  to condense the sequence of the drug  discovery
process - further  helping  customers  increase  throughput.  Our  revolutionary
approaches  will  enable  customers  to  simultaneously  carry  out  steps  that
historically have been done sequentially.

         For example,  we are  launching an automatic  lab reactor with multiple
reaction  vessels  combined with an infrared  multi-sensor  device that provides
real-time reaction analysis for each vessel. The combined instrument bridges the
gap between parallel  synthesizers for drug discovery and single-vessel  reactor
systems for process development. The combination also




forms a fully integrated  solution for the process  screening of drug candidates
and creates exceptional customer value.

Instruments and Solutions

Laboratory Instruments and Solutions

         We manufacture and market a complete range of laboratory  balances,  as
well as  other  selected  laboratory  instruments,  such as  titrators,  thermal
analysis  systems,  automatic lab reactors,  automated  synthesis  products,  pH
meters and electrodes,  for laboratory applications in research and development,
quality assurance,  production and education. We estimate that approximately 40%
of our sales are to customers  using our  instruments and services in laboratory
environments.  We estimate  that we have  approximately  45% share of the global
market  for  laboratory  balances  and we are  among  the  top  three  producers
worldwide of  titrators,  thermal  analysis  systems,  automatic  lab  reactors,
automated synthesis products, pH meters and electrodes. We have also established
a leading  position in the drug  discovery  market.  We believe that we have the
leading  market  share for  laboratory  balances  in each of Europe,  the United
States and Asia (excluding Japan) and the number two position in Japan.

         Balances.  The balance is the most  common  piece of  equipment  in the
laboratory.  We believe that we sell the highest performance laboratory balances
available on the market,  with weighing ranges from one  ten-millionth of a gram
up to 32  kilograms.  The  Company's  brand  name  is so  well  recognized  that
laboratory  balances  are  often  generically  referred  to as  "Mettlers."  The
Mettler-Toledo  name is identified  worldwide  with  accuracy,  reliability  and
innovation.  In our judgment,  this reputation  constitutes one of our principal
competitive strengths.

         In order to cover a wide range of customer  needs and price points,  we
market laboratory  balances in three principal product tiers offering  different
levels  of  functionality.  High-end  balances  provide  maximum  automation  of
calibration,  application support and additional  functions.  Mid-level balances
provide a more  limited  but  still  extensive  set of  automated  features  and
software  applications.  Basic level balances  provide  simple  operations and a
limited feature set. We also  manufacture  mass  comparators,  which are used by
weights and measures  regulators as well as  laboratories to ensure the accuracy
of reference weights. Due to the wide range of functions and features offered by
our products,  prices vary significantly.  A typical mid-range precision balance
is priced  at  approximately  $2,500  and a  typical  microbalance  is priced at
approximately $14,000.

         In addition to Mettler-Toledo branded products, we also manufacture and
sell balances  under the brand name  "Ohaus."  Ohaus  branded  products  include
mechanical balances and electronic balances for the educational market and other
markets in which  customers are  interested in lower cost, a more limited set of
features and less comprehensive support and service.

         Titrators.  Titrators measure the chemical  composition of samples. Our
high-end   titrators   are   multi-tasking   models,   which  can   perform  two
determinations  simultaneously.  They permit high  sample  throughputs  and have
extensive  expansion  capability and flexibility in calculations,  functions and
parameters.  Most models,  including  those in the  lower-range,  permit  common
determinations  to be stored in a database for frequent use.  Titrators are used
heavily  in the food and  beverage  industry.  A typical  titrator  is priced at
approximately $12,000.




         Thermal Analysis  Systems.  Thermal analysis systems measure  different
properties,  such as weight, dimension and energy flow, at varying temperatures.
Our  thermal  analysis   products  include  full  computer   integration  and  a
significant  amount of proprietary  software.  Thermal analysis systems are used
primarily in the plastics and polymer  industries.  A typical  thermal  analysis
system is priced at approximately $50,000.

         pH Meters.  A pH meter measures  acidity in a laboratory  sample and is
the second most widely used measurement instrument in the laboratory,  after the
balance. We manufacture  desktop models and portable models.  Desktop models are
microprocessor-based   instruments,  offering  a  wide  range  of  features  and
self-diagnostic functions. Portable models are waterproof, ultrasonically welded
and  ergonomically  designed.  Data  collected  from  a  portable  meter  can be
downloaded to a computer or printer using an interface kit and custom  software.
pH meters are used in a wide range of  industries.  A typical pH meter is priced
at approximately $1,200.

         Automatic  Lab  Reactors  and  Reaction  Calorimeters.   Automatic  lab
reactors and reaction  calorimeters  simulate an entire  chemical  manufacturing
process in the laboratory.  Customers use the simulation test before  proceeding
to production, in order to test the safety and feasibility of new processes. Our
products are fully  computer-integrated,  with a significant  software component
that we also provide.  They also offer wide  flexibility  in the  structuring of
experimental  processes.  Automatic lab reactors and reaction  calorimeters  are
typically  used in the chemicals and  pharmaceutical  industries.  A typical lab
reactor is priced at approximately $140,000.

         Synthesizers. We manufacture automated parallel synthesizers for use in
sophisticated chemistry environments, such as pharmaceutical laboratories. These
synthesizers  allow  scientists to develop new compounds more efficiently and to
create large  libraries  of molecules at the same time instead of creating  them
one  by  one  as  is  done  traditionally.   This  is  an  important  aspect  of
combinatorial chemistry in the drug and chemical compound discovery process. Our
synthesizers  use  robotics  and  sophisticated  software to  automate  what was
previously a manual process. A synthesizer costs between $75,000 and $1,000,000,
depending on its functionality.

         Robotic Workstations.  Robotic workstations include dedicated automated
instruments for weighing,  pH meter measurement,  titration and other analytical
technologies, particularly in the area of sample preparation. Sample preparation
has  historically  been a manual  process for our  customers  and accounts for a
significant cost in chemical analysis. By automating these manual processes, our
robotic workstations  significantly  increase productivity in the laboratory and
specifically  meet our  pharmaceutical,  chemical and other customers' needs for
automated  solutions  for drug and  chemical  compound  discovery.  Our  robotic
workstations include sophisticated software and cost between $20,000 and $75,000
depending on its functionality.

         Other  Instruments.  We have  recently  introduced  single-channel  and
multi-channel  pipettes  which are used for liquid  handling in the  laboratory.
These devices are the most widely used  instruments in the rapidly  growing life
science market.  We sell density and  refractometry  instruments,  which measure
chemical  concentrations  in solutions.  These instruments are sourced through a
marketing joint venture with a third-party manufacturer,  but are sold under the
Mettler-Toledo  brand  name.  In  addition,  we  manufacture  and sell  moisture
analyzers,  which  precisely  determine  the  moisture  content  of a sample  by
utilizing  an  infrared  dryer  to  evaporate  moisture.   We  also  manufacture
electrodes for use in a variety of laboratory  instruments  and in-line  process
applications. Laboratory electrodes are used in pH meters and titrators, and may
be replaced many times during the life of the instrument.




Industrial and Food Retailing Instruments and Solutions

         In 1999, we continued the  globalization  of our  industrial and retail
businesses,  which  historically  were  distinct  entities in North  America and
Europe,  by reorganizing the businesses under a global head. Our  reorganization
anticipates the continued  emergence of a global  marketplace,  as our customers
set up operations worldwide and as industry standards are harmonized globally.

         The new  organization  will  improve  customer  service  and support by
ensuring we offer state-of-the-art  solutions and consistent quality and service
levels  around the globe.  It is this  powerful  combination  that  continues to
attract major  customers who have  standardized  on our weighing  instruments at
their  facilities   worldwide.   Our  reorganization   also  will  increase  our
cost-effectiveness  by eliminating  duplicate  costs and  standardizing  product
lines. By reducing 25 regional  product groups to 15 global lines, we are better
leveraging our R&D and other  recources to develop even more advanced  solutions
for customers.

         We offer industrial measurement solutions,  principally the measurement
of  weight,  to  customers  in a variety  of  industries,  often in the same end
markets where we sell our laboratory instruments.  The key end markets for these
solutions  are the  food,  pharmaceutical,  chemical,  cosmetics  and  logistics
industries.  We also sell weighing instruments and solutions to the electronics,
metal,  rubber and plastics  industries  and to the public  sector in connection
with the control and tariff of trucks.

         Weighing  instruments  are  among  the most  broadly  used  measurement
devices in industry and food retailing.  We estimate that  approximately  40% of
our sales are to customers  using our  instruments  and  services in  industrial
environments  and 20% to customers in food  retailing  environments.  We believe
that we have the  largest  market  share in the  industrial  and food  retailing
market in each of Europe and the United  States.  In Asia, we have a substantial
industrial and food  retailing  business which has gained market share in recent
years.  This business is supported by an established  manufacturing  presence in
China.  We believe  that we are the only  company  with a true  global  presence
across industrial and food retailing weighing applications.

         Our industrial measurement solutions cover many customer processes from
raw  material  management,  to  production,  through to  packaging  and into the
logistics  industry.  We can walk  through  the  steps in a  typical  production
process to illustrate some of the solutions we offer:


         o    For food and  pharmaceutical  companies,  as well as other process
              industries, the production process begins with the receipt of bulk
              materials,  such as  ingredients  for food or chemicals.  We offer
              integrated  solutions to help  customers  manage  these  inventory
              items from the time they  enter a facility  to when they move into
              production.  This is accomplished  through weigh stations with our
              industrial terminals and application-specific software which helps
              manage the inventory  flow at each step. The data collected by our
              instruments is usually interfaced with customers' ERP systems.

         o    Production processes often require the mixing of inventory items
              or ingredients using a formula or recipe. Since these formulas are
              based on weight, we offer





              integrated  weighing  solutions,  including our FormWeigh software
              package to control the formulation process and manage production.

        o     After  the food  item or drug has  been  manufactured,  it must go
              through a packaging  process  where it is sorted and enclosed in a
              container. Two standard quality control processes in virtually all
              packaging lines are tests for over- or under-filling and for metal
              contamination.  We offer instruments for both these  applications.
              In  addition,  we  offer  specialized   industrial  terminals  and
              software for  statistical  quality control which allows a customer
              to run a number of standard  quality control  applications  and to
              send  instructions  to earlier phases in the packaging  process to
              correct off-specification conditions.

        o     Finally,  after the food or drug item has been packaged, it enters
              a logistics  process in which the item  ultimately  reaches an end
              customer.   We  offer  highly  advanced  solutions  for  logistics
              companies  like FedEx and DHL to capture the weight and  dimension
              of  packages as they move  through  their hub  systems.  Logistics
              companies  then use the data  captured in these  systems to manage
              loads and bill their customers.

         We also offer perishable goods management  systems to assist large food
retailers in their management of fresh goods, such as meats, fruits,  vegetables
and cheese.  These perishable goods management  systems are networked  computers
deployed in a store, each with weighing sensors,  which are linked together with
an array of software packages that assist in the management of perishable goods.
We offer these  solutions for  individual  stores or can network  together large
numbers of stores.  Many food  retailers are  considering  the movement of these
solutions  to the  internet,  where  they  can  manage  their  perishable  goods
inventory and control pricing of individual  items in real-time.  Our perishable
goods management systems can also be used as merchandising tools, for example by
showing promotional information on the display.

         The industrial  and food retailing  products that we offer in providing
these solutions are described in more detail below.

         Industrial Scales and Balances.  We offer a complete line of industrial
scales and balances,  such as bench scales and floor scales,  for weighing loads
from a few grams to several  thousand  kilograms  in  applications  ranging from
measuring  materials in chemical  production to weighing mail and packages.  Our
product  lines include the "Viper" and "Spider"  range of scales,  often used in
receiving and shipping departments in counting applications; "TrimWeigh" scales,
which determine  whether an item falls within a specified  weight range, and are
used primarily in the food industry; "Mentor SC" scales, for counting parts; and
precision   scales  for   formulating  and  mixing   ingredients.   Prices  vary
significantly  with the size and functions of the scale,  generally ranging from
$1,000 to $20,000.

         Industrial Weighing Terminals. Our industrial weighing terminals,  such
as  "FormWeigh,"  are  based  on  an  open-system   architecture   that  enables
interaction with customers' enterprise software packages.  Prices for industrial
weighing terminals vary significantly based on functionality of the application,
generally ranging from $500 to $10,000.  Our "MultiRange"  products also include
standardized  software  which uses the weight data  obtained to calculate  other
parameters,  such as price or  number of  pieces.  The  modular  design of these
products  facilitates the integration of our weighing  equipment into a computer
system performing other functions, like inventory control or batch management.




         Truck Scale Systems.  Our primary heavy industrial  products are scales
for  weighing  trucks or  railcars  (i.e.,  weighing  bulk goods as they enter a
factory  or  at a  toll  station).  Our  truck  scales,  such  as  the  "DigiTol
TRUCKMATE,"   generally  have  digital  load  cells,   which  offer  significant
advantages in serviceability over analog load cells. Heavy industrial scales are
capable of measuring  weights up to 500 tons and permit accurate  weighing under
extreme environmental conditions. We also offer advanced computer software, such
as "WinBridge,"  that can be used with our heavy  industrial  scales to permit a
broad range of applications.  Truck scale prices generally range from $20,000 to
$50,000.

         Dynamic Checkweighers. We offer solutions to checkweighing requirements
in the food processing, pharmaceutical, chemicals and cosmetic industries, where
customers are required to accurately  measure  portions for  packaging.  We also
offer  checkweighing  solutions  to  the  transportation  and  package  delivery
industries,  where  tariffs are levied  based on weight.  Customizable  software
applications utilize the information generated by checkweighing hardware to find
production flaws, packaging and labeling errors and nonuniform products, as well
as to sort  rejects and record the  results.  Our  checkweighing  equipment  can
accurately  determine weight in dynamic  applications at speeds of up to several
hundred units per minute. Checkweighers generally range in price from $8,000 to
$40,000.

         Metal Detection Systems. Metal detection systems control the removal of
products that are identified as contaminated  by metal during the  manufacturing
process in the food processing,  pharmaceutical,  cosmetics, chemicals and other
industries.   Metal  detectors   therefore  provide   manufacturers  with  vital
protection  against  metal  contamination  arising  from  their  own  production
processes or from using  contaminated  raw materials.  Metal  detectors are most
commonly used with checkweighers as components of integrated  packaging lines in
the food  processing,  pharmaceutical  and other  industries.  Prices  for metal
detection systems generally range from $5,000 to $20,000.

         Dimensioning  Equipment.  We offer automated dimensioning equipment for
use in the shipping  industry to measure package volumes.  These products employ
the patented  PILAR  technology  and are integrated  with  industrial  scales to
combine volume-based and weight-based tariff calculations. Prices for integrated
dimensioning/weighing systems range from $5,000 to $20,000.

         Retail   Scale   Systems  and   Prepackaging   Systems.   Supermarkets,
hypermarkets and other food retail  establishments make use of multiple weighing
applications for the full handling of perishable goods. For example,  perishable
goods are weighed on arrival to determine payment to suppliers and some of these
goods are repackaged,  priced and labeled for sale to customers. Other goods are
kept  loose and  selected  by  customers  and either  weighed at the  produce or
delicatessen counter or at the checkout counter.

         We offer  stand-alone  scales for basic  counter  weighing and pricing,
price finding, and printing.  In addition, we offer network scales and software,
which can integrate backroom, counter,  self-service and checkout functions, and
can incorporate  weighing data into a  supermarket's  overall  perishable  goods
management system. Backroom products include dynamic weighing products, labeling
and wrapping machines,  perishable goods management and data processing systems.
In some countries in Europe, we also sell slicing and mincing equipment.  Prices
for food retailing  scales  generally  range from $500 to $5,000,  but are often
sold as part of comprehensive weighing solutions.





Customers and Distribution

         Our business is geographically diversified,  with sales in 1999 derived
46% from  Europe,  43% from North and South  America and 11% from Asia and other
countries.  Our customer base is also  diversified by industry and by individual
customer.  Our largest single customer accounted for no more than 3% of 1999 net
sales.

         We use the Mettler-Toledo Web site, www.mt.com,  to provide current and
prospective  customers and other audiences with the  information  they need in a
convenient manner.  With more than 2,500 pages of information,  our Web site has
become  a  principal  source  of  answers  for  customers'   questions  on  many
laboratory,  industrial and food retailing processes.  Customers repeatedly tell
us  how  much  they  value  this  resource,  reinforcing  their  belief  in  our
unparalleled applications support and further strengthening our brand.

         In addition,  we use the information  gained through visits to our site
to make our marketing  messages  even more relevant to customers.  This includes
employing one-to-one marketing techniques, which are already proving successful.

Laboratory

         Principal   customers  for  laboratory   products  include:   chemicals
manufacturers,  pharmaceutical manufacturers,  cosmetics manufacturers, food and
beverage makers,  the metals industry,  the electronics  industry,  the plastics
industry,  the transportation  industry,  the packaging industry,  the logistics
industry,   the  rubber  industry,   the  jewelry  and  precious  metals  trade,
educational  institutions and government standards  laboratories.  Balances,  pH
meters and pipettes are the most widely used laboratory measurement  instruments
and are found in virtually every  laboratory  across a wide range of industries.
Other products have more specialized uses.

         Our  laboratory  products  are sold  through a  worldwide  distribution
network.  Our  extensive  direct  distribution  network  and our dealer  support
activities  enable us to  maintain  a  significant  degree of  control  over the
distribution of our products.

         We now offer customers the ability to shop online for basic instruments
with global appeal, such as balances, pipettes, pH meters, electrodes, titrators
and density meters.  Launched in mid-1999,  www.MT-Shop.com  presents  customers
with unique  options,  including  the ability to  customize a product  down to a
specific  color  or  design  motif.  Users  also  can  access  the  site in five
languages.

         Our virtual shop is aimed  principally at small start-up  companies and
individual  scientists  segments of the market that previously were difficult to
reach  cost-effectively.  The site is expected to increase  brand  awareness and
market penetration with these new target groups.

         In the United  States  where  there are strong  independent  laboratory
distributors,  we use  them  as the  primary  marketing  channel  for  lower  to
mid-price products. This strategy allows us to leverage the strength of both the
Mettler-Toledo brand and the laboratory distributors' market position into sales
of other laboratory measurement instruments.  We provide our distributors with a
significant  amount of technical and sales support.  Mid to high-end products in
the United  States are  handled by our own sales  force.  There has been  recent
consolidation  among  distributors  in the  United  States  market.  While  this
consolidation could adversely affect our




U.S.  distribution,  we believe our leadership position in the market gives us a
competitive advantage when dealing with our U.S. distributors.

         We sell products in Asia through our own sales force and  distributors,
and in Europe primarily  through direct sales.  European and Asian  distributors
are generally fragmented on a country-by-country basis.

         Ohaus  branded   laboratory   balances  are  generally   positioned  in
alternative  distribution channels to those of Mettler-Toledo  branded products.
This  means  that we can fill a greater  number  of  distribution  channels  and
increase penetration of our existing markets.  Since acquiring Ohaus in 1990, we
have  expanded  this brand  beyond its  historical  U.S.  focus.  Ohaus  branded
products are sold exclusively through distributors.

Industrial and Food Retailing

         We  offer   industrial  and  food  retailing   measurement   solutions,
principally the measurement of weight,  to customers in a variety of industries,
often in the same end markets where we sell our laboratory instruments.  The key
end  markets  for  these  solutions  are  the  food,  pharmaceutical,  chemical,
cosmetics  and  logistics  industries.  We also sell  weighing  instruments  and
solutions to the electronics,  metal,  rubber and plastics industries and to the
public sector in connection with the control and tariff of trucks.

         Our  industrial  products share  weighing  technology,  and often minor
modifications  to  existing  products  make them  useful for  applications  in a
variety  of   industrial   processes.   We  also  sell  to  original   equipment
manufacturers  ("OEMs") which integrate our modules into larger process control
applications or  comprehensive  packaging lines. Our products are also purchased
by engineering  firms,  systems  integrators and vertical  application  software
companies.

         Customers for metal  detection  systems are typically food  processing,
pharmaceutical,  cosmetics  and  chemicals  manufacturers  that must ensure that
their products are free from contamination by metal particles.  Undetected metal
contamination  can have  severe  consequences  for  these  companies,  including
potential  litigation  and product  recalls.  Metal  detection  systems are most
commonly  utilized  together  with  checkweighers  as  components  of integrated
packaging lines. Metal detectors provide important safety checks before food and
other products are delivered to customers. Metal detection systems are also used
in pipeline  detectors  for dairy and other  liquids,  gravity  fall systems for
grains and sugar and throat detection systems for raw material monitoring.

         Our   food   retailing   products   customers   include   supermarkets,
hypermarkets and smaller food retailing  establishments.  The North American and
European markets already include many large supermarket  chains, and there is an
on-going shift in most of our food retailing  markets from "mom and pop" grocery
stores to supermarkets  and  hypermarkets.  While  supermarkets and hypermarkets
generally  buy less  equipment  per  customer,  they  tend to buy more  advanced
products that require more electronic and software content. In emerging markets,
however, the highest growth is in basic scales. As with industrial products,  we
also sell food  retailing  products to OEMs for inclusion in more  comprehensive
checkout  systems.  For example,  our OEMs often incorporate our checkout scales
into scanner-scales, which can weigh perishable goods and also read bar codes on
other items. Scanner-scales are in turn integrated with cash registers to form a
comprehensive checkout system.




         In the industrial and food retailing  market,  we sell both directly to
customers  (including  OEMs) and  through  distributors.  In the United  States,
direct sales exceed distribution sales and in Europe,  direct sales predominate,
with  distributors  used in certain  cases.  We sell products in Asia  primarily
through  distributors,  except in China where we sell  products  through our own
sales force and distributors. Where we use distributors, we seek to provide them
with significant support.

Sales and Service

Market Organizations

         We have over 30  geographically  focused market  organizations  ("MOs")
around the world that are  responsible for all aspects of our sales and service.
The MOs are local marketing and service organizations designed to maintain close
relationships  with our customer base.  Each MO has the flexibility to adapt its
marketing  and service  efforts to account for  different  cultural and economic
conditions.  MOs also work closely with our producing  organizations  (described
below)  by  providing   feedback  on  manufacturing   and  product   development
initiatives and relaying innovative product and application ideas.

         We have the only global sales and service  organization  among weighing
instruments  manufacturers.  At December 31, 1999,  our sales and services group
consisted of more than 3,800 employees in sales,  marketing and customer service
(including related administration) and after-sales technical service. This field
organization  has the capability to provide service and support to our customers
and distributors in virtually all major markets across the globe.

         Sales managers and  representatives  interact  across product lines and
markets in order to serve customers that have a wide range of instrument  needs,
such as  pharmaceutical  companies that purchase both  laboratory and industrial
products.  We classify customers  according to their potential for sales and the
appropriate  distribution  channel  is  selected  to  service  the  customer  as
efficiently  as  possible.   Larger   accounts  tend  to  have  dedicated  sales
representatives.   Other  representatives  specialize  by  product  line.  Sales
representatives  call  directly on end-users  either alone or, in regions  where
sales are made through distributors, jointly with distributors.

         We utilize a variety of advertising  media,  including  trade journals,
catalogs,  exhibitions and trade shows. In addition,  we also sponsor  seminars,
product  demonstrations  and customer training  programs.  Our high market share
helps us to gauge  growth  opportunities,  target  our  message  to  appropriate
customer groups and monitor competitive  developments.  We utilize sophisticated
marketing  techniques  in  our  sales  efforts.  These  techniques  include  the
development and utilization of marketing  databases.  We develop these databases
to better  understand  the full  potential of our market by customer,  location,
industry, instruments and related application. We then utilize this data to more
efficiently direct our field resources and complement our direct and distributor
sales forces with  targeted  mailing and  telemarketing  campaigns to more fully
exploit our market's potential.

         We also utilize a dual brand  strategy for certain  market  segments to
improve our overall market penetration. For example, we sell laboratory balances
under the Ohaus brand name as an alternative to the Mettler-Toledo brand name in
certain distribution channels.





After-Sales Service

         We believe service  capabilities  are a critical  success factor in our
business. Through our own dedicated service technicians, we provide contract and
repair  services in all  countries in which our  products are sold.  We estimate
that we have the largest  installed  base of weighing  instruments in the world,
and our contract and repair services  generate  significant  revenues.  In 1999,
service  (representing   service  contracts,   repairs  and  replacement  parts)
accounted  for  approximately  17% of our total net sales  (service  revenue  is
included in the laboratory and industrial and food retailing  sales  percentages
given above). Approximately half of this amount is derived from spare parts with
the  remaining   portion   derived  from  service   contacts.   Beyond   revenue
opportunities,  service  is a  key  part  of  our  product  offering  and  helps
significantly in generating  repeat sales. The close  relationships and frequent
contact with our large  customer base provides us with sales  opportunities  and
innovative  product and  application  ideas. A global service network also is an
important  factor in our ability to expand in emerging  markets.  Moreover,  the
widespread  adoption of quality  laboratory and manufacturing  standards and the
privatization of weights and measures  certification  represent favorable trends
for  our  service  business,  as  they  tend  to  increase  demand  for  on-site
calibration services.

         Our  service  contracts  provide  for repair  services  within  various
guaranteed  response  times,  depending on the level of service  selected.  Many
contracts also include periodic calibration and testing. Contracts are generally
one year in length,  but may be longer.  If the service  contract  also includes
products of other manufacturers, we will generally perform calibration,  testing
and basic repairs  directly,  and contract out more significant  repair work. As
application  software  becomes more complex,  our service  efforts  increasingly
include installation and customer training programs as well as product service.

Research and Development; Manufacturing

Producing Organizations

         Our  product  development,   research  and  manufacturing  efforts  are
organized  into a number of  producing  organizations  ("POs").  At December 31,
1999, POs included  approximately  4,100  employees  worldwide.  POs are product
development  teams  comprised  of  personnel  from our  marketing,  development,
research, manufacturing,  engineering and purchasing departments. POs often seek
customer  input to ensure that the  products  developed  are  tailored to market
needs.  We have organized our POs to reduce product  development  time,  improve
customer focus, reduce costs and maintain technological leadership. The POs work
together to share ideas and best  practices,  and some employees are in both MOs
and POs.  We recently  implemented  a number of  projects  that we believe  will
further increase  productivity and lower costs. For example, we restructured the
order and product delivery process in Europe to enable us to deliver many of our
products  to our  customers  directly  from the  manufacturing  facility  within
several  days,  which  minimizes  the need to store  products  in  decentralized
warehouses.  In addition, we have centralized our European spare parts inventory
management  system  allowing all spare parts for Europe to be  delivered  from a
single, highly automated location.

Research and Product Development

         We attribute a significant  portion of our recent margin improvement to
our research and development efforts. We intend to continue to invest in product
innovation  in  order  to  provide  technologically  advanced  products  to  our
customers for existing and new applications. Over the




last three  years,  we have  invested  more than $150  million in  research  and
development.  In 1999, we spent  approximately 5.8% of net sales on research and
development  (including  costs  associated  with  customer-specific  engineering
projects, which are included in cost of sales for financial reporting purposes).
Our research and development efforts fall into two categories:

         o    technology advancements, which increase the value of our products.
              These  may  be  in  the  form  of  enhanced   functionality,   new
              applications  for our  technologies,  more  accurate  or  reliable
              measurement,  additional software capability or automation through
              robotics or other means

         o    cost reductions, which reduce the manufacturing cost of our
              products through better overall design

         We  have  devoted  an   increasing   proportion  of  our  research  and
development budget to software  development.  Software  development for weighing
applications  includes  application-specific   software,  as  well  as  software
utilized in sensor mechanisms,  displays, and other common components, which can
be leveraged across our broad product lines.

         We  closely   integrate   research  and  development   with  marketing,
manufacturing  and  product  engineering.  We have  over  700  professionals  in
research and  development and product  engineering.  As part of our research and
development  activities,  we have  frequent  contact  with  university  experts,
industry professionals and the governmental agencies responsible for weights and
measures,  analytical instruments and metal detectors. In addition, our in-house
development is complemented by technology and product development alliances with
customers and original equipment manufacturers.

Manufacturing

         We manufacture  some of our own  components,  usually  components  that
contain  proprietary  technology.  However,  when outside  manufacturing is more
efficient,  we contract with others for certain components and in turn use these
components in our own manufacturing  processes. We use a wide range of suppliers
and we believe our supply arrangements to be adequate. From time to time we rely
on a single supplier for all of our requirements of a particular component. Even
then, adequate alternative sources are generally available if necessary.  Supply
arrangements  for  electronics  are  generally  made  globally.  For  mechanical
components, we generally use local sources to optimize materials flow.

         We strive to emphasize product quality in our manufacturing operations,
and  most  of  our   products   require   very  strict   tolerances   and  exact
specifications.  We use an extensive  quality  control system that is integrated
into each step of the  manufacturing  process.  This  integration  permits field
service  technicians to trace important  information  about the manufacture of a
particular unit, which facilitates repair efforts and permits fine-tuning of the
manufacturing  process.  Many of our measuring  instruments  are subjected to an
extensive   calibration  process  that  allows  the  software  in  the  unit  to
automatically adjust for the impact of temperature and humidity.

         We are a worldwide manufacturer,  with nine manufacturing plants in the
United States, four in Switzerland,  two in Germany,  two in the United Kingdom,
one in France  and two in China.  Laboratory  products  are  produced  mainly in
Switzerland  and to a lesser  extent  in the  United  States  and  China,  while
industrial  and food retailing  products are produced in all six  countries.  We
produce our metal detectors in the United Kingdom. We have manufacturing




expertise in sensor technology,  precision machining and electronics, as well as
strength  in  software  development.  Furthermore,  most  of  our  manufacturing
facilities   have  achieved  ISO  9001   certification.   We  believe  that  our
manufacturing   capacity  is  sufficient  to  meet  our  present  and  currently
anticipated needs.

Backlog

         Manufacturing  turnaround time is generally sufficiently short so as to
permit us to manufacture to fill orders for most of our products, which helps to
limit inventory  costs.  Backlog is therefore  generally a function of requested
customer delivery dates and is typically no longer than one to two months.

Employees

         As  of  December  31,  1999,  we  had  approximately   7,900  employees
throughout the world,  including  more than 4,200 in Europe,  more than 2,700 in
North and South America, and approximately 1,000 in Asia and other countries. We
believe our employee  relations are good,  and we have not suffered any material
employee work stoppage or strike during the last five years. Labor unions do not
represent a meaningful number of our employees.

         In certain of our facilities, we have a flexible workforce environment,
in which hours vary depending on the workload. This flexible working environment
enhances employees' involvement,  thus increasing productivity. It also improves
efficient  payroll  management  by  permitting  us to adjust  staffing  to match
workload to a greater degree without changing the size of the overall workforce.

Intellectual Property

         We hold more than 1,100 patents and trademarks, primarily in the United
States,  Switzerland,  Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Japan and China. Our
products generally incorporate a wide variety of technological innovations, many
of which are protected by patents and many of which are not. Moreover,  products
are generally not protected as a whole by individual  patents.  Accordingly,  no
one patent or group of related patents is material to our business. We also have
numerous  trademarks,  including  the  Mettler-Toledo  name and logo  which  are
material to our  business.  We regularly  protect  against  infringement  of our
intellectual property.

Regulation

         Our products are subject to various regulatory  standards and approvals
by weights  and  measures  regulatory  authorities.  Although  there are a large
number of regulatory  agencies across our markets,  there is an increasing trend
toward  harmonization  of  standards,  and weights and  measures  regulation  is
harmonized  across the European  Union.  Our food  processing and food retailing
products  are subject to  regulation  and  approvals  by  relevant  governmental
agencies, such as the United States Food and Drug Administration.  Products used
in hazardous  environments may also be subject to special  requirements.  All of
our electrical components are subject to electrical safety standards. We believe
that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable regulations.




Environmental Matters

         We are subject to a variety of  environmental  laws and  regulations in
the  jurisdictions  in which we operate,  including  provisions  relating to air
emissions,  wastewater  discharges,  the  handling  and  disposal  of solid  and
hazardous  wastes and the remediation of  contamination  associated with the use
and disposal of hazardous  substances.  We wholly or partly own, lease or hold a
direct or indirect equity  interest in a number of properties and  manufacturing
facilities  around  the  world,  including  North  and  South  America,  Europe,
Australia and China.  Like many of our competitors,  we have incurred,  and will
continue  to incur,  capital  and  operating  expenditures  and  other  costs in
complying with such laws and regulations in both the United States and abroad.

         We are currently involved in, or have potential  liability with respect
to, the remediation of past  contamination  in certain of our facilities in both
the United  States and abroad.  In  addition,  certain of our present and former
facilities  have or had been in operation  for many decades and, over such time,
some of these  facilities may have used  substances or generated and disposed of
wastes which are or may be considered hazardous. It is possible that such sites,
as well as disposal  sites owned by third  parties to which we have sent wastes,
may in  the  future  be  identified  and  become  the  subject  of  remediation.
Accordingly,  although we believe  that we are in  substantial  compliance  with
applicable environmental  requirements and to date we have not incurred material
expenditures in connection with  environmental  matters,  it is possible that we
could become subject to additional environmental  liabilities in the future that
could result in a material adverse effect on our financial  condition or results
of operations.

         Our  operating  facility  in  Landing,  New Jersey is the subject of an
investigation and clean-up of hazardous substance  contamination pursuant to the
New Jersey  Industrial  Site Recovering Act. On or about July 1988, an affiliate
of  Ciba  ("AGP")   purchased  100%  of  the  outstanding  stock  of  Metramatic
Corporation ("Metramatic"), a manufacturer of checkweighing equipment located in
Landing, from GEI International Corporation ("GEI"). GEI agreed to indemnify and
hold harmless AGP for certain pre-closing  environmental  conditions,  including
those  resulting  in  cleanup  responsibilities   required  by  the  New  Jersey
Department of Environmental  Protection pursuant to the New Jersey Environmental
Cleanup  Responsibility  Act ("ECRA").  ECRA is now the Industrial Site Recovery
Act.  Pursuant  to a 1988 New  Jersey  Department  of  Environmental  Protection
administrative  consent order naming GEI and Metramatic as respondents,  GEI has
spent  approximately $2 million in the performance of certain  investigatory and
remedial  work  addressing  groundwater  contamination  at  the  site.  However,
implementation  of a final remedy has not yet been  completed,  and,  therefore,
future remedial costs are currently  unknown.  In 1992, GEI filed a suit against
various parties  including  Hi-Speed  Checkweigher Co., Inc.  ("Hi-Speed"),  our
wholly owned  subsidiary  that currently owns the facility,  to recover  certain
costs incurred by GEI in connection with the site. Pursuant to a 2000 settlement
agreement, GEI agreed to dismiss the litigation and covenanted not to sue us for
investigation,  remediation and monitoring  costs and natural  resource  damages
associated with  contamination  at the facility in exchange for our agreement to
assign to GEI  certain  potential  insurance  recovery  rights  relating  to the
facility.  Based on currently available information and our settlement agreement
with GEI, we believe that costs  associated  with the future  investigation  and
remediation  of this  site  will  not  have a  material  adverse  effect  on our
financial condition or results of operations.

         We, or in some cases the former owner of Toledo Scale,  have been named
a potentially  responsible party under CERCLA or analogous state statutes at the
following  third-party  owned sites with respect to the alleged  disposal at the
sites by Toledo Scale during the period before we




owned it: Granville Solvents Site,  Granville,  Ohio;  Aqua-Tech  Environmental,
Inc. Site, Greer, South Carolina; and Seaboard Chemical Company Site, Jamestown,
North Carolina. Pursuant to the terms of the stock purchase agreement between us
and the former owner of Toledo Scale, the former owner is obligated to indemnify
us for various environmental  liabilities.  To date, with respect to each of the
foregoing sites, the former owner has undertaken the defense and indemnification
of  Toledo  Scale.  Based on  currently  available  information  and  given  our
contractual rights of indemnification, we believe that the costs associated with
the  investigation  and  remediation  of these  sites  will not have a  material
adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

Competition

         Our markets are highly competitive.  Furthermore,  weighing instruments
markets are fragmented both geographically and by application,  particularly the
industrial and food retailing weighing  instruments market. As a result, we face
numerous regional or specialized competitors, many of which are well established
in their markets.  In addition,  some of our competitors are divisions of larger
companies with potentially  greater  financial and other resources than our own.
Taken  together,  the  competitive  forces present in our markets can impair our
operating margins in certain product lines and geographic markets.

         We expect  our  competitors  to  continue  to  improve  the  design and
performance  of their  products and to introduce new products  with  competitive
prices.  Although  we  believe  that we have  certain  technological  and  other
advantages  over our  competitors,  we may not be able to realize  and  maintain
these  advantages.  In any event,  to remain  competitive,  we must  continue to
invest in research and development, sales and marketing and customer service and
support. We cannot be sure that we will have sufficient resources to continue to
make these investments or that we will be successful in identifying,  developing
and maintaining any competitive advantages.

         We believe that the principal  competitive  factors in our U.S. markets
for purchasing  decisions are accuracy and durability,  while in Europe accuracy
and service are the most important factors. In emerging markets,  where there is
greater demand for less sophisticated products, price is a more important factor
than in developed markets. Competition in the United States laboratory market is
also  influenced  by the presence of large  distributors  that sell not only our
products but those of our competitors as well.




ITEM 2.       PROPERTIES

         The  following   table  lists  our  principal   operating   facilities,
indicating  the  location,  primary  use and  whether  the  facility is owned or
leased.



(1)      We also conduct  research and development  activities at certain of the
         listed facilities in Switzerland,  Germany, France, the United Kingdom,
         the United States and China.


         We believe our  facilities  are adequate for our current and reasonably
anticipated future needs.





ITEM 3.       LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

         Routine litigation is incidental to our business.  Nevertheless, we are
not  currently  involved in any legal  proceeding  which we believe could have a
material  adverse effect upon our financial  condition or results of operations.
See  "Environmental  Matters"  under Part I, Item 1 for  information  concerning
legal proceedings relating to certain environmental claims.

         Our products generally are sold with a limited warranty for defects. We
have  reviewed our  products  currently in use by customers or being sold and do
not believe that we will have material increase in warranty or product liability
claims arising out of Year 2000  non-compliance.  However, any material increase
in these claims could harm our results of operations.


ITEM 4.       SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

         None.

agreement  restricts our ability to pay dividends.  Any future  determination to
pay dividends  will depend on our results of  operations,  financial  condition,
capital requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant
by our Board of Directors.





ITEM 6.       SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

         The  selected  historical  financial  information  set  forth  below at
December 31, 1999,  1998,  1997, 1996 and 1995, for the years ended December 31,
1999,  1998 and 1997, for the period from October 15, 1996 to December 31, 1996,
for the period  from  January 1, 1996 to October 14, 1996 and for the year ended
December 31, 1995 is derived from our  consolidated  financial  statements.  The
financial information for all periods prior to October 15, 1996, the date of our
acquisition  from  Ciba-Geigy  (the   "Acquisition"),   is  combined   financial
information  of  the   Mettler-Toledo   group  of  companies  (the  "Predecessor
Business").  The combined  historical data of the  Predecessor  Business and the
consolidated  historical data of the Company are not comparable in many respects
due  to  the  Acquisition  and  the  Safeline  acquisition.   See  "Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial  Condition and Results of  Operations"  and
our  consolidated  financial  statements and  accompanying  notes. The financial
information presented below, in thousands except per share data, was prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of
America ("U.S. GAAP").

ITEM 7.       MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
              RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

         The following  discussion  and analysis of our financial  condition and
results  of  operations   should  be  read  in  conjunction   with  our  audited
consolidated financial statements.

Overview

         We operate a global  business,  with net sales that are  diversified by
geographic region, product range and customer. We hold leading positions in many
of our markets and attribute this leadership to several  factors,  including the
strength of our brand name, the quality of our global sales and service network,
our  continued  investment  in product  development,  our pursuit of  technology
leadership  and our focus on  capitalizing  on  opportunities  in developed  and
emerging markets.

         Our financial  information  is presented in accordance  with  generally
accepted  accounting  principles in the United States of America ("U.S.  GAAP").
Financial results following our initial public offering in November 1997 and the
Safeline  acquisition  in May 1997 are not  comparable  in many  respects to the
financial results prior to those events.

         In 1999, we attained two important financial milestones.  Our net sales
exceeded $1 billion and our total debt was reduced below $300  million,  despite
spending approximately $175 million on acquisitions in the last three years.

         Net sales in local  currency  increased 16% in 1999, 8% in 1998 and 11%
in  1997.  The  strengthening  of the  U.S.  dollar  versus  our  major  trading
currencies reduced U.S. dollar - reported sales  growth in each year. Net sales
in U.S. dollars increased 14% in 1999, 7% in 1998 and 3% in 1997.

         In 1999, we had solid local currency sales growth of 19% in Europe, 15%
in the Americas and 11% in Asia and other  markets.  We believe our sales growth
over the next several  years will come  primarily  from (i) the needs of our lab
and  industrial  customers  in developed  markets to continue to automate  their
research and  development  and  manufacturing  processes,  (ii) the needs of our
retail customers in Europe to upgrade their scales for the implementation of the
euro,  (iii)  the  needs of our  retail  customers  to  implement  sophisticated
perishable  goods  management  systems  using  weighing and PC  technology  in a
networked  environment,  (iv) the needs of  customers  in  emerging  markets  to
continue  modernizing  research  and  development  and  manufacturing  processes
through the use of  increasingly  sophisticated  instruments and (v) acquisition
opportunities.

         We increased our gross profit margin before  non-recurring  acquisition
costs from 44.1% in 1997 to 45.2% in 1999 and increased  our Adjusted  Operating
Income  (gross  profit less research and  development  and selling,  general and
administrative  expenses  before  amortization  and  non-recurring  costs)  as a
percentage of net sales from 9.3% in 1997 to 11.6% in 1999.

         This improved  performance was achieved while we continued to invest in
product development and in our distribution and manufacturing infrastructure. We
believe that a significant  portion of the  increases in our Adjusted  Operating
Income  resulted from our strategy to reduce costs,  re-engineer  our operations
and  focus  on the  highest  value-added  segments  of the  markets  in which we
compete.




Recent Acquisitions

         In May 1999, we completed the acquisition of the Testut-Lutrana  group,
a  leading   manufacturer   and  marketer  of  industrial  and  retail  weighing
instruments  in France,  with annual  sales of  approximately  $50  million.  We
believe this  acquisition is an excellent  strategic fit given  Testut-Lutrana's
extensive sales and service  network in France and excellent brand  recognition.
By virtue of this  acquisition,  we have  assumed the  leading  position in food
retail weighing in Europe and are well  positioned to meet the rapidly  changing
demands of our European customer base.

         In April 1999, we announced  that we had signed an agreement to convert
our 60% joint venture in Changzhou,  China, into a legal structure that provides
us with full control. Through this change in ownership, we will be able to fully
leverage this low-cost  manufacturing base for international  markets. This move
further  demonstrates  our  strategic  commitment  to Asia and our belief in the
fundamental growth factors for the region.

         In 1998, we decided to pursue  opportunities  in the automated drug and
chemical compound discovery and development  market, and build on our leadership
position as a provider of automated lab reactors and reaction calorimeters.

         In December 1998, we announced that we had acquired two technologically
advanced   instrument   companies,   Applied  Systems  and  Myriad   Synthesizer
Technology.  Applied  Systems  designs,  assembles and markets  instruments  for
in-process  molecular  analysis,   which  is  primarily  used  for  researching,
developing and  monitoring  chemical  processes.  Applied  Systems'  proprietary
sensors,  together with its innovative  Fourier transform  infrared  technology,
enable  chemists to analyze  chemical  reactions  as they  occur,  which is more
efficient than pulling samples. Myriad Synthesizer Technology designs, assembles
and markets  instruments  that  facilitate  and automate the  synthesis of large
numbers of chemical  compounds in parallel,  which is a key step in the chemical
compound discovery process.  Its products can be used in all stages of synthesis
in drug discovery.

         In July 1998, we also  extended our product  offerings to the automated
drug and  chemical  compound  discovery  market with our  acquisition  of Bohdan
Automation  Inc.  Bohdan is a leading  supplier  of  laboratory  automation  and
automated synthesis products used in research for life science  applications for
pharmaceutical  and agricultural  products and in other applications in the food
and chemicals industries.

         These acquisitions  enable us to offer a strong and comprehensive array
of  solutions,   from  sample  preparation  to  compound  synthesis  to  process
development.  We believe that our customers want solutions in this market from a
company like  Mettler-Toledo,  with a reputation  for innovation and quality and
with a global presence and service network.

Secondary Offerings and IPO

         In 1999 and 1998,  certain  selling  shareholders  completed  secondary
offerings totalling 6,099,250 and 11,464,400 shares, respectively, of our common
stock,  including  the  underwriters'   over-allotment  options.  No  directors,
executive officers or other employees sold shares, and we did not sell shares or
receive proceeds in the offerings.  We incurred charges of $0.8 million and $0.7
million in connection with the offerings during 1999 and 1998, respectively.




         During the fourth  quarter of 1997,  we  completed  our initial  public
offering of 7,666,667 shares of common stock at a per share price of $14.00. The
offering raised net proceeds,  after underwriters'  commission and expenses,  of
approximately $97.3 million.  Concurrently with the offering,  we refinanced our
existing credit facility by entering into a new credit facility, borrowings from
which,  along  with  the  proceeds  from  the  offering,   were  used  to  repay
substantially all of our then-existing debt,  including all of our 9 3/4% senior
subordinated notes due 2006. In connection with this refinancing, we recorded an
extraordinary  charge of $31.6 million,  net of tax,  principally for prepayment
premiums on certain  debt  repaid and for the  write-off  of  existing  deferred
financing  fees.  We also paid a  one-time  termination  fee of $2.5  million in
connection  with the termination of our management  services  agreement with AEA
Investors Inc.

Cost Reduction Programs

         As part of our efforts to reduce  costs,  we evaluate from time to time
the cost effectiveness of our global manufacturing  strategy.  Over the next few
years,  we intend to  continue  to  develop  China as a  low-cost  manufacturing
resource  and to seek other  manufacturing  cost-saving  opportunities.  In this
respect,  we  recorded  a charge of $8.0  million  in 1999  associated  with the
transfer  of  production  lines  from the  Americas  to China and Europe and the
closure  of  facilities.  We  believe  that the future  cash  benefits  of these
programs will exceed the costs, although the cash outflows will precede the cash
flow  benefits.  The charge  relates  primarily to severance  and other  related
benefits and costs of exiting facilities,  including lease termination costs and
the write-down of impaired assets.

         An  initiative  that we  launched  in 1999 is a  worldwide  procurement
project.  The project is intended to eliminate price differences  between units,
leverage potential opportunities to increase buying power, and work to establish
worldwide sourcing arrangements.  We envision it will take at least two years to
obtain  benefits from this  project.  It is too early to determine the potential
cost savings.

         During  1999,  we also  exited  our glass  batching  business  based in
Belgium.  In this  respect,  we  incurred  losses of $4.1  million  during  1999
primarily for severance and other costs of exiting this  business.  We completed
our exit of the glass batching business by the end of 1999.





Results of Operations

         The  following  table sets forth  certain  items from our  consolidated
statements of operations for the years ended  December 31, 1999,  1998 and 1997.
The consolidated statement of operations data, in thousands,  for the year ended
December 31, 1997 includes Safeline results from May 31, 1997.



(a)  In connection with acquisitions in 1999,  including the acquisition  of the
     Testut-Lutrana  group,  we allocated $998 of the purchase price to  revalue
     certain inventories  (principally  work-in-progress and finished  goods) to
     fair value (net realizable value). Substantially all such inventories  were
     sold during the second quarter of 1999.
(b)  In  connection  with the  Bohdan  acquisition,  we  allocated,   based upon
     independent valuations, $9,976 of the purchase price to purchased  research
     and  development  in  process.  This  amount  was  recorded  as  an expense
     immediately following the Bohdan acquisition.
(c)  In connection with the Safeline  acquisition,  we allocated   $2,054 of the
     purchase    price   to   revalue    certain    inventories     (principally
     work-in-progress and finished goods) to fair value (net  realizable value).
     Substantially  all  such  inventories  revalued  in   connection  with  the
     Safeline acquisition were sold in the second quarter of 1997.
(d)  In connection  with the Safeline  acquisition,  we   allocated,  based upon
     independent  valuations,  $29,959  of  the  purchase  price  to   purchased
     research  and  development  in  process.  This  amount was   recorded as an
     expense immediately following the Safeline acquisition.
(e)  Other charges,  net generally  includes  interest income,  foreign currency
     transactions,  (gains) losses from sales of assets and other items. For the
     years ended  December 31, 1999 and 1998, the amount shown includes $825 and
     $650,  respectively,  of  expenses  incurred  on behalf of certain  selling
     shareholders  in connection with the secondary  offerings.  The 1999 amount
     also includes a gain on an asset sale of approximately  $3,100, a charge of
     $8,007 to transfer  production  lines from the Americas to China and Europe
     and the  closure  of  facilities  and  losses  of  approximately  $4,100 in
     connection with the exit from our glass batching business based in Belgium.
     For the year ended December 31, 1997, the amount shown includes a charge of
     $6,300 to consolidate three facilities in North America.
(f)  Adjusted Operating Income is defined as operating income (gross profit less
     research and development and selling,  general and administrative expenses)
     before amortization and non-recurring costs. Non-recurring costs which have
     been  excluded  are the  costs  set  forth  in  Notes  (a)  and (c)  above.
     Non-recurring  costs for the year ended  December  31, 1997 also  include a
     charge of $2,500  in  connection  with the  termination  of our  management
     services  agreement  with AEA  Investors  Inc.  We  believe  that  Adjusted
     Operating Income provides important financial  information in measuring and
     comparing  our  operating  performance.  Adjusted  Operating  Income is not
     intended to represent  operating  income under U.S.  GAAP and should not be
     considered as an alternative to net earnings  (loss) as an indicator of our
     operating performance.





Year Ended December 31, 1999 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 1998

         Net sales were $1,065.5  million for the year ended  December 31, 1999,
compared to $935.7 million in the prior year.  This reflected an increase of 16%
in local currencies  during 1999.  Results for 1999 were negatively  impacted by
the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies. Net sales in U.S.
dollars during 1999 increased 14%.

         Net sales by geographic customer location were as follows: Net sales in
Europe increased 19% in local currencies during 1999, versus the prior year. The
increase  largely  reflected  the effect of  Testut-Lutrana,  as well as organic
growth  in our  business.  Net  sales in  local  currencies  during  1999 in the
Americas  increased 15%  principally  due to organic growth in our business,  as
well as the effect of businesses  acquired.  Net sales in Asia and other markets
increased 11% in local  currencies  during 1999.  The results of our business in
Asia and other  markets  during 1999  primarily  represented  improved  economic
conditions throughout the region, which began in the fourth quarter of 1998.

         The operating  results for  Testut-Lutrana  (which were included in our
results from May 1, 1999) would have had the effect of increasing  our net sales
by an additional $38.8 million in 1998, if included from May 1, 1998.

         Gross profit as a percentage of net sales  increased to 45.2% for 1999,
compared to 44.4% for 1998, before non-recurring acquisition costs.

         Research  and  development  expenses  as  a  percentage  of  net  sales
increased  to 5.4% for 1999,  compared to 5.2% for the prior year.  The increase
primarily  reflected  increased  research and  development  activity  related to
product introductions, as well as the effect of acquired businesses.

         Selling,  general and  administrative  expenses as a percentage  of net
sales decreased to 28.2% for 1999, compared to 28.4% for the prior year.

         Adjusted  Operating Income increased 22.5% to $123.7 million,  or 11.6%
of sales, for 1999, compared to $101.0 million, or 10.8% of sales, for the prior
year. The 1999 period excludes the previously  noted  non-recurring  acquisition
charge of $1.0 million for the  revaluation of  inventories  to fair value.  The
increased operating margin reflected the benefits of higher sales levels and our
continuous efforts to improve productivity.

         Interest expense decreased to $22.0 million for 1999, compared to $22.6
million for the prior year.  The  decrease was  principally  due to reduced debt
levels.

         Other  charges,  net were $10.5  million  for 1999,  compared  to other
charges,  net of $1.2  million  for the prior  year.  The 1999 and 1998  amounts
included  charges of $0.8  million and $0.7  million  relating to the  secondary
offerings  completed  in 1999  and  1998,  respectively.  The 1999  amount  also
included  a gain on an  asset  sale of $3.1  million,  charges  of $8.0  million
regarding the transfer of production lines from the Americas to China and Europe
and the  closure  of  facilities  and  losses of $4.1  million to exit our glass
batching business based in Belgium. The 1998 amount also included gains on asset
sales offset by other charges.

         Our tax rate in 1999 before non-recurring items was consistent with the
prior year,  excluding a benefit of  approximately  5 percentage  points or $3.6
million based upon a one-time  change in Swiss tax law which  benefited only the
1998 period. The 1998 period also included




non-deductible purchased research and development charges incurred in connection
with the Bohdan acquisition.

         Net earnings before expenses for the secondary  offerings,  acquisition
charges  and the $8.0  million  charge to  transfer  production  lines  from the
Americas to China and Europe and the closure of facilities were $57.9 million in
1999,  compared to $48.3 million in 1998.  This represents an increase of almost
30%, excluding the one-time tax benefit of $3.6 million received in 1998.

Year Ended December 31, 1998 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 1997

         Net sales were $935.7  million for the year ended  December  31,  1998,
compared to $878.4  million in the prior year.  This reflected an increase of 8%
in local  currency  (6%  including  Safeline  for full year 1997)  during  1998.
Results  for 1998 were  negatively  impacted  by the  strengthening  of the U.S.
dollar against other currencies. Net sales in U.S. dollars during 1998 increased
7%.

         Net sales in Europe  increased  10% in local  currencies  during  1998,
versus the prior year.  We  experienced  favorable  sales trends  during 1998 in
Europe, which began in the second half of 1997, as a result of the strengthening
of the  European  economy.  Net  sales in local  currencies  during  1998 in the
Americas  also  increased  10% due to  improved  market  conditions  across most
product lines,  offset in part by weakness in Latin America.  Net sales in local
currencies in 1998 in Asia and other markets  decreased 4%. The sales decline in
Asia during 1998 results in part from a decline in net sales in  Southeast  Asia
and Korea.  In addition,  during the second half of 1998 we also  experienced  a
decline in net sales in Japan. Our sales and operating results in Asia and other
emerging markets deteriorated due to poor economic conditions.  These results in
U.S. dollar terms were also affected by severe currency devaluations. We believe
that our sales  growth on a U.S.  dollar  basis was reduced by 1 to 2 percentage
points  during  1998  as  a  result  of  these  poor  economic   conditions  and
devaluations.

         The operating  results for Safeline (which were included in our results
from May 31, 1997) would have had the effect of  increasing  our net sales by an
additional   $19.0   million  in  1997,   if  included  from  January  1,  1997.
Additionally,  Safeline's  operating  results  during the same period would have
increased  our  Adjusted  Operating  Income  (gross  profit  less  research  and
development and selling, general and administrative expenses before amortization
and non-recurring costs) by $4.4 million.

         Gross profit as a percentage of net sales  increased to 44.4% for 1998,
compared to 44.1% for 1997,  before  non-recurring  acquisition  costs. The 1997
period  excludes a $2.1 million  non-cash  charge  associated with the excess of
fair  value  over  historical  cost for  inventories  acquired  in the  Safeline
acquisition.

         Research  and  development  expenses  as  a  percentage  of  net  sales
decreased to 5.2% for 1998,  compared to 5.4% for the prior year.  However,  the
local currency spending level remained relatively constant for the year.

         In July 1998, we acquired Bohdan Automation Inc., a leading supplier of
laboratory  automation and automated synthesis products. We incurred a charge of
$10.0 million  immediately  following the acquisition  based upon an independent
valuation  for  purchased  research and  development  costs for  products  being
developed that had not established




technological feasibility as of the date of the acquisition and, if unsuccessful
had no alternative future use.

         Selling,  general and  administrative  expenses as a percentage  of net
sales  decreased to 28.4% for 1998,  compared to 29.6% for the prior year.  This
decrease primarily reflected the benefits of ongoing cost-efficiency programs.

         Adjusted  Operating  Income was $101.0 million,  or 10.8% of sales, for
1998,  compared  to $81.5  million,  or 9.3% of sales,  for the prior  year,  an
increase of 23.8%.  The 1997 period excludes the previously noted charge of $2.1
million for the  revaluation of inventories to fair value in connection with the
Safeline  acquisition and $2.5 million in connection with the termination of our
management services agreement with AEA Investors Inc. at the time of our initial
public offering.

         Interest expense decreased to $22.6 million for 1998, compared to $35.9
million  for the prior  year.  The  decrease  was  principally  due to  benefits
received from our initial public  offering,  the  refinancing  completed at that
time and cash flow provided by operations.

         Other  charges,  net were  $1.2  million  for 1998,  compared  to other
charges,  net of $10.8  million for the prior year.  The 1998 amount  includes a
one-time charge of $0.7 million relating to the secondary  offering completed in
July 1998.  The 1998 amount also  includes  gains on asset sales offset by other
charges. The 1997 period includes  restructuring related charges of $6.3 million
and other  charges of $3.5  million  ($2.9  million  after tax)  relating to (i)
certain derivative financial instruments acquired in 1996 and closed in 1997 and
(ii) foreign currency  exchange losses resulting from certain unhedged bank debt
denominated in foreign  currencies.  Such derivative  financial  instruments and
such unhedged bank debt are no longer held pursuant to current Company policy.

         The tax rate for 1998 included a benefit of  approximately 5 percentage
points based upon a one-time  change in Swiss tax law which  benefited  only the
1998  period.  The 1998  period  also  reflects  efficiencies  in our global tax
structure, offset by the non-deductibility of purchased research and development
charges incurred in connection with the Bohdan acquisition.

         The extraordinary  loss of $41.2 million in 1997 represents charges for
the early repayment premium on our senior  subordinated  notes and the write-off
of  capitalized  debt issuance  fees and related  expenses  associated  with our
senior subordinated notes and previous credit facilities.

         Net  earnings   excluding  the  expenses  for  purchased  research  and
development and the secondary offering were $48.3 million in 1998, compared with
net  earnings  before  non-recurring  items  of  $19.1  million  in  1997.  Such
non-recurring  items  in 1997  include  the  previously  mentioned  charges  for
purchased  research and  development,  the  revaluation  of  inventories to fair
value,  the termination fee paid to AEA Investors Inc.,  restructuring  charges,
losses  relating to  derivative  financial  instruments  and unhedged  bank debt
denominated  in foreign  currencies,  and  extraordinary  items  related to debt
extinguishments.








Liquidity and Capital Resources

         At December 31, 1999,  our  consolidated  debt, net of cash, was $279.4
million.  We had  borrowings of $280.4  million  under our credit  agreement and
$16.2 million under various other  arrangements  as of December 31, 1999. Of our
credit agreement  borrowings,  approximately $153.1 million was borrowed as term
loans  scheduled  to mature in 2004 and  $127.3  million  was  borrowed  under a
multi-currency  revolving credit  facility.  At December 31, 1999, we had $277.0
million of availability remaining under the revolving credit facility.

         At December 31, 1999,  approximately  $96.5  million of the  borrowings
under the credit agreement and local working capital facilities were denominated
in U.S.  dollars.  The balance of the borrowings  under the credit agreement and
local  working  capital  facilities  were  denominated  in  certain of our other
principal  trading  currencies  amounting  to  approximately  $200.1  million at
December 31, 1999.  Changes in exchange rates between the currencies in which we
generate cash flow and the currencies in which our  borrowings  are  denominated
affect our liquidity. In addition, because we borrow in a variety of currencies,
our debt balances fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates.

         Under the credit  agreement,  amounts  outstanding under the term loans
are  payable in  quarterly  installments.  In  addition,  the  credit  agreement
obligates us to make  mandatory  prepayments in certain  circumstances  with the
proceeds of asset sales or issuance of capital  stock or  indebtedness  and with
certain excess cash flow. The credit agreement  imposes certain  restrictions on
us and our subsidiaries,  including  restrictions and limitations on the ability
to pay dividends to our  shareholders,  incur  indebtedness,  make  investments,
grant liens,  sell financial assets and engage in certain other  activities.  We
must also comply with  several  financial  covenants.  The credit  agreement  is
secured by most of our assets.

         Cash  provided by operating  activities  totaled $91.3 million in 1999,
compared  to $72.0  million  in 1998 and $55.6  million  in 1997.  The  increase
resulted principally from improved Adjusted Operating Income.

         During 1999,  we spent  approximately  $20.5  million on  acquisitions,
including  approximately  $2.0 million of working  capital  retained by sellers.
These  purchases were funded from cash generated from  operations and additional
borrowings.  We continue to explore potential  acquisitions.  In connection with
any acquisition, we may incur additional indebtedness. In addition, we expect to
make additional  earn-out  payments in 2000 relating to certain of our 1998 drug
discovery acquisitions.

         Capital  expenditures  are a  significant  use of  funds  and are  made
primarily for machinery, equipment and the purchase and expansion of facilities.
Our capital  expenditures  totaled $29.2 million in 1999,  $28.6 million in 1998
and $22.3 million in 1997. We do not expect the level of our capital expenditure
increases in 2000 to be significantly different than historical increases.

         We currently believe that cash flow from operating activities, together
with borrowings  available under the credit  agreement and local working capital
facilities,  will be sufficient to fund currently  anticipated  working  capital
needs and capital spending requirements as well as debt service requirements for
at least  several  years,  but there can be no  assurance  that this will be the
case.





Effect of Currency on Results of Operations

         Because we conduct  operations in many countries,  our operating income
can be significantly  affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Swiss
franc-denominated  expenses represent a much greater percentage of our operating
expenses than Swiss franc-denominated sales represent of our net sales. In part,
this is  because  most of our  manufacturing  costs  in  Switzerland  relate  to
products  that  are  sold  outside  of  Switzerland.   Moreover,  a  substantial
percentage   of  our   research  and   development   expenses  and  general  and
administrative  expenses are incurred in  Switzerland.  Therefore,  if the Swiss
franc strengthens against all or most of our major trading currencies (e.g., the
U.S. dollar,  the euro,  other major European  currencies and the Japanese yen),
our  operating  profit is  reduced.  We also have  significantly  more  sales in
European  currencies (other than the Swiss franc) than we have expenses in those
currencies.  Therefore,  when European currencies weaken against the U.S. dollar
and the Swiss franc, it also decreases our operating  profits.  In recent years,
the  Swiss  franc  and  other  European  currencies  have  generally  moved in a
consistent  manner versus the U.S.  dollar.  Therefore,  because the two effects
previously described have offset each other, our operating profits have not been
materially  affected  by  movements  in the U.S.  dollar  exchange  rate  versus
European  currencies.  However,  there can be no assurance that these currencies
will continue to move in a consistent  manner in the future.  In addition to the
effects of exchange  rate  movements on operating  profits,  our debt levels can
fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates, particularly between the U.S. dollar
and the Swiss franc.

Year 2000

         We put in place  detailed  programs  to  address  Year  2000  readiness
internally  and with  certain  suppliers.  The Year 2000  issue is the result of
computer  logic that was written using two digits rather than four to define the
applicable  year. Any computer logic that processes  date-sensitive  information
may recognize dates using "00" as the year 1900 rather than the year 2000, which
could result in miscalculations or system or equipment failures.

         Pursuant to our readiness programs, all major categories of information
technology systems and non-information  technology systems (e.g., equipment with
embedded  microprocessors)  in  use  by  us,  including  manufacturing,   sales,
financial and human resources,  were inventoried and assessed.  We also reviewed
our products,  including  products  sold in recent  years,  and believe that our
products are Year 2000 compliant. We believe that all internal  mission-critical
information  technology  and  non-information  technology  systems are Year 2000
compliant.

         We have not  experienced  any  significant  Year 2000 problems to date.
While we believe  that the  identification  of  significant  Year 2000 issues is
unlikely at this time,  there is an ongoing risk that Year 2000 related problems
could still occur and we will continue to monitor the situation closely.

         The costs incurred to date related to our Year 2000 activities have not
been  material.  We do not expect to realize a significant  reduction in related
expenditures now that the work on Year 2000 compliance is complete.




European Economic and Monetary Union

         Within  Europe,  the European  Economic and Monetary  Union (the "EMU")
introduced a new currency, the euro, on January 1, 1999. Switzerland is not part
of the EMU.

         On January 1, 1999,  the  participating  countries  adopted the euro as
their local  currency,  initially  available  for  currency  trading on currency
exchanges and noncash (banking) transactions.  The existing local currencies, or
legacy currencies,  will remain legal tender through January 1, 2002.  Beginning
on  January 1,  2002,  euro-denominated  bills and coins will be issued for cash
transactions.  For a period of six months from this date, both legacy currencies
and the euro will be legal tender.  On or before July 1, 2002, the participating
countries will withdraw all legacy currency and use exclusively the euro.

         We have recognized the introduction of the euro as a significant  event
with potential  implications for existing operations.  Currently,  we operate in
all of the  participating  countries  in the  EMU.  We  expect  nonparticipating
European Union countries, where we also have operations, may eventually join the
EMU.

         We have  committed  resources to conduct risk  assessments  and to take
corrective  actions,   where  required,  to  ensure  we  are  prepared  for  the
introduction of the euro. We have undertaken a review of the euro implementation
and have  concentrated on areas such as operations,  finance,  treasury,  legal,
information  management,  procurement  and  others,  both in  participating  and
nonparticipating  European  Union  countries  where we operate.  Also,  existing
legacy  accounting  and  business  systems and other  business  assets have been
reviewed for euro compliance,  including assessing any risks from third parties.
Progress regarding euro implementation is reported periodically to management.

         Because of the staggered  introduction  of the euro regarding  non-cash
and cash transactions, we have developed our plans to address our accounting and
business  systems first and our business  assets second.  We were euro compliant
within our accounting  and business  systems by the end of 1999 and expect to be
compliant within our other business assets prior to the introduction of the euro
bills and coins. Compliance in participating and nonparticipating countries will
be achieved primarily through upgraded systems, which were previously planned to
be upgraded. Remaining systems will be modified to achieve compliance. We do not
currently  expect to experience any  significant  operational  disruptions or to
incur any significant costs, including any currency risk, which could materially
affect our liquidity or capital  resources.  We are  preparing  plans to address
issues within the  transitional  period when both legacy and euro currencies may
be used.

         We are  reviewing  our pricing  strategy  throughout  Europe due to the
increased  price  transparency  created by the euro and are attempting to adjust
prices in some of our markets.  We are also  encouraging our suppliers,  even in
Switzerland,  to commence  transacting  in the euro.  We do not believe that the
effect of these adjustments will be material.

         We have a disproportionate amount of our costs in Swiss francs relative
to sales.  Historically,  the potential  currency  impact has been muted because
currency   fluctuations  between  the  Swiss  franc  and  other  major  European
currencies have been minimal and there is greater balance between total European
(including  Swiss) sales and costs.  However,  if the  introduction  of the euro
results in a  significant  weakening of the euro  against the Swiss  franc,  our
financial performance could be harmed.




         The statements set forth herein concerning the introduction of the euro
which are not historical facts are forward-looking statements that involve risks
and  uncertainties  that could cause actual  results to differ  materially  from
those in the  forward-looking  statements.  In particular,  the costs associated
with our euro  programs  and the  time-frame  in which we plan to complete  euro
modifications are based upon  management's best estimates.  These estimates were
derived from internal assessments and assumptions of future events. There can be
no guarantee  that any  estimates or other  forward-looking  statements  will be
achieved, and actual results could differ significantly from those contemplated.

Taxes

         We are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions  throughout the world.
Our  effective  tax rate  and tax  liability  will be  affected  by a number  of
factors, such as the amount of taxable income in particular  jurisdictions,  the
tax rates in such jurisdictions,  tax treaties between jurisdictions, the extent
to which we transfer  funds between  jurisdictions  and repatriate  income,  and
changes in law. Generally, the tax liability for each legal entity is determined
either   (i)   on   a    non-consolidated/combined    basis   or   (ii)   on   a
consolidated/combined  basis only with other eligible entities subject to tax in
the same  jurisdiction,  in either case without  regard to the taxable losses of
non-consolidated/combined  affiliated  entities.  As a result, we may pay income
taxes to certain  jurisdictions  even though on an overall  basis we incur a net
loss for the period.

Environmental Matters

         We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, including
those  relating  to air  emissions,  wastewater  discharges,  the  handling  and
disposal of solid and  hazardous  wastes and the  remediation  of  contamination
associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances.

         We  incur  capital  and  operating   expenditures   in  complying  with
environmental  laws and regulations both in the United States and abroad. We are
currently  involved  in,  or have  potential  liability  with  respect  to,  the
remediation of past  contamination  in facilities  both in the United States and
abroad. In addition,  some of these facilities have or had been in operation for
many decades and may have used  substances  or generated  and disposed of wastes
that are hazardous or may be considered  hazardous in the future. Such sites and
disposal  sites  owned by  others to which we sent  waste  may in the  future be
identified as contaminated and require remediation.  Accordingly, it is possible
that we could become  subject to  additional  environmental  liabilities  in the
future that may harm our results of operations or financial condition.  However,
we do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our results of operations or
financial condition as a result of future costs of environmental compliance.

Inflation

         Inflation  can affect the costs of goods and services  that we use. The
competitive  environment  in which we operate  limits  somewhat  our  ability to
recover higher costs through  increased selling prices.  Moreover,  there may be
differences  in inflation  rates  between  countries in which we incur the major
portion of our costs and other  countries in which we sell  products,  which may
limit our ability to recover  increased costs. We remain committed to operations
in China, Latin America and Eastern Europe, which have experienced  inflationary
conditions.  To date,  inflationary conditions have not had a material effect on
our operating results. However, if




our  presence  in China,  Latin  America  and Eastern  Europe  increases,  these
inflationary conditions could have a greater impact on our operating results.

Seasonality

         Our business has  historically  experienced a slight amount of seasonal
variation, with sales in the first quarter slightly lower than, and sales in the
fourth quarter  slightly  higher than,  sales in the second and third  quarters.
This trend has a somewhat  greater effect on income from  operations than on net
sales because fixed costs are spread evenly across all quarters.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

         We have only limited involvement with derivative financial  instruments
and do not use them for trading purposes.

         We have  entered  into  foreign  currency  forward  contracts  to hedge
short-term  intercompany  balances with our foreign  businesses.  Such contracts
limit our exposure to both favorable and unfavorable  currency  fluctuations.  A
sensitivity  analysis  to  changes in the U.S.  dollar and Swiss  franc on these
foreign  currency-denominated  contracts  indicates that if the U.S.  dollar and
Swiss franc uniformly weakened by 10% against all of our currency exposures, the
fair value of these  instruments  would decrease by $3.7 million at December 31,
1999 as compared with $2.6 million at December 31, 1998.  Any resulting  changes
in fair value would be offset by changes in the underlying  hedged balance sheet
position.  The sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in foreign currency
exchange rates.  The assumption  that exchange rates change in parallel  fashion
may overstate the impact of changing  exchange  rates on assets and  liabilities
denominated  in a  foreign  currency.  We also  have  other  currency  risks  as
described under "Effect of Currency on Results of Operations."

         We have entered into certain  interest rate swap agreements in order to
limit our exposure to  increases in interest  rates.  These  contracts  are more
fully  described  in Note 5 to our audited  consolidated  financial  statements.
Based on our  agreements  outstanding  at December  31,  1999, a 100 basis point
increase in  interest  rates  would  result in an increase in the net  aggregate
market value of these instruments of $9.4 million, as compared with $8.2 million
at December 31, 1998.  Conversely,  a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates
would result in a $9.4 million net reduction in the net  aggregate  market value
of these  instruments,  as compared with $8.8 million at December 31, 1998.  Any
change in fair value would not affect our  Consolidated  Statement of Operations
unless such  agreements  and the variable rate debt they hedge were  prematurely
settled.

         We have  designated  certain of our Swiss  franc debt as a hedge of our
net  investments.  A sensitivity  analysis to changes in the U.S. dollar on such
debt at December  31, 1999  indicates  that if the U.S.  dollar  weakened by 10%
against  the Swiss  franc,  the fair value of such debt would  increase by $14.7
million as compared with $26.2 million at December 31, 1998. Any changes in fair
value of the debt are recorded in comprehensive  income and offset the impact on
comprehensive  income of foreign exchange  changes on the net investments  which
they hedge.

New Accounting Standards

         In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging





Activities." This statement  establishes  accounting and reporting standards for
derivative  instruments,  including certain derivative  instruments  embedded in
other  contracts  (collectively  referred  to as  derivatives),  and for hedging
activities.  It requires  that an entity  recognize  all  derivatives  as either
assets or liabilities  in the statement of financial  position and measure those
instruments at fair value.  This statement is effective for all fiscal  quarters
of fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. We have not determined the effect
of the adoption of this statement.

Forward-Looking Statements and Associated Risks

         This annual report  includes  forward-looking  statements  based on our
current expectations and projections about future events,  including:  strategic
plans;  potential  growth,   including  penetration  of  developed  markets  and
opportunities  in  emerging  markets;  planned  product  introductions;  planned
operational  changes and  research  and  development  efforts;  euro  conversion
issues; future financial  performance,  including expected capital expenditures;
research and development expenditures; estimated proceeds from and the timing of
asset sales; potential acquisitions;  future cash sources and requirements;  and
potential  cost savings  from  planned  employee  reductions  and  restructuring
programs.

         These  forward-looking  statements are subject to a number of risks and
uncertainties,  including those  identified in Exhibit 99.1 to our Annual Report
on Form 10-K,  which could cause our actual  results to differ  materially  from
historical  results  or those  anticipated  and  certain of which are beyond our
control.  The words "believe,"  "expect,"  "anticipate" and similar  expressions
identify  forward-looking  statements.  We undertake no  obligation  to publicly
update or revise  any  forward-looking  statements,  whether  as a result of new
information,  future events or otherwise.  New risk factors  emerge from time to
time and it is not possible for us to predict all such risk factors,  nor can we
assess the  impact of all such risk  factors  on our  business  or the extent to
which any factor, or combination of factors,  may cause actual results to differ
materially from those contained in any forward-looking  statements.  Given these

ITEM 9.       CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND
              FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

         On March  10,  1999,  the  Company  dismissed  KPMG  Fides  Peat as its
independent auditors.  The reports of KPMG Fides Peat on the Company's financial
statements  for the fiscal  years ended  December 31, 1998 and December 31, 1997
did  not  contain  an  adverse  opinion  or  a  disclaimer  of  opinion,   or  a
qualification  or  modification  as to  uncertainty,  audit scope, or accounting
principles.  In  connection  with its audits for the  Company's  two most recent
fiscal years, and through March 10, 1999, there were no disagreements  with KPMG
Fides  Peat on any  matter of  accounting  principles  or  practices,  financial
statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreement(s),  if
not  resolved to the  satisfaction  of KPMG Fides Peat,  would have caused it to
make a reference to the subject matter of the disagreement(s) in connection with
its reports covering such periods.  None of the reportable events listed in Item
304(a)(1)(v)  of  Regulation  S-K occurred  with respect to the Company and KPMG
Fides Peat.

         On March 10, 1999, the Company engaged  PricewaterhouseCoopers  ("PwC")
as its independent auditors for the fiscal year ending December 31, 1999. During
the  Company's two most recent  fiscal  years,  and through March 10, 1999,  the
Company  did not consult  with PwC as to either the  application  of  accounting
principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type
of audit  opinion that might be rendered on the Company's  financial  statements
and the Company  did not  consult  with PwC as to any matter that was either the
subject of a disagreement or reportable event.

         The  decision to dismiss KPMG Fides Peat as the  Company's  independent
auditors  was  approved  by the  Audit  Committee  of  the  Company's  Board  of
Directors.

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

In our opinion, the consolidated  financial statements listed in the index under
Item 14(a)(1) on page 47 present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Mettler-Toledo  International  Inc. and its subsidiaries at December
31, 1999, and the results of their  operations and their cash flows for the year
then ended in conformity with accounting  principles  generally  accepted in the
United States of America. In addition,  in our opinion,  the financial statement
schedule  listed in the index under Item 14 (a) (2) on page 47 presents  fairly,
in all material  respects,  the information set forth therein for 1999 when read
in  conjunction  with  the  related  consolidated  financial  statements.  These
financial  statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of
the Company's  management;  our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial  statements and financial  statement  schedule based on our audit.  We
conducted our audit of these  statements in accordance  with auditing  standards
generally  accepted in the United States of America,  which require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a
test basis,  evidence  supporting  the amounts and  disclosures in the financial
statements,  assessing the accounting  principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for the opinion  expressed
above.

                 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                     (In thousands unless otherwise stated)

1.            Business Description and Basis of Presentation

         Mettler-Toledo  International Inc.  ("Mettler-Toledo" or the "Company")
is a global  manufacturer  and  marketer  of  precision  instruments,  including
weighing  and  certain  analytical  and  measurement  technologies,  for  use in
laboratory,  industrial and food retailing  applications.  The Company's primary
manufacturing facilities are located in Switzerland, the United States, Germany,
the United Kingdom,  France and China. The Company's principal executive offices
are located in Greifensee, Switzerland.

         The consolidated  financial statements have been prepared in accordance
with generally  accepted  accounting  principles in the United States of America
("U.S.  GAAP") and  include  all  entities  in which the  Company  has  control,
including its majority owned  subsidiaries.  Certain amounts in the prior period
financial  statements  have been  reclassified  to  conform  with  current  year
presentation.

         All  intercompany  transactions  and  balances  have  been  eliminated.
Investments  in which the  Company  has  voting  rights  between  20% to 50% are
accounted for using the equity method of accounting.

         The  preparation of financial  statements  requires  management to make
estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of assets and
liabilities,  as well as disclosure of contingent  assets and liabilities at the
date of the  financial  statements,  and the  reported  amounts of revenues  and
expenses  during the  reporting  periods.  Actual  results may differ from those
estimates.

2.            Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

         Cash and Cash Equivalents

         Cash  and cash  equivalents  include  highly  liquid  investments  with
original maturity dates of three months or less.

         Inventories

         Inventories  are  valued at the lower of cost or  market.  Cost,  which
includes  direct  materials,  labor and  overhead  plus  indirect  overhead,  is
determined using the first in, first out (FIFO) or weighted average cost methods
and to a lesser extent the last in, first out (LIFO) method.

                     (In thousands unless otherwise stated)

2.            Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - (Continued)

         Property, Plant and Equipment

         Property,  plant and  equipment  are  stated  at cost less  accumulated
depreciation.  Depreciation  is  charged  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the
estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:

              Buildings and improvements    15 to 50 years
              Machinery and equipment       3 to 12 years
              Computer software             3 to 5 years
              Leasehold improvements        Shorter of useful life or lease term

         The Company  reviews its property,  plant and equipment for  impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
an asset may not be  recoverable.  An impairment  loss would be recognized  when
estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its
eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount.

         Excess of Cost over Net Assets Acquired

         The excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired
is amortized on a straight-line  basis over the expected period to be benefited.
The Company assesses the  recoverability of such amounts by determining  whether
the  amortization  of the balance over its remaining  life can be recovered from
the undiscounted future operating cash flows of the acquired operations.

         Taxation

         The  Company  files  tax  returns  in each  jurisdiction  in  which  it
operates.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences   attributable  to  differences  between  the  financial  statement
carrying  amounts of existing assets and  liabilities  and their  respective tax
bases and operating loss and tax credit  carryforwards.  Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in the respective jurisdictions
in which the Company  operates  that are expected to apply to taxable  income in
the years in which those  temporary  differences are expected to be recovered or
settled.  In assessing  the  realizability  of deferred  tax assets,  management
considers  whether it is more  likely  than not that some  portion or all of the
deferred tax assets will not be realized.

         Generally,  deferred taxes are not provided on the unremitted  earnings
of subsidiaries  outside of the U.S.  because it is expected that these earnings
are  permanently  reinvested and such  determination  is not  practicable.  Such
earnings may become taxable upon the sale or  liquidation of these  subsidiaries
or upon the  remittance of dividends.  Deferred taxes are provided in situations
where the Company's subsidiaries plan to make future dividend distributions.

         Currency Translation and Transactions

         The reporting currency for the consolidated financial statements of the
Company is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency for the Company's operations
is  generally  the  applicable  local  currency.  Accordingly,  the  assets  and
liabilities of companies whose functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar
are included in the consolidated  financial statements by translating the assets
and liabilities into the reporting  currency at the exchange rates applicable at
the end of the reporting period.  The statements of operations and cash flows of
such  non-U.S.  dollar  functional  currency  operations  are  translated at the
monthly average exchange rates during the year.  Translation gains or losses are
accumulated in other comprehensive  income (loss) in the Consolidated Statements
of Shareholders' Equity.

         Revenue Recognition

         Revenue  is  recognized  when  title to a product  has  transferred  or
services have been rendered. Revenues from service contracts are recognized over
the contract period.

         Research and Development

         Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.

         Earnings per Common Share

         As described in Note 11, in accordance  with the treasury stock method,
the Company has included  2,777,673 and 2,325,132  equivalent shares relating to
5,035,647  outstanding  options  to  purchase  shares  of  common  stock  in the
calculation of diluted weighted average number of common shares for years ending
December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

         Derivative Financial Instruments

         The Company has only  limited  involvement  with  derivative  financial
instruments and does not use them for trading purposes.  The Company enters into
foreign currency forward contracts to hedge short-term intercompany transactions
with its foreign businesses. Such contracts limit the Company's exposure to both
favorable and unfavorable currency fluctuations. These contracts are adjusted to
reflect market values as of each balance sheet date, with the resulting  changes
in fair value being recognized in other charges, net.

         The Company also enters into certain  interest rate swap  agreements in
order to reduce its exposure to changes in interest rates. The differential paid
or received on interest rate swap  agreements is recognized as interest  expense
over the life of the agreements as incurred.

         The Company has entered into certain foreign currency forward contracts
in order to convert  certain U.S. dollar based debt into Swiss franc based debt.
The  Company has also  designated  certain of its Swiss franc debt as a hedge of
its net investments. Any changes in

         Stock Based Compensation

         The  Company  applies  Accounting  Principles  Board  Opinion  No.  25,
"Accounting  for Stock  Issued to  Employees,"  and related  interpretations  in
accounting for its stock option plan.

         Concentration of Credit Risk

         The Company's  revenue base is widely  diversified by geographic region
and by  individual  customer.  The  Company's  products  are  utilized  in  many
different  industries,  although extensively in the pharmaceutical and chemicals
industries.  The Company performs  ongoing credit  evaluations of its customers'
financial condition and, generally, requires no collateral from its customers.

3.            Business Combinations

         During  1999,  the  Company  spent   approximately   $20.5  million  on
acquisitions  including the net assets of the  Testut-Lutrana  group,  a leading
manufacturer  and marketer of  industrial  and retail  weighing  instruments  in
France.  This amount  includes  approximately  $2.0  million of working  capital
retained by sellers which has been excluded from the purchase price  allocation.
The  Company  accounted  for the  acquisitions  using  the  purchase  method  of
accounting.  Accordingly,  the costs of the  acquisitions  were allocated to the
assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values.
In this respect the Company  allocated  $1.0  million of the  purchase  price to
revalue certain finished goods  inventories to fair value.  Substantially all of
such inventories were sold in 1999.

         During  1998,  the  Company  spent   approximately   $44.9  million  on
acquisitions and other investing  activities including seller financing of $12.0
million  and  assumed  debt of $3.1  million  as well as  contingent  and  other
payments  associated with  acquisitions  consummated in 1997. The Company may be
required  to make  additional  earn-out  payments  relating  to certain of these
acquisitions in the future.

         In December  1998, the Company  announced that it had acquired  Applied
Systems  and Myriad  Synthesizer  Technology.  The Company  accounted  for these
acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting.

         Applied  Systems  designs,   assembles  and  markets   instruments  for
in-process  molecular  analysis,   which  is  primarily  used  for  researching,
developing and  monitoring  chemical  processes.  Applied  Systems'  proprietary
sensors,  together with its innovative  Fourier transform  infrared  technology,
enable  chemists to analyze  chemical  reactions  as they  occur,  which is more
efficient than pulling samples.

         Myriad   Synthesizer   Technology   designs,   assembles   and  markets
instruments  that  facilitate  and  automate the  synthesis of large  numbers of
chemical compounds in parallel,

which is a key step in the  chemical  compound  discovery  process. Its products
can be used in all stages of synthesis in drug discovery.

         In July 1998, the Company  acquired Bohdan  Automation  Inc., a leading
supplier of laboratory automation and automated synthesis products.  The Company
accounted  for  the  acquisition   using  the  purchase  method  of  accounting.
Accordingly,  the costs of the acquisition were allocated to the assets acquired
and liabilities  assumed based upon their  respective  fair values.  The Company
incurred a charge of $10.0 million  immediately  following the acquisition based
upon an independent  valuation for purchased  research and development costs for
products being developed that had not established  technological  feasibility as
of the date of acquisition and, if unsuccessful,  had no alternative  future use
in research and development activities or otherwise.

         In May 1997,  the Company  purchased the entire issued share capital of
Safeline Limited  ("Safeline"),  a manufacturer of metal detection systems based
in Manchester  in the United  Kingdom,  for  approximately  (pound)63.7  million
(approximately  $104.4  million  at May  30,  1997),  including  a  post-closing
adjustment of (pound)1.9  million which was paid in October 1997 and an earn-out
of  (pound)0.8  million  which  was paid in June  1998.  Under  the terms of the
agreement,  the Company paid approximately  (pound)13.7  million  (approximately
$22.4 million) in the form of seller loan notes.

         The Company  accounted for the Safeline  acquisition using the purchase
method of accounting. The Company incurred a charge of $30.0 million immediately
following  the  acquisition  based upon an  independent  valuation for purchased
research and development  costs. The  technological  feasibility of the products
being developed had not been  established as of the date of the acquisition and,
if  unsuccessful,  had no  alternative  future use in research  and  development
activities or otherwise.  In addition, the Company allocated $2.1 million of the
purchase  price to revalue  certain  finished  goods  inventories to fair value.
Substantially  all of such  inventories were sold in the second quarter of 1997.
The excess of the cost of the acquisition  over the fair value of the net assets
acquired is being amortized over 30 years.

         Inventories, net consisted of the following at December 31:

5.            Financial Instruments

         At December  31,  1999,  the Company  had  certain  interest  rate swap
agreements outstanding that fix the variable interest obligation associated with
CHF 265 million of Swiss  franc  based debt and $120  million of USD based debt.
Certain of these  agreements have forward starting dates commencing in 2000. The
agreements  have various  maturities  beginning in 2000 and  continuing  through
2004. The fixed rates  associated with the swap of Swiss franc debt vary between
2.17% and 2.94%,  while the rates  associated with the USD debt range from 5.93%
and 6.09% plus the Company's normal interest margin.  The swaps are effective at
either  one-month or three month LIBOR rates. At December 31, 1999 and 1998, the
fair market value of such financial  instruments was approximately  $2.4 million
and $(6.6) million, respectively.

         At December  31, 1999,  the Company had  outstanding  foreign  currency
forward contracts in the amount of $35.6 million. The purpose of these contracts
is to hedge short-term  intercompany  balances with its foreign businesses.  The
fair value of these  contracts was not  materially  different  than the carrying
value at December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

         The  Company  may  be  exposed  to  credit   losses  in  the  event  of
nonperformance  by the  counterparties  to its derivative  financial  instrument
contracts.  Counterparties are established banks and financial institutions with
high  credit   ratings.   The  Company  has  no  reason  to  believe  that  such
counterparties  will not be able to fully satisfy their  obligations under these
contracts.

         The fair values of all derivative  financial  instruments are estimated
based on current settlement prices of comparable  contracts obtained from dealer
quotes.  The values  represent  the  estimated  amount the Company  would pay or
receive to terminate the agreements at the reporting  date,  taking into account
current creditworthiness of the counterparties.

9.            Long-Term Debt

         Long-term debt consisted of the following at December 31:


         The  Company  has a  multi-currency  $400.0  million  revolving  credit
facility and a CDN $26.3 million  Canadian  revolving  credit facility under its
credit  agreement.  Loans under these revolving credit  facilities may be repaid
and  reborrowed  and are due in full on May 19, 2004. At December 31, 1999,  the
Company had approximately  $277.0 million of additional borrowing capacity under
its credit  agreement.  The Company has the ability to refinance its  short-term
borrowings  through  its  revolving   facilities  for  an  uninterrupted  period
extending  beyond one year.  Accordingly,  approximately  $119.8  million of the
Company's  short-term  borrowings at December 31, 1999 have been reclassified to
long-term.

         The aggregate  maturities of long-term  obligations  during each of the
years 2001 through 2004 are approximately  $34.6 million,  $32.5 million,  $37.1
million and $27.8 million, respectively.

         The  Company  is  required  to pay a facility  fee based  upon  certain
financial  ratios  per annum on the  amount  of its  revolving  facilities.  The
facility  fee at December  31, 1999 was equal to 0.20%.  At December  31,  1999,
borrowings under the Company's revolving  facilities carried an interest rate of
LIBOR plus 0.425%.  The Company's  weighted  average  interest rate for the year
ended December 31, 1999 was approximately 6.1%.

         The  Company's   credit   agreement   contains   covenants,   including
limitations  on the Company's  ability to pay dividends to  shareholders,  incur
indebtedness, make investments, grant liens, sell financial assets and engage in
certain  other  activities.  The credit  agreement  also requires the Company to
maintain a minimum net worth, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, and a ratio
of total debt to EBITDA below a specified maximum.

         The  carrying  value of the  Company's  obligations  under  its  credit
agreement  approximate  fair  value  due  to the  variable  rate  nature  of the
obligations.

9.            Long-Term Debt - (Continued)

         At the  time of the  Safeline  acquisition  in May  1997,  the  Company
refinanced its previous credit facility and entered into a new credit  facility.
The  Company  recorded  an  extraordinary  loss of  approximately  $9.6  million
representing  a charge for the write-off of  capitalized  debt issuance fees and
related expenses associated with the Company's previous credit facility.

         In connection  with the Company's  initial public  offering in November
1997, the Company refinanced its existing credit facility by entering into a new
credit  facility (the "Credit  Agreement").  Concurrent  with the initial public
offering and refinancing,  the Company  consummated a tender offer to repurchase
9 3/4%   senior  subordinated  notes  (the  "Notes").  In  connection  with  the
refinancing and the Notes repurchase, the Company recorded an extraordinary loss
of $31.6 million primarily  representing the premium paid in connection with the
early  extinguishment  of the  Notes  of  $17.9  million  and the  write-off  of
capitalized  debt  issuance  fees  associated  with the Notes and the  Company's
previous credit facility.

10.           Shareholders' Equity

         Common Stock

         In November 1997, pursuant to a merger with its wholly owned subsidiary
Mettler-Toledo Holding Inc., each share of the Company's existing Class A, Class
B and Class C common stock was converted  into  12.58392  shares of common stock
and the number of authorized  shares was increased to 125,000,000  shares with a
par value of $0.01 per share.  Concurrently therewith,  the Company completed an
underwritten  initial public  offering of 7,666,667  shares at a public offering
price of $14.00 per share.  The net proceeds from the offering of  approximately
$97.3  million  were  used to repay a portion  of the  Company's  9 3/4%  senior
subordinated  notes  (see  Note 9). As part of the  offering  the  Company  sold
approximately  287,000 shares of its common stock to Company  sponsored  benefit
funds at the public  offering price.  Holders of the Company's  common stock are
entitled to one vote per share.


         At December 31, 1999,  6,029,691  shares of the Company's  common stock
were reserved for grant pursuant to the Company's stock option plan.

         Preferred Stock

         The Board of Directors,  without further shareholder authorization,  is
authorized to issue up to 10,000,000  shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01
per share in one or more series and to determine and fix the rights, preferences
and privileges of each series,  including  dividend rights and preferences  over
dividends  on the common  stock and one or more series of the  preferred  stock,
conversion  rights,  voting  rights  (in  addition  to those  provided  by law),
redemption  rights and the terms of any sinking fund therefore,  and rights upon
liquidation,  dissolution or winding up,  including  preferences over the common

series of the preferred stock. The issuance of shares of preferred stock, or the
issuance of rights to purchase  such  shares,  may have the effect of  delaying,
deferring  or  preventing  a change in control of the Company or an  unsolicited
acquisition proposal.

11.           Stock Option Plan

         Effective  October 15, 1996, the Company adopted a stock option plan to
provide certain key employees and directors of the Company additional  incentive
to join and/or  remain in the service of the Company as well as to maintain  and
enhance the long-term performance and profitability of the Company.

         Under the terms of the plan,  options granted shall be nonqualified and
the  exercise  price shall not be less than the fair market  value of the common
stock on the date of grant.  Options  vest  equally over a five year period from
the date of grant.



         At December 31, 1999, 994,044 options were available for grant.

         As of the date granted,  the weighted average  grant-date fair value of
the options  granted during the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997 was
approximately  $12.31,  $8.11 and $3.37 per share,  respectively.  Such weighted
average grant-date fair value was determined using an option pricing model which
incorporated the following assumptions:

                                        1999          1998         1997

12.           Benefit Plans

         Mettler-Toledo  maintains a number of retirement  plans for the benefit
of its employees.

         Certain  companies  sponsor defined  contribution  plans.  Benefits are
determined  and  funded  annually  based  upon the terms of the  plans.  Amounts
recognized as cost under these plans amounted to $2.8 million,  $8.2 million and
$8.9 million for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.
Based on certain  changes in 1999, the Company  performed a reevaluation  of its
Swiss  pension plans and  determined  these plans to be defined  benefit  plans.
Accordingly,  commencing  in 1999,  the Company has accounted for these plans as
such. The application of defined benefit accounting to the plans had no material
impact on the consolidated financial statements.

         Certain companies sponsor defined benefit plans.  Benefits are provided
to employees  primarily based upon years of service and employees'  compensation
for certain  periods  during the last years of  employment.  The Company's  U.S.
operations  also provide  postretirement  medical  benefits to their  employees.
Contributions for medical benefits are related to employee years of service.

12.           Benefit Plans - (Continued)

         The assumed discount rates and rates of increase in future compensation
level used in calculating the projected  benefit  obligations  vary according to
the  economic  conditions  of the  country  in which  the  retirement  plans are
situated. The weighted average rates used for the purposes of the Company's U.S.
plans are as follows:

                                                         1999     1998     1997

Expected long term rate of return on plan assets......   9.5%     9.5%     9.5%

         Plan  assets  relate  principally  to  the  Company's  U.S.  and  Swiss
companies and consist of equity investments, obligations of the U.S. Treasury or
other governmental agencies, and other interest-bearing investments.

         At  December  31,  1999,  the fair  value of plan  assets and the total
projected benefit  obligation for the Company's  non-U.S.  defined benefit plans
were $305.4 million and $324.6 million, respectively.  Actuarial assumptions for
these plans  ranged from 3.75% to 8.5% for the discount  rate,  2.0% to 6.5% for
the compensation  increase rate and 5.0% to 8.5% for the expected long term rate
of return on plan assets for the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997.

         Net periodic  pension cost for the defined  benefit plans  includes the
following components for the year ended December 31:

         The  accumulated  postretirement  benefit  obligation  and net periodic
postretirement  benefit cost were principally determined using discount rates of
7.2% in 1999,  6.7% in 1998 and 7.0% in 1997 and health  care cost  trend  rates
ranging from 7.5% to 8.5% in 1999, 1998 and 1997, decreasing to 5% in 2005.

         The health care cost trend rate assumption has a significant  effect on
the   accumulated   postretirement   benefit   obligation   and   net   periodic
postretirement  benefit cost. A  one-percentage-point  change in assumed  health
care cost trend rates would have the following effects:

13.           Taxes - (Continued)

         The Company has  established  valuation  allowances  primarily  for net
operating losses, deferred losses as well as postretirement and pension costs as
follows as of December 31:

                                                              1999       1998

    Other................................................     9,535     12,577
                                                            -------    -------
Total valuation allowance................................   $53,128    $64,640
                                                            =======    =======


         The Company has recorded  valuation  allowances related to its deferred
income tax assets due to the  uncertainty of the ultimate  realization of future
benefits  from such assets.  The 1999 net change in the  valuation  allowance is
primarily  attributable  to the changes as enumerated  above which are primarily
related to improved  realization  potential  and/or  utilization  of  associated
deferred tax assets.

         The potential  decrease or increase of the  valuation  allowance in the
near term is  dependent on the future  realizability  of the deferred tax assets
which are  primarily  affected  by the future  profitability  of  operations  in
various worldwide jurisdictions, but primarily in the United States.

         The total valuation  allowances  relating to acquired businesses amount
to $16.7 million and $35.0 million at December 31, 1999 and 1998,  respectively.
The reduction for the current year is primarily  attributable to the utilization
of net  operating  losses  and the  expiration  of the  useful  life of  various
deferred  tax assets.  Future  reductions  of these  valuation  allowances  will
continue to be credited to goodwill.

         At December 31, 1999, the Company had net operating loss  carryforwards
for U.S.  federal income tax purposes of $46.8  million,  all of which expire in
2012.  The Company  has  various  U.S.  state net  operating  losses and various
foreign operating losses that expire in varying amounts through 2012.

14.           Other Charges, Net

         Other charges, net consists primarily of foreign currency transactions,
interest income,  charges related to the Company's  cost-reduction  programs and
gains on the sale of property, plant and equipment.

         As part of its efforts to reduce costs, the Company evaluates from time
to time the cost  effectiveness of its global  manufacturing  strategy.  In this
respect,  the Company  recorded a charge of  approximately  $8.0 million in 1999
associated with the transfer of production  lines from the Americas to China and
Europe and the closure of facilities.  The charge comprised  primarily severance
and other  related  benefits and costs of exiting  facilities,  including  lease
termination  costs and the  write-down of impaired  assets.  In connection  with
these activities,  the Company expects to involuntarily  terminate approximately
180 employees.

14.           Other Charges, Net - (Continued)

         The  Company  also  incurred  losses  of $4.1  million  during  1999 in
connection with the exit from its glass batching business based in Belgium. This
amount primarily  comprised  severance and other costs of exiting this business.
The Company completed its exit of this business by the end of 1999. These losses
were offset by a gain of $3.1 million recorded in connection with an asset sale.

         In 1997, the Company recorded  restructuring charges of $6.3 million in
connection with the closure of three facilities in North America.  These charges
comprised  mainly  severance  and other  related  benefits  and costs of exiting
facilities, including lease termination costs.

         A rollforward of the components of the Company's accrual for

         Rent expense for  operating  leases  amounted to $15.3  million,  $17.7
million and $16.4 million for the years ended December 31, 1999,  1998 and 1997,

         Legal

         The Company is party to various legal  proceedings,  including  certain
environmental matters,  incidental to the normal course of business.  Management
does not expect that any of such proceedings will have a material adverse effect
on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.

16.           Segment Reporting

         Operating  segments  are the  individual  reporting  units  within  the
Company.  These units are managed separately,  and it is at this level where the
determination  of resource  allocation is made.  The units have been  aggregated
based on operating  segments in geographical  regions that have similar economic
characteristics  and meet the aggregation  criteria of SFAS 131. The Company has
determined that there are five reportable  segments:  Principal U.S. Operations,
Principal Central European Operations,  Swiss R&D and Manufacturing  Operations,
Other Western European Operations and Other. Principal U.S. Operations represent
certain of the Company's  marketing and producing  organizations  located in the
United States.  Principal  Central European  Operations  primarily  includes the
Company's German marketing and producing  organizations that primarily serve the
German  market  and, to a lesser  extent,  Europe.  Swiss R&D and  Manufacturing
Operations  consist  of  the  organizations  located  in  Switzerland  that  are
responsible  for  the   development,   production  and  marketing  of  precision
instruments, including weighing, analytical and measurement technologies for use
in a variety of industrial and laboratory  applications.  Other Western European
Operations include the Company's market organizations in Western Europe that are
not included in Principal  Central  European  Operations.  The Company's  market
organizations are geographically  focused and are responsible for all aspects of
the  Company's  sales and service.  Operating  segments that exist outside these
reportable segments are included in Other.

         The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those
described  in the  summary  of  significant  accounting  policies.  The  Company
evaluates  performance  based on adjusted  operating  income  (gross profit less
research and development and selling, general

and  administrative  expenses  before  amortization  and  non-recurring  costs).
Intersegment  sales and transfers are priced to reflect  consideration of market
conditions  and the  regulations  of the  countries  in which  the  transferring
entities are located.  The following tables show the operations of the Company's
operating segments:




(a)    Other includes reporting units in Asia, Eastern Europe, Latin America and
       segments from other countries that do not meet the  aggregation  criteria
       of SFAS 131.
(b)    Eliminations  and  Corporate  includes the  elimination  of  intersegment
       transactions  as  well  as  certain  corporate   expenses,   intercompany
       investments and certain goodwill, which are not included in the Company's
       operating segments.
