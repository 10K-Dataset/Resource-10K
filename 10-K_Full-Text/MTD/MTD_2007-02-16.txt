PART I

Item 1.

Business

We are a leading global supplier of precision instruments and
    services. We have strong leadership positions in all of our
    businesses and believe in a majority of them, we hold global
    number one market positions. Specifically, we are the largest
    provider of weighing instruments for use in laboratory,
    industrial and food retailing applications. We are also a
    leading provider of analytical instruments for use in life
    science, reaction engineering and real-time analytic systems
    used in drug and chemical compound development, and process
    analytics instruments used for in-line measurement in production
    processes. In addition, we are the largest supplier of

end-of-line

inspection systems used in production and packaging for food,
    pharmaceutical and other industries.

Our business is geographically diversified, with sales in 2006
    derived 42% from Europe, 40% from North and South America and
    18% from Asia and other countries. Our customer base is also
    diversified by industry and by individual customer.

Mettler-Toledo International Inc. was incorporated as a Delaware
    corporation in 1991 and became a publicly traded company with
    its initial public offering in November 1997. In November 2001,
    we acquired Rainin Instrument, a leading manufacturer of
    pipetting solutions used in pharmaceutical, biotech and medical
    research applications.

Business
    Segments

We have five reportable segments: U.S. Operations, Swiss
    Operations, Western European Operations, Chinese Operations and
    Other. See Note 15 to the audited consolidated financial
    statements and Item 7. Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under
    “Results of Operations — by Operating
    Segment” for detailed results by segment and geographic
    region.

We manufacture a wide variety of precision instruments and
    provide value-added services to our customers. Our principal
    products and principal services are set forth below. We have
    followed this description of our products and services with
    descriptions of our customers and distribution, sales and
    service, research and development, manufacturing and other
    certain other matters. These descriptions apply to substantially
    all of our products and related segments.

Laboratory
    Instruments

We make a wide variety of precision laboratory instruments,
    including laboratory balances, pipettes, titrators, thermal
    analysis systems and other analytical instruments. The
    laboratory instruments business accounted for approximately 44%
    of our net sales in 2006.

Laboratory
    Balances

Our laboratory balances have weighing ranges from one
    ten-millionth of a gram up to 32 kilograms. To cover a wide
    range of customer needs and price points, we market our balances
    in a range of product tiers offering different levels of
    functionality. Based on the same technology platform, we also
    manufacture mass comparators, which are used by weights and
    measures regulators as well as laboratories to ensure the
    accuracy of reference weights.

Pipettes

Pipettes are used in laboratories for dispensing small volumes
    of liquids. We operate our pipette business with the Rainin
    brand name. Rainin develops, manufactures and distributes
    advanced pipettes, tips and accessories, including single and
    multi-channel manual and electronic pipettes. Rainin maintains
    service centers in the key markets where customers periodically
    send in their pipettes for certified recalibrations.
    Rainin’s principal end markets are pharmaceutical, biotech,
    clinical and academia.



Analytical
    Instruments

Titrators measure the chemical composition of samples and are
    used in laboratories as well as the food and beverage and other
    industries. Our high-end titrators are multi-tasking models,
    which can perform two determinations simultaneously on multiple
    vessels. Our offering includes robotics to automate routine work
    in quality control applications.

Thermal analysis systems measure material properties as a
    function of temperature, such as weight, dimension, energy flow
    and viscoelastic properties. Thermal analysis systems are used
    in nearly every industry, but primarily in the plastics and
    polymer industries and increasingly in the pharmaceutical
    industry.

pH meters measure acidity in laboratory samples. We also sell
    density and refractometry instruments, which measure chemical
    concentrations in solutions. In addition, we manufacture and
    sell moisture analyzers, which precisely determine the moisture
    content of a sample by utilizing an infrared dryer to evaporate
    moisture.

Laboratory
    Software

LabX, our PC-based laboratory software platform, manages and
    analyzes data generated by our titrators and balances. LabX
    provides full network capability, has efficient, intuitive
    protocols, and enables customers to collect and archive data in
    compliance with the U.S. Food and Drug
    Administration’s traceability requirements for
    electronically stored data (also known as 21 CFR
    Part 11). We plan to expand LabX to include other
    laboratory instruments.

Automated
    Chemistry Solutions

Our current Automated Chemistry solutions focus on key aspects
    of the drug development process. Our automated lab reactors, in
    situ analysis systems, and VirtualLab Informatics Suite are
    considered integral to the process development and

scale-up

activities of our customers. We provide systems for cleaning and
    purifying synthesized products for use in preclinical trials.
    Our on-line measurement technologies based on infrared and laser
    light enables customers to monitor chemical reactions and
    crystallization processes in the lab and plant. We believe that
    our portfolio of integrated technologies can bring significant
    efficiencies to the drug development process, enabling our
    customers to bring new drugs to market faster.

Process
    Analytics

Our process analytics business provides instruments for the
    in-line measurement of liquid parameters used primarily in the
    production process of pharmaceutical, biotech, beverage,
    microelectronics, and chemical companies. Approximately half of
    our process analytics sales are to the pharmaceutical and
    biotech markets, where our customers need fast and secure

scale-up

and
    production that meets the validation processes required for GMP
    (Good Manufacturing Processes) and other regulatory standards.
    We are a leading solution provider for liquid analytical
    measurement to control and optimize production processes. Our
    solutions include sensor technology for measuring pH, dissolved
    oxygen, carbon dioxide, conductivity, turbidity and total
    organic carbons and automated systems for calibration and
    cleaning of measurement points. Our instruments offer leading
    multi-parameter capabilities and plant-wide control system
    integration, which are key for integrated measurement of
    multiple parameters to secure production quality and efficiency.
    With a worldwide network of specialists, we support customers in
    critical process applications, compliance and systems
    integration questions.

Industrial
    Instruments

We manufacture numerous industrial weighing instruments and
    related terminals and offer dedicated software solutions for the
    pharmaceutical, chemical and food industries. In addition, we
    manufacture metal detection and other

end-of-line

inspection systems used in production and packaging. We supply
    automatic identification and data capture solutions, which
    integrate in-motion weighing, dimensioning and identification
    technologies for transport, shipping and logistics customers. We
    also offer heavy industrial scales and



related software. The industrial instruments business accounted
    for approximately 42% of our net sales in 2006.

Industrial
    Weighing Instruments

We offer a comprehensive line of industrial scales and balances,
    such as bench scales and floor scales, for weighing loads from a
    few grams to several thousand kilograms in applications ranging
    from measuring materials in chemical production to weighing mail
    and packages. Our products are used in a wide range of
    applications, such as counting applications and in formulating
    and mixing ingredients.

Industrial
    Terminals

Our industrial scale terminals collect data and integrate it
    into manufacturing processes, helping automate them. Our
    terminals allow users to remotely download programs or access
    setup data and can minimize down time through predictive rather
    than reactive maintenance.

Transportation
    and Logistics

We are a leading global supplier of automatic identification and
    data capture solutions, which integrate in-motion weighing,
    dimensioning and identification technologies. With these
    solutions, customers can measure the weight and cubic volume of
    packages for appropriate billing, logistics and quality control.
    Our solutions also integrate into customers’ information
    systems.

Vehicle Scale
    Systems

Our primary heavy industrial products are scales for weighing
    trucks or railcars (i.e., weighing bulk goods as they enter or
    leave a factory or at a toll station). Heavy industrial scales
    are capable of measuring weights up to 500 tons and permit
    accurate weighing under extreme environmental conditions. We
    also offer advanced computer software that can be used with our
    heavy industrial scales to facilitate a broad range of customer
    solutions and provides a complete system for managing vehicle
    transaction processing.

Industrial
    Software

We offer a wide range of software that can be used with our
    industrial instruments. Examples include FreeWeigh.Net,
    statistical quality control software, Formweigh.Net, our
    formulation/batching software, and OverDrive. FreeWeigh.Net and
    Formweigh.Net provide full network capability and enable
    customers to collect and archive data in compliance with
    21 CFR part 11. In addition, our Q.i365 software
    controls batching processes by monitoring the material transfer
    control process. Q.i365 also provides statistical, diagnostic
    and operational information for asset management, process
    control and database applications.

Product
    Inspection

Increasing safety and consumer protection requirements are
    driving the need for more and more sophisticated

end-of-line

inspection systems (e.g., for use in food processing and
    packaging, and pharmaceutical and other industries). We are a
    leading global provider of metal detectors, x-ray visioning
    equipment and checkweighers that are used in these industries.
    Metal detectors are most commonly used to detect fine particles
    of metal that may be contained in raw materials or may be
    generated by the manufacturing process itself. X-ray-based
    vision inspection helps detect non-metallic contamination, such
    as glass, stones and pits, which enter the manufacturing process
    for similar reasons. Our x-ray systems can also detect metal in
    metallized containers and can be used for mass control.
    Checkweighers are used to control the filling content of
    packaged goods such as food, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. Both
    x-ray and metal detection systems may be used together with
    checkweighers as components of integrated packaging lines.
    FreeWeigh.net is our statistical and quality control software
    that optimizes package filling, monitors weight-related data and
    integrates it in real time into customers’ enterprise
    resource planning

and/or

process control systems.



Retail Weighing
    Solutions

Supermarkets, hypermarkets and other food retail businesses make
    use of multiple weighing and food labeling solutions for
    handling fresh goods (such as meats, vegetables, fruits and
    cheeses). We offer stand-alone scales for basic counter weighing
    and pricing, price finding and printing. In addition, we offer
    networked scales and software, which can integrate backroom,
    counter, self-service and checkout functions and can incorporate
    fresh goods item data into a supermarket’s overall food
    item and inventory management system. Customer benefits are in
    the areas of pricing, merchandising, inventory management, and
    regulatory compliance. The retail business accounted for
    approximately 14% of our net sales in 2006.

Retail
    Software

Our subsidiary SofTechnics provides retail software for in-store
    item and inventory management solutions. SofTechnics’
    offering complements our retail weighing solutions to food
    retailers by providing the full scope of real-time item
    management. Retailers can then match local store inventory
    levels with local customer demand. As our traditional retail
    weighing business extends further into the area of information
    technology, the opportunity to cross-sell SofTechnics’
    software and services will expand. We continue to introduce
    SofTechnics software for the improved inventory management of
    fresh goods and plan to sell more complete and integrated data
    management solutions for fresh goods now and in the future.

Customers and
    Distribution

Our principal customers include companies in the following key
    end markets: the life science industry (pharmaceutical and
    biotech companies, as well as independent research
    organizations); food producers; food retailers; the beverage
    industry; specialty chemicals and cosmetics companies; the
    transportation and logistics industry; the metals industry; the
    electronics industry; and the academic community.

Our products are sold through a variety of distribution
    channels. Generally, more technically sophisticated products are
    sold through our direct sales force, while less complicated
    products are sold through indirect channels. Our sales through
    direct channels exceed our sales through indirect channels. A
    significant portion of our sales in the Americas is generated
    through the indirect channels, including sales of our
    “Ohaus” branded products. Ohaus branded products
    principally target the educational market and other markets in
    which customers are interested in lower cost, a more limited set
    of features and less comprehensive support and service. We have
    a diversified customer base, with no single customer accounting
    for more than 2% of 2006 net sales.

Sales and
    Service

Market
    Organizations

We maintain geographically focused market organizations around
    the world that are responsible for all aspects of our sales and
    service. The market organizations are local marketing and
    service organizations designed to maintain close relationships
    with our customers. Each market organization has the flexibility
    to adapt its marketing and service efforts to account for
    different cultural and economic conditions. Market organizations
    also work closely with our producing organizations (described
    below) by providing feedback on manufacturing and product
    development initiatives and relaying new product and application
    ideas.

We have one of the largest and broadest global sales and service
    organizations among precision instrument manufacturers. At
    December 31, 2006, our sales and services group consisted
    of over 3,600 employees in sales, marketing and customer service
    (including related administration) and post-sales technical
    service, located in 35 countries. This field organization has
    the capability to provide service and support to our customers
    and distributors in major markets across the globe. This is
    important because our customers are seeking to do more and more
    business with a consistent global approach.



Service

We have expanded our service business from one focused on repair
    and maintenance to one driven by regulatory compliance and other
    value-added services. We have a unique offering to our
    pharmaceutical customers in promoting use of our instruments in
    compliance with FDA regulations and we can provide these
    services regardless of the customer’s location around the
    world. This global service network is also an important factor
    in our ability to expand in emerging markets. We estimate that
    we have the largest installed base of weighing instruments in
    the world. In 2006, service (representing service contracts,
    repairs and replacement parts) accounted for approximately 23%
    of our total net sales. A significant portion of this amount is
    derived from the sale of replacement parts.

Beyond revenue opportunities, we believe service is a key part
    of our solution offering and helps significantly in customer
    retention. The close relationships and frequent contact with our
    large customer base provides us with sales opportunities and
    innovative product and application ideas.

Research and
    Development and Manufacturing

Producing
    Organizations

Our research, product development and manufacturing efforts are
    organized into a number of producing organizations. Our focused
    producing organizations help reduce product development time and
    costs, improve customer focus and maintain technological
    leadership. The producing organizations work together to share
    ideas and best practices, and there is a close interface and
    coordinated customer interaction among marketing organizations
    and producing organizations.

Research and
    Development

We intend to continue to invest in product innovation in order
    to provide technologically advanced products to our customers
    for existing and new applications. Over the last three years, we
    have invested $247.9 million in research and development
    ($82.8 million in 2006, $81.9 million in 2005, and
    $83.2 million in 2004). In 2006, we spent approximately
    5.2% of net sales on research and development. Our research and
    development efforts fall into two categories:

•

technology advancements, which increase the value of our
    products. These advancements may be in the form of enhanced
    functionality, new applications for our technologies, more
    accurate or reliable measurement, additional software capability
    or automation through robotics or other means, and

•

cost reductions, which reduce the manufacturing cost of our
    products through better overall design.

We continue to devote an increasing proportion of our research
    and development budget to software development. This includes
    software to process the signals captured by the sensors of our
    instruments, application-specific software, and software that
    connects our solutions into customers’ existing IT systems.
    We closely integrate research and development with marketing,
    manufacturing and product engineering. We have over 800
    employees in research and development and product engineering.

Manufacturing

We are a worldwide manufacturer, with facilities principally
    located in China, Germany, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and
    the United States. Laboratory instruments are produced mainly in
    Switzerland and to a lesser extent in the United States and
    China, while our remaining products are manufactured worldwide.
    We emphasize product quality in our manufacturing operations,
    and most of our products require very strict tolerances and
    exact specifications. We use an extensive quality control system
    that is integrated into each step of the manufacturing process.
    All major manufacturing facilities have achieved ISO 9001
    certification. We believe that our manufacturing capacity is
    sufficient to meet our present and currently anticipated demand.

We generally manufacture only critical components, which are
    components that contain proprietary technology. When outside
    manufacturing is more efficient, we contract with other
    manufacturers for certain non-proprietary components. We use a
    wide range of suppliers. We believe our supply arrangements are



adequate and that there are no material constraints on the
    sources and availability of materials. From time to time we may
    rely on a single supplier for all of our requirements of a
    particular component. Supply arrangements for electronic
    components are generally made globally.

Backlog;
    Seasonality

Our manufacturing turnaround time is generally short, which
    permits us to manufacture orders to fill for most of our
    products. Backlog is generally a function of requested customer
    delivery dates and is typically no longer than one to two months.

Our business has historically experienced a slight amount of
    seasonal variation, particularly the high-end laboratory
    instruments business. Traditionally, sales in the first quarter
    are slightly lower than, and sales in the fourth quarter are
    slightly higher than sales in the second and third quarters.
    Fourth quarter sales have historically generated approximately

27-29%

of
    our net sales. This trend has a somewhat greater effect on
    income from operations than on net sales because fixed costs are
    spread evenly across all quarters.

Employees

As of December 31, 2006, we had approximately 9,100
    employees throughout the world, including approximately 4,100 in
    Europe, 3,000 in North and South America, and 2,000 in Asia and
    other countries.

We believe our employee relations are good, and we have not
    suffered any material employee work stoppage or strike during
    the last five years, except for a strike in early 2003 at our
    Bethune, France facility, which has been closed. Labor unions do
    not represent a meaningful number of our employees.

Intellectual
    Property

We hold over 1,700 patents and trademarks, primarily in the
    United States, Switzerland, Germany, the United Kingdom, France,
    Japan and China. Our products generally incorporate a wide
    variety of technological innovations, some of which are
    protected by patents of various durations. Products are
    generally not protected as a whole by individual patents, and as
    a result, no one patent or group of related patents is material
    to our business. We have numerous trademarks, including the
    Mettler-Toledo name and logo, which are material to our
    business. We regularly protect against infringement of our
    intellectual property.

Regulation

Our products are subject to various regulatory standards and
    approvals by weights and measures regulatory authorities. All of
    our electrical components are subject to electrical safety
    standards. We believe that we are in compliance in all material
    respects with applicable regulations.

Approvals are required to ensure our instruments do not
    impermissibly influence other instruments, and are themselves
    not affected by other instruments. In addition, some of our
    products are used in “legal for trade” applications,
    in which prices based on weight are calculated, and for which
    specific weights and measures approvals are required. Although
    there are a large number of regulatory agencies across our
    markets, there is an increasing trend toward harmonization of
    standards, and weights and measures regulation is harmonized
    across the European Union.

Our products may also be subject to special requirements
    depending on the end-user and market. For example, laboratory
    customers are typically subject to Good Laboratory Practices
    (GLP), industrial customers to Good Manufacturing Practices
    (GMP), pharmaceutical customers to U.S. Food and Drug
    Administration (FDA) regulations, and customers in food
    processing industries may be subject to Hazard Analysis and
    Critical Control Point (HACCP) regulations. Products used in
    hazardous environments may also be subject to special
    requirements.



Environmental
    Matters

We are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the
    jurisdictions in which we operate. We own or lease a number of
    properties and manufacturing facilities around the world. Like
    many of our competitors, we have incurred, and will continue to
    incur, capital and operating expenditures and other costs in
    complying with such laws and regulations.

We are currently involved in, or have potential liability with
    respect to, the remediation of past contamination in certain of
    our facilities. Our subsidiary Mettler-Toledo Hi-Speed, Inc.
    (“Hi-Speed”) is one of two private parties ordered to
    perform certain ground water contamination monitoring under an
    administrative consent order that the New Jersey Department of
    Environmental Protection (“NJDEP”) signed on
    June 13, 1988 with respect to certain property in Landing,
    New Jersey. GEI International Corporation (“GEI”) is
    the other ordered party. GEI has failed to fulfill its
    obligations under the NJDEP consent order, and NJDEP has agreed
    with Hi-Speed that the residual ground water contaminants can be
    monitored through the establishment of a Classification
    Exception Area and concurrent Well Restriction Area for the
    site. The NJDEP does not view these vehicles as remedial
    measures, but rather as “institutional controls” that
    must be adequately maintained and periodically evaluated. We
    estimate that the costs of compliance associated with monitoring
    ground water contamination levels at the site will be
    approximately $0.7 million in the coming years.

In addition, certain of our present and former facilities have
    or had been in operation for many decades and, over such time,
    some of these facilities may have used substances or generated
    and disposed of wastes which are or may be considered hazardous.
    It is possible that these sites, as well as disposal sites owned
    by third parties to which we have sent wastes, may in the future
    be identified and become the subject of remediation. Although we
    believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable
    environmental requirements and, to date, we have not incurred
    material expenditures in connection with environmental matters,
    it is possible that we could become subject to additional
    environmental liabilities in the future that could have a
    material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of
    operations or cash flows.

Competition

Our markets are highly competitive. Weighing and analytical
    instruments markets are fragmented both geographically and by
    application, particularly the industrial and food retailing
    markets. As a result, we face numerous regional or specialized
    competitors, many of which are well established in their
    markets. In addition, some of our competitors are divisions of
    larger companies with potentially greater financial and other
    resources than our own. Taken together, the competitive forces
    present in our markets can impair our operating margins in
    certain product lines and geographic markets.

We expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and
    performance of their products and to introduce new products with
    competitive prices. Although we believe that we have
    technological and other competitive advantages over many of our
    competitors, we may not be able to realize and maintain these
    advantages. These advantages include our worldwide market
    leadership positions; our global brand and reputation; our track
    record of technological innovation; our comprehensive,
    high-quality solution offering; our global sales and service
    offering; our large installed base of weighing instruments; and
    the diversification of our revenue base by geographic region,
    product range and customer. To remain competitive, we must
    continue to invest in research and development, sales and
    marketing and customer service and support. We cannot be sure
    that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make these
    investments or that we will be successful in identifying,
    developing and maintaining any competitive advantages.

We believe the principal competitive factors in developed
    markets for purchasing decisions are the product itself,
    application support, service support and price. In emerging
    markets, where there is greater demand for less sophisticated
    products, price is a more important factor than in developed
    markets. Competition in the U.S. laboratory market is also
    influenced by the presence of large distributors that sell not
    only our products but those of our competitors as well.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

Factors affecting
    our future operating results

We are subject to
    certain risks associated with our international operations and
    fluctuating conditions in emerging markets.

We conduct business in many countries, including emerging
    markets in Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe and these
    operations represent a significant potion of our sales and
    earnings. For example our Chinese Operations account for
    $132.7 million of sales to external customers and
    $45.2 million of segment profit. In addition to the
    currency risks discussed below, international operations pose
    other substantial risks and problems for us. For instance,
    various local jurisdictions in which we operate may revise or
    alter their respective legal and regulatory requirements. In
    addition, we may encounter one or more of the following
    obstacles or risks:

•

tariffs and trade barriers;

•

difficulties in staffing and managing local operations,

and/or

mandatory salary increases for local employees;

•

credit risks arising from financial difficulties facing local
    customers and distributors;

•

difficulties in protecting intellectual property;

•

nationalization of private enterprises may result in the
    confiscation of assets as we hold significant assets around the
    world in the form of property, plant and equipment, inventory
    and accounts receivable, as well as $55 million of cash at
    December 31, 2006 in our Chinese subsidiaries;

•

restrictions on investments

and/or

limitations regarding foreign ownership;

•

adverse tax consequences, including imposition or increase of
    withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by
    subsidiaries; and

•

other uncertain local economic, political and social conditions,
    including hyper-inflationary conditions, or periods of low or no
    productivity growth.

We must also comply with a variety of regulations regarding the
    conversion and repatriation of funds earned in local currencies.
    For example, converting earnings from our operations in China
    into other currencies and repatriating these funds require
    governmental approvals. If we cannot comply with these or other
    applicable regulations, we may face increased difficulties in
    utilizing cash flow generated by these operations outside of
    China.

Economic conditions in emerging markets have from time to time
    deteriorated significantly, and some emerging markets are
    experiencing recessionary trends, severe currency devaluations
    and inflationary prices. Moreover, economic problems in
    individual markets can spread to other economies, adding to the
    adverse conditions we face in emerging markets. We remain
    committed to emerging markets, particularly those in Asia, Latin
    America and Eastern Europe. However, we expect the fluctuating
    economic conditions will affect our results of operations in
    these markets for the foreseeable future.

We operate in
    highly competitive markets, and it may be difficult to preserve
    operating margins, gain market share and maintain a
    technological advantage.

Our markets are highly competitive. Weighing and analytical
    instruments markets are also fragmented both geographically and
    by application, particularly the industrial and food retailing
    markets. As a result, we face numerous regional or specialized
    competitors, many of whom are well established in their markets.
    In addition, some of our competitors are divisions of larger
    companies with potentially greater financial and other resources
    than our company. Taken together, the competitive forces present
    in our markets can impair our operating margins in certain
    product lines and geographic markets. We expect our competitors
    to continue to improve the design and performance of their
    products and to introduce new products with



competitive prices. Although we believe that we have certain
    technological and other advantages over our competitors, we may
    not be able to realize and maintain these advantages.

Our product
    development efforts may not produce commercially viable products
    in a timely manner.

We must introduce new products and enhancements in a timely
    manner, or our products could become technologically obsolete
    over time, which would harm our operating results. To remain
    competitive, we must continue to make significant investments in
    research and development, sales and marketing, and customer
    service and support. We cannot be sure that we will have
    sufficient resources to continue to make these investments. In
    developing new products, we may be required to make substantial
    investments before we can determine their commercial viability.
    As a result, we may not be successful in developing new products
    and we may never realize the benefits of our research and
    development activities.

Our ability to
    deliver products and services may be disrupted.

An interruption in our business due to acts such as natural
    disasters, fires, explosions, or issues with the supply chain
    may cause us to temporarily be unable to deliver products or
    services to our customers. It may be expensive to resolve these
    issues, even though we hold certain insurance. More importantly,
    customers may switch to competitors and may not return to us
    even if we resolve the interruption.

A prolonged
    downturn or additional consolidation in the pharmaceutical,
    food, food retailing and chemicals industries could adversely
    affect our operating results.

Our products are used extensively in the pharmaceutical, food
    and beverage and chemical industries. Consolidation in the
    pharmaceutical and chemicals industries hurt our sales in prior
    years. A prolonged downturn or additional consolidation in any
    of these industries could adversely affect our operating
    results. In addition, the capital spending policies of our
    customers in these industries are based on a variety of factors
    we cannot control, including the resources available for
    purchasing equipment, the spending priorities among various
    types of equipment and policies regarding capital expenditures.
    Any decrease or delay in capital spending by our customers would
    cause our revenues to decline and could harm our profitability.

We may face risks
    associated with future acquisitions.

We may pursue acquisitions of complementary product lines,
    technologies or businesses. Acquisitions involve numerous risks,
    including difficulties in the assimilation of the acquired
    operations, technologies and products; diversion of
    management’s attention from other business concerns; and
    potential departures of key employees of the acquired company.
    If we successfully identify acquisitions in the future,
    completing such acquisitions may result in: new issuances of our
    stock that may be dilutive to current owners; increases in our
    debt and contingent liabilities; and additional amortization
    expenses related to intangible assets. Any of these
    acquisition-related risks could have a material adverse affect
    on our profitability.

Larger companies have identified life sciences and instruments
    as businesses they will consider entering, which could change
    the competitive dynamics of these markets. In addition, we may
    not be able to identify, successfully complete or integrate
    potential acquisitions in the future. However, even if we can do
    so, we cannot be sure that these acquisitions will have a
    positive impact on our business or operating results.

If we cannot
    protect our intellectual property rights, or if we infringe or
    misappropriate the proprietary rights of others, our operating
    results could be harmed.

Our success depends on our ability to obtain and enforce patents
    on our technology and to protect our trade secrets. Our patents
    may not provide complete protection, and competitors may develop
    similar products that are not covered by our patents. Our
    patents may also be challenged by third parties and invalidated
    or narrowed. Although we take measures to protect confidential
    information, improper use or disclosure of our trade secrets may
    still occur.



We may be sued for infringing on the intellectual property
    rights of others. The cost of any litigation could affect our
    profitability regardless of the outcome, and management
    attention could be diverted. If we are unsuccessful in such
    litigation, we may have to pay damages, stop the infringing
    activity

and/or

obtain a license. If we fail to obtain a required license, we
    may be unable to sell some of our products, which could result
    in a decline in our revenues.

Departures of key
    employees could impair our operations.

We have employment contracts with each of our key employees. In
    addition, our key employees own shares of our common stock

and/or

have
    options to purchase additional shares. Nevertheless, such
    individuals could leave the Company. If any key employees
    stopped working for us, our operations could be harmed. We have
    no key man life insurance policies with respect to any of our
    senior executives.

We may be
    adversely affected by environmental laws and
    regulations.

We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations,
    including those relating to: air emissions; wastewater
    discharges; the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous
    wastes; and the remediation of contamination associated with the
    use and disposal of hazardous substances.

We incur expenditures in complying with environmental laws and
    regulations. We are currently involved in, or have potential
    liability with respect to, the remediation of past contamination
    in various facilities. In addition, some of our facilities are
    or have been in operation for many decades and may have used
    substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are
    hazardous or may be considered hazardous in the future. These
    sites and disposal sites owned by others to which we sent waste
    may in the future be identified as contaminated and require
    remediation. Accordingly, it is possible that we could become
    subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future
    that may harm our results of operations or financial condition.

We may be
    adversely affected by failure to comply with regulations of
    governmental agencies.

Our products are subject to regulation by governmental agencies.
    These regulations govern a wide variety of activities relating
    to our products, from design and development, to labeling,
    manufacturing, promotion, sales and distribution. If we fail to
    comply with these regulations, we may have to recall products
    and cease their manufacture and distribution. In addition, we
    could be subject to fines or criminal prosecution.

We may experience
    impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets.

As of December 31, 2006, our consolidated balance sheet
    included goodwill of $432.9 million and other intangible
    assets of $102.8 million.

Our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other
    intangible assets, which affect the amount of future period
    amortization expense and possible impairment expense that we
    will incur. The determination of the value of such intangible
    assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions
    that affect our consolidated financial statements.

In accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and
    Other Intangible Assets” (“SFAS 142”), our
    goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not
    amortized, but are evaluated for impairment annually in the
    fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired. The
    evaluation is based on valuation models that estimate fair value
    based on expected future cash flows and profitability
    projections. In preparing the valuation models we consider a
    number of factors, including operating results, business plans,
    economic conditions, future cash flows, and transactions and
    market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to
    these factors and our judgment in applying them to the
    impairment analyses. The significant estimates and assumptions
    within our fair value models include sales growth, controllable
    cost growth, perpetual growth, effective tax rates and discount
    rates. Our assessments to date have indicated that there has
    been no impairment of these assets.



Should any of these estimates or assumptions change, or should
    we incur lower than expected operating performance or cash
    flows, we may experience a triggering event that requires a new
    fair value assessment for our reporting units, possibly prior to
    the required annual assessment. These types of events and
    resulting analysis could result in impairment charges for
    goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets if the
    fair value estimate declines below the carrying value.

Our amortization expense related to intangible assets with
    finite lives may materially change should our estimates of their
    useful lives change.

Unanticipated
    changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax
    liabilities could impact our profitability.

We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and
    various other foreign jurisdictions, and our domestic and
    international tax liabilities are subject to allocation of
    expenses among different jurisdictions. Our effective tax rates
    could be adversely affected by: changes in the mix of earnings
    by jurisdiction; changes in tax laws or tax rates; changes in
    the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities; and
    material adjustments from tax audits.

In particular, the carrying value of deferred tax assets, which
    are predominantly in the U.S., is dependent upon our ability to
    generate future taxable income in the U.S. In addition, the
    amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in
    various jurisdictions and a material assessment by a governing
    tax authority could affect our profitability.

Currency
    fluctuations may affect our operating profits.

Because we conduct operations in many countries, our operating
    income can be significantly affected by fluctuations in currency
    exchange rates. Swiss franc-denominated expenses represent a
    much greater percentage of our operating expenses than Swiss
    franc-denominated sales represent of our net sales. In part,
    this is because most of our manufacturing costs in Switzerland
    relate to products that are sold outside Switzerland. Moreover,
    a substantial percentage of our research and development
    expenses and general and administrative expenses are incurred in
    Switzerland. Therefore, if the Swiss franc strengthens against
    all or most of our major trading currencies (e.g

.

, the
    U.S. dollar, the euro, other major European currencies and
    the Japanese yen), our operating profit is reduced. We also have
    significantly more sales in European currencies (other than the
    Swiss franc) than we have expenses in those currencies.
    Therefore, when European currencies weaken against the
    U.S. dollar and the Swiss franc, it also decreases our
    operating profits. Accordingly, the Swiss franc exchange rate to
    the euro is an important cross-rate monitored by the Company. We
    estimate that a 1% strengthening of the Swiss franc against the
    euro would result in a decrease in our earnings before tax of
    approximately $1.0 million on an annual basis. In addition
    to the effects of exchange rate movements on operating profits,
    our debt levels can fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates,
    particularly between the U.S. dollar and the Swiss franc.
    Based on our outstanding debt at December 31, 2006, we
    estimate that a 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar against
    the currencies in which our debt is denominated would result in
    an increase of approximately $22.9 million in the reported
    U.S. dollar value of the debt.

We have
    substantial debt and we may incur substantially more debt, which
    could affect our ability to meet our debt obligations and may
    otherwise restrict our activities.

We have substantial debt and we may incur substantial additional
    debt in the future. As of December 31, 2006, we had total
    indebtedness of approximately $204.4 million, net of cash
    of $151.3 million. We are also permitted by the terms of
    our debt instruments to incur substantial additional
    indebtedness, subject to the restrictions therein.

Our debt could have important consequences. For example, it
    could: make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations
    under our debt instruments; require us to dedicate a substantial
    portion of our cash flow to payments on our indebtedness, which
    would reduce the amount of cash flow available to fund working
    capital, capital expenditures, product development and other
    corporate requirements; increase our vulnerability to general
    adverse economic and industry conditions, including changes in
    raw material costs;



limit our ability to respond to business opportunities; limit
    our ability to borrow additional funds, which may be necessary;
    and subject us to financial and other restrictive covenants,
    which, if we fail to comply with these covenants and our failure
    is not waived or cured, could result in an event of default
    under our debt.

The agreements
    governing our debt impose restrictions on our
    business.

The indenture governing our senior notes and the agreements
    governing our credit facility contain covenants imposing various
    restrictions on our business. These restrictions may affect our
    ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to
    take advantage of potential business opportunities as they
    arise. The restrictions these covenants place on us include
    limitations on our ability to: enter into sale and leaseback
    arrangements; incur liens; and consolidate, merge, sell or lease
    all or substantially all of our assets. Our credit facility also
    requires us to meet certain financial ratios.

Our ability to comply with these agreements may be affected by
    events beyond our control, including prevailing economic,
    financial and industry conditions, and are subject to the risks
    in this section. The breach of any of these covenants or
    restrictions could result in a default under the indenture
    governing the senior notes

and/or

under
    our credit facility. An event of default under our credit
    facility would permit our lenders to declare all amounts
    borrowed from them to be immediately due and payable.
    Acceleration of our other indebtedness may cause us to be unable
    to make interest payments on the senior notes and repay the
    principal amount of the senior notes.

Our ability to
    generate cash depends on factors beyond our control.

Our ability to make payments on our debt and to fund planned
    capital expenditures and research and development efforts will
    depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to
    an extent, is subject to general economic, financial,
    competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors,
    including those described in this section, that are beyond our
    control.

We cannot ensure that our business will generate sufficient cash
    flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available
    to us under our credit facility in an amount sufficient to
    enable us to pay our debt, or to fund our other liquidity needs.
    We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on
    or before maturity. We cannot ensure that we will be able to
    refinance any of our debt, including our credit facility and the
    senior notes, on commercially reasonable terms or at all.

    owners of common stock held in street name.

Dividend
    Policy

Historically we have not paid dividends on our common stock.
    However, we will evaluate this policy on a periodic basis taking
    into account our results of operations, financial condition,

We have a share repurchase program, under which we have been
    authorized to buy back up to $900 million of the
    company’s common shares. We have purchased 9.6 million
    shares since the inception of the program through
    December 31, 2006, at a total cost of $534.3 million.
    As of December 31, 2006, there was $365.7 million
    remaining authorized for repurchases under the plan by
    December 31, 2008. The share repurchases are expected to be
    funded from cash balances, borrowings and cash generated from
    operating activities. Repurchases will be made through open
    market transactions, and the timing will depend on the level of
    acquisition activity, business and market conditions, the stock
    price, trading restrictions and other factors.

During the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, we spent
    $265.9 million and $164.6 million on the repurchase of
    4,141,559 shares and 3,229,200 shares at an average
    price of $64.18 and $50.94, respectively.

    to headcount reductions and manufacturing transfers.



Item 7.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

The following discussion and analysis of our financial
    condition and results of operations should be read together with
    our audited consolidated financial statements.

Overview

We operate a global business, with sales that are diversified by
    geographic region, product range and customer. We hold leading
    positions worldwide in many of our markets and attribute this
    leadership to several factors, including the strength of our
    brand name and reputation, our comprehensive offering of
    innovative instruments and solutions, and the breadth and
    quality of our global sales and service network.

Net sales in U.S. dollars increased by 8% and 6% in 2006
    and 2005, respectively. Excluding the effect of currency
    exchange rate fluctuations, or in local currencies, net sales
    increased 7% and 5% in 2006 and 2005, respectively. We enjoyed
    an improved world economy in 2006 compared to recent years with
    improved market conditions in Europe, continued solid growth in
    the United States and generally strong demand in most Asian
    countries.

In respect to our end user markets, we experienced improved
    results during 2006 in our laboratory-related end user markets,
    such as pharmaceutical and biotech customers as well as the
    laboratories of chemical companies, food and beverage companies
    and universities. We believe that the long-term fundamentals of
    the pharmaceutical and biotech markets are particularly
    attractive and our solutions assist these companies in enhancing
    their productivity as they meet the challenges of new drug
    approval activity, heightened price regulation and industry
    consolidation.

In our industrial markets, the principal growth driver in recent
    years has been increased investment in China related to
    production capacity. Although this provides a significant
    opportunity for our Chinese operations, this manufacturing shift
    has a negative impact on certain of our industrial end user
    markets in the U.S. and Europe. However despite this challenge,
    our U.S. and European industrial end user markets experienced
    solid sales growth during 2006.

In our food retail end markets, we experienced strong results in
    both Europe and the U.S. related to increased project
    activity. Traditionally the spending levels in this sector have
    experienced more volatility than our other customer sectors.
    Increased spending in the past has come from events such as Y2K
    and the introduction of the euro currency. While we have not
    experienced similar triggering events in recent years, we have
    enjoyed strong overall demand in 2006. Similar to our industrial
    business, China also provides growth as the expansion of their
    local economy is creating a significant number of new retail
    stores each year.



In 2007, we expect to continue to pursue the overall business
    growth strategies which we have followed in recent years:

Gaining Market Share.

Our global sales and
    marketing initiative, “Spinnaker”, continues to be an
    important growth strategy. We aim to achieve above market sales
    growth by improving the productivity and effectiveness of our
    global sales and marketing processes. While this initiative is
    broad based, efforts to improve these processes include
    increased segment marketing and leads generation activities, the
    implementation of more effective pricing strategies and
    processes and further automation of field processes. Our
    comprehensive service offering also helps us further penetrate
    developed markets. In addition to traditional services, we offer
    installation, calibration, regulatory compliance services and
    remote service support.

Expanding Emerging Markets.

We have a
    two-pronged strategy in emerging markets: first, to capitalize
    on growth opportunities in these markets and second, to leverage
    our low-cost manufacturing operations in China. We have nearly a
    20 year track record in China, and our sales in Asia have
    grown more than 10% per year in local currency since 1999.
    We have broadened our product offering to the Asian markets and
    are benefiting as multinational customers shift production to
    China. We are shifting more of our manufacturing to China to
    reduce costs, where our three facilities manufacture for the
    local markets as well as for export. We are also experiencing
    rapid growth in India from increased life science research
    activities, as well as our acquisition of our distribution
    channel for laboratory products in 2005. In addition, Russia
    continues to be an important growth driver due in part to the
    expansion of their local economy.

Extending Our Technology Lead.

We continue to
    focus on product innovation. In the last three years, we spent
    between 5.2% and 5.9% of net sales on research and development.
    We seek to drive shorter product life cycles, as well as improve
    our product offerings and their capabilities with additional
    integrated technologies and software. In addition, we aim to
    create value for our customers by having an intimate knowledge
    of their processes via our significant installed product base.

Maintaining Cost Leadership.

We continue to
    strive to improve our margins by reducing our cost structure. As
    previously mentioned, shifting production to China has been an
    important component of our cost savings initiatives. We have
    also implemented global procurement and supply chain management
    programs over the last several years aimed at lowering supply
    costs. Our cost leadership initiatives are also focused on
    continuously improving our invested capital efficiency, such as
    reducing our working capital levels and ensuring appropriate
    returns on our expenditures.

Pursuing Strategic Acquisitions.

While we have
    not completed a significant acquisition since 2001, acquisitions
    remain part of our growth strategy. We seek to pursue
    acquisitions that may leverage our global sales and service
    network, respected brand, extensive distribution channels and
    technological leadership. We have identified life sciences,
    product inspection and process analytics as three key areas for
    acquisitions.

Results of
    Operations — Consolidated

Net
    sales

Net sales were $1,594.9 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2006, compared to $1,482.5 million in
    2005 and $1,404.5 million in 2004. This represents
    increases in 2006 and 2005 of 8% and 6% in U.S. dollars and
    7% and 5% in local currencies, respectively.

In 2006, our net sales by geographic destination increased in
    local currencies by 5% in the Americas, 7% in Europe and 10% in
    Asia/Rest of World. A discussion of sales by operating segment
    is included below.

As described in Note 15 to our consolidated financial
    statements, our net sales comprise product sales of precision
    instruments and related services. Service revenues are primarily
    derived from regulatory compliance qualification, calibration,
    certification and repair services, much of which is provided
    under contracts, as well as sales of spare parts.

Net sales of products increased in 2006 and 2005 by 8% and 6% in
    U.S. dollars and by 7% and 6% in local currencies,
    respectively. Service revenue (including spare parts) increased
    in 2006 and 2005 by 8% and 5% in U.S. dollars and by 7% and
    5% in local currencies, respectively.



Net sales for our laboratory-related products increased 6% in
    local currencies during 2006 with strong growth in process
    analytics, laboratory balances and analytical instruments.

Net sales of our industrial-related products increased 6% in
    2006 in local currencies. We experienced sales growth in our
    core industrial products, most notably our heavy industrial and
    standard industrial weighing products, as well as our product
    inspection products, especially x-ray products.

In our food retailing markets, net sales increased 11% in 2006
    in local currencies over the previous year due to increased
    sales across all geographic regions, particularly in Europe and
    the U.S., related to strong project activity. The food retailing
    markets also continue to experience improved growth of software
    solutions.

Gross
    profit

Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 49.6% for 2006,
    compared to 49.3% for 2005 and 48.6% for 2004.

Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for products was 53.3%
    for 2006, compared to 53.2% for 2005 and 52.3% for 2004. Gross
    profit as a percentage of net sales for services (including
    spare parts) was 36.9% for 2006, compared to 36.0% for 2005 and
    36.1% for 2004.

The increase in gross profit percentage reflects benefits from
    our sales volume leveraging our fixed production costs, our cost
    rationalization initiatives and the impact of increased pricing.
    These trends were offset in part by unfavorable product mix and
    lower margin project activity.

Research and
    development and selling, general and administrative
    expenses

Research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales
    were 5.2% for 2006, compared to 5.5% for 2005 and 5.9% in 2004.
    Research and development expenses increased by 1% in 2006 and
    decreased by 2% in 2005 in local currencies. Our research and
    development spending levels reflect improved productivity, the
    timing of projects and our desire to reallocate research and
    development resources to marketing.

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of
    net sales increased to 30.2% for 2006, compared to 29.8% for
    2005 and 29.9% for 2004. Selling, general and administrative
    expenses increased 9% in 2006 and 5% in 2005 in local
    currencies. This increase is due in part to share-based
    compensation expense in 2006 of $8.2 million, sales and
    marketing investments, particularly in China, higher performance
    related compensation as well as charges associated with our cost
    reduction programs in 2006. During 2004, we incurred
    $5.0 million related to an investigation into allegations
    made by an employee with respect to the Company and various
    Company processes.

Other (income)
    charges, net

Other (income) charges, net consisted of other income, net of
    $7.9 million in 2006, compared to other charges, net of
    $20.2 million in 2005 and $0.1 million in 2004. Other
    (income) charges, net consisted primarily of interest income,
    (gains) losses from foreign currency transactions, (gains)
    losses from sales of assets and other items. In 2006, other
    (income) charges, net includes increased interest income
    associated with higher cash balances in the U.S. as a
    result of our foreign earnings repatriation during 2005
    associated with the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. During
    2005, other (income) charges, net also included a
    $21.8 million charge related to litigation. We wrote off a
    $19.9 million intangible asset relating to an intellectual
    property license that was subject to litigation with the grantor
    in June 2005. This license enabled one of our wholly owned
    subsidiaries exclusive rights to distribute certain third-party
    manufactured pipettes in the United States. A judgment entered
    on June 6, 2005 terminated the license agreement and
    awarded damages to the other party. We also incurred
    $1.9 million of related legal costs during 2005, which
    included damages of $0.6 million. The damages of
    $0.6 million were subsequently reversed during 2006.



Interest expense
    and taxes

Interest expense was $17.5 million for 2006, compared to
    $14.9 million for 2005 and $12.9 million for 2004. The
    increase in 2006 and 2005 was principally due to higher average
    borrowings over the prior year due to our increased debt balance
    in Europe as a result of our foreign earnings repatriation
    during 2005 associated with the American Jobs Creation Act of
    2004.

During the third quarter of 2006, we implemented a legal
    reorganization that resulted in a reduction of the estimated
    annual effective tax rate before discrete items from 30% to 27%.
    In addition to the change in our annual effective tax rate, we
    recorded three discrete tax items: a charge of
    $10.5 million related to the establishment of a valuation
    allowance on foreign tax credit carryforwards, a benefit of
    $13.4 million associated with a reduction of a liability
    previously established for estimated costs to repatriate
    unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries, and a favorable tax
    law change resulting in a benefit of $5.1 million.

Pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, we
    repatriated $396 million of cash during 2005 that was
    generated over time by our foreign operations. As a result of
    this repatriation, we recorded additional income tax expense of
    $13.1 million. This amount reflects the federal tax impact
    in the United States (including certain state taxes) of
    $12.3 million, foreign withholding taxes of
    $2.0 million and a net decrease of $1.2 million of
    deferred tax liabilities associated with the reassessment of
    pre-existing and future dividend repatriations. In addition, we
    recorded tax benefits of $7.7 million related to the
    favorable resolution of certain tax matters. Our tax rate for
    2005 also included a tax benefit associated with the previously
    described litigation.

Excluding the tax effects of the previously described discrete
    tax items, our annual effective tax rate would have been 27%,
    30% and 30% for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Including
    these items, our annual effective tax rate was 23%, 32% and 30%
    for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Earnings before
    taxes and net earnings

Earnings before taxes were $204.8 million for 2006,
    compared to $160.2 million in 2005 and $154.2 million
    in 2004. Net earnings were $157.5 million for 2006,
    compared to $108.9 million in 2005 and $108.0 million
    in 2004.

The 2006 results included $8.2 million of share-based
    compensation expense ($5.5 million after tax). Net earnings
    in 2006 also included the previously described discrete tax
    items amounting to a $8.0 million net benefit. The 2005
    results included a one-time $21.8 million
    ($13.1 million after tax) charge related to the litigation
    described above. Net earnings in 2005 also included a
    $5.4 million net after tax expense related to the
    previously described discrete tax items. The 2004 results
    included $5.0 million ($3.5 million after tax) related
    to the previously mentioned investigation. The increase in net
    earnings excluding these items primarily reflected improved
    sales volume leveraging our fixed production costs, benefits
    from our cost rationalization initiatives and a reduced tax rate
    in 2006.

Net earnings per diluted share were $3.86 for 2006 compared to
    $2.52 in 2005 and $2.37 in 2004. Net earnings per diluted share
    for 2006 includes $0.14 of share-based compensation expense and
    a benefit of $0.20 related to the previously described discrete
    tax items associated with a legal reorganization and the
    favorable tax law change. Net earnings per diluted share for
    2005 includes a net charge of $0.12 related to the previously
    described tax items associated with the earnings repatriation
    associated with the American Jobs Creation Act offset in part by
    the favorable resolution of certain tax contingencies and $0.30
    related to the one-time litigation charge. Net earnings per
    diluted share for 2004 includes $0.08 of expense related to the
    previously described investigation. Net earnings per diluted
    share, as reported, increased 53% during 2006 compared to 6% in
    2005 and 12% in 2004. Excluding the effect of share-based
    compensation, the one-time litigation charge, discrete tax items
    and investigation charge, net earnings per diluted share would
    have increased 29% in 2006, 20% in 2005 and 12% in 2004. In
    addition to our improved net earnings, the increase in net
    earnings per diluted share also benefits from our share
    repurchase program.

Represents U.S. dollar growth (decline) for net sales
    and segment profit.

The increase in total net sales during 2006 is the result of
    improved sales to external customers and includes solid growth
    across most products, particularly our food retailing products
    due to strong project activity as well as continued growth in
    our in-store retail software solutions. The increase in 2005 in
    total net sales reflected improved sales to external customers
    across most product lines, including particularly strong results
    in our food retailing and transportation and logistics products
    due to significant project activity as well as solid growth in
    laboratory balances, process analytics and analytical
    instruments.

Segment profit increased $9.9 million in our
    U.S. Operations segment during 2006, compared to an
    increase of $3.8 million during 2005. The increase in
    segment profit for 2006, was primarily due to increased sales
    volume and our ability to leverage our fixed production costs
    and benefits of our cost rationalization initiatives. The
    increase in segment profit of our U.S. Operations segment
    during 2005 is due to an increase in sales volume, partially
    offset by an unfavorable product mix.

    increased 10% in 2006 and decreased by 4% in 2005. The exit of
    our third party electronic component product line reduced total
    net sales by approximately 1% in 2005. The increase in sales to
    external customers during 2006 related primarily to particularly
    solid growth in our laboratory-related and industrial-related
    products offset in part by reduced project activity. We also
    experienced strong export sales growth to emerging markets. The
    decrease in sales in 2005 related primarily to the exit of our
    third party electronic component product line combined with
    reduced food retailing project activity and reduced direct
    export sales to emerging markets, partially offset by a strong
    increase in our industrial-related products.

Segment profit increased $4.6 million in our Swiss
    Operations segment during 2006, compared to an increase of
    $5.9 million during 2005. The increase in segment profit in
    2006 is primarily due to increased sales volume, our ability to
    leverage our fixed production costs, particularly for laboratory
    balances, and favorable currency translation fluctuations. The
    increase in segment profit is partially offset by changes in
    intercompany pricing to other segments and higher research and
    development expense. The increase in segment profit in 2005
    primarily related to increased sales to other segments of
    laboratory-related products as well as benefits from our cost
    rationalization initiatives.

    increased 5% in 2006 and 3% in 2005. The 2006 increase is
    primarily due to improved market conditions across most

    retailing products primarily related to project activity, as
    well as solid growth in our laboratory-related products,
    particularly process analytics. The 2005 increase was primarily
    due to improved market conditions in the major European

    products.

Segment profit increased $5.2 million in our Western
    European Operations segment during 2006, compared to an increase
    of $5.3 million in 2005. The increase in segment profit for
    2006 is principally a result of increased net sales volume and

Segment profit increased $6.7 million in our Other
    Operations segment during 2006, compared to an increase of
    $1.9 million during 2005. Segment profit increased during
    2006 primarily due to strong sales volume, improved cost levels
    and inventory charges that occurred during 2005. Segment profit
    increased during 2005 primarily due to the continued improvement
    in sales volume.

Liquidity and
    Capital Resources

Liquidity is our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from
    operating activities to meet our obligations and commitments. In
    addition, liquidity includes the ability to obtain appropriate
    financing. Currently, our financing requirements are primarily
    driven by working capital requirements, capital expenditures,
    share repurchases and acquisitions. In 2005, we have also
    increased our debt balance in Europe and our cash balance in the
    United States as a result of our foreign earnings repatriation
    associated with the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.

Cash provided by operating activities totaled
    $191.6 million in 2006, compared to $177.1 million in
    2005 and $166.0 million in 2004. The increase in 2006
    resulted principally from improved operating results and reduced
    inventory levels, which was offset in part by a $6 million
    voluntary incremental pension contribution to our U.K. pension
    plan. The increase in 2005 resulted principally from improved
    operating results offset in part by approximately
    $15 million of higher payments relating to 2004 performance
    related compensation incentives (bonus payments). Cash provided
    by operating activities in 2004 was impacted by voluntary
    incremental pension contributions of $10.0 million to our
    U.S. pension plan. Similar to previous years, we expect to
    make normal employer pension contributions of approximately
    $11.5 million in 2007.

Capital expenditures are made primarily for machinery, equipment
    and the purchase and expansion of facilities. Our capital
    expenditures totaled $34.3 million in 2006,
    $32.5 million in 2005 and $27.9 million in 2004. We
    expect capital expenditures to increase as our business grows
    and to fluctuate as currency exchange rates change. In 2006, we
    launched a building project for a new plant in China which will
    cost in the range of $10 million to $15 million over a
    two year period.

We continue to explore potential acquisitions. In connection
    with any acquisition, we may incur additional indebtedness.

November 2005
    Refinancing

On November 7, 2005, we entered into a revised credit
    agreement (the “Amended Credit Agreement”), which
    amended and restated the existing Credit Agreement, dated as of
    November 12, 2003. The Amended Credit Agreement increased
    the amount that can be borrowed under the facility from
    $300 million to $450 million, extended the maturity
    date to November 2010 and lowered the margin applicable to the
    interest rate payable thereunder. The remaining terms of the
    Amended Credit Agreement are substantially the same as under the
    existing Credit Agreement. We incurred fees of approximately
    $0.9 million in conjunction with amending and restating the
    Credit Agreement which are amortized to interest expense through
    2010.

Amended Credit
    Agreement

The $450 million Amended Credit Agreement is provided by a
    group of financial institutions and has a maturity date of
    November 5, 2010. It is not subject to any scheduled
    principal payments. Borrowings under the Amended Credit
    Agreement bear interest at current market rates plus a margin
    based on our senior unsecured credit ratings (currently
    “BBB” by Standard & Poor’s and
    “Baa3” by Moody’s) and is currently set at LIBOR
    plus 0.375%. We must also pay facility fees that are tied to our
    credit ratings. The Amended Credit Agreement contains covenants,
    including maintaining a ratio of debt to earnings before
    interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of less than 3.25
    to 1.0 and an interest coverage ratio of more than 3.5 to 1.0.
    This also places certain limitations on us, including limiting
    the ability to grant liens or incur debt at a subsidiary level.
    In addition, the Amended Credit Agreement has several events of
    default, including upon a change of control. As of
    December 31, 2006, approximately $253.9 million was
    available under the facility. The Amended Credit Agreement is
    unsecured.



Senior
    Notes

In November 2003, we issued $150 million of 4.85% unsecured
    Senior Notes due November 15, 2010. The Senior Notes rank
    equally with all our unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.
    Interest is payable semi-annually in May and November. Discount
    and issuance costs approximated $1.2 million and are being
    amortized to interest expense over the seven-year term of the
    Senior Notes.

At our option, the Senior Notes may be redeemed in whole or in
    part at any time at a redemption price equal to the greater of:

•

The principal amount of the Senior Notes; or

•

The sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled
    payments of principal and interest thereon discounted to the
    redemption date on a semi-annual basis at a comparable treasury
    rate plus a margin of 0.20%.

The Senior Notes contain limitations on our ability to incur
    liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions exceeding
    10% of our consolidated net worth.

Our short-term borrowings and long-term debt consisted of the
    following at December 31, 2006.

Changes in exchange rates between the currencies in which we
    generate cash flow and the currencies in which our borrowings
    are denominated affect our liquidity. In addition, because we
    borrow in a variety of currencies, our debt balances fluctuate
    due to changes in exchange rates.

At December 31, 2006, we were in compliance with all
    covenants set forth in our Amended Credit Agreement and Senior
    Notes. In addition, we do not have any downgrade triggers
    relating to ratings from rating agencies that would accelerate
    the maturity dates of our debt.

We currently believe that cash flow from operating activities,
    together with liquidity available under our Amended Credit
    Agreement and local working capital facilities, will be
    sufficient to fund currently anticipated working capital needs
    and capital spending requirements for at least the next several
    years.



Contractual
    Obligations

The following summarizes certain of our contractual obligations
    at December 31, 2006 and the effect such obligations are

In addition to the above table, we also have liabilities for
    income taxes, pension and post-retirement funding however we
    cannot determine the timing or the amounts for periods beyond
    2006 for income taxes and beyond 2007 for pension and
    post-retirement funding.

We have purchase commitments for materials, supplies, services
    and fixed assets in the normal course of business. Due to the
    proprietary nature of many of our materials and processes,
    certain supply contracts contain penalty provisions. We do not
    expect potential payments under these provisions to materially
    affect results of operations or financial condition. This
    conclusion is based upon reasonably likely outcomes derived by
    reference to historical experience and current business plans.

Share Repurchase
    Program

We have a share repurchase program. Under the program, we have
    been authorized to buy back up to $900 million of equity
    shares. As of December 31, 2006, there were
    $365.7 million of remaining equity shares authorized to be
    repurchased under the plan by December 31, 2008. The share
    repurchases are expected to be funded from cash balances,
    borrowings and cash generated from operating activities.
    Repurchases will be made through open market transactions, and
    the timing will depend on the level of acquisition activity,
    business and market conditions, the stock price, trading
    restrictions and other factors. We have purchased
    9.6 million shares since the inception of the program
    through December 31, 2006.

During the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, we spent
    $265.9 million and $164.6 million on the repurchase of
    4,141,559 shares and 3,229,200 shares at an average
    price of $64.18 and $50.94, respectively. An additional
    $5.4 million and $4.2 million relating to the
    settlement of shares repurchased as of December 31, 2006
    and 2005 were cash settled during 2007 and 2006, respectively.
    We reissued 1,152,892 shares and 1,261,332 shares held
    in treasury for the exercise of stock options during 2006 and
    2005, respectively.

Off-Balance Sheet
    Arrangements

Currently, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have
    or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on
    our financial condition, changes in financial condition,
    revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital
    expenditures or capital resources that is material.

Effect of
    Currency on Results of Operations

Because we conduct operations in many countries, our operating
    income can be significantly affected by fluctuations in currency
    exchange rates. Swiss franc-denominated expenses represent a
    much greater percentage of our operating expenses than Swiss
    franc-denominated sales represent of our net sales. In part,
    this is because most of our manufacturing costs in Switzerland
    relate to products that are sold outside Switzerland. Moreover,
    a substantial percentage of our research and development
    expenses and general and



administrative expenses are incurred in Switzerland. Therefore,
    if the Swiss franc strengthens against all or most of our major
    trading currencies (e.g

.

, the U.S. dollar, the euro,
    other major European currencies and the Japanese yen), our
    operating profit is reduced. We also have significantly more
    sales in European currencies (other than the Swiss franc) than
    we have expenses in those currencies. Therefore, when
    European currencies weaken against the U.S. dollar and
    the Swiss franc, it also decreases our operating profits.
    Accordingly, the Swiss franc exchange rate to the euro is an
    important cross-rate that we monitor. We estimate that a 1%
    strengthening of the Swiss franc against the euro would result
    in a decrease in our earnings before tax of $0.9 million to
    $1.1 million on an annual basis. In addition to the effects
    of exchange rate movements on operating profits, our debt levels
    can fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates, particularly
    between the U.S. dollar and the Swiss franc. Based on our
    outstanding debt at December 31, 2006, we estimate that a
    10% weakening of the U.S. dollar against the currencies in
    which our debt is denominated would result in an increase of
    approximately $22.9 million in the reported
    U.S. dollar value of the debt.

Taxes

We are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions throughout the
    world. Our effective tax rate and tax liability will be affected
    by a number of factors, such as the amount of taxable income in
    particular jurisdictions, the tax rates in such jurisdictions,
    tax treaties between jurisdictions, the extent to which we
    transfer funds between jurisdictions, earnings repatriations
    between jurisdictions and changes in law. Generally, the tax
    liability for each taxpayer within the group is determined
    either (i) on a

non-consolidated/non-combined basis

or (ii) on a consolidated/combined basis only with other
    eligible entities subject to tax in the same jurisdiction, in
    either case without regard to the taxable losses of
    non-consolidated/non-combined affiliated legal entities. As a
    result, we may pay income taxes to certain jurisdictions even
    though on an overall basis we incur a net loss for the period.

Environmental Matters

We are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the
    jurisdictions in which we operate. We own or lease a number of
    properties and manufacturing facilities around the world. Like
    many of our competitors, we have incurred, and will continue to
    incur, capital and operating expenditures and other costs in
    complying with such laws and regulations.

We are currently involved in, or have potential liability with
    respect to, the remediation of past contamination in certain of
    our facilities in both the United States and abroad. Our
    subsidiary Mettler-Toledo Hi-Speed, Inc. (“Hi-Speed”)
    is one of two private parties ordered to perform certain ground
    water contamination monitoring under an administrative consent
    order that the New Jersey Department of Environmental
    Protection (“NJDEP”) signed on June 13, 1988
    with respect to certain property in Landing, New Jersey.

GEI International Corporation (“GEI”) is the other
    ordered party. GEI has failed to fulfill its obligations under
    the NJDEP consent order, and NJDEP has agreed with Hi-Speed that
    the residual ground water contaminants can be monitored through
    the establishment of a Classification Exception Area and
    concurrent Well Restriction Area for the site. The NJDEP does
    not view these vehicles as remedial measures, but rather as
    “institutional controls” that must be adequately
    maintained and periodically evaluated. We estimate that the
    costs of compliance associated with monitoring ground water
    contamination levels at the site will be approximately
    $0.7 million in the coming years.

In addition, certain of our present and former facilities have
    or had been in operation for many decades and, over such time,
    some of these facilities may have used substances or generated
    and disposed of wastes which are or may be considered hazardous.
    It is possible that these sites, as well as disposal sites owned
    by third parties to which we have sent wastes, may in the future
    be identified and become the subject of remediation.
    Accordingly, although we believe that we are in substantial
    compliance with applicable environmental requirements and to
    date we have not incurred material expenditures in connection
    with environmental matters, it is possible that we could become
    subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future
    that could result in a material adverse effect on our financial
    condition or results of operations.



Inflation

Inflation can affect the costs of goods and services that we
    use, including raw materials to manufacture our products. The
    competitive environment in which we operate limits somewhat our
    ability to recover higher costs through increased selling prices.

Moreover, there may be differences in inflation rates between
    countries in which we incur the major portion of our costs and
    other countries in which we sell products, which may limit our
    ability to recover increased costs. We remain committed to
    operations in China and Eastern Europe, which have experienced
    inflationary conditions. To date, inflationary conditions have
    not had a material effect on our operating results. However, as
    our presence in China and Eastern Europe increases, these
    inflationary conditions could have a greater impact on our
    operating results.

Quantitative and
    Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

We have only limited involvement with derivative financial
    instruments and do not use them for trading purposes.

We have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to
    economically hedge short-term intercompany balances with our
    international businesses on a monthly basis. Such contracts
    limit our exposure to both favorable and unfavorable currency
    fluctuations. The fair value of these contracts was a
    $0.2 million gain and a $0.2 million loss at
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. A sensitivity
    analysis to changes on these foreign currency-denominated
    contracts indicates that if the primary currency
    (U.S. dollar, Swiss franc and British pound) declined by
    10%, the fair value of these instruments would decrease by
    $3.5 million at December 31, 2006, as compared with a
    decrease of $4.1 million at December 31, 2005. Any
    resulting changes in fair value would be offset by changes in
    the underlying hedged balance sheet position. The sensitivity
    analysis assumes a parallel shift in foreign currency exchange
    rates. The assumption that exchange rates change in parallel
    fashion may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on
    assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency. We
    also have other currency risks as described under “Effect
    of Currency on Results of Operations”.

We have entered into certain interest rate swap agreements.
    These contracts are more fully described in Note 4 to our
    audited consolidated financial statements. The fair value of
    these contracts was a $0.4 million loss at
    December 31, 2006 and 2005. Based on our agreements
    outstanding at December 31, 2006, a 100-basis-point
    increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the net
    aggregate market value of these instruments of
    $1.0 million, as compared with a decrease of
    $1.3 million at December 31, 2005. Conversely, a
    100-basis-point decrease in interest rates would result in a
    $1.1 million increase in the net aggregate market value of
    these instruments at December 31, 2006, as compared with a
    net increase of $1.4 million at December 31, 2005. Any
    change in fair value would not affect our consolidated statement
    of operations unless such agreements and the debt they hedge
    were prematurely settled.

Critical Accounting
    Policies

Management’s discussion and analysis of our financial
    condition and results of operations is based upon our audited
    consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in
    accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these
    consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates
    and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
    liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of
    contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we
    evaluate our estimates, including those related to pensions and
    other post-retirement benefits, inventories, intangible assets,
    income taxes, revenue and warranty costs. We base our estimates
    on historical experience and on various other assumptions that
    are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the
    results of which form the basis for making judgments about the
    carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily
    apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from
    these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our
    more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation
    of our audited consolidated financial statements. For a detailed
    discussion on the



application of these and other accounting policies, see
    Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements.

Employee benefit
    plans

The net periodic pension cost for 2006 and projected benefit
    obligation as of December 31, 2006 were $1.4 million
    and $113.2 million, respectively, for our U.S. pension
    plans, and $6.1 million and $569.7 million,
    respectively, for our international pension plans. The net
    periodic post-retirement cost for 2006 and expected
    postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2006
    for our U.S. post-retirement medical benefit plan were
    $0.6 million and $23.9 million, respectively.

Pension and post-retirement benefit plan expense and obligations
    are developed from assumptions utilized in actuarial valuations.
    The most significant of these assumptions include the discount
    rate and expected return on plan assets. In accordance with
    U.S. GAAP, actual results that differ from the assumptions
    are accumulated and deferred over future periods. While
    management believes the assumptions used are appropriate,
    differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may
    affect our plan obligations and future expense.

The expected rates of return on the various defined benefit
    pension plans’ assets are based on the asset allocation of
    each plan and the long-term projected return of those assets,
    which represent a diversified mix of U.S. and international
    corporate equities and government and corporate debt securities.
    In April 2002, we froze our U.S. defined benefit pension
    plan and discontinued our retiree medical program for certain
    current and all future employees. Consequently, no significant
    future service costs will be incurred on these plans. For 2006,
    the weighted average return on assets assumption was 8.5% for
    the U.S. plan and 5.1% for the international plans. A
    change in the rate of return of 1% would impact annual benefit
    plan expense by approximately $4.5 million after tax.

The discount rates for defined benefit and post-retirement plans
    are set by benchmarking against high-quality corporate bonds.
    For 2006, the average discount rate assumption was 5.75% for the
    U.S. plans and 3.30% for the international plans,
    representing a weighted average of local rates in countries
    where such plans exist. A decrease in the discount rate of 1%
    would impact annual benefit plan expense by approximately
    $2.3 million after tax.

In 2006 and 2004, we made voluntary incremental funding payments
    of $6.0 million and $10.0 million, respectively, to
    reduce the under funded status of our U.K. and U.S. pension
    plans. In the future, we may make additional mandatory or
    discretionary contributions to our plan or we could be required
    to make additional cash funding payments.

Equity
    compensation

We also have an equity incentive plan that provides for the
    grant of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units
    and other equity-based awards which, as of January 1, 2006,
    are accounted for and recognized in the consolidated statement
    of operations based on the grant date fair value of the award
    under SFAS No. 123R, “Share-Based Payment”
    (“SFAS 123R”). Prior to January 1, 2006,
    these equity awards were accounted for under the intrinsic value
    method pursuant to Accounting Principles Board Opinion
    No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
    Employees” and related interpretations. Note 10 to the
    audited consolidated financial statements provides supplemental
    information, including pro forma earnings and earnings
    per share, as if we had accounted for options based on the
    fair value method prescribed by SFAS No. 123,
    “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.” These
    methodologies yield an estimate of fair value based in part on a
    number of management estimates, the most significant of which
    include future volatility and estimated option lives. Changes in
    these assumptions could significantly impact the estimated fair
    value of stock options.



Inventory

As of December 31, 2006, inventories were
    $148.4 million.

We record our inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable
    value. Cost, which includes direct materials, labor and
    overhead, is generally determined using the first in, first out
    (FIFO) method. The estimated net realizable value is based on
    assumptions for future demand and related pricing. Adjustments
    to the cost basis of our inventory are made for excess and
    obsolete items based on forecast usage, orders and technological
    obsolescence. If actual market conditions are less favorable
    than those projected by management, reductions in the value of
    inventory may be required.

Goodwill and
    other intangible assets

As of December 31, 2006, our consolidated balance sheet
    included goodwill of $432.9 million and other intangible
    assets of $102.8 million.

Our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other
    intangible assets, which affect the amount of future period
    amortization expense and possible impairment expense that we
    will incur. The determination of the value of such intangible
    assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions
    that affect our consolidated financial statements.

In accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and
    Other Intangible Assets” (“SFAS 142”), our
    goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not
    amortized, but are evaluated for impairment annually in the
    fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired. The
    evaluation is based on valuation models that estimate fair value
    based on expected future cash flows and profitability
    projections. In preparing the valuation models, we consider a
    number of factors, including operating results, business plans,
    economic conditions, future cash flows, and transactions and
    market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to
    these factors and our judgment in applying them to the
    impairment analyses. The most significant of these estimates and
    assumptions within our fair value models include estimated cash
    flows resulting from estimates of sales growth and controllable
    cost growth, perpetual growth, effective tax rates and discount
    rates. Our assessments to date have indicated that there has
    been no impairment of these assets.

As of December 31, 2004, our intangible assets included a
    $19.9 million indefinite life intangible asset relating to
    an intellectual property license. This license was previously
    subject to litigation with the grantor, and on June 6,
    2005, we were ordered to pay $0.6 million in damages and
    the respective intellectual property license was terminated. Due
    to the cancellation of the license, we concluded that the
    intangible asset had no future benefit and as such, during the
    second quarter of 2005, we wrote off the total value of the
    asset, $19.9 million ($12 million after tax). This
    charge has been included as a component of Other charges, net
    within the Statement of Operations. The damages of
    $0.6 million were subsequently reversed during 2006.

Should any of these estimates or assumptions in the preceding
    paragraphs change, or should we incur lower than expected
    operating performance or cash flows, we may experience a
    triggering event that requires a new fair value assessment for
    our reporting units, possibly prior to the required annual
    assessment. These types of events and resulting analysis could
    result in impairment charges for goodwill and other
    indefinite-lived intangible assets if the fair value estimate
    declines below the carrying value.

Our amortization expense related to intangible assets with
    finite lives may materially change should our estimates of their
    useful lives change.

Income
    taxes

Income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities
    reflect management’s assessment of actual future taxes to
    be paid on items in the consolidated financial statements. We
    record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets
    to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. While
    we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and
    feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the
    valuation allowance, in the event we were to determine that we
    would be able to realize our



deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded
    amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase
    income, equity or goodwill in the period such determination was
    made. Likewise, should we determine that we would not be able to
    realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future,
    an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to
    income in the period such determination was made.

The Company has undistributed earnings of

non-U.S. subsidiaries

and currently believes that there will be no cost associated
    with the repatriation of such foreign earnings.

The significant assumptions and estimates described in the
    preceding paragraphs are important contributors to our ultimate
    effective tax rate for each year in addition to our income mix
    from geographical regions. If any of our assumptions or
    estimates were to change, or should our income mix from our
    geographical regions change, our effective tax rate could be
    materially affected. Based on earnings before taxes of
    $204.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006,
    each increase of $2.0 million in tax expense would increase
    our effective tax rate by 1%.

Revenue
    recognition

Revenue is recognized when title to a product has transferred
    and any significant customer obligations have been fulfilled.
    Standard shipping terms are generally FOB shipping point in most
    countries and, accordingly, title transfers upon shipment. In
    countries where title cannot legally transfer before delivery,
    we defer revenue recognition until delivery has occurred. Other
    than a few small software applications, we do not sell software
    products without the related hardware instrument as the software
    is embedded in the instrument. Our typical solution requires no
    significant production, modification or customization of the
    hardware or software that is essential to the functionality of
    the products. To the extent our solutions have a post shipment
    obligation, such as customer acceptance, revenue is deferred
    until the obligation has been completed. In addition, we also
    defer revenue where installation is required, unless such
    installation is perfunctory. We also generally maintain the
    right to accept or reject a product return in our terms and
    conditions and we also maintain accruals for outstanding
    credits. Distributor discounts are offset against revenue at the
    time such revenue is recognized. Revenues from service contracts
    are recognized ratably over the contract period.

Warranty

We generally offer one-year warranties on most of our products.
    Product warranties are recorded at the time revenue is
    recognized for certain product shipments. While we engage in
    extensive product quality programs and processes, our warranty
    obligation is affected by product failure rates, material usage
    and service costs incurred in correcting a product failure. If
    we experience claims or significant cost changes in material,
    freight and vendor charges, our cost of goods sold could be
    affected.

Controls and

Conclusion
    Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and
    Procedures and Changes in Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting

Our management carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of
    our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the
    period covered by this annual report under the supervision and
    with the participation of our disclosure committee, our CFO and
    CEO. Based upon that evaluation, our CFO and CEO concluded that
    our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in
    permitting us to comply with our disclosure obligations and
    ensure that the material information required to be disclosed is
    recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
    periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. There were
    no changes in our internal control over financial reporting
    during the quarter ended December 31, 2006 that have
    materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
    affect, our controls over financial reporting.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal
    control over financial reporting is a process designed to
    provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
    financial reporting and the preparation of the Company’s
    financial statements for external reporting purposes in
    accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2006. In making this assessment, we used the
    criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
    of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework. Based on our
    assessment, we concluded that, as of December 31, 2006, the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting is
    effective.

Our management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2006 has been audited by
    PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears on

page F-2.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and

Shareholders of Mettler-Toledo International Inc.

We have completed integrated audits of Mettler-Toledo
    International Inc.’s 2006 and 2005 consolidated financial
    statements and of its internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 31, 2006 in accordance with the standards of
    the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
    Our opinions, based on our audits, are presented below.

Consolidated
    financial statements and financial statement schedules

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
    the index appearing on

Page F-1

present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
    of Mettler-Toledo International Inc. and its subsidiaries at
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the results of their
    operations and their cash flows for the years then ended in
    conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the
    financial statement schedules appearing on

Page S-1

presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set
    forth therein when read in conjunction with the related
    consolidated financial statements. These financial statements
    and financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these financial statements and financial statement
    schedules based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
    statements in accordance with the standards of the Public
    Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements
    includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
    amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
    the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
    presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
    basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Note 10 to the consolidated financial
    statements, effective January 1, 2006 the Company changed
    the manner in which it accounts for share-based compensation. In
    addition, as discussed in Note 11, the Company changed the
    manner in which it records the funded status of its defined
    benefit pension and other postretirement plans.

Internal control
    over financial reporting

Also, in our opinion, management’s assessment, included in
    Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting appearing under Item 9A, that the Company
    maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 31, 2006 based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all material respects,
    based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the
    Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
    control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006,
    based on criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the COSO. The Company’s
    management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
    control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
    effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
    responsibility is to express opinions on management’s
    assessment and on the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We
    conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting
    in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
    Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
    require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
    assurance about whether effective internal control over
    financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An
    audit of internal control over financial reporting includes
    obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
    reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and
    evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
    control, and performing such other procedures as we consider
    necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit
    provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

F-2


A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

BUSINESS
    DESCRIPTION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

Mettler-Toledo International Inc. (“Mettler-Toledo” or
    the “Company”) is a leading global supplier of
    precision instruments and services. The Company manufactures
    weighing instruments for use in laboratory, industrial,
    packaging, logistics and food retailing applications. The
    Company also manufactures several related analytical
    instruments, and provides automated chemistry solutions used in
    drug and chemical compound discovery and development. In
    addition, the Company manufactures metal detection and other

end-of-line

inspection systems used in production and packaging, and
    provides solutions for use in certain process analytics
    applications. The Company’s primary manufacturing
    facilities are located in China, Germany, Switzerland, the
    United Kingdom and the United States. The Company’s
    principal executive offices are located in Greifensee,
    Switzerland.

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
    accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and
    include all entities in which the Company has control, which are
    its majority owned subsidiaries.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and
    assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
    liabilities, as well as disclosure of contingent assets and
    liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the
    reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
    periods. Actual results may differ from those estimates

.

All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.

Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts
    to conform to the current year presentation.

SUMMARY OF
    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Cash and Cash
    Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with
    original maturity dates of three months or less.

Trade Accounts
    Receivable

Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount
    and do not bear interest. The allowance for doubtful accounts
    represents the Company’s best estimate of probable credit
    losses in its existing trade accounts receivable.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable
    value. Cost, which includes direct materials, labor and
    overhead, is generally determined using the first in, first out
    (FIFO) method. The estimated net realizable value is based on
    assumptions for future demand and related pricing. Adjustments
    to the cost basis of our inventory are made for excess and
    obsolete items based on forecasted usage, orders and
    technological obsolescence. If actual market conditions are less
    favorable than those projected by management, reductions in the
    value of inventory may be required.

    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands,
    except share data, unless otherwise stated)

Long-Lived
    Assets

a) Property,
    Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less
    accumulated depreciation. Repair and maintenance costs are
    charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation and amortization is
    charged on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives
    of the assets as follows:

Buildings and improvements

15 to 50 years

Machinery and equipment

3 to 12 years

Computer software

3 to 5 years

Leasehold improvements

Shorter of useful life or lease
    term

b) Capitalized
    Software

In accordance with Statement of Position

98-1,

“Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or
    Obtained for Internal Use”

(“SOP 98-1”),

the Company expenses all internal-use software costs incurred in
    the preliminary project stage and capitalizes certain direct
    costs associated with the development and purchase of
    internal-use software within property, plant and equipment.
    Capitalized costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over
    the estimated useful lives of the software, generally not
    exceeding five years.

c) Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets

In accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and
    Other Intangible Assets” (“SFAS 142”),
    goodwill, representing the excess of purchase price over the net
    asset value of companies acquired, and indefinite-lived
    intangible assets are not amortized, but are reviewed for
    impairment annually in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if
    events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might
    be impaired. The annual evaluation is based on valuation models
    that estimate fair value based on expected future cash flows and
    profitability projections.

Other intangible assets also include definite-lived assets which
    are subject to amortization. Where applicable, amortization is
    charged on a straight-line basis over the expected period to be
    benefited. The straight-line method of amortization reflects an
    appropriate allocation of the cost of the intangible assets to
    earnings in proportion to the amount of economic benefits
    obtained by the company in each reporting period. The Company
    assesses the recoverability of other intangible assets subject
    to amortization in accordance with SFAS No. 144,
    “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
    Assets” (“SFAS 144”).

Accounting for
    Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

In accordance with SFAS 144, the Company assesses the need
    to record impairment losses on long-lived assets with finite
    lives when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
    carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. An impairment
    loss would be recognized when future estimated undiscounted cash
    flows expected to result from use of the asset are less than the
    asset’s carrying value, with the loss measured at fair
    value based on discounted expected cash flows.

Taxation

The Company files tax returns in each jurisdiction in which it
    operates. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for
    the future tax consequences attributable to differences between
    the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
    liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss
    and tax

F-10


METTLER-TOLEDO
    INTERNATIONAL INC.

NOTES TO THE
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands,
    except share data, unless otherwise stated)

credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
    measured using enacted tax rates in the respective jurisdictions
    in which the Company operates. In assessing the ability to
    realize deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is
    more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred
    tax assets will not be realized.

Deferred taxes are not provided on the unremitted earnings of
    subsidiaries outside of the United States when it is expected
    that these earnings are permanently reinvested. Such earnings
    may become taxable upon the sale or liquidation of these
    subsidiaries or upon the remittance of dividends. Deferred taxes
    are provided when the Company no longer considers subsidiary
    earnings to be permanently invested, such as in situations where
    the Company’s subsidiaries plan to make future dividend
    distributions.

Currency
    Translation and Transactions

The reporting currency for the consolidated financial statements
    of the Company is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency
    for the Company’s operations is generally the applicable
    local currency. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of
    companies whose functional currency is other than the
    U.S. dollar are included in the consolidated financial
    statements by translating the assets and liabilities into the
    reporting currency at the exchange rates applicable at the end
    of the reporting period. The statements of operations and cash
    flows of such

non-U.S. dollar

functional currency operations are translated at the monthly
    average exchange rates during the year. Translation gains or
    losses are accumulated in other comprehensive income (loss) in
    the consolidated statements of shareholders’ equity.
    Transaction gains and losses are included as a component of net
    earnings.

Revenue
    Recognition

Revenue is recognized when title to a product has transferred
    and any significant customer obligations have been fulfilled.
    Standard shipping terms are generally FOB shipping point in most
    countries and, accordingly, title transfers upon shipment. In
    countries where title cannot legally transfer before delivery,
    we defer revenue recognition until delivery has occurred. Other
    than a few small software applications, we do not sell software
    products without the related hardware instrument as the software
    is embedded in the instrument. The Company’s products
    typically require no significant production, modification or
    customization of the hardware or software that is essential to
    the functionality of the products. To the extent the
    Company’s solutions have a post shipment obligation, such
    as customer acceptance, revenue is deferred until the obligation
    has been completed. In addition, we also defer revenue where
    installation is required, unless such installation is deemed
    perfunctory. We also generally maintain the right to accept or
    reject a product return in our terms and conditions and we also
    maintain accruals for outstanding credits. Distributor discounts
    are offset against revenue at the time such revenue is
    recognized. Revenues from service contracts are recognized
    ratably over the contract period. Shipping and handling costs
    charged to customers are included in total net sales and the
    associated expense is recorded in cost of sales for all periods
    presented.

Research and
    Development

Research and development costs primarily consist of salaries,
    consulting and other costs. The Company expenses these costs as
    incurred.

Warranty

The Company generally offers one-year warranties on most of its
    products. Product warranties are recorded at the time revenue is
    recognized for certain product shipments. While the Company
    engages in

F-11


METTLER-TOLEDO
    INTERNATIONAL INC.

NOTES TO THE
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands,
    except share data, unless otherwise stated)

extensive product quality programs and processes, our warranty
    obligation is affected by product failure rates, material usage
    and service costs incurred in correcting a product failure.

Earnings per
    Common Share

In accordance with the treasury stock method, the Company has
    included 719,757, 1,077,344 and 1,246,755 equivalent shares in
    the calculation of diluted weighted average number of common
    shares for the years ending December 31, 2006, 2005 and
    2004, respectively, relating to outstanding stock options.

Outstanding options to purchase 416,375, 127,125 and
    748,813 shares of common stock for the years ending
    December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, have been
    excluded from the calculation of diluted weighted average number
    of common shares as such options would be anti-dilutive.

Share-Based
    Compensation

The Company applies the fair value methodology under Statement
    of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R,
    “Share-Based Compensation”
    (“SFAS 123R”), and related interpretations in
    accounting for its

share-based

compensation plan.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

The Company has only limited involvement with derivative
    financial instruments and does not use them for trading
    purposes. As described more fully in Note 4, the Company
    enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to
    economically hedge certain short-term intercompany balances
    involving its international businesses. Such contracts limit the
    Company’s exposure to currency fluctuations on the items
    they hedge. These contracts are adjusted to fair market value as
    of each balance sheet date, with the resulting changes in fair
    value being recognized in the appropriate financial statement
    caption in the income statement consistent with the underlying
    hedged item.

The Company also enters into certain interest rate swap
    agreements in order to manage its exposure to changes in
    interest rates. The differential paid or received on interest
    rate swap agreements is recognized as interest expense over the
    life of the agreements as incurred. The Company’s fixed to
    floating interest rate swap agreements are accounted for as fair
    value hedges. The change in fair value of outstanding interest
    rate swap agreements that are effective as fair value hedges is
    recognized in earnings as incurred and is offset by the change
    in fair value of the hedged item.

New Accounting
    Pronouncements

In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48,
    “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an
    interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109”
    (“FIN 48”). FIN 48 prescribes a recognition
    threshold and measurement process for recording in the financial
    statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken
    in a tax return. Additionally, FIN 48 provides guidance on
    derecognition, classification, interest and penalties,
    accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition for
    uncertain tax positions. This interpretation will be effective
    for the Company beginning January 1, 2007. The Company does
    not believe the implementation of FIN 48 will have a
    material impact on its consolidated results of operations or
    financial position.

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    issued FASB Statement No. 158, “Employers’
    Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
    Plans” (“SFAS 158”). SFAS 158 requires
    the Company to record the funded status of its defined benefit
    pension and other postretirement plans in its financial
    statements. The Company is required to record an asset in its
    financial statements if a plan is overfunded or record a
    liability in its financial statements if a plan is underfunded
    with a corresponding

offset to shareholders’ equity. Previously unrecognized
    assets and liabilities are recorded as a component of
    shareholders’ equity in accumulated other comprehensive
    income, net of applicable income taxes. SFAS 158 also
    requires the Company to measure the value of its assets and
    liabilities as of the end of its fiscal year ending after
    December 15, 2008. The Company has implemented
    SFAS 158 using the required prospective method. The
    recognition provisions of SFAS 158 are effective for the
    fiscal year ending after December 15, 2006 (see
    Note 11).

FINANCIAL
    INSTRUMENTS

As described in Note 8, on November 7, 2005, the
    Company amended and restated its existing $300 million
    Credit Agreement (the “Amended Credit Agreement”). The
    Amended Credit Agreement increased the amount that can be
    borrowed under the facility from $300 million to
    $450 million, extended the maturity date to November 2010
    and lowered the margin applicable to the interest rate payable
    thereunder. The remaining terms of the Amended Credit Agreement
    are substantially the same as under the prior Credit Agreement.
    The Company incurred fees of approximately $0.9 million in
    conjunction with amending and restating the Credit Agreement
    which are amortized to interest expense through 2010.

In November 2003, the Company issued $150 million of
    seven-year Senior Notes (the “Senior Notes”). In
    connection with this issuance, the Company entered into an
    interest rate swap agreement, designated as a fair value hedge,
    which changes the fixed interest obligation associated with
    $30 million of the Senior Notes into a floating rate. This
    agreement has a maturity date of November 15, 2010. Under
    the swap, the Company will receive a fixed interest rate of
    4.85% (i.e., the same rate as the Senior Notes) and pay interest
    at a rate of LIBOR plus 0.22%. At December 31, 2006 and
    2005, the fair value of the swap was a loss of approximately
    $0.4 million.

At December 31, 2006, the Company had outstanding foreign
    currency forward contracts with notional amounts of
    $86.1 million, in order to economically hedge short-term
    intercompany balances with its foreign businesses. The fair
    value of these contracts was a $0.2 million gain and a
    $0.2 million loss as of December 31, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively.

The Company may be exposed to credit losses in the event of
    nonperformance by the counterparties to its derivative financial
    instrument contracts. Counterparties are established banks and
    financial institutions with high credit ratings. The Company
    believes that such counterparties will be able to fully satisfy
    their obligations under these contracts.

The fair values of all derivative financial instruments are
    estimated based on current settlement prices of comparable
    contracts obtained from dealer quotes. The values represent the
    estimated amount the Company would pay or receive to terminate
    the agreements at the balance sheet date.

The annual aggregate amortization expense based on the current
    balance of other intangible assets for each of the next five
    years is estimated at $4.4 million. The
    non-indefinite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a
    straight-line basis over periods ranging from 7 to
    45 years. The straight-line method of amortization reflects
    an appropriate allocation of the cost of the intangible assets
    to earnings in proportion to the amount of economic benefits
    obtained by the Company in each reporting period.

The Company had amortization expense associated with the above
    intangible assets of $4.5 million and $4.1 million for
    the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

November 2005
    Refinancing

On November 7, 2005, the Company amended and restated its
    Credit Agreement, which amends and restates its prior Credit
    Agreement, dated as of November 12, 2003. The Amended
    Credit Agreement increased the amount that can be borrowed under
    the facility from $300 million to $450 million,
    extended the maturity date to November 2010 and lowered the
    margin applicable to the interest rate payable thereunder. The
    remaining terms of the Amended Credit Agreement are
    substantially the same as under the prior Credit Agreement. The
    Company incurred fees of approximately $0.9 million in
    conjunction with amending and restating the Credit Agreement
    which are being amortized to interest expense through 2010.

Amended Credit
    Agreement

The $450 million Amended Credit Agreement is provided by a
    group of financial institutions and has a maturity date of
    November 5, 2010. It is not subject to any scheduled
    principal payments. Borrowings under the Amended Credit
    Agreement bear interest at current market rates plus a margin
    based on our senior unsecured credit ratings (currently
    “BBB” by Standard & Poor’s and
    “Baa3” by Moody’s) and is currently set at LIBOR
    plus 0.375%. We must also pay facility fees that are tied to our
    credit ratings. The Amended Credit Agreement contains covenants,
    for which the Company was in compliance as of December 31,
    2006, including maintaining a ratio of debt to earnings before
    interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of less

than 3.25 to 1.0 and an interest coverage ratio of more than 3.5
    to 1.0. This also places certain limitations on us, including
    limiting the ability to grant liens or incur debt at a
    subsidiary level. In addition, the Amended Credit Agreement has
    several events of default, including upon a change of control.
    The borrowings under the amended credit agreement have been
    classified as long-term debt in accordance with the
    Company’s intent and ability to refinance such obligations
    on a long-term basis. As of December 31, 2006,
    approximately $253.9 million was available under the
    facility. The Amended Credit Agreement is unsecured.

Senior
    Notes

In November 2003, the Company issued $150 million of 4.85%
    unsecured Senior Notes due November 15, 2010. The Senior
    Notes rank equally with all our unsecured and unsubordinated
    indebtedness. Interest is payable semi-annually in May and
    November. Discount and issuance costs approximated
    $1.2 million and are being amortized to interest expense
    over the seven-year term of the Senior Notes. At the
    Company’s option, the Senior Notes may be redeemed in whole
    or in part at any time at a redemption price equal to the
    greater of:

•

The principal amount of the Senior Notes; or

•

The sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled
    payments of principal and interest thereon discounted to the
    redemption date on a semi-annual basis at a comparable treasury
    rate plus a margin of 0.20%.

The Senior Notes contain limitations on the ability to incur
    liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions exceeding
    10% of the Company’s consolidated net worth.

Other Local
    Arrangements

During the third quarter of 2006, a wholly owned subsidiary of
    the Company issued and sold $10 million of redeemable
    instruments to one of the Company’s

non-U.S. sponsored

defined benefit plans. These instruments are redeemable
    beginning in July 2011 and, as such, are classified as long-term
    debt on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet.

The Company’s weighted average interest rate for the years
    ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 was approximately 4% and
    6% respectively. The carrying value of the Company’s debt
    obligations approximates fair value.

SHAREHOLDERS’
    EQUITY

Common
    Stock

The number of authorized shares of the Company’s common
    stock is 125,000,000 shares with a par value of
    $0.01 per share. Holders of the Company’s common stock
    are entitled to one vote per share. At December 31, 2006,
    5,585,130 shares of the Company’s common stock were
    reserved for issuance pursuant to the Company’s stock
    option plans.

Preferred
    Stock

The Board of Directors, without further shareholder
    authorization, is authorized to issue up to
    10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per
    share in one or more series and to determine and fix the rights,
    preferences and privileges of each series, including dividend
    rights and preferences over dividends on the common stock and
    one or more series of the preferred stock, conversion rights,
    voting rights (in addition to those provided by law), redemption
    rights and the terms of any sinking fund therefore, and rights
    upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, including
    preferences over the common stock and one or

more series of the preferred stock. The issuance of shares of
    preferred stock, or the issuance of rights to purchase such
    shares, may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing
    a change in control of the Company or an unsolicited acquisition
    proposal.

Restricted Stock
    Units

In 2006 and 2005, the Company granted 61,100 and 74,600,
    respectively, restricted stock units to certain employees. The
    grant-date fair value of the restricted stock units granted in
    2006 and 2005 was $68.06 and $52.37, respectively, and the
    restricted units vest ratably over a five-year period. The fair
    value of the restricted stock units on the date of grant for
    2006 and 2005 of $4.2 and $3.9 million, respectively, will
    be recorded as compensation expense ratably over the vesting
    period. Approximately $0.9 million and $0.1 million of
    compensation expense was recognized during the years ended
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Shareholder
    Rights Plan

On August 26, 2002, the Board of Directors adopted a
    Shareholder Rights Plan under which the Company declared a
    non-cash dividend of one right for each outstanding share of
    common stock. The Rights, which expire on September 5,
    2012, entitle stockholders to buy one one-thousandth of a share
    of preferred stock at an exercise price of $150. The Rights were
    distributed to those stockholders of record as of close of
    business on September 5, 2002 and are attached to all
    certificates representing those shares of common stock.

The Rights Plan provides that should any person or group
    acquire, or announce a tender or exchange offer for 15% or more
    of the Company’s common stock, each Right, other than
    Rights held by the acquiring person or group, would entitle its
    holder to purchase a number of shares of the Company’s
    common stock for 50% of its then-current market value. Unless a
    15% acquisition has occurred, the Rights may be redeemed by the
    Board of Directors of the Company at any time. The Rights Plan
    will not be triggered by a tender or exchange offer for all
    outstanding shares of the Company at a price and on terms that
    the Company’s Board of Directors determines to be adequate
    and in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders.

The Rights Plan exempts any stockholder that beneficially owned
    15% or more of the Company’s common stock as of
    August 26, 2002. However, the Rights will become
    exercisable if, at any time after August 26, 2002, any of
    these stockholders acquire additional shares of the
    Company’s common stock in an amount which is greater than
    2% of the Company’s outstanding common stock.

Share Repurchase
    Program

The Company has a share repurchase program. Under the program,
    the Company has been authorized to buy back up to
    $900 million of equity shares. As of December 31,
    2006, there were $365.7 million of remaining equity shares
    authorized to be repurchased under the plan by December 31,
    2008. The share repurchases are expected to be funded from cash
    balances, borrowings and cash generated from operating
    activities. Repurchases will be made through open market
    transactions, and the timing will depend on the level of
    acquisition activity, business and market conditions, the stock
    price, trading restrictions and other factors. The Company has
    purchased 9.6 million shares since the inception of the
    program through December 31, 2006.

During the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, the
    Company spent $265.9 million and $164.6 million on the
    repurchase of 4,141,559 shares and 3,229,200 shares at
    an average price of $64.18 and $50.94, respectively. An
    additional $5.4 million and $4.2 million relating to
    the settlement of shares repurchased as of December 31,
    2006 and 2005 were cash settled during 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. The Company reissued 1,152,892 shares and
    1,261,332 shares held in treasury for the exercise of stock
    options during 2006 and 2005, respectively. In connection with
    these reissuances, the Company has reclassified

EQUITY INCENTIVE
    PLAN

The Company’s equity incentive plan provides employees and
    directors of the Company additional incentive to join

and/or

remain in the service of the Company as well as to maintain and
    enhance the

long-term

performance and profitability of the Company. The Company’s
    2004 equity incentive plan was approved by shareholders on
    May 6, 2004 and provides that 3.5 million shares of
    common stock, plus any options outstanding under the
    Company’s prior option plan that terminate without being
    exercised, may be the subject of awards. Of the 3.5 million
    shares of common stock available for awards, up to
    2.1 million shares may be issued in the form of restricted
    stock or restricted stock units. The plan provides for the grant
    of options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and other
    equity-based awards. The exercise price of options granted shall
    not be less than the fair market value of the common stock on
    the date of grant. Options generally vest equally over a
    five-year period from the date of grant and have a maximum term
    of up to 10 years and six months. Restricted units vest
    equally over a five-year period from the date of grant. During
    2005, the compensation committee of the Board of Directors
    determined to grant restricted share units to participating
    managers and non-qualified stock options to executive officers.

On January 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS 123R and
    Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 107,
    “Share-Based Payments”, applying the modified
    prospective method. SFAS 123R requires all share-based
    compensation arrangements granted to employees, including stock
    option grants, to be recognized in the consolidated statement of
    operations based on the grant date fair value of the award over
    the period during which an employee is required to provide
    service in exchange for the award. Under the modified
    prospective method, the Company is required to record
    share-based compensation expense for all awards granted after
    the date of adoption and for the unvested portion of previously
    granted awards outstanding as of the date of adoption.

BENEFIT
    PLANS

Mettler-Toledo maintains a number of retirement and other
    post-retirement employee benefit plans.

Certain subsidiaries sponsor defined contribution plans.
    Benefits are determined and funded annually based upon the terms
    of the plans. Amounts recognized as cost under these plans
    amounted to $11.1 million, $9.2 million and
    $7.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2006,
    2005 and 2004, respectively.

Certain subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit plans. Benefits are
    provided to employees primarily based upon years of service and
    employees’ compensation for certain periods during the last
    years of employment. Prior to 2002, the Company’s
    U.S. operations also provided post-retirement medical
    benefits to their employees. Contributions for medical benefits
    are related to employee years of service.

In May 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position

No. 106-2

(“FSP

106-2”),

“Accounting and Disclosure Requirements related to the
    Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of
    2003.” FSP

106-2

relates to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and
    Modernization Act of 2003 (the “Act”) signed into law
    on December 8, 2003. The Act introduced a prescription drug
    benefit under Medicare (Medicare Part D), as well as
    federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans
    that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent
    to Medicare Part D. During the third quarter of 2004, the
    Company adopted the provisions of FSP

106-2.

The
    Company sponsors post-retirement health care plans that provide
    prescription drug benefits that are deemed actuarially
    equivalent to the Medicare Part D and elected to

recognize the impact of the federal subsidy on its accumulated
    post-retirement benefit obligation and net post-retirement
    benefit costs in the third quarter of 2004. Recognition of the
    Medicare Drug Act decreased the Company’s accumulated
    post-retirement benefit obligation by $3.5 million and
    reduced its net post-retirement benefit cost by approximately
    $0.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2004.

    $497.7 million and $429.4 million, respectively, for
    all

non-U.S. plans.

Certain of the plans included within

non-U.S. Pension

Benefits have benefit obligations which exceed the fair value of
    plan assets. The projected benefit obligation, the accumulated
    benefit obligation and fair value of assets of these plans as of
    December 31, 2006 were $169.1 million,
    $160.7 million and $62.6 million, respectively.

The accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation was
    principally determined using discount rates of 5.75% in 2006,
    5.50% in 2005 and 5.75% in 2004 and net periodic post-retirement
    benefit cost was principally determined using discount rates of
    5.50% in 2006, 5.75% in 2005 and 6.25% in 2004 and health care
    cost trend rates ranging from 8.5% to 12% in 2006, 9% to 12% in
    2005 and 9% to 13.5% in 2004, decreasing to 4.5% in 2010.

The health care cost trend rate assumption has a significant
    effect on the accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation and

Plan assets relate principally to the Company’s U.S. and

    obligations of the U.S. Treasury or other governmental
    agencies, and other interest-bearing investments. Actual and

Investment policies and strategies for each of the
    Company’s pension plans are determined periodically by
    pension trustees for each plan, having regard for the potential
    risks and returns offered by investment in the various assets
    available. Target asset allocation and investment return
    criteria are established by the trustees with the overriding
    objective of stable earnings growth. Actual results are
    monitored against those targets and the trustees are required to
    report to the members of each plan, including an analysis of
    investment performance on an annual basis at a minimum.

Day-to-day

asset management is typically performed by a third party asset
    management company, reporting to the pension trustees. The
    long-term rate of return on plan asset assumptions used to
    determine pension expense under U.S. GAAP are generally
    based on historical investment performance and the target
    investment return criteria for the future determined by the
    trustees.

The Company has recorded valuation allowances related to certain
    of its deferred income tax assets due to the uncertainty of the
    ultimate realization of future benefits from such assets. The
    potential decrease or increase of the valuation allowance in the
    near term is dependent on the future ability of the Company to
    realize the deferred tax assets that are affected by the future
    profitability of operations in various worldwide jurisdictions.
    During 2006, the Company incurred a $10.5 million charge
    related to the establishment of a valuation allowance for
    foreign tax credit carryforwards described below.
    $4.4 million of the Company’s total valuation
    allowance will be credited to shareholders’ equity if and
    when realized.

At December 31, 2006, for U.S. federal income tax
    purposes, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of
    $0.3 million that expire in various amounts through 2021.
    The Company has various U.S. state net operating losses and
    various foreign net operating losses that have various
    expiration periods.

The Company has undistributed earnings of non-US subsidiaries
    and currently believes that there will be no cost associated
    with the repatriation of such foreign earnings. The Company
    plans to repatriate $100 million of such earnings in future
    years. All other undistributed earnings are considered to be
    permanently reinvested.

During the third quarter of 2006, the Company implemented a
    legal reorganization that resulted in a reduction of the
    estimated annual effective tax rate before discrete items from
    30% to 27%. In addition to the change in the Company’s
    annual effective tax rate, the Company recorded three discrete
    tax items: a charge of $10.5 million related to the
    establishment of a valuation allowance on foreign tax credit
    carryforwards, a benefit of $13.4 million associated with a
    reduction of a liability previously established for estimated
    costs to

repatriate unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries and a
    favorable tax law change resulting in a benefit of
    $5.1 million.

As a result of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, the
    Company repatriated $396 million of cash during 2005 that
    had been generated over time by its foreign operations. As a
    result of this repatriation, the Company recorded additional
    income tax expense of $13.1 million. This amount reflects
    the federal tax impact in the United States (including certain
    state taxes) of $12.3 million, foreign withholding taxes of
    $2.0 million and a net decrease of $1.2 million of
    deferred tax liabilities associated with the reassessment of
    pre-existing and future dividend repatriations. In addition, the
    Company recorded tax benefits of $7.7 million related to
    the favorable resolution of certain tax matters.

The Company is currently under examination in various taxing
    jurisdictions in which it conducts business operations. While
    the Company has not yet received any material assessments from
    these taxing authorities, the Company believes that adequate
    amounts of taxes and related interest and penalties have been
    provided for any adverse adjustments as a result of these
    examinations and that the ultimate outcome of these examinations
    will not result in a material impact on the Company’s
    consolidated results of operations or financial position.

OTHER (INCOME)
    CHARGES, NET

Other (income) charges, net consists primarily of interest
    income, (gains) losses from foreign currency transactions,
    (gains) losses from sales of assets and other items.

In 2005, other (income) charges, net includes a
    $21.8 million charge related to litigation. In June of
    2005, the Company wrote off a non-cash $19.9 million
    ($12 million after tax) intangible asset relating to an
    intellectual property license that was subject to litigation
    with the grantor which is included as a component of Other and
    Deferred taxes in the interim consolidated statements of cash
    flows. This license enabled a wholly owned subsidiary of the
    Company exclusive rights to distribute certain third-party
    manufactured pipettes in the United States. A judgment entered
    on June 6, 2005 terminated the license agreement and
    awarded damages to the other party. The Company also incurred
    $1.9 million of related legal costs during the three months
    ended June 30, 2005, which includes damages of
    $0.6 million due to the grantor. The damages of
    $0.6 million were subsequently reversed during 2006.

Legal

The Company is party to various legal proceedings, including

    of business. Management does not expect that any of such
    proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s financial condition or results of operations.

SEGMENT
    REPORTING

Operating segments are the individual reporting units within the
    Company. These units are managed separately, and it is at this
    level where the determination of resource allocation is made.
    The units have been aggregated based on operating segments in
    geographic regions that have similar economic characteristics
    and meet the aggregation criteria of SFAS No. 131,
    “Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
    Information” (“SFAS 131”). The Company has
    determined there are five reportable segments:
    U.S. Operations, Swiss Operations, Western European
    Operations, Chinese Operations, and Other. Prior year segment
    information has been restated to conform with current period
    presentation.

U.S. Operations represent certain of the Company’s
    marketing and producing organizations located in the United
    States. Western European Operations include the Company’s
    marketing and producing organizations in Western Europe,
    excluding operations located in Switzerland. Swiss Operations
    include marketing and producing organizations located in
    Switzerland as well as extensive R&D operations that are
    responsible for the development, production and marketing of
    precision instruments, including weighing, analytical and
    measurement technologies for use in a variety of industrial and
    laboratory applications. Chinese Operations represents the
    Company’s marketing and producing organizations located in
    China. The Company’s market organizations are
    geographically focused and are responsible for all aspects of
    the Company’s sales and service. Operating segments that
    exist outside these reportable segments are included in Other.

The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same
    as those described in the summary of significant accounting
    policies. The Company evaluates performance based on segment
    profit for segment reporting (gross profit less research and
    development, selling, general and administrative expenses and
    restructuring charges, before amortization, interest, other
    charges and taxes). Inter-segment sales and transfers are priced
    to reflect consideration of market conditions and the
    regulations of the countries in which the transferring entities
    are located. The following tables show the operations of the
    Company’s operating segments:

RELATED PARTY
    TRANSACTIONS

As part of the Rainin acquisition, the Company entered into an
    agreement to lease certain property from the former owner and
    former General Manager of Rainin. During the years ended
    December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company made lease
    payments with respect to this agreement of $2.6 million,
    $2.5 million and $2.3 million, respectively. In
    addition, Rainin continued to purchase certain products from its
    former owner. During the years ended December 31, 2005 and
    2004, the volume of these purchases was $0.1 million and
    $0.8 million, respectively. The formal agreement to
    purchase these products was terminated during the third quarter
    of 2004. This termination did not have a material impact on the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements. All of the
    Company’s transactions with the former owner of Rainin were
    in the normal course of business.
