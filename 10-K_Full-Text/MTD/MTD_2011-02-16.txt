    pharmaceutical and other industries.

Our business is geographically diversified, with net sales in
    2010 derived 37% from Europe, 36% from North and South America
    and 27% from Asia and other countries. Our customer base is also
    diversified by industry and by individual customer.

Mettler-Toledo International Inc. was incorporated as a Delaware
    corporation in 1991 and became a publicly traded company with
    its initial public offering in 1997.

Business
    Segments

We have five reportable segments: U.S. Operations, Swiss
    Operations, Western European Operations, Chinese Operations and
    Other. See Note 18 to the audited consolidated financial
    statements and Item 7. Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under
    “Results of Operations — by Operating
    Segment” included herein for detailed results by segment
    and geographic region.

We manufacture a wide variety of precision instruments and
    provide value-added services to our customers. Our principal
    products and principal services are set forth below. We have
    followed this description of our products and services with
    descriptions of our customers and distribution, sales and
    service, research and development, manufacturing and certain
    other matters. These descriptions apply to substantially all of
    our products and related segments.

Laboratory
    Instruments

We make a wide variety of precision laboratory instruments,
    including laboratory balances, pipettes, titrators, thermal
    analysis systems and other analytical instruments. The
    laboratory instruments business accounted for approximately 46%
    of our net sales in 2010 and 2009 and 44% in 2008.

Laboratory
    Balances

Our laboratory balances have weighing ranges from one
    ten-millionth of a gram up to 64 kilograms. To cover a wide
    range of customer needs and price points, we market our balances
    in a range of product tiers offering different levels of
    functionality. Based on the same technology platform, we also
    manufacture mass comparators, which are used by weights and
    measures regulators as well as laboratories to ensure the
    accuracy of reference weights. Laboratory balances are primarily
    used in the pharmaceutical, food, chemical, cosmetics and other
    industries.

Also included in our offerings is Quantos, an automated powder
    dosing solution for small sample sizes, which is controlled and
    monitored by the balance. The first step in sample preparation
    for analytical methods is precise weighing of substances, which
    has traditionally been done by hand using a spatula. The Quantos
    dosing system offers automated measuring performance of 200
    grams to 0.005 milligrams.

Pipettes

Pipettes are used in laboratories for dispensing small volumes
    of liquids. We operate our pipette business with the Rainin
    brand name. Rainin develops, manufactures and distributes
    advanced pipettes, tips and accessories, including single- and
    multi-channel manual and electronic pipettes. Rainin maintains
    service centers in the key markets where customers periodically
    send their pipettes for certified recalibrations. Rainin’s
    principal end markets are pharmaceutical, biotech and academia.



Analytical
    Instruments

Titrators measure the chemical composition of samples and are
    used in environmental and research laboratories as well as in
    quality control labs in the pharmaceutical, food and beverage
    and other industries. Our high-end titrators are multi-tasking
    models, which can perform two determinations simultaneously on
    multiple vessels. Our offering includes robotics to automate
    routine work in quality control applications.

Thermal analysis systems measure material properties as a
    function of temperature, such as weight, dimension, energy flow
    and viscoelastic properties. Thermal analysis systems are used
    in nearly every industry, but primarily in the plastics and
    polymer industries and increasingly in the pharmaceutical
    industry.

pH meters measure acidity in laboratory samples. We also sell
    density and refractometry instruments, which measure chemical
    concentrations in solutions. In addition, we manufacture and
    sell moisture analyzers, which precisely determine the moisture
    content of a sample by utilizing an infrared dryer to evaporate
    moisture.

Laboratory
    Software

LabX, our PC-based laboratory software platform, manages and
    analyzes data generated by our balances, titrators, pH meters,
    moisture analyzers and other analytical instruments. LabX
    provides full network capability; has efficient, intuitive
    protocols; and enables customers to collect and archive data in
    compliance with the U.S. Food and Drug
    Administration’s traceability requirements for
    electronically stored data (also known as 21 CFR
    Part 11).

Automated
    Chemistry Solutions

Our current automated chemistry solutions focus on selected
    applications in the chemical and drug discovery process. Our
    automated lab reactors and in situ analysis systems are
    considered integral to the process development and

scale-up

    technologies based on infrared and laser light scattering
    enables customers to monitor chemical reactions and
    crystallization processes in real time in the lab and plant. We
    believe that our portfolio of integrated technologies can bring
    significant efficiencies to the development process, enabling
    our customers to bring new chemicals and drugs to market faster.

Process
    Analytics

Our process analytics business provides instruments for the
    in-line measurement of liquid parameters used primarily in the
    production process of pharmaceutical, biotech, beverage,
    microelectronics, chemical and refining companies. Approximately
    half of our process analytics sales are to the pharmaceutical
    and biotech markets, where our customers need fast and secure

scale-up

and
    production that meets the validation processes required for GMP
    (Good Manufacturing Processes) and other regulatory standards.
    We are a leading solution provider for liquid analytical
    measurement to control and optimize production processes. Our
    solutions include sensor technology for measuring pH, dissolved
    oxygen, carbon dioxide, conductivity, turbidity, ozone and total
    organic carbons and automated systems for calibration and
    cleaning of measurement points. Intelligent sensor diagnostics
    capabilities enable improved asset management solutions for our
    customers to reduce process downtime and maintenance costs. Our
    instruments offer leading multi-parameter capabilities and
    plant-wide control system integration, which are key for
    integrated measurement of multiple parameters to secure
    production quality and efficiency. With a worldwide network of
    specialists, we support customers in critical process
    applications, compliance and systems integration questions.

Industrial
    Instruments

We manufacture numerous industrial weighing instruments and
    related terminals and offer dedicated software solutions for the
    pharmaceutical, chemical, food and other industries. In
    addition, we manufacture metal detection and other

end-of-line

inspection systems used in production and packaging. We supply
    automatic identification and data capture solutions, which
    integrate in-motion weighing, dimensioning and identification
    technologies for transport, shipping and logistics customers. We
    also offer heavy industrial scales and related software. The
    industrial instruments business accounted for approximately 43%
    of our net sales in 2010, 42% in 2009 and 43% in 2008.



Industrial
    Weighing Instruments

We offer a comprehensive line of industrial scales and balances,
    such as bench scales and floor scales, for weighing loads from a
    few grams to several thousand kilograms in applications ranging
    from measuring materials in chemical production to weighing
    packages. Our products are used in a wide range of applications,
    such as counting applications and in formulating and mixing
    ingredients.

Industrial
    Terminals

Our industrial scale terminals collect data and integrate it
    into manufacturing processes, helping to automate them. Our
    terminals allow users to remotely download programs or access
    setup data and can minimize downtime through predictive rather
    than reactive maintenance.

Transportation
    and Logistics

We are a leading global supplier of automatic identification and
    data capture solutions, which integrate in-motion weighing,
    dimensioning and identification technologies. With these
    solutions, customers can measure the weight and cubic volume of
    packages for appropriate billing, logistics and quality control.
    Our solutions also integrate into customers’ information
    systems.

Vehicle Scale
    Systems

Our primary heavy industrial products are scales for weighing
    trucks or railcars (i.e., weighing bulk goods as they enter or
    leave a factory or at a toll station). Heavy industrial scales
    are capable of measuring weights up to 500 tons and permit
    accurate weighing under extreme environmental conditions. We
    also offer advanced computer software that can be used with our
    heavy industrial scales to facilitate a broad range of customer
    solutions and provides a complete system for managing vehicle
    transaction processing.

Industrial
    Software

We offer software that can be used with our industrial
    instruments. Examples include FreeWeigh.Net, statistical quality
    control software, Formweigh.Net, our formulation/batching
    software and OverDrive, which supports the operation of vehicle
    scales. FreeWeigh.Net and Formweigh.Net provide full network
    capability and enable customers to collect and archive data in
    compliance with 21 CFR Part 11.

Product
    Inspection

Increasing safety and consumer protection requirements are
    driving the need for more sophisticated

end-of-line

inspection systems (e.g., for use in food processing and
    packaging, pharmaceutical and other industries). We are a
    leading global provider of metal detectors, x-ray and
    camera-based visioning equipment and checkweighers that are used
    in these industries. Metal detectors are most commonly used to
    detect fine particles of metal that may be contained in raw
    materials or may be generated by the manufacturing process
    itself. X-ray-based vision inspection helps detect non-metallic
    contamination, such as glass, stones and pits, which enter the
    manufacturing process for similar reasons. Our x-ray systems can
    also detect metal in metallized containers and can be used for
    mass control. We also provide vision inspection solutions that
    provide in-line inspection of package quality and content and
    enable our customers to implement traceability and serialization
    tracking, which are needs for food and beverage, consumer goods
    and pharmaceutical companies. Checkweighers are used to control
    the filling content of packaged goods such as food,
    pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. Both x-ray and metal detection
    systems may be used together with checkweighers as components of
    integrated packaging lines. FreeWeigh.Net is our statistical and
    quality control software that optimizes package filling,
    monitors weight-related data and integrates it in real time into
    customers’ enterprise resource planning

and/or

process control systems.

Retail Weighing
    Solutions

Supermarkets, hypermarkets and other food retail businesses make
    use of multiple weighing and food labeling solutions for
    handling fresh goods (such as meats, vegetables, fruits and
    cheeses). We offer stand-alone scales for basic counter weighing
    and pricing, price finding and printing. In addition, we offer
    networked scales and software, which can integrate backroom,
    counter, self-service and checkout functions and can incorporate
    fresh goods item data into a supermarket’s overall food
    item and inventory management



system. Customer benefits are in the areas of pricing,
    merchandising, inventory management and regulatory compliance.
    Our instruments have been expanded to allow in-store marketing
    which permits customers to make more decisions at the point of
    sale. The retail business accounted for approximately 11% of our
    net sales in 2010, 12% in 2009 and 13% in 2008.

Customers and
    Distribution

Our principal customers include companies in the following key
    end markets: the life science industry (pharmaceutical and
    biotech companies, as well as independent research
    organizations); food and beverage producers; food retailers;
    chemical, specialty chemicals and cosmetics companies; the
    transportation and logistics industry; the metals industry; the
    electronics industry; and the academic community.

Our products are sold through a variety of distribution
    channels. Generally, more technically sophisticated products are
    sold through our direct sales force, while less complicated
    products are sold through indirect channels. Our sales through
    direct channels exceed our sales through indirect channels. A
    significant portion of our sales in the Americas is generated
    through indirect channels, including sales of our
    “Ohaus” branded products. Ohaus branded products
    target markets, such as the educational market, in which
    customers are interested in lower cost, a more limited set of
    features and less comprehensive support and service.

We have a diversified customer base, with no single customer
    accounting for more than 2% of 2010 net sales.

Sales and
    Service

Market
    Organizations

We maintain geographically focused market organizations around
    the world that are responsible for all aspects of our sales and
    service. The market organizations are customer-focused, with an
    emphasis on building and maintaining value-added relationships
    with customers in our target market segments. Each market
    organization has the ability to leverage best practices from
    other units while maintaining the flexibility to adapt its
    marketing and service efforts to account for different cultural
    and economic conditions. Market organizations also work closely
    with our producing organizations (described below) by providing
    feedback on manufacturing and product development initiatives,
    new product and application ideas and information about key
    market segments.

We have one of the largest and broadest global sales and service
    organizations among precision instrument manufacturers. At
    December 31, 2010, our sales and service group consisted of
    approximately 5,500 employees in sales, marketing and
    customer service (including related administration) and
    post-sales technical service, located in 35 countries. This
    field organization has the capability to provide service and
    support to our customers and distributors in major markets
    across the globe. This is important because our customers
    increasingly seek to do business with a consistent global
    approach.

Service

Our service business remains successful with a focus on repair
    services as well as further expansion of our offerings to
    include value-added services for a range of market needs,
    including regulatory compliance qualification, calibration,
    certification and preventative maintenance. We have a unique
    offering to our pharmaceutical customers in promoting use of our
    instruments in compliance with FDA regulations, and we can
    provide these services regardless of the customer’s
    location around the world. This global service network is also
    an important factor in our ability to expand in emerging
    markets. We estimate that we have the largest installed base of
    weighing instruments in the world. Service (representing service
    contracts, repairs and replacement parts) accounted for
    approximately 23% of our net sales in 2010, 25% in 2009 and 22%
    in 2008. A significant portion of this amount is derived from
    the sale of replacement parts.

Beyond revenue opportunities, we believe service is a key part
    of our solution offering and helps significantly in customer
    retention. The close relationships and frequent contact with our
    large customer base provide us with sales opportunities and
    innovative product and application ideas.



Research and
    Development and Manufacturing

Producing
    Organizations

Our research, product development and manufacturing efforts are
    organized into a number of producing organizations. Our focused
    producing organizations help reduce product development time and
    costs, improve customer focus and maintain technological
    leadership. The producing organizations work together to share
    ideas and best practices, and there is a close interface and
    coordinated customer interaction among marketing organizations
    and producing organizations.

Research and
    Development

We continue to invest in product innovation to provide
    technologically advanced products to our customers for existing
    and new applications. Over the last three years, we have
    invested $289.0 million in research and development
    ($97.0 million in 2010, $89.7 million in 2009 and
    $102.3 million in 2008). In 2010, we spent approximately
    4.9% of net sales on research and development. Our research and
    development efforts fall into two categories:

•

technology advancements, which generate new products and
    increase the value of our products. These advancements may be in
    the form of enhanced or new functionality, new applications for
    our technologies, more accurate or reliable measurement,
    additional software capability or automation through robotics or
    other means, which allow us to design products more specific to
    the needs of the industries we serve, and

•

cost reductions, which reduce the manufacturing cost of our
    products through better overall design.

We devote a substantial proportion of our research and
    development budget to software development. This includes
    software to process the signals captured by the sensors of our
    instruments, application-specific software and software that
    connects our solutions into customers’ existing IT systems.
    We closely integrate research and development with marketing,
    manufacturing and product engineering. We have approximately
    1,000 employees in research and development and product
    engineering in countries around the globe.

Manufacturing

We are a worldwide manufacturer, with facilities principally
    located in China, Germany, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and
    the United States. Laboratory instruments are produced mainly in
    Switzerland and to a lesser extent in the United States and
    China, while our remaining products are manufactured worldwide.
    We emphasize product quality in our manufacturing operations,
    and most of our products require very strict tolerances and
    exact specifications. We use an extensive quality control system
    that is integrated into each step of the manufacturing process.
    All major manufacturing facilities have achieved ISO 9001
    certification. We believe that our manufacturing capacity is
    sufficient to meet our present and currently anticipated demand.

We generally manufacture only critical components, which are
    components that contain proprietary technology. When outside
    manufacturing is more efficient, we contract with other
    manufacturers for certain nonproprietary components. We use a
    wide range of suppliers. We believe our supply arrangements are
    adequate and that there are no material constraints on the
    sources and availability of materials. From time to time we may
    rely on a single supplier for all of our requirements of a
    particular component. Supply arrangements for electronic
    components are generally made globally.

Backlog;
    Seasonality

Our manufacturing turnaround time is generally short, which
    permits us to manufacture orders to fill for most of our
    products. Backlog is generally a function of requested customer
    delivery dates and is typically no longer than one to two months.

Our business has historically experienced a slight amount of
    seasonal variation, particularly the high-end laboratory
    instruments business. Traditionally, sales in the first quarter
    are slightly lower than, and sales in the fourth quarter are
    slightly higher than, sales in the second and third quarters.
    Fourth quarter sales have historically generated approximately
    26% to 30% of our net sales. This trend has a somewhat greater
    effect on income from operations than on net sales because fixed
    costs are spread evenly across all quarters.



Employees

Our total workforce including employees and temporary personnel
    as of December 31, 2010 was approximately 11,200 throughout
    the world, including approximately 4,400 in Europe, 3,000 in
    North and South America and 3,800 in Asia and other countries.

We believe our employee relations are good, and we have not
    suffered any material employee work stoppage or strike during
    the last five years. Labor unions do not represent a meaningful
    number of our employees.

Sustainability —
    GreenMT

We have long felt it is important to be an environmentally
    conscious company. We believe this philosophy has lead to a
    strong recognition in our organization for the importance of the
    topics and strong track record of environmental consciousness in
    how we run our business. For example, our product manufacturing
    processes are clean and efficient, and our products are designed
    to minimize energy consumption as well as help our customers to
    be “green” through better yield and reduced waste. We
    want to gain a broader awareness of all the ways our business
    affects the environment and society and to ensure we are
    continuously improving our practices. In 2010, we initiated a
    formal program to pursue these ambitions called GreenMT. GreenMT
    is considered a key strategic program for the Company.

Blue Ocean
    Program

“Blue Ocean” refers to our program to establish a new
    global operating model, with standardized, automated and
    integrated processes, with high levels of global data
    transparency. It will encompass a new enterprise architecture,
    with a global, single instance ERP system. Within our IT systems
    we are moving toward integrated, homogeneous applications and
    common data structures. We will also largely standardize our key
    business processes. The implementation of the systems and
    processes will proceed on a staggered basis over a several year
    period with the initial go-live rollout having occurred in 2010.
    We expect the incremental capitalized project costs associated
    with Blue Ocean to approximate $20 million on an annual
    basis over the next five years. This amount may change based
    upon fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We expect the
    return on this investment when complete to include reduced
    operating costs and working capital requirements.

Intellectual
    Property

We hold over 4,000 patents and trademarks (including pending
    applications), primarily in the United States, Switzerland,
    Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, France, Japan, China, South
    Korea, Brazil and India. Our products generally incorporate a
    wide variety of technological innovations, some of which are
    protected by patents of various durations. Products are
    generally not protected as a whole by individual patents, and as
    a result, no one patent or group of related patents is material
    to our business. We have numerous trademarks, including the
    Mettler-Toledo name and logo, which are material to our
    business. We regularly protect against infringement of our
    intellectual property.

Regulation

Our products are subject to various regulatory standards and
    approvals by weights and measures regulatory authorities. All of
    our electrical components are subject to electrical safety
    standards. We believe that we are in compliance in all material
    respects with applicable regulations.

Approvals are required to ensure our instruments do not
    impermissibly influence other instruments and are themselves not
    affected by other instruments. In addition, some of our products
    are used in “legal for trade” applications, in which
    prices based on weight are calculated and for which specific
    weights and measures approvals are required. Although there are
    a large number of regulatory agencies across our markets, there
    is an increasing trend toward harmonization of standards, and
    weights and measures regulation is harmonized across the
    European Union.

Our products may also be subject to special requirements
    depending on the end-user and market. For example, laboratory
    customers are typically subject to Good Laboratory Practices
    (GLP), industrial customers to Good Manufacturing Practices
    (GMP), pharmaceutical customers to U.S. Food and Drug
    Administration



(FDA) regulations, and customers in food processing industries
    may be subject to Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point
    (HACCP) regulations. Products used in hazardous environments may
    also be subject to special requirements.

Environmental
    Matters

We are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the
    jurisdictions in which we operate. We own or lease a number of
    properties and manufacturing facilities around the world. Like
    many of our competitors, we have incurred, and will continue to
    incur, capital and operating expenditures and other costs in
    complying with such laws and regulations.

We are currently involved in, or have potential liability with
    respect to, the remediation of past contamination in certain of
    our facilities. A former subsidiary of Mettler-Toledo, Inc.
    (“MTI”) known as Hi-Speed Checkweigher Co., Inc.
    (“Hi-Speed”) was one of two private parties ordered by
    the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection
    (“NJDEP”), in an administrative consent order
    (“ACO”) signed on June 13, 1988, to investigate
    and remediate certain ground water contamination at certain
    property in Landing, New Jersey. After the other party ordered
    under this ACO failed to fulfill its obligations, Hi-Speed
    became solely responsible for compliance with the ACO. Residual
    ground water contamination at this site is now within a
    Classification Exception Area (“CEA”) which NJDEP has
    approved and within which MTI oversees monitoring of the decay
    of contaminants of concern. A concurrent Well Restriction Area
    also exists for the site. The NJDEP does not view these vehicles
    as remedial measures, but rather as “institutional
    controls” that must be adequately maintained and
    periodically evaluated. NJDEP has informally told MTI to expect
    a claim for natural resource damages (“NRD”) regarding
    this site but has not yet made such a claim. In 2010, testing of
    indoor air at certain buildings within the site led to the
    installation of a vapor intrusion mitigation system at one
    building. We estimate that the costs of compliance associated
    with the site over the next six years will approximate
    $0.6 million.

In addition, certain of our present and former facilities have
    or had been in operation for many decades and, over such time,
    some of these facilities may have used substances or generated
    and disposed of wastes which are or may be considered hazardous.
    It is possible that these sites, as well as disposal sites owned
    by third parties to which we have sent wastes, may in the future
    be identified and become the subject of remediation. Although we
    believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable
    environmental requirements and, to date, we have not incurred
    material expenditures in connection with environmental matters,
    it is possible that we could become subject to additional
    environmental liabilities in the future that could have a
    material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of
    operations or cash flows.

Competition

Our markets are highly competitive. Many of the markets in which
    we compete are fragmented both geographically and by
    application, particularly the industrial and food retailing
    markets. As a result, we face numerous regional or specialized
    competitors, many of which are well established in their
    markets. For example, some of our competitors are divisions of
    larger companies with potentially greater financial and other
    resources than our own. In addition, some of our competitors are
    domiciled in emerging markets and may have a lower cost
    structure than ours. We are confronted with new competitors in
    emerging markets who, although relatively small in size today,
    could become larger companies in their home markets. Given the
    sometimes significant growth rates of these emerging markets,
    and in light of their cost advantage over developed markets,
    emerging market competitors could become more significant global
    competitors. Taken together, the competitive forces present in
    our markets can impair our operating margins in certain product
    lines and geographic markets.

We expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and
    performance of their products and to introduce new products with
    competitive prices. Although we believe that we have
    technological and other competitive advantages over many of our
    competitors, we may not be able to realize and maintain these
    advantages. These advantages include our worldwide market
    leadership positions; our global brand and reputation; our track
    record of technological innovation; our comprehensive,
    high-quality solution offering; our global sales and service
    offering; our large installed base of weighing instruments; and
    the diversification of our revenue base by geographic region,
    product range and customer. To remain competitive, we must



continue to invest in research and development, sales and
    marketing and customer service and support. We cannot be sure
    that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make these
    investments or that we will be successful in identifying,
    developing and maintaining any competitive advantages.

We believe the principal competitive factors in developed
    markets for purchasing decisions are the product itself,
    application support, service support and price. In emerging
    markets, where there is greater demand for less sophisticated
    products, price is a more important factor than in developed
    markets. Competition in the U.S. laboratory market is also
    influenced by the presence of large distributors that sell not
    only our products but those of our competitors as well.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

Factors Affecting
    Our Future Operating Results

The majority of
    our business is derived from companies in developed countries.
    Continued economic uncertainty in these countries may adversely
    affect our operating results.

Although the percentage of our sales coming from emerging
    markets is growing, the majority of our business is still
    derived from companies in developed countries. Because our
    customers often decrease or delay capital expenditures in
    difficult economic times, economic downturns or recessions in
    developed countries adversely affect our operating results.
    Customers may also purchase lower-cost products made by
    competitors and not resume purchasing our products even after
    economic conditions improve. These conditions would reduce our
    revenues and profitability.

We are subject to
    certain risks associated with our international operations and
    fluctuating conditions in emerging markets.

We conduct business in many countries, including emerging
    markets in Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe, and these
    operations represent a significant portion of our sales and
    earnings. For example, our Chinese operations account for
    $298.6 million of sales to external customers and
    $93.0 million of segment profit during 2010. In addition to
    the currency risks discussed below, international operations
    pose other substantial risks and problems for us. For instance,
    various local jurisdictions in which we operate may revise or
    alter their respective legal and regulatory requirements. In
    addition, we may encounter one or more of the following
    obstacles or risks:

•

tariffs and trade barriers;

•

difficulties in staffing and managing local operations

and/or

mandatory salary increases for local employees;

•

credit risks arising from financial difficulties facing local
    customers and distributors;

•

difficulties in protecting intellectual property;

•

nationalization of private enterprises which may result in the
    confiscation of assets as we hold significant assets around the
    world in the form of property, plant and equipment, inventory
    and accounts receivable, as well as $105.5 million of cash
    at December 31, 2010 in our Chinese subsidiaries;

•

restrictions on investments

and/or

limitations regarding foreign ownership;

•

adverse tax consequences, including tax disputes, imposition or
    increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other
    payments by subsidiaries; and

•

other uncertain local economic, political and social conditions,
    including hyper-inflationary conditions or periods of low or no
    productivity growth.

We must also comply with a variety of regulations regarding the
    conversion and repatriation of funds earned in local currencies.
    For example, converting earnings from our operations in China
    into other currencies and repatriating these funds require
    governmental approvals. If we cannot comply with these or other
    applicable regulations, we may face increased difficulties in
    utilizing cash flow generated by these operations outside of
    China.

While business activity in emerging markets improved during
    2010, fluctuating economic conditions may continue to affect our
    results of operations in these markets for the foreseeable
    future. Certain emerging markets have also experienced currency
    devaluations and inflationary prices. Economic problems in
    individual markets can also spread to other economies, adding to
    the adverse conditions we may face in emerging markets. We
    remain committed to emerging markets, particularly those in
    Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe. However, fluctuating
    economic conditions may adversely affect our results of
    operations in these markets.



We operate in
    highly competitive markets, and it may be difficult to preserve
    operating margins, gain market share and maintain a
    technological advantage.

Our markets are highly competitive. Many of the markets in which
    we compete are fragmented both geographically and by
    application, particularly the industrial and food retailing
    markets. As a result, we face numerous regional or specialized
    competitors, many of which are well established in their
    markets. In addition, some of our competitors are divisions of
    larger companies with potentially greater financial and other
    resources than our own. Some of our competitors are domiciled or
    operate in emerging markets and may have a lower cost structure
    than ours. We are confronted with new competitors in emerging
    markets who, although relatively small in size today, could
    become larger companies in their home markets. Given the
    sometimes significant growth rates of these emerging markets,
    and in light of their cost advantage over developed markets,
    emerging market competitors could become more significant global
    competitors. Taken together, the competitive forces present in
    our markets can impair our operating margins in certain product
    lines and geographic markets. We expect our competitors to
    continue to improve the design and performance of their products
    and to introduce new products with competitive prices. Although
    we believe that we have certain technological and other
    advantages over our competitors, we may not be able to realize
    and maintain these advantages.

We are vulnerable
    to system failures, which could harm our business.

We rely on our technology infrastructure, among other functions,
    to interact with suppliers, sell our products and services,
    support our customers, fulfill orders and bill, collect and make
    payments. Our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption
    from natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures,
    terrorist attacks, computer viruses, computer

denial-of-service

attacks and other events. When we upgrade or change systems, we
    may suffer interruptions in service, loss of data or reduced
    functionality. A significant number of our systems are not
    redundant, and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient
    for every eventuality. Despite any precautions we may take, such
    problems could result in, among other consequences,
    interruptions in our services, which could harm our reputation
    and financial condition. We do not carry business interruption
    insurance sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result
    from interruptions in our services as a result of system
    failures.

We also are in the process of implementing our Blue Ocean
    program, a program to globalize our business processes and
    information technology systems that includes the implementation
    of a Company-wide enterprise resource planning system. The
    implementation of this program will proceed on a staggered basis
    over a several year period with the initial go-live rollout
    having occurred in 2010. If the implementation of any unit is
    flawed, we could suffer interruptions in operations and
    customer-facing activities which could harm our reputation and
    financial condition, or cause us to lose data, experience
    reduced functionality or have delays in reporting financial
    information. It may take us longer to implement the Blue Ocean
    program than we have planned, and the project may cost us more
    than we have estimated, either of which would negatively impact
    our ability to generate cost savings or other efficiencies. In
    addition, the implementation of Blue Ocean will increase our
    reliance on a single information technology system which would
    have greater consequences should we experience a system
    disruption.

Our ability to
    deliver products and services may be disrupted.

An interruption in our business due to events such as
    disruptions with our supply chain, natural disasters, pandemics
    or other health crises, fires or explosions may cause us to
    temporarily be unable to deliver products or services to our
    customers. It may be expensive to resolve these issues, even
    though some of these risks are covered by insurance policies.
    More importantly, customers may switch to competitors and may
    not return to us even if we resolve the interruption.

Our product
    development efforts may not produce commercially viable products
    in a timely manner.

We must introduce new products and enhancements in a timely
    manner, or our products could become technologically obsolete
    over time, which would harm our operating results. To remain
    competitive, we must



continue to make significant investments in research and
    development, sales and marketing and customer service and
    support. We cannot be sure that we will have sufficient
    resources to continue to make these investments. In developing
    new products, we may be required to make substantial investments
    before we can determine their commercial viability. As a result,
    we may not be successful in developing new products and we may
    never realize the benefits of our research and development
    activities.

A widespread
    outbreak of an illness or other health issue could negatively
    affect our business, making it more difficult and expensive to
    meet our obligations to our customers, and could result in
    reduced demand from our customers.

In recent years, a number of countries have experienced
    outbreaks of the H1N1 influenza (swine flu) or, in the Asia
    Pacific region, outbreaks of SARS

and/or

avian
    influenza (bird flu). Despite the implementation of certain
    precautions, we are susceptible to such outbreaks. As a result
    of such outbreaks, businesses can be shut down and individuals
    can become ill or quarantined. Outbreaks of infectious diseases
    such as these, particularly in North America, Europe, China or
    other locations significant to our operations, could adversely
    affect general commercial activity, which could have a material
    adverse effect on our financial condition, results of
    operations, business or prospects. If our operations are
    curtailed because of health issues, we may need to seek
    alternate sources of supply for services and staff and these
    alternate sources may be more expensive. Alternate sources may
    not be available or may result in delays in shipments to our
    customers, each of which would affect our results of operations.
    In addition, a curtailment of our product design operations
    could result in delays in the development of new products.
    Further, if our customers’ businesses are affected by
    health issues, they might delay or reduce purchases from us,
    which could adversely affect our results of operations.

A prolonged
    downturn or additional consolidation in the pharmaceutical,
    food, food retailing and chemical industries could adversely
    affect our operating results.

Our products are used extensively in the pharmaceutical, food
    and beverage and chemical industries. Consolidation in the
    pharmaceutical and chemical industries hurt our sales in prior
    years. A prolonged economic downturn or additional consolidation
    in any of these industries could adversely affect our operating
    results. In addition, the capital spending policies of our
    customers in these industries are based on a variety of factors
    we cannot control, including the resources available for
    purchasing equipment, the spending priorities among various
    types of equipment and policies regarding capital expenditures.
    Any decrease or delay in capital spending by our customers would
    cause our revenues to decline and could harm our profitability.

We may face risks
    associated with future acquisitions.

We may pursue acquisitions of complementary product lines,
    technologies or businesses. Acquisitions involve numerous risks,
    including difficulties in the assimilation of the acquired
    operations, technologies and products; diversion of
    management’s attention from other business concerns; and
    potential departures of key employees of the acquired company.
    If we successfully identify acquisitions in the future,
    completing such acquisitions may result in new issuances of our
    stock that may be dilutive to current owners, increases in our
    debt and contingent liabilities and additional amortization
    expense related to intangible assets. Any of these
    acquisition-related risks could have a material adverse effect
    on our profitability.

Larger companies have identified life sciences and instruments
    as businesses they will consider entering, which could change
    the competitive dynamics of these markets. In addition, we may
    not be able to identify, successfully complete or integrate
    potential acquisitions in the future. However, even if we can do
    so, we cannot be sure that these acquisitions will have a
    positive impact on our business or operating results.



If we cannot
    protect our intellectual property rights, or if we infringe or
    misappropriate the proprietary rights of others, our operating
    results could be harmed.

Our success depends on our ability to obtain and enforce patents
    on our technology, maintain our trademarks and protect our trade
    secrets. Our patents may not provide complete protection, and
    competitors may develop similar products that are not covered by
    our patents. Our patents may also be challenged by third parties
    and invalidated or narrowed. Competitors sometimes seek to take
    advantage of our trademarks or brands in ways that may create
    customer confusion or weaken our brand. Although we take
    measures to protect confidential information, improper use or
    disclosure of our trade secrets may still occur.

We may be sued for infringing on the intellectual property
    rights of others. The cost of any litigation could affect our
    profitability regardless of the outcome, and management
    attention could be diverted. If we are unsuccessful in such
    litigation, we may have to pay damages, stop the infringing
    activity

and/or

obtain a license. If we fail to obtain a required license, we
    may be unable to sell some of our products, which could result
    in a decline in our revenues.

Departures of key
    employees could impair our operations.

We generally have employment contracts with each of our key
    employees. Our executive officers own shares of our common stock

and/or

have
    options to purchase additional shares. Nevertheless, such
    individuals could leave the Company. If any key employees
    stopped working for us, our operations could be harmed.
    Important R&D personnel may leave and join competitors,
    which could substantially delay or hinder ongoing development
    projects. We have no key man life insurance policies with
    respect to any of our senior executives.

We may be
    adversely affected by environmental laws and
    regulations.

We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations,
    including those relating to air emissions, wastewater
    discharges, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous
    wastes and the remediation of contamination associated with the
    use and disposal of hazardous substances.

We incur expenditures in complying with environmental laws and
    regulations. We are currently involved in, or have potential
    liability with respect to, the remediation of past contamination
    in various facilities. In addition, some of our facilities are
    or have been in operation for many decades and may have used
    substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are
    hazardous or may be considered hazardous in the future. These
    sites and disposal sites owned by others to which we sent waste
    may in the future be identified as contaminated and require
    remediation. Accordingly, it is possible that we could become
    subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future
    that may harm our results of operations or financial condition.

We may be
    adversely affected by failure to comply with regulations of
    governmental agencies or by the adoption of new
    regulations.

Our products are subject to regulation by governmental agencies.
    These regulations govern a wide variety of activities relating
    to our products, from design and development, to product safety,
    labeling, manufacturing, promotion, sales and distribution. If
    we fail to comply with these regulations, or if new regulations
    are adopted that substantially change existing practice or
    impose new burdens, we may have to recall products and cease
    their manufacture and distribution. In addition, we could be
    subject to fines or criminal prosecution.

We may experience
    impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets.

As of December 31, 2010, our consolidated balance sheet
    included goodwill of $434.7 million and other intangible
    assets of $104.4 million.

Our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other
    intangible assets, which affect the amount of future period
    amortization expense and possible impairment expense. The
    determination of the



value of such intangible assets requires management to make
    estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial
    statements.

In accordance with U.S. GAAP, our goodwill and
    indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are
    evaluated for impairment annually in the fourth quarter, or more
    frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that
    an asset might be impaired. The evaluation is based on valuation
    models that estimate fair value based on expected future cash
    flows and profitability projections. In preparing the valuation
    models we consider a number of factors, including operating
    results, business plans, economic conditions, future cash flows,
    and transactions and market data. There are inherent
    uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in
    applying them to the impairment analyses. The significant
    estimates and assumptions within our fair value models include
    sales growth, controllable cost growth, perpetual growth,
    effective tax rates and discount rates. Our assessments to date
    have indicated that there has been no impairment of these assets.

Should any of these estimates or assumptions change, or should
    we incur

lower-than-expected

operating performance or cash flows, including from a prolonged
    economic slowdown, we may experience a triggering event that
    requires a new fair value assessment for our reporting units,
    possibly prior to the required annual assessment. These types of
    events and resulting analysis could result in impairment charges
    for goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets if the
    fair value estimate declines below the carrying value.

Our amortization expense related to intangible assets with
    finite lives may materially change should our estimates of their
    useful lives change.

Unanticipated
    changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax
    liabilities could impact our profitability.

We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and
    various other foreign jurisdictions, and our domestic and
    international tax liabilities are subject to allocation of
    expenses among different jurisdictions. Our effective tax rates
    could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings by
    jurisdiction, changes in tax laws or tax rates, changes in the
    valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and material
    adjustments from tax audits.

In particular, the carrying value of deferred tax assets, which
    are predominantly in the U.S., is dependent upon our ability to
    generate future taxable income in the U.S. In addition, the
    amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in
    various jurisdictions, and a material assessment by a governing
    tax authority could affect our profitability.

Currency
    fluctuations affect our operating profits.

Because we conduct operations in many countries, our operating
    income can be significantly affected by fluctuations in currency
    exchange rates. Swiss franc-denominated expenses represent a
    much greater percentage of our total operating expenses than
    Swiss franc-denominated sales represent of our total net sales.
    In part, this is because most of our manufacturing and product
    development costs in Switzerland relate to products that are
    sold outside Switzerland. In addition, we have a number of
    corporate functions located in Switzerland. Therefore, if the
    Swiss franc strengthens against all or most of our major trading
    currencies (e.g

.

, the U.S. dollar, the euro, other
    major European currencies, the Chinese yuan and the Japanese
    yen), our operating profit is reduced. We also have
    significantly more sales in euro than we have expenses.
    Therefore, when the euro weakens against the U.S. dollar
    and the Swiss franc, it also decreases our operating profits.
    Accordingly, the Swiss franc exchange rate to the euro is an
    important cross-rate that we monitor. We have seen higher
    volatility in exchange rates generally than in the past, and
    recently the Swiss franc has strengthened against the euro. The
    exchange rate between the Swiss franc and the euro was 1.39
    during 2010 as compared to 1.51 for the prior year, reflecting
    an 8% strengthening of the Swiss franc against the euro. The
    current exchange rate for the Swiss franc to the euro is 1.30 as
    of February 8, 2011, reflecting a 6% strengthening of the
    Swiss franc against the euro as compared to 2010. We estimate
    that a 1% strengthening of the Swiss franc against the euro
    would result in a decrease in our earnings before tax of
    $1.1 million to $1.8 million on an annual basis. In
    addition to the Swiss



franc and major European currencies, we also conduct business in
    many geographies throughout the world, including Asia Pacific,
    the United Kingdom, Eastern Europe, Latin America and Canada.
    Fluctuations in these currency exchange rates against the
    U.S. dollar can also affect our operating results. In
    addition to the effects of exchange rate movements on operating
    profits, our debt levels can fluctuate due to changes in
    exchange rates, particularly between the U.S. dollar and
    the Swiss franc. Based on our outstanding debt at
    December 31, 2010, we estimate that a 10% weakening of the
    U.S. dollar against the currencies in which our debt is
    denominated would result in an increase of approximately
    $9.5 million in the reported U.S. dollar value of the
    debt.

We have debt and
    we may incur substantially more debt, which could affect our
    ability to meet our debt obligations and may otherwise restrict
    our activities.

We have debt and we may incur substantial additional debt in the
    future. As of December 31, 2010, we had total indebtedness
    of approximately $233.6 million, net of cash of
    $447.6 million. We are also permitted by the terms of our
    debt instruments to incur substantial additional indebtedness,
    subject to the restrictions therein.

The existence and magnitude of our debt could have important
    consequences. For example, it could make it more difficult for
    us to satisfy our obligations under our debt instruments;
    require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to
    payments on our indebtedness, which would reduce the amount of
    cash flow available to fund working capital, capital
    expenditures, product development and other corporate
    requirements; increase our vulnerability to general adverse
    economic and industry conditions, including changes in raw
    material costs; limit our ability to respond to business
    opportunities; limit our ability to borrow additional funds,
    which may be necessary; and subject us to financial and other
    restrictive covenants, which, if we fail to comply with these
    covenants and our failure is not waived or cured, could result
    in an event of default under our debt instruments.

The agreements
    governing our debt impose restrictions on our
    business.

The note purchase agreement governing our senior notes and the
    agreements governing our credit facility contain covenants
    imposing various restrictions on our business. These
    restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and
    may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business
    opportunities as they arise. The restrictions these covenants
    place on us include limitations on our ability to incur liens
    and consolidate, merge, sell or lease all or substantially all
    of our assets. Our credit facility and the note purchase
    agreement governing our senior notes also require us to meet
    certain financial ratios.

Our ability to comply with these agreements may be affected by
    events beyond our control, including prevailing economic,
    financial and industry conditions, and is subject to the risks
    in this section. The breach of any of these covenants or
    restrictions could result in a default under the note purchase
    agreement governing the senior notes

and/or

under
    our credit facility. An event of default under the agreements
    governing our debt would permit holders of our debt to declare
    all amounts owed to them under such agreements to be immediately
    due and payable. Acceleration of our other indebtedness may
    cause us to be unable to make interest payments on the senior
    notes and repay the principal amount of the senior notes.

The lenders under
    our credit agreement may be unable to meet their funding
    commitments, reducing the amount of our borrowing
    capacity.

We have a revolving credit facility outstanding under which the
    Company and certain of its subsidiaries may borrow up to
    $950 million. Our credit facility is provided by a group of
    20 financial institutions, who individually have between 1% and
    11% of the total funding commitment. At December 31, 2010,
    we had borrowings of $556.5 million outstanding under our
    credit facility. Our ability to borrow further funds under our
    credit facility is subject to the various lenders’
    financial condition and ability to make funds available. Even
    though the financial institutions are contractually obligated to
    lend funds, if one or more of the lenders encounters financial
    difficulties or goes bankrupt, such lenders may be unable to
    meet their obligations. This could result in us being unable to
    borrow the full $950 million.



We make from time
    to time forward-looking statements, and actual events or results
    may differ materially from these statements because assumptions
    we have made prove incorrect due to market conditions in our
    industries or other factors.

We from time to time provide forward-looking statements both in
    our filings with the SEC and orally in connection with our
    quarterly earnings calls, including guidance on anticipated
    earnings per share. These statements are only predictions.
    Actual events or results may differ materially from these
    statements because assumptions we have made prove incorrect due
    to market conditions in our industries or other factors. We
    refer you to the factors discussed under the captions
    “Factors affecting our future operating results” in
    the “Business” section and the “Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations” section of this annual report on

Form 10-K,

which describe risks and factors that could cause results to
    differ materially from those projected in those forward-looking
    statements. We operate in a continually changing business
    environment, and new risk factors emerge from time to time.
    Management cannot predict these new risk factors, nor can it
    assess the impact, if any, of these new risk factors on our
    businesses or the extent to which any factor, or combination of
    factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from
    those projected in any forward-looking statements. Accordingly,
    forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as a
    prediction of actual results.

In providing guidance on our future earnings, our management
    evaluates our budgets, our strategic plan and certain factors
    relating to our business. This evaluation requires management to
    make several key assumptions relating to both external and
    internal factors. Some of the key external assumptions include:

•

the outlook for our end markets and the global economy;

•

impact of external factors on our competition;

•

financial position of our customers;

•

the estimated costs of purchasing materials;

•

developments in personnel costs; and

•

rates for currency exchange, particularly between the Swiss
    franc and the euro.

Some of these assumptions may prove to be incorrect over time.
    For example, although no one customer accounts for more than 2%
    of our revenues, if a number of our customers experienced
    significant deteriorations in their financial positions
    concurrently, it could have an impact on our results of
    operations.

Some of our key internal assumptions include the following:

•

our ability to implement our business strategy;

•

the effectiveness of our marketing programs such as our
    Spinnaker initiatives;

•

our ability to develop and deliver innovative products and
    services;

•

the continued growth of our sales in emerging markets;

•

our ability to implement price increases as forecasted; and

•

the effectiveness of our cost saving initiatives.

These internal assumptions may also prove to be incorrect over
    time. For example, with respect to our ability to realize our
    planned price increases without disturbing our customer base in
    core markets, in certain markets, such as emerging markets,
    price tends to be a more significant factor in customers’
    decisions to purchase our products. Furthermore, we can have no
    assurance that our cost reduction programs will generate
    adequate cost savings. Additionally, it may become necessary to
    take additional restructuring actions resulting in additional
    restructuring costs.

We believe our current assumptions are reasonable and prudent
    for planning purposes. However, should any of these assumptions
    prove to be incorrect, or should we incur

lower-than-expected

operating performance or cash flows, we may experience results
    different than our projections.



Our ability to
    generate cash depends in part on factors beyond our
    control.

Our ability to make payments on our debt and to fund planned
    capital expenditures and research and development efforts will
    depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to
    an extent, is subject to general economic, financial,
    competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors,
    including those described in this section, that are beyond our
    control.

We cannot ensure that our business will generate sufficient cash
    flows from operations or that future borrowings will be
    available to us under our credit facility in an amount
    sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other
    liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or a portion of
    our indebtedness on or before maturity. We cannot ensure that we
    will be able to refinance any of our debt, including our credit
    facility and the senior notes, on commercially reasonable terms
    or at all.

We have a $2.25 billion share repurchase program that was
    increased in November 2010, whereby the Board of Directors
    authorized us to repurchase an additional $750 million of
    common shares. As of December 31, 2010, there was
    $920.6 million of remaining common shares authorized to be
    repurchased



under our share repurchase program. The share repurchases are
    expected to be funded from existing cash balances, borrowings
    and cash generated from operating activities. Repurchases will
    be made through open market transactions, and the amount and
    timing of repurchases will depend on business and market
    conditions, stock price, trading restrictions, the level of
    acquisition activity and other factors. We have purchased
    17.2 million common shares since the inception of the
    program through December 31, 2010, at a total cost of
    $1.3 billion.

Our share repurchase program was suspended in October 2008 and
    restarted in December 2009. During the years ended
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, we spent $240.0 million
    and $6.0 million on the repurchase of 1,955,634 shares
    and 58,800 shares at an average price per share of $122.70
    and $101.82, respectively.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

The following discussion and analysis of our financial
    condition and results of operations should be read together with
    our audited consolidated financial statements.

Local currency changes exclude the effect of currency exchange
    rate fluctuations. Local currency amounts are determined by
    translating current and previous year consolidated financial
    information at an index utilizing historical currency exchange
    rates. We believe local currency information provides a helpful
    assessment of business performance and a useful measure of
    results between periods. We do not, nor do we suggest that
    investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in
    isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information
    prepared in accordance with GAAP. We present non-GAAP financial
    measures in reporting our financial results to provide investors
    with an additional analytical tool to evaluate our operating
    results.

Overview

We operate a global business, with sales that are diversified by
    geographic region, product range and customer. We hold leading
    positions worldwide in many of our markets and attribute this
    leadership to several factors, including the strength of our
    brand name and reputation, our comprehensive offering of
    innovative instruments and solutions, and the breadth and
    quality of our global sales and service network.

During 2010, we experienced broad-based sales increases across
    most geographies and products related to improved global
    economic conditions. We also experienced increased sales during
    2010 given the replacement nature of many of our products and
    the respective deferral of product replacements by our customers
    during 2009. Net sales in U.S. dollars increased by 14% in
    2010 and decreased by 12% in 2009. Excluding the effect of
    currency exchange rate fluctuations, or in local currencies, net
    sales increased 14% in 2010 and decreased 10% in 2009. Our
    future sales in local currencies may be adversely affected by
    weak



global economic conditions, although we also expect to continue
    to benefit from our strong leadership positions and the impact
    of our global sales and marketing programs. Examples include
    identifying and investing in growth opportunities, improving our
    lead generation and nurturing processes, better penetrating our
    market segments and more effectively pricing our products and
    services. While we have experienced improved business activity
    during 2010, the global economic environment remains uncertain
    and it is currently difficult to predict the extent to which our
    results may be adversely affected.

With respect to our end-user markets, we experienced increased
    results during 2010 in our laboratory-related end-user markets,
    such as pharmaceutical and biotech customers as well as the
    laboratories of chemical companies, food and beverage companies
    and universities. Demand from these markets increased during
    2010 related to the previously mentioned improved global
    economic conditions, particularly in Asia Pacific and the
    Americas.

Our industrial markets, especially core-industrial products,
    were particularly impacted by improved economic conditions in
    emerging markets due to increased production capacity for
    domestic and export markets. Emerging market economies have
    historically been an important source of growth based upon the
    expansion of their domestic economies, as well as increased
    exports as companies have moved production to low-cost
    countries. Local currency sales growth in our developed
    industrial markets during 2010 was also primarily related to
    improved economic conditions, as well as weaker prior period
    comparisons. However, market conditions improved more quickly in
    the Americas as compared to Europe.

In our food retail end markets, we also experienced increased
    results during 2010 related to improved global economic
    conditions, especially in emerging markets. However, we did not
    experience a significant increase in project activity in
    developed markets during 2010. Traditionally the spending levels
    in this sector have experienced more volatility than our other
    customer sectors due to the timing of customer project activity
    or new regulation. Similar to our industrial business, emerging
    markets have also historically provided growth as the expansion
    of local emerging market economies creates a significant number
    of new retail stores each year.

In 2011, we expect to continue to pursue the overall business
    growth strategies which we have followed in recent years:

Gaining Market Share.

Our global sales and
    marketing initiative, “Spinnaker,” continues to be an
    important growth strategy. We aim to achieve above-market sales
    growth by implementing sophisticated sales and marketing
    programs and leveraging our extensive customer databases. While
    this initiative is broad-based, efforts to improve these
    processes include increased segment marketing and leads
    generation and nurturing activities, the implementation of more
    effective pricing and value-based selling strategies and
    processes, improved sales force training and effectiveness and
    other sales and marketing topics. Our comprehensive service
    offerings also help us further penetrate developed markets. We
    estimate that we have the largest installed base of weighing
    instruments in the world. In addition to traditional repair and
    maintenance, our service offerings continue to expand into
    value-added services for a range of market needs, including
    regulatory compliance.

Expanding Emerging Markets.

Emerging markets,
    comprising Asia (excluding Japan), Eastern Europe, Latin
    America, the Middle East and Africa, account for approximately
    31% of our total net sales. We have a two-pronged strategy in
    emerging markets: first, to capitalize on growth opportunities
    in these markets and second, to leverage our low-cost
    manufacturing operations in China. We have over a

20-year

track record in China, and our sales in Asia have grown more
    than 16% on a compound annual growth basis in local currency
    since 1999. We have broadened our product offering to the Asian
    markets and are benefiting as multinational customers shift
    production to China. We are pleased with our accomplishments in
    China and in recent years have expanded our territory coverage
    with new branch offices, additional dealers and more service
    professionals. India has also been a source of emerging market
    sales growth in past years due to increased life science
    research activities. Local currency sales increased in emerging
    markets by 24% during 2010 versus the prior year related to
    improved global economic conditions. Sales increases were
    experienced throughout all markets, especially in China. We
    anticipate sales in 2011 will continue to increase as compared
    to 2010, absent a deterioration in global economic conditions.
    However, we expect local currency sales growth to be



reduced as 2010 benefited from weaker prior period comparisons.
    To reduce costs, we also continue to shift more of our
    manufacturing to China where our three facilities manufacture
    for the local markets as well as for export.

Extending Our Technology Lead.

We continue to
    focus on product innovation. In the last three years, we spent
    approximately 5.1% of net sales on research and development. We
    seek to drive shorter product life cycles, as well as improve
    our product offerings and their capabilities with additional
    integrated technologies and software. In addition, we aim to
    create value for our customers by having an intimate knowledge
    of their processes via our significant installed product base.

Maintaining Cost Leadership.

We continue to
    strive to improve our margins by optimizing our cost structure.
    For example, we significantly reduced our global cost structure
    during 2009 in response to the recent global economic slowdown.
    We have also focused on reallocating resources and better
    aligning our cost structure to support higher growth areas and
    opportunities for margin improvement. As previously mentioned,
    shifting production to China has also been an important
    component of our cost savings initiatives. We have also
    implemented global procurement and supply chain management
    programs over the last several years aimed at lowering supply
    costs. Our cost leadership initiatives are also focused on
    continuously improving our invested capital efficiency, such as
    reducing our working capital levels and ensuring appropriate
    returns on our expenditures.

Pursuing Strategic Acquisitions.

We seek to
    pursue acquisitions that may leverage our global sales and
    service network, respected brand, extensive distribution
    channels and technological leadership. We have identified life
    sciences, product inspection and process analytics as three key
    areas for acquisitions. We also continue to pursue
    “bolt-on” acquisitions. For example, during the first
    quarter of 2010, we acquired our pipette distributor in the
    United Kingdom and during the fourth quarter of 2009, we also
    acquired a leader of vision inspection technology that has been
    integrated with our

end-of-line

packaging inspection systems product offering.

Results of
    Operations — Consolidated

Net
    sales

Net sales were $1,968.2 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2010, compared to $1,728.9 million in
    2009 and $1,973.3 million in 2008. In U.S. dollars,
    this represents an increase in 2010 of 14% and a decrease in
    2009 of 12%. In local currencies, net sales increased 14% in
    2010 and decreased 10% in 2009. During the fourth quarter of
    2009, we acquired a vision technology company that has been
    integrated into our

end-of-line

packaging inspection systems product offering. During the first
    quarter of 2010, we also acquired our pipette distributor in the
    United Kingdom that has been integrated into our U.K. market
    organization. We estimate acquisitions contributed approximately
    2% to our net sales growth during 2010.

In 2010, our net sales by geographic destination increased in
    U.S. dollars by 16% in the Americas, 4% in Europe and 27%
    in Asia/Rest of World. In local currencies, our net sales by
    geographic destination increased in 2010 by 15% in the Americas,
    7% in Europe and 23% in Asia/Rest of World. A discussion of
    sales by operating segment is included below. Acquisitions
    contributed approximately 2% in the Americas and 2% in Europe to
    net sales growth during 2010. While we have experienced improved
    business activity, particularly in Asia/Rest of World and the
    Americas, the global economic environment remains uncertain and
    it is currently difficult to predict the extent to which our
    results may be adversely affected.

As described in Note 18 to our audited consolidated
    financial statements, our net sales comprise product sales of
    precision instruments and related services. Service revenues are
    primarily derived from repair and other services, including
    regulatory compliance qualification, calibration, certification,
    preventative maintenance and spare parts.

Net sales of products increased by 17% in 2010 in
    U.S. dollars and decreased by 15% in 2009. In local
    currencies, net sales of products increased by 16% in 2010 and
    decreased by 13% in 2009. Service revenue (including spare
    parts) increased in 2010 by 5% and decreased in 2009 by 4% in
    U.S. dollars. In local currencies, service revenue
    increased by 5% in 2010 and was flat in 2009.



Net sales of our laboratory-related products increased by 15% in
    U.S. dollars and in local currencies during 2010
    principally driven by strong growth across most product
    categories and geographies. Acquisitions contributed
    approximately 2% to our laboratory-related net sales growth
    during 2010.

Net sales of our industrial-related products increased by 15% in
    U.S. dollars and in local currencies during 2010. We
    experienced strong sales growth in our product inspection and
    core-industrial products. Net sales growth was offset in part by
    decreased sales in transportation and logistics products during
    2010. Net sales growth in industrial-related products reflects
    particularly strong growth in China and the Americas.
    Acquisitions contributed approximately 2% to our
    industrial-related net sales growth during 2010.

In our food retailing markets, net sales increased by 3% in
    U.S. dollars and increased 5% in local currencies during
    2010 compared to the previous year, resulting from strong growth
    in China.

Gross
    profit

Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 52.7% for 2010,
    compared to 51.4% for 2009 and 50.3% for 2008.

Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for products was 56.5%
    for 2010, compared to 55.2% for 2009 and 54.2% for 2008. Gross
    profit as a percentage of net sales for services (including
    spare parts) was 39.5% for 2010, compared to 39.8% for 2009 and
    36.8% for 2008.

The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales
    reflects benefits from increased sales volume and operating
    efficiencies, as well as pricing. These results were also partly
    offset by unfavorable business mix, as well as increased
    material costs, including higher costs for certain steel-related
    items and unfavorable currency.

Research and
    development and selling, general and administrative
    expenses

Research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales
    were 4.9% for 2010 and 5.2% for both 2009 and 2008. Research and
    development expenses increased by 8% and decreased by 12% in
    U.S. dollars in 2010 and 2009, respectively, and in local
    currencies increased by 6% in 2010 and decreased by 11% in 2009.
    Our research and development spending levels reflect increased
    research and development investments across most product
    categories.

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of
    net sales increased to 29.9% for 2010, compared to 29.2% for
    2009 and 29.4% for 2008. Selling, general and administrative
    expenses in U.S. dollars increased by 17% in 2010 and
    decreased by 13% in 2009 and in local currencies increased by
    16% in 2010 and decreased by 11% in 2009. The increase in 2010
    is primarily due to higher performance-related compensation
    costs and increased sales and marketing activities related to
    the improved economic environment, as well as
    acquisition-related expenses. The decrease in selling, general
    and administrative expenses in 2009 compared to 2008 is
    primarily due to benefits from our cost reduction activities and
    reduced performance-related compensation costs.

Restructuring
    charges

During the fourth quarter of 2008, we initiated a global cost
    reduction program which has substantially been completed.
    Charges under the program primarily comprise severance costs.
    Through December 31, 2010, total charges recognized were
    $42.7 million of which $4.9 million,
    $31.4 million and $6.4 million was recognized during
    2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. See Note 15 to our
    audited consolidated financial statements for a summary of
    restructuring activity during 2010.

Other charges
    (income), net

Other charges (income), net consisted of net charges of
    $4.2 million in 2010, compared to net charges of
    $1.4 million and $2.6 million in 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. Other charges (income), net consists primarily of
    interest income, (gains) losses from foreign currency
    transactions and other items. Other charges (income),



net in 2010 also includes a $4.4 million ($3.8 million
    after-tax) charge associated with the sale of our retail
    software business for in-store item and inventory management
    solutions. This amount was partially offset by a benefit from
    unrealized contingent consideration from a previous acquisition
    totaling $1.2 million ($1.2 million after-tax).

Interest expense
    and taxes

Interest expense was $20.1 million for 2010, compared to
    $25.1 million for 2009 and $25.4 million for 2008. The
    2010 amount reflects the benefit of lower average borrowings and
    lower costs associated with our interest rate swap agreements
    compared with the prior year. The 2009 amount includes charges
    associated with the tender offer of our 4.85% Senior Notes
    and other financing costs as well as costs associated with our
    interest rate swap agreements which were offset by lower average
    debt balances in comparison to 2008.

During 2010, we recorded discrete tax items resulting in a net
    tax benefit of $5.2 million primarily related to the
    favorable resolution of certain prior year tax matters. In 2009,
    we recorded a discrete net tax benefit of $8.3 million
    primarily related to the favorable resolution of certain prior
    year tax matters. During 2008, we recorded a discrete tax
    benefit of $2.5 million related to favorable withholding
    tax law changes in China and discrete tax items resulting in a
    net tax benefit of $3.5 million primarily related to the
    closure of certain tax matters.

Our annual effective tax rate was 25%, 23% and 24% for 2010,
    2009 and 2008, respectively. The previously described discrete
    tax items had the effect of lowering our annual effective tax
    rate by 1% in 2010, 4% in 2009 and 2% in 2008.

Results of
    Operations — by Operating Segment

The following is a discussion of the financial results of our
    operating segments. We currently have five reportable segments:
    U.S. Operations, Swiss Operations, Western European
    Operations, Chinese Operations and Other. A more detailed
    description of these segments is outlined in Note 18 to our
    audited consolidated financial statements.

The increase in total net sales and net sales to external
    customers during 2010 reflects increases across most product
    categories, particularly product inspection and
    laboratory-related products. Net sales in our
    U.S. operations benefited approximately 2% from
    acquisitions during 2010.

Segment profit increased by $15.7 million in our
    U.S. Operations segment during 2010, compared to a decrease
    of $5.9 million during 2009. The increase in segment profit
    in 2010 was primarily due to increased sales volume as well as
    benefits from our cost reduction efforts and acquisitions,
    offset in part by increased material costs and a
    $1.8 million gain recognized during 2009 from the receipt
    of a previously reserved receivable.

Segment profit increased by $16.2 million in our Swiss
    Operations segment during 2010, compared to a decrease of
    $4.8 million during 2009. The increase in segment profit
    during 2010 is primarily due to increased sales volume and
    increased inter-segment pricing, partially offset by increased
    sales and marketing investments.

    primarily reflects increased sales across most geographies,
    especially other Asian countries.

Segment profit increased $9.3 million in our Other segment
    during 2010, compared to a decrease of $5.2 million during
    2009. The increase in segment profit during 2010 relates
    primarily to increased sales volume.

Liquidity and
    Capital Resources

Liquidity is our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from
    operating activities to meet our obligations and commitments. In
    addition, liquidity includes the ability to obtain appropriate
    financing. Currently, our financing requirements are primarily
    driven by working capital requirements, capital expenditures,
    share repurchases and acquisitions. In 2010, we have also
    increased our debt balance at a European owned entity and our
    cash balance in the United States to facilitate foreign earnings
    repatriation. Our share repurchase program was suspended in
    October 2008 and restarted in December 2009 due to the economic
    downturn and instability in the financial markets. While we have
    seen an improvement in global economic conditions, our ability
    to generate cash flows may be reduced by a prolonged global
    economic slowdown.

Cash provided by operating activities totaled
    $268.3 million in 2010, compared to $232.6 million in
    2009 and $223.1 million in 2008. The increase in 2010
    resulted principally from higher net earnings, offset in part by
    increased working capital associated with the increased sales
    volume. Our inventory balances have also increased during 2010
    related to increased business activity, as well as supplier
    constraints, system changes, product transfers and new product
    introductions. In addition, benefits during 2010 from reduced
    incentive payments related to previous year performance-related
    compensation incentives were offset by benefits during 2009 from
    reduced working capital balances associated with the decline in
    prior year business activity. The increase in cash provided by
    operating activities during 2009 resulted principally from
    decreased incentive payments of $15.4 million related to
    2008 performance-related compensation incentives and reduced
    accounts receivable and inventory balances, offset in part by
    lower net earnings and cash payments of $22.2 million
    related to our restructuring program. We also made
    $5.0 million, $11.5 million and $5.0 million of
    voluntary incremental pension contributions in 2010, 2009 and
    2008, respectively.



Capital expenditures are made primarily for investments in
    information systems and technology, machinery, equipment and the
    purchase and expansion of facilities. Our capital expenditures
    totaled $73.9 million in 2010, $60.0 million in 2009
    and $61.0 million in 2008. Our capital expenditures in 2010
    included approximately $30.6 million of investments
    directly related to our Blue Ocean multi-year program of
    information technology investment compared with
    $35.1 million in 2009 and $16.2 million in 2008.

Cash flows used in financing activities during 2010 included the
    repayment of our $75 million 4.85% Senior Notes which
    matured on November 15, 2010. The repayment was funded from
    additional borrowings under our credit facility. Cash flows used
    in financing activities during 2009 included proceeds of
    $100 million from the issuance of our 6.30% Senior
    Notes and payments of $0.7 million of debt issuance costs.
    In 2009, we also made payments to repurchase $75 million of
    our 4.85% Senior Notes and paid $1.6 million in debt
    extinguishment costs and other financing charges in connection
    with our tender offer. Financing activities during 2008 included
    $3.3 million of financing fees related to the closing of
    our $950 million credit facility. As further described
    below, in accordance with our share repurchase plan, we
    repurchased 1,955,634 shares and 58,800 shares in the
    amount of $240.0 million and $6.0 million during 2010
    and 2009, respectively.

As previously mentioned, cash flows provided by financing
    activities during 2010 also reflected increased debt balances at
    a European owned entity to facilitate foreign earnings
    repatriation. The increase in our Credit Agreement from 2009 to
    2010 was primarily related to this transaction. The transaction
    also increased cash balances in the U.S.

We continue to explore potential acquisitions. In connection
    with any acquisition, we may incur additional indebtedness.
    During the first quarter of 2010 we spent approximately
    $12.5 million relating to the acquisition of our pipette
    distributor in the United Kingdom. During the fourth quarter of
    2009, we also spent approximately $14.3 million, plus
    contingent consideration up to a maximum of $7.8 million,
    for a leader in vision technology that we have integrated into
    our

end-of-line

packaging inspection systems product offering.

During the fourth quarter of 2010, we also sold our retail
    software business for in-store item and inventory management
    solutions for approximately $10 million. The sale resulted
    in a $4.4 million pre-tax charge ($3.8 million
    after-tax) and has been included in other charges (income), net
    in our 2010 consolidated statement of operations. Annualized net
    sales and net earnings associated with this business are
    immaterial to our consolidated results.

6.30% Senior
    Notes

On June 25, 2009, we issued and sold, in a private
    placement, $100 million aggregate principal amount of our
    6.30%

Series 2009-A

Senior Notes due June 25, 2015 (“6.30% Senior
    Notes”) under a Note Purchase Agreement among the Company
    and the accredited institutional investors named therein (the
    “Agreement”). The 6.30% Senior Notes are senior
    unsecured obligations of the Company.

The 6.30% Senior Notes mature on June 25, 2015.
    Interest is payable semi-annually in June and December. We may
    at any time prepay the 6.30% Senior Notes, in whole or in
    part (but in an amount not less than 10% of the original
    aggregate principal amount), at a price equal to 100% of the
    principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest plus a
    “make-whole” prepayment premium. In the event of a
    change in control of the Company (as defined in the Agreement),
    we may be required to offer to prepay the 6.30% Senior
    Notes in whole at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount
    thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest.

The Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative
    covenants for agreements of this type including, among others,
    limitations on us and our subsidiaries with respect to
    incurrence of liens and priority indebtedness, disposition of
    assets, mergers, and transactions with affiliates. The Agreement
    also requires us to maintain a consolidated interest coverage
    ratio of not less than 3.5 to 1.0 and a consolidated leverage
    ratio of not more than 3.5 to 1.0. The Agreement contains
    customary events of default with customary grace periods, as
    applicable. We were in compliance with these covenants at
    December 31, 2010.



Under the terms of the offering, we may sell additional Senior
    Notes at our discretion in an aggregate amount not to exceed
    $600 million. Such additional Senior Notes would rank
    equally with our unsecured indebtedness.

Issuance costs approximating $0.7 million will be amortized
    to interest expense over the six-year term of the
    6.30% Senior Notes.

Tender
    Offer & Repayment of 4.85% Senior Notes

In November 2003, we issued $150 million of 4.85% unsecured
    Senior notes due November 15, 2010 (“4.85% Senior
    Notes”). Discount and issuance costs approximated
    $1.2 million and were amortized to interest expense over
    the seven-year term of the 4.85% Senior Notes.

On May 6, 2009, we commenced a cash tender offer to
    purchase any and all of our outstanding 4.85% Senior Notes
    due November 15, 2010. The tender offer, which expired
    May 12, 2009, resulted in the repurchase of
    $75 million of the principal balance of the
    4.85% Senior Notes. In connection with the tender, we
    recorded a charge of $1.5 million, which included a premium
    of $0.9 million, unamortized discount and debt issuance
    fees of $0.2 million and certain third party costs of
    $0.4 million. These charges were recorded in interest
    expense in the consolidated statement of operations.

At maturity, on November 15, 2010, we repaid the remaining
    $75 million outstanding principal balance of our
    4.85% Senior Notes. The repayment was funded from
    additional borrowings under our credit facility.

Credit
    Agreement

On August 15, 2008, we entered into a $950 million
    Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”), which
    replaced our $450 million Amended and Restated Credit
    Agreement (the “Prior Credit Agreement”). The Credit
    Agreement is provided by a group of financial institutions
    (similar to our Prior Credit Agreement) and has a maturity date
    of August 15, 2013. It is a revolving credit facility and
    is not subject to any scheduled principal payments prior to
    maturity. The obligations under the Credit Agreement are
    unsecured.

Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at current
    market rates plus a margin based on our senior unsecured credit
    ratings, which was, as of December 31, 2010, set at LIBOR
    plus 0.70% (based on ratings of “BBB” by
    Standard & Poor’s and “Baa2” by
    Moody’s). We must also pay facility fees that are tied to
    our credit ratings. The Credit Agreement contains covenants,
    with which we were in compliance as of December 31, 2010,
    which include maintaining a consolidated interest coverage ratio
    of not less than 3.5 to 1.0 and a consolidated leverage ratio of
    not more than 3.25 to 1.0. The Credit Agreement also places
    certain limitations on us, including limiting our ability to
    incur liens or indebtedness at a subsidiary level. In addition,
    the Credit Agreement has several events of default, including
    upon a change of control. We capitalized $3.3 million in
    financing fees during 2008 associated with the Credit Agreement
    which are amortized to interest expense through 2013. As of
    December 31, 2010, approximately $387.9 million was
    available under the facility.

Our short-term borrowings and long-term debt consisted of the
    following at December 31, 2010:

Changes in exchange rates between the currencies in which we
    generate cash flow and the currencies in which our borrowings
    are denominated affect our liquidity. In addition, because we
    borrow in a variety of currencies, our debt balances fluctuate
    due to changes in exchange rates.

At December 31, 2010, we were in compliance with all
    covenants set forth in our 6.30% Senior Notes and Credit
    Agreement. In addition, we do not have any downgrade triggers
    relating to ratings from rating agencies that would accelerate
    the maturity dates of our debt.

We currently believe that cash flows from operating activities,
    together with liquidity available under our Credit Agreement and
    local working capital facilities, will be sufficient to fund
    currently anticipated working capital needs and capital spending
    requirements for at least the foreseeable future.

    Obligations

The following summarizes certain of our contractual obligations
    at December 31, 2010 and the effect such obligations are
    expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future

In addition to the above table, we also have liabilities for
    pension and post-retirement funding and income taxes. However,
    we cannot determine the timing or the amounts for periods beyond
    2010 for income taxes and beyond 2011 for pension and
    post-retirement funding.

We have purchase commitments for materials, supplies, services
    and fixed assets in the normal course of business. Due to the
    proprietary nature of many of our materials and processes,
    certain supply contracts contain penalty provisions. We do not
    expect potential payments under these provisions to materially
    affect results of operations or financial condition. This
    conclusion is based upon reasonably likely outcomes derived by
    reference to historical experience and current business plans.

Share Repurchase
    Program

We have a $2.25 billion share repurchase program that was
    increased in November 2010, whereby the Board of Directors
    authorized us to repurchase an additional $750 million of
    common shares. We expect that the new authorization will be
    utilized over the next several years. As of December 31,
    2010, there were $920.6 million of remaining common shares
    authorized to be repurchased under the program. The share
    repurchases are expected to be funded from existing cash
    balances, borrowings and cash generated from operating
    activities. Repurchases will be made through open market
    transactions and the amount and timing of purchases will depend
    on business and market conditions, the stock price, trading
    restrictions, the level of acquisition activity and other
    factors. We have purchased 17.2 million shares since the
    inception of the program through December 31, 2010.

Our share repurchase program was suspended in October 2008 and
    restarted in December 2009. During the years ended
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, we spent $240.0 million
    and $6.0 million on the repurchase of 1,955,634 shares
    and 58,800 shares at an average price per share of $122.70
    and $101.82, respectively. We



reissued 527,276 shares and 308,154 shares held in
    treasury for the exercise of stock options and restricted stock
    units during 2010 and 2009, respectively.

We also reissued 2,549 shares and 6,467 shares held in
    treasury during 2010 and 2009, respectively, pursuant to our
    2007 Share Plan, which extends certain eligible employees
    the option to receive a percentage of their annual
    performance-related compensation in shares of the Company’s
    stock.

Off-Balance Sheet
    Arrangements

Currently, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have
    or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on
    our financial condition, changes in financial condition,
    revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital
    expenditures or capital resources that is material.

Effect of
    Currency on Results of Operations

Because we conduct operations in many countries, our operating
    income can be significantly affected by fluctuations in currency
    exchange rates. Swiss franc-denominated expenses represent a
    much greater percentage of our total operating expenses than
    Swiss franc-denominated sales represent of our total net sales.
    In part, this is because most of our manufacturing and product
    development costs in Switzerland relate to products that are
    sold outside Switzerland. In addition, we have a number of
    corporate functions located in Switzerland. Therefore, if the
    Swiss franc strengthens against all or most of our major trading
    currencies (e.g

.

, the U.S. dollar, the euro, other
    major European currencies, the Chinese yuan and the Japanese
    yen), our operating profit is reduced. We also have
    significantly more sales in euro than we have expenses.
    Therefore, when the euro weakens against the U.S. dollar
    and the Swiss franc, it also decreases our operating profits.
    Accordingly, the Swiss franc exchange rate to the euro is an
    important cross-rate that we monitor. We have seen higher
    volatility in exchange rates generally than in the past, and
    recently the Swiss franc has strengthened against the euro. The
    exchange rate between the Swiss franc and the euro was 1.39
    during 2010 as compared to 1.51 for the prior year, reflecting
    an 8% strengthening of the Swiss franc against the euro. The
    current exchange rate for the Swiss franc to the euro is 1.30 as
    of February 8, 2011, reflecting a 6% strengthening of the
    Swiss franc against the euro as compared to 2010. We estimate
    that a 1% strengthening of the Swiss franc against the euro
    would result in a decrease in our earnings before tax of
    $1.1 million to $1.8 million on an annual basis. In
    addition to the Swiss franc and major European currencies, we
    also conduct business in many geographies throughout the world,
    including Asia Pacific, the United Kingdom, Eastern Europe,
    Latin America and Canada. Fluctuations in these currency
    exchange rates against the U.S. dollar can also affect our
    operating results. In addition to the effects of exchange rate
    movements on operating profits, our debt levels can fluctuate
    due to changes in exchange rates, particularly between the
    U.S. dollar and the Swiss franc. Based on our outstanding
    debt at December 31, 2010, we estimate that a 10% weakening
    of the U.S. dollar against the currencies in which our debt
    is denominated would result in an increase of approximately
    $9.5 million in the reported U.S. dollar value of the
    debt.

Taxes

We are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions throughout the
    world. Our effective tax rate and tax liability will be affected
    by a number of factors, such as the amount of taxable income in
    particular jurisdictions, the tax rates in such jurisdictions,
    tax treaties between jurisdictions, the extent to which we
    transfer funds between jurisdictions, earnings repatriations
    between jurisdictions and changes in law. Generally, the tax
    liability for each taxpayer within the group is determined
    either (i) on a non-consolidated/non-combined basis or
    (ii) on a consolidated/combined basis only with other
    eligible entities subject to tax in the same jurisdiction, in
    either case without regard to the taxable losses of
    non-consolidated/non-combined affiliated legal entities.

Environmental
    Matters

We are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the
    jurisdictions in which we operate. We own or lease a number of
    properties and manufacturing facilities around the world. Like
    many of our competitors,



we have incurred, and will continue to incur, capital and
    operating expenditures and other costs in complying with such
    laws and regulations.

We are currently involved in, or have potential liability with
    respect to, the remediation of past contamination in certain of
    our facilities. A former subsidiary of Mettler-Toledo, Inc.
    (“MTI”) known as Hi-Speed Checkweigher Co., Inc.
    (“Hi-Speed”) was one of two private parties ordered by
    the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection
    (“NJDEP”), in an administrative consent order
    (“ACO”) signed on June 13, 1988, to investigate
    and remediate certain ground water contamination at certain
    property in Landing, New Jersey. After the other party ordered
    under this ACO failed to fulfill its obligations, Hi-Speed
    became solely responsible for compliance with the ACO. Residual
    ground water contamination at this site is now within a
    Classification Exception Area (“CEA”) which NJDEP has
    approved and within which MTI oversees monitoring of the decay
    of contaminants of concern. A concurrent Well Restriction Area
    also exists for the site. The NJDEP does not view these vehicles
    as remedial measures, but rather as “institutional
    controls” that must be adequately maintained and
    periodically evaluated. NJDEP has informally told MTI to expect
    a claim for natural resource damages (“NRD”) regarding
    this site but has not yet made such a claim. In 2010, testing of
    indoor air at certain buildings within the site led to the
    installation of a vapor intrusion mitigation system at one
    building. We estimate that the costs of compliance associated
    with the site over the next six years will approximate
    $0.6 million.

In addition, certain of our present and former facilities have
    or had been in operation for many decades and, over such time,
    some of these facilities may have used substances or generated
    and disposed of wastes which are or may be considered hazardous.
    It is possible that these sites, as well as disposal sites owned
    by third parties to which we have sent wastes, may in the future
    be identified and become the subject of remediation.
    Accordingly, although we believe that we are in substantial
    compliance with applicable environmental requirements and, to
    date, we have not incurred material expenditures in connection
    with environmental matters, it is possible that we could become
    subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future
    that could have a material adverse effect on our financial
    condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Inflation

Inflation can affect the costs of goods and services that we
    use, including raw materials to manufacture our products. The
    competitive environment in which we operate limits somewhat our
    ability to recover higher costs through increased selling prices.

Moreover, there may be differences in inflation rates between
    countries in which we incur the major portion of our costs and
    other countries in which we sell products, which may limit our
    ability to recover increased costs. We remain committed to
    operations in China and Eastern Europe, which have experienced
    inflationary conditions. To date, inflationary conditions have
    not had a material effect on our operating results. However, as
    our presence in China and Eastern Europe increases, these
    inflationary conditions could have a greater impact on our
    operating results.

Quantitative and
    Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

We have only limited involvement with derivative financial
    instruments and do not use them for trading purposes.

We have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to
    economically hedge short-term intercompany balances with our
    international businesses on a monthly basis and to hedge certain
    forecasted intercompany sales. Such contracts limit our exposure
    to both favorable and unfavorable currency fluctuations. The net
    fair value of these contracts was a $1.5 million net gain
    at December 31, 2010. A sensitivity analysis to changes on
    these foreign currency-denominated contracts indicates that if
    the primary currency (primarily U.S. dollar, Swiss franc
    and British pound) declined by 10%, the fair value of these
    instruments would decrease by $7.3 million at
    December 31, 2010. Any resulting changes in fair value
    would be offset by changes in the underlying hedged balance
    sheet position. The sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel
    shift in foreign currency exchange rates. The assumption that
    exchange rates change in parallel fashion may



overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on assets and
    liabilities denominated in a foreign currency. We also have
    other currency risks as described under “Effect of Currency
    on Results of Operations.”

We have entered into certain interest rate swap agreements.
    These contracts are more fully described in Note 5 to our
    audited consolidated financial statements. The fair value of
    these contracts was a loss of $5.8 million at
    December 31, 2010. Based on our agreements outstanding at
    December 31, 2010, a 100-basis-point increase in interest
    rates would result in an increase in the net aggregate market
    value of these instruments of $4.8 million. Conversely, a
    100-basis-point decrease in interest rates would result in a
    $5.1 million decrease in the net aggregate market value of
    these instruments at December 31, 2010. Any change in fair
    value would not affect our consolidated statement of operations
    unless such agreements and the debt they hedge were prematurely
    settled.

Critical
    Accounting Policies

Management’s discussion and analysis of our financial
    condition and results of operations is based upon our audited
    consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in
    accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these
    consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates
    and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
    liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of
    contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we
    evaluate our estimates, including those related to pensions and
    other post-retirement benefits, trade accounts receivable,
    inventories, intangible assets, income taxes, revenue and
    warranty costs. We base our estimates on historical experience
    and on various other assumptions that are believed to be
    reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form
    the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of
    assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other
    sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under
    different assumptions or conditions.

We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our
    more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation
    of our audited consolidated financial statements. For a detailed
    discussion on the application of these and other accounting
    policies, see Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial
    statements.

Employee benefit
    plans

The net periodic pension cost for 2010 and projected benefit
    obligation as of December 31, 2010 was $5.1 million
    and $125.3 million, respectively, for our U.S. pension
    plan and $5.8 million and $661.0 million,
    respectively, for our international pension plans. The net
    periodic post-retirement credit for 2010 and expected
    post-retirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2010
    for our U.S. post-retirement medical benefit plan was
    $0.4 million and $14.6 million, respectively.

Pension and post-retirement benefit plan expense and obligations
    are developed from assumptions utilized in actuarial valuations.
    The most significant of these assumptions include the discount
    rate and expected return on plan assets. In accordance with
    U.S. GAAP, actual results that differ from the assumptions
    are accumulated and deferred over future periods. While
    management believes the assumptions used are appropriate,
    differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may
    affect our plan obligations and future expense.

The expected rates of return on the various defined benefit
    pension plans’ assets are based on the asset allocation of
    each plan and the long-term projected return of those assets,
    which represent a diversified mix of U.S. and international
    corporate equities and government and corporate debt securities.
    In 2002, we froze our U.S. defined benefit pension plan and
    discontinued our retiree medical program for certain current and
    all future employees. Consequently, no significant future
    service costs will be incurred on these plans. For 2010, the
    weighted average return on assets assumption was 8.25% for the
    U.S. plan and 5.20% for the international plans. A change
    in the rate of return of 1% would impact annual benefit plan
    expense by approximately $5.9 million after tax.

The discount rates for defined benefit and post-retirement plans
    are set by benchmarking against high-quality corporate bonds.
    For 2010, the average discount rate assumption was 5.50% for the
    U.S. plan and



3.90% for the international plans, representing a weighted
    average of local rates in countries where such plans exist. A
    decrease in the discount rate of 1% would impact annual benefit
    plan expense by approximately $1.5 million after tax.

We made voluntary incremental funding payments of
    $5.0 million, $11.5 million and $5.0 million in
    2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, to increase the funded status
    of our pension plans. In the future, we may make additional
    mandatory or discretionary contributions to our plan or we could
    be required to make additional cash funding payments.

Equity-based
    compensation

We also have an equity incentive plan that provides for the
    grant of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units
    and other equity-based awards which are accounted for and
    recognized in the consolidated statement of operations based on
    the grant-date fair value of the award. This methodology yields
    an estimate of fair value based in part on a number of
    management estimates, the most significant of which include
    future volatility and estimated option lives. Changes in these
    assumptions could significantly impact the estimated fair value
    of stock options.

Trade accounts
    receivable

As of December 31, 2010, trade accounts receivable were
    $368.9 million, net of a $11.5 million allowance for
    doubtful accounts.

Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount
    and do not bear interest. The allowance for doubtful accounts
    represents our best estimate of probable credit losses in our
    existing trade accounts receivable. We determine the allowance
    based upon a review of both specific accounts for collection and
    the age of the accounts receivable portfolio.

Inventories

As of December 31, 2010, inventories were
    $217.1 million.

We record our inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable
    value. Cost, which includes direct materials, labor and
    overhead, is generally determined using the first in, first out
    (FIFO) method. The estimated net realizable value is based on
    assumptions for future demand and related pricing. Adjustments
    to the cost basis of our inventory are made for excess and
    obsolete items based on usage, orders and technological
    obsolescence. If actual market conditions are less favorable
    than those projected by management, reductions in the value of
    inventory may be required.

Goodwill and
    other intangible assets

As of December 31, 2010, our consolidated balance sheet
    included goodwill of $434.7 million and other intangible
    assets of $104.4 million.

Our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other
    intangible assets, which affect the amount of future period
    amortization expense and possible impairment expense. The
    determination of the value of such intangible assets requires
    management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our
    consolidated financial statements.

In accordance with U.S. GAAP, our goodwill and
    indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are
    evaluated for impairment annually in the fourth quarter, or more
    frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that
    an asset might be impaired. The evaluation is based on valuation
    models that estimate fair value based on expected future cash
    flows and profitability projections. In preparing the valuation
    models, we consider a number of factors, including operating
    results, business plans, economic conditions, future cash flows
    and transactions and market data. There are inherent
    uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in
    applying them to the impairment analyses. The most significant
    of these estimates and assumptions within our fair value models
    include sales growth, controllable cost growth,



perpetual growth, effective tax rates and discount rates. Our
    assessments to date have indicated that there has been no
    impairment of these assets.

Should any of these estimates or assumptions change, or should
    we incur lower than expected operating performance or cash
    flows, including from a prolonged economic slowdown, we may
    experience a triggering event that requires a new fair value
    assessment for our reporting units, possibly prior to the
    required annual assessment. These types of events and resulting
    analysis could result in impairment charges for goodwill and
    other indefinite-lived intangible assets if the fair value
    estimate declines below the carrying value.

Our amortization expense related to intangible assets with
    finite lives may materially change should our estimates of their
    useful lives change.

Income
    taxes

Income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities
    reflect management’s assessment of actual future taxes to
    be paid on items in the consolidated financial statements. We
    record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets
    to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. While
    we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and
    feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the
    valuation allowance, in the event we were to determine that we
    would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future
    in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to the
    deferred tax asset would increase income or equity in the period
    such determination was made. Likewise, should we determine that
    we would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred
    tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset
    would be charged to income in the period such determination was
    made.

We plan to repatriate earnings from China, Switzerland, the
    United Kingdom and certain other countries in future years and
    we currently believe that there will be no additional cost
    associated with the repatriation of such foreign earnings other
    than withholding taxes. All other undistributed earnings are
    considered to be permanently invested.

The significant assumptions and estimates described in the
    preceding paragraphs are important contributors to our ultimate
    effective tax rate for each year in addition to our income mix
    from geographical regions. If any of our assumptions or
    estimates were to change, or should our income mix from our
    geographical regions change, our effective tax rate could be
    materially affected. Based on earnings before taxes of
    $307.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2010,
    each increase of $3.1 million in tax expense would increase
    our effective tax rate by 1%.

Revenue
    recognition

Revenue is recognized when title to a product has transferred
    and any significant customer obligations have been fulfilled.
    Standard shipping terms are generally FOB shipping point in most
    countries and, accordingly, title and risk of loss transfers
    upon shipment. In countries where title cannot legally transfer
    before delivery, we defer revenue recognition until delivery has
    occurred. Other than a few small software applications, we do
    not sell software products without the related hardware
    instrument as the software is embedded in the instrument. Our
    products typically require no significant production,
    modification or customization of the hardware or software that
    is essential to the functionality of the products. To the extent
    our solutions have a post-shipment obligation, such as customer
    acceptance, revenue is deferred until the obligation has been
    completed. In addition, we also defer revenue where installation
    is required, unless such installation is deemed perfunctory. We
    generally maintain the right to accept or reject a product
    return in our terms and conditions and we also maintain
    appropriate accruals for outstanding credits. Further, certain
    products are also sold through indirect distribution channels
    whereby the distributor assumes any further obligations to the
    customer upon title transfer. Revenue is recognized on these
    products upon transfer of title and risk of loss to our
    distributors. Distributor discounts are offset against revenue
    at the time such revenue is recognized. Shipping and handling
    costs charged to customers are included in total net sales and
    the associated expense is recorded in cost of sales for all
    periods presented.



Service revenue not under contract is recognized upon the
    completion of the service performed. Spare parts sold on a
    stand-alone basis are recognized upon title and risk of loss
    transfer which is generally at the time of shipment. Revenues
    from service contracts are recognized ratably over the contract
    period. These contracts represent an obligation to perform
    repair and other services including regulatory compliance
    qualification, calibration, certification and preventative
    maintenance on a customer’s pre-defined equipment over the
    contract period. Service contracts are separately priced and
    payment is typically received from the customer at the beginning
    of the contract period.

Warranty

We generally offer one-year warranties on most of our products.
    Product warranties are recorded at the time revenue is
    recognized. While we engage in extensive product quality
    programs and processes, our warranty obligation is affected by
    product failure rates, material usage and service costs incurred
    in correcting a product failure. If we experience claims or
    significant cost changes in material, freight and vendor
    charges, our cost of goods sold could be affected.

Conclusions
    Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and
    Procedures and Changes in Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting

Under the supervision and with the participation of our
    management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief
    Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our
    disclosure controls and procedures as required by Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15(b)

as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon
    that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief
    Financial Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls
    and procedures are effective.

There were no changes in our internal control over financial
    reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2010 that
    have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
    affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal
    control over financial reporting is a process designed to
    provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
    financial reporting and the preparation of the Company’s
    financial statements for external reporting purposes in
    accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America.



Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2010. In making this assessment, we used the
    criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
    of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework. Based on our
    assessment, we concluded that, as of December 31, 2010, the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting is
    effective.

    accounting firm that audited the financial statements included

has issued an attestation in their report on our internal
    control over financial reporting which appears on

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders

of Mettler-Toledo International Inc.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
    the index appearing on

page F-1

present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
    of Mettler-Toledo International Inc. at December 31, 2010
    and 2009, and the results of their operations and their cash
    flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2010 in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition,
    in our opinion, the financial statement schedules listed in the
    index appearing on

page S-1

present fairly, in all material respects, the information set
    forth therein when read in conjunction with the related
    consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the
    Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
    control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010,
    based on criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The
    Company’s management is responsible for these financial
    statements and financial statement schedules, for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on
    Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under
    Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these
    financial statements, on the financial statement schedules, and
    on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
    based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in
    accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
    Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
    that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable
    assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
    material misstatement and whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audits of the financial statements included
    examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
    disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
    presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial
    reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal
    control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a
    material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
    assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
    opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTES TO
    THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(In thousands,
    except share data, unless otherwise stated)

1.

BUSINESS
    DESCRIPTION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

Mettler-Toledo International Inc. (“Mettler-Toledo” or
    the “Company”) is a leading global supplier of
    precision instruments and services. The Company manufactures
    weighing instruments for use in laboratory, industrial,
    packaging, logistics and food retailing applications. The
    Company also manufactures several related analytical instruments
    and provides automated chemistry solutions used in drug and
    chemical compound discovery and development. In addition, the
    Company manufactures metal detection and other

end-of-line

inspection systems used in production and packaging and provides
    solutions for use in certain process analytics applications. The
    Company’s primary manufacturing facilities are located in
    China, Germany, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United
    States. The Company’s principal executive offices are
    located in Columbus, Ohio and Greifensee, Switzerland.

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
    accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and
    include all entities in which the Company has control, which are
    its wholly-owned subsidiaries.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and
    assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
    liabilities, as well as disclosure of contingent assets and
    liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the
    reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
    periods. Actual results may differ from those estimates.

All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.

Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts
    to conform to the current year presentation.

2.

SUMMARY OF
    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Cash and Cash
    Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with
    original maturity dates of three months or less. The carrying
    value of these cash equivalents approximates fair value.

Trade Accounts
    Receivable

Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount
    and do not bear interest. The allowance for doubtful accounts
    represents the Company’s best estimate of probable credit
    losses in its existing trade accounts receivable. The Company
    determines the allowance based upon a review of both specific
    accounts for collection and the age of the accounts receivable
    portfolio.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable
    value. Cost, which includes direct materials, labor and
    overhead, is generally determined using the first in, first out
    (FIFO) method. The estimated net realizable value is based on
    assumptions for future demand and related pricing. Adjustments
    to the cost basis of the Company’s inventory are made for
    excess and obsolete items based on usage, orders and
    technological obsolescence. If actual market conditions are less
    favorable than those projected by management, reductions in the
    value of inventory may be required.

NOTES TO THE
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands,
    except share data, unless otherwise stated)

Long-Lived
    Assets

a)  Property,
    Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less
    accumulated depreciation. Repair and maintenance costs are
    charged to expense as incurred. The Company expenses all
    internal-use software costs incurred in the preliminary project
    stage and capitalizes certain direct costs associated with the
    development and purchase of internal-use software within
    property, plant and equipment. Capitalized costs are amortized
    on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the
    software, generally not exceeding 10 years.

Depreciation and amortization are charged on a straight-line
    basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:

Buildings and improvements

15 to 50 years

Machinery and equipment

3 to 12 years

Computer software

3 to 10 years

Leasehold improvements

Shorter of useful life or lease term

b)  Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill, representing the excess of purchase price over the net
    asset value of companies acquired, and indefinite-lived
    intangible assets are not amortized, but are reviewed for
    impairment annually in the fourth quarter, or more
    frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that
    an asset might be impaired. The annual evaluation is based on
    valuation models that estimate fair value based on expected
    future cash flows and profitability projections.

Other intangible assets also include definite-lived assets which
    are subject to amortization. Where applicable, amortization is
    charged on a straight-line basis over the expected period to be
    benefited. The straight-line method of amortization reflects an
    appropriate allocation of the cost of the intangible assets to
    earnings in proportion to the amount of economic benefits
    obtained by the Company in each reporting period. The Company
    assesses the recoverability of other intangible assets annually,
    or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances
    indicate that an asset might be impaired.

Accounting for
    Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

The Company assesses the need to record impairment losses on
    long-lived assets with finite lives when events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may
    not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when
    future estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from
    use of the asset are less than the asset’s carrying value,
    with the loss measured as the difference between carrying value
    and fair value.

Taxation

The Company files tax returns in each jurisdiction in which it
    operates. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for
    the future tax consequences attributable to differences between
    the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
    liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss
    and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and
    liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in the
    respective jurisdictions in which the Company operates. In
    assessing the ability to realize deferred tax assets, management
    considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion
    or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

F-8


METTLER-TOLEDO
    INTERNATIONAL INC.

NOTES TO THE
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands,
    except share data, unless otherwise stated)

Deferred taxes are not provided on the unremitted earnings of
    subsidiaries outside of the United States when it is expected
    that these earnings are permanently reinvested. Such earnings
    may become taxable upon the sale or liquidation of these
    subsidiaries or upon the remittance of dividends. Deferred taxes
    are provided when the Company no longer considers subsidiary
    earnings to be permanently invested, such as in situations where
    the Company’s subsidiaries plan to make future dividend
    distributions.

The Company recognizes accrued amounts of interest and penalties
    related to its uncertain tax positions as part of income tax
    expense within its consolidated statement of operations.

Currency
    Translation and Transactions

The reporting currency for the consolidated financial statements
    of the Company is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency
    for the Company’s operations is generally the applicable
    local currency. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of
    companies whose functional currency is other than the
    U.S. dollar are included in the consolidated financial
    statements by translating the assets and liabilities into the
    reporting currency at the exchange rates applicable at the end
    of the reporting period. The statements of operations and cash
    flows of such

non-U.S. dollar

functional currency operations are translated at the monthly
    average exchange rates during the year. Translation gains or
    losses are accumulated in other comprehensive income (loss) in
    the consolidated statements of shareholders’ equity.
    Transaction gains and losses are included as a component of net
    earnings.

Revenue
    Recognition

Revenue is recognized when title to a product has transferred
    and any significant customer obligations have been fulfilled.
    Standard shipping terms are generally FOB shipping point in most
    countries and, accordingly, title and risk of loss transfers
    upon shipment. In countries where title cannot legally transfer
    before delivery, the Company defers revenue recognition until
    delivery has occurred. Other than a few small software
    applications, the Company does not sell software products
    without the related hardware instrument as the software is
    embedded in the instrument. The Company’s products
    typically require no significant production, modification or
    customization of the hardware or software that is essential to
    the functionality of the products. To the extent the
    Company’s solutions have a post-shipment obligation, such
    as customer acceptance, revenue is deferred until the obligation
    has been completed. In addition, the Company also defers revenue
    where installation is required, unless such installation is
    deemed perfunctory. The Company generally maintains the right to
    accept or reject a product return in its terms and conditions
    and also maintains appropriate accruals for outstanding credits.
    Further, certain products are also sold through indirect
    distribution channels whereby the distributor assumes any
    further obligations to the customer upon title transfer. Revenue
    is recognized on these products upon transfer of title and risk
    of loss to its distributors. Distributor discounts are offset
    against revenue at the time such revenue is recognized. Shipping
    and handling costs charged to customers are included in total
    net sales and the associated expense is recorded in cost of
    sales for all periods presented.

Service revenue not under contract is recognized upon the
    completion of the service performed. Spare parts sold on a
    stand-alone basis are recognized upon title and risk of loss
    transfer which is generally at the time of shipment. Revenues
    from service contracts are recognized ratably over the contract
    period. These contracts represent an obligation to perform
    repair and other services including regulatory compliance
    qualification, calibration, certification and preventative
    maintenance on a customer’s pre-defined equipment over the
    contract period. Service contracts are separately priced and
    payment is typically received from the customer at the beginning
    of the contract period.

METTLER-TOLEDO
    INTERNATIONAL INC.

NOTES TO THE
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands,
    except share data, unless otherwise stated)

Research and
    Development

Research and development costs primarily consist of salaries,
    consulting and other costs. The Company expenses these costs as
    incurred.

Warranty

The Company generally offers one-year warranties on most of its
    products. Product warranties are recorded at the time revenue is
    recognized. While the Company engages in extensive product
    quality programs and processes, its warranty obligation is
    affected by product failure rates, material usage and service
    costs incurred in correcting a product failure.

Employee
    Termination Benefits

In situations where contractual termination benefits exist, the
    Company records accruals for employee termination benefits when
    it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount
    of the liability is reasonably estimable. All other employee
    termination arrangements are recognized and measured at their
    fair value at the communication date unless the employee is
    required to render additional service beyond the legal
    notification period, in which case the liability is recognized
    ratably over the future service period.

Earnings per
    Common Share

In accordance with the treasury stock method, the Company has
    included 859,634, 574,418 and 798,549 common equivalent shares
    in the calculation of diluted weighted average number of common
    shares for the years ending December 31, 2010, 2009 and
    2008, respectively, relating to outstanding stock options and
    restricted stock units.

Outstanding options and restricted stock units to purchase or
    receive 474,443, 1,017,136 and 564,487 shares of common
    stock for the years ending December 31, 2010, 2009 and
    2008, respectively, have been excluded from the calculation of
    diluted weighted average number of common and common equivalent
    shares as such options and restricted stock units would be
    anti-dilutive.

Equity-Based
    Compensation

The Company applies the fair value methodology in accounting for
    its equity-based compensation plan.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

The Company has only limited involvement with derivative
    financial instruments and does not use them for trading
    purposes. As described more fully in Note 5, the Company
    enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to
    economically hedge certain short-term intercompany balances
    involving its international businesses and to hedge certain
    forecasted intercompany sales. Such contracts limit the
    Company’s exposure to currency fluctuations on the items
    they hedge. These contracts are adjusted to fair market value as
    of each balance sheet date, with the resulting changes in fair
    value being recognized in the appropriate financial statement
    caption in the income statement consistent with the underlying
    hedged item.

The Company also enters into interest rate swap agreements in
    order to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates. The
    differential paid or received on interest rate swap agreements
    is recognized in interest expense over the life of the
    agreements as incurred. Fixed to floating interest rate swap
    agreements are accounted for as fair value hedges. Changes in
    fair value of outstanding interest rate swap agreements that are
    effective as fair value hedges are recognized in earnings as
    incurred and offset by the change in fair value of the hedged
    item. Floating to fixed interest rate swap agreements are
    accounted for as cash flow hedges.

Fair Value
    Measurements

The Company measures or monitors certain assets and liabilities
    on a fair value basis. Fair value is used on a recurring basis
    for assets and liabilities in which fair value is the primary
    basis of accounting, mainly derivative instruments. Fair value
    is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset
    or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
    between market participants at the measurement date. When
    determining the fair value measurements for assets and
    liabilities required to be recorded at fair value, the Company
    considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it
    would transact and considers assumptions that market
    participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. The
    Company applies the fair value hierarchy established under
    U.S. GAAP and when possible looks to active and observable
    markets to price identical assets and liabilities. If identical
    assets and liabilities are not traded in active markets, the
    Company looks to market observable data for similar assets and
    liabilities.

Recent Accounting
    Pronouncements

In January 2010, the FASB issued authoritative guidance
    regarding fair value measures and disclosures. The guidance
    requires disclosure of significant transfers between
    level 1 and level 2 fair value measurements along with
    the reason for the transfer. An entity must also separately
    report purchases, sales, issuances and settlements within the
    level 3 fair value rollforward. The guidance further
    provides clarification of the level of disaggregation to be used
    within the fair value measurement disclosures for each class of
    assets and liabilities and clarified the disclosures required
    for the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure
    level 2 or level 3 fair value measurements. This new
    authoritative guidance is effective for the Company in fiscal
    years beginning after December 15, 2010, and for interim
    periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of this guidance
    will not impact the Company’s consolidated results of
    operations or financial position.

In October 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance
    impacting two areas of revenue recognition. First, the guidance
    revises previous criteria for separating deliverables and
    allocating consideration to units of accounting in multiple
    deliverable arrangements. Arrangement consideration under the
    new guidance is allocated on the basis of “relative selling
    price” rather than fair value. The guidance establishes a
    hierarchy for determining relative selling price requiring first
    the use of vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”)
    if it exists, then the use of third party evidence. If neither
    VSOE nor third party evidence exists, estimated selling price
    may be used. In addition, the guidance no longer permits the use
    of the residual method of allocation. Secondly, guidance was
    issued excluding software components essential to the
    functionality of tangible products from the scope of software
    revenue recognition. This new authoritative guidance requires
    expanded qualitative and quantitative disclosures and is
    effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially
    modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15,
    2010. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance
    to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
    results of operations or financial position.

ACQUISITIONS AND
    DIVESTITURE

The Company adopted authoritative guidance on business
    combinations on January 1, 2009, which retained the
    fundamental requirements of the previous guidance requiring that
    the purchase method be used for all business combinations, but
    also provided revised guidance for recognizing and measuring
    identifiable assets and goodwill acquired and liabilities
    assumed. Contingent consideration is measured at fair value on
    the acquisition date with subsequent changes in the fair value
    of contingent consideration classified as a

liability recognized in earnings. Transaction costs are excluded
    from acquisition accounting and recognized as an expense as
    incurred.

In December 2009, the Company acquired a leader in vision
    technology for

end-of-line

packaging systems located in the U.S. for an aggregate
    purchase price of $14.3 million. The Company may be
    required to pay additional cash consideration up to a maximum
    amount of $7.8 million related to an earn-out period.
    Goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition totaled
    $10.2 million, which is included in the Company’s
    U.S. Operations segment. The Company also recorded
    $11.8 million of identified intangibles primarily
    pertaining to tradename, customer relationships and acquired
    technology.

In January 2010, the Company acquired a pipette distributor
    located in the United Kingdom for an aggregate purchase price of
    approximately $12.5 million. Goodwill recorded in
    connection with the acquisition totaled approximately
    $7.4 million, which is included in the Company’s
    Western European Operations segment. The Company also recorded
    $4.5 million of identified intangibles pertaining to a
    tradename and customer relationships.

In December 2010, the Company also sold its retail software
    business for in-store item and inventory management solutions
    for approximately $10 million. The sale resulted in a
    $4.4 million pre-tax charge ($3.8 million after-tax)
    and has been included in other charges (income), net in the
    Company’s consolidated statement of operations for the year
    ending December 31, 2010. Annualized net sales and net
    earnings associated with this business are immaterial to the
    Company’s consolidated financial results. Goodwill
    previously recorded associated with this business amounted to
    $13.0 million and was included in the Company’s
    U.S. Operations segment.

FINANCIAL
    INSTRUMENTS

On January 1, 2009, the Company adopted authoritative
    guidance which requires enhanced disclosure of a Company’s
    objectives and strategies for using derivative instruments and
    the impact of those derivative instruments on a Company’s
    operations, financial position and cash flows. The Company has
    limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and
    does not use them for trading purposes. As more fully described
    below, the Company enters into interest rate swap agreements in
    order to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates. At
    December 31, 2010, the interest payments associated with
    31% of the Company’s debt are fixed obligations. The amount
    of the Company’s fixed obligation interest payments may
    change based upon the expiration dates of its interest rate swap
    agreement and the level and composition of its debt. The Company
    also enters into foreign currency forward contracts to limit the
    Company’s exposure to currency fluctuations on the
    respective hedged items. For additional disclosures on the fair
    value of financial instruments, also see Note 6 to the
    consolidated financial statements.

Cash Flow
    Hedges

The Company has an interest rate swap agreement, designated as a
    cash flow hedge. The agreement is a forward-starting swap which
    changes the floating rate LIBOR-based interest payments
    associated with $100 million in forecasted borrowings under
    the Company’s credit facility to a fixed obligation of
    3.24% beginning in October 2010. During 2010, the Company
    settled $100 million of its original $200 million
    arrangement, resulting in expense of $0.6 million being
    reclassified from other comprehensive income to interest
    expense. An additional interest rate swap agreement that changed
    the floating rate LIBOR-based interest payments associated with
    $40 million outstanding under the Company’s credit
    facility to a fixed obligation of 2.70% expired in October 2010.
    During 2009, $110 million of the original $150 million
    agreement was terminated and settled. This coincided with the
    repayment on the Company’s credit facility of the same
    amount, the interest payments of which were hedged under the
    agreement. As a result of this transaction, a charge of
    $2.4 million was reclassified from other comprehensive
    income to interest expense.

The Company entered into a foreign currency forward contract
    (with a notional amount of $25.3 million), designated as a
    cash flow hedge, to hedge certain forecasted intercompany sales
    denominated in U.S. dollars with its foreign businesses.
    The Company recorded the effective portion of the cash flow
    derivative hedging gains and losses in accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss), net of tax and reclassified these
    amounts into earnings in the period in which the transaction
    affected earnings. The foreign currency forward contract expired
    in December 2010.

Through December 31, 2010, no hedge ineffectiveness has
    occurred in relation to these cash flow hedges.

Fair Value
    Hedges and Other Derivatives

The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts in
    order to economically hedge short-term intercompany balances
    largely denominated in Swiss franc and other major European
    currencies with its foreign businesses. In accordance with
    U.S. GAAP, these contracts are considered “derivatives
    not designated as hedging instruments” and are categorized
    as “other derivatives” in the table below. Gains or
    losses on these instruments are reported in current earnings. At
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, these contracts had a notional
    value of $99.3 million and $128.7 million,
    respectively.

The Company entered into a $30 million interest rate swap
    agreement, designated as a fair value hedge, in connection with
    its 4.85% $75 million seven-year Senior Notes. Under the
    swap the Company received a fixed rate of 4.85% (i.e. the same
    rate as the 4.85% Senior Notes) and paid interest at a rate
    of LIBOR plus 0.22%. The Company recorded the gain or loss on
    the derivative as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the
    hedged item in earnings under interest expense. The interest
    rate swap agreement expired in November 2010.

The Company may be exposed to credit losses in the event of
    nonperformance by the counterparties to its derivative financial
    instrument contracts. Counterparties are established banks and
    financial institutions with high credit ratings. The Company
    believes that such counterparties will be able to fully satisfy
    their obligations under these contracts.

FAIR VALUE
    MEASUREMENTS

On January 1, 2008, the Company adopted guidance which
    clarified how companies are required to use a fair value measure
    for recognition and disclosure by establishing a common
    definition of fair value, provided a framework for measuring
    fair value and expanded disclosures about fair value
    measurements. The guidance was applied to all financial assets
    and liabilities reported at fair value on the consolidated
    balance sheet. On January 1, 2009, this guidance was
    adopted for all nonfinancial assets reported at fair value on
    the consolidated balance sheet on a non-recurring basis,
    including goodwill, other intangible assets, long-lived assets
    (for purposes of impairment analysis) and asset retirement
    obligations.

At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company had derivative
    assets totaling $1.8 million and $6.3 million,
    respectively, and derivative liabilities totaling
    $6.1 million and $1.1 million, respectively. The fair
    values of the interest rate swap agreements and foreign currency
    forward contracts that economically hedge short-term
    intercompany balances are estimated based upon inputs from
    current valuation information obtained from dealer quotes and
    priced with observable market assumptions and appropriate
    valuation adjustments for credit risk. The Company has evaluated
    the valuation methodologies used to develop the fair values by
    dealers in order to determine whether such valuations are
    representative of an exit price in the Company’s principal
    market. In addition, the Company uses an internally developed
    model to perform testing on the valuations received from
    brokers. The fair value of the foreign currency forward contract
    hedging forecasted intercompany sales is priced with observable
    market assumptions with appropriate valuations for credit risk.
    The Company has also considered both its own credit risk and
    counterparty credit risk in determining fair value and
    determined these adjustments were insignificant for the years
    ended December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009.

At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company had
    $243.5 million and $11.1 million of cash equivalents,
    respectively, the fair value of which is determined through
    quoted and corroborated prices in active markets. The fair value
    of cash equivalents approximates cost.

The difference between the fair value and carrying value of the
    Company’s long-term debt is not material.

Under U.S. GAAP, fair value is defined as the price that
    would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a
    liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
    at the measurement date. A fair value measurement consists of
    observable and unobservable inputs that reflect the assumptions
    that a market participant would use in pricing an asset or
    liability.

A fair value hierarchy has been established that categorizes
    these inputs into three levels:

Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical
    assets and liabilities

Level 2: Observable inputs other than quoted prices in
    active markets for identical assets and liabilities

Level 3: Unobservable inputs

The annual aggregate amortization expense based on the current

    $3.9 million for 2013, $3.8 million for 2014 and
    $3.2 million for 2015. The non-indefinite-lived intangible
    assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over periods
    ranging from 5 to 45 years. The straight-line method of
    amortization reflects an appropriate allocation of the cost of
    the intangible assets to earnings in proportion to the amount of
    economic benefits obtained by the Company in each reporting
    period. The weighted average amortization period of the
    non-indefinite-lived intangible assets acquired during 2010 is
    21 years. Further, the weighted average amortization
    periods of the customer relationships, proven technology and
    patents and tradenames acquired during 2010 are 30 years,
    12 years and 7 years, respectively.

The Company recognized amortization expense associated with the
    above intangible assets of $6.2 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2010 and $4.8 million and
    $4.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and
    2008, respectively, of which $3.7 million, net of tax for
    the year ended December 31, 2010 and $2.7 million, net
    of tax, for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    pertained to purchased intangibles.

In addition to the above amortization, the Company recorded
    amortization expense associated with capitalized software of
    $8.6 million, $7.0 million and $5.9 million for

The 6.30% Senior Notes mature on June 25, 2015.
    Interest is payable semi-annually in June and December. The
    Company may at any time prepay the 6.30% Senior Notes, in
    whole or in part (but in an amount not less than 10% of the
    original aggregate principal amount), at a price equal to 100%
    of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid
    interest, plus a “make-whole” prepayment premium. In
    the event of a change in control of the Company (as defined in
    the Agreement), the Company may be required to offer to prepay
    the 6.30% Senior Notes in whole at a price equal to 100% of
    the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest.

The Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative
    covenants for agreements of this type including, among others,
    limitations on the Company and its subsidiaries with respect to
    incurrence of liens and priority indebtedness, disposition of
    assets, mergers, and transactions with affiliates. The Agreement
    also requires the Company to maintain a consolidated interest
    coverage ratio of not less than 3.5 to 1.0 and a consolidated
    leverage ratio of not more than 3.5 to 1.0. The agreement
    contains customary events of default with customary grace
    periods, as applicable. The Company was in compliance with these
    covenants at December 31, 2010.

Under the terms of the offering, the Company may sell additional
    Senior Notes at its discretion in an aggregate amount not to
    exceed $600 million. Such additional Senior Notes would
    rank equally with the Company’s unsecured indebtedness.

Issuance costs approximating $0.7 million will be amortized
    to interest expense over the six-year term of the
    6.30% Senior Notes.

Tender
    Offer & Repayment of 4.85% Senior Notes

In November 2003, the Company issued $150 million of 4.85%
    unsecured Senior notes due November 15, 2010
    (“4.85% Senior Notes”). Discount and issuance
    costs approximated $1.2 million and were amortized to
    interest expense over the seven-year term of the 4.85% Senior
    Notes.

NOTES TO THE
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands,
    except share data, unless otherwise stated)

On May 6, 2009, the Company commenced a cash tender offer
    to purchase any and all of its outstanding 4.85% Senior
    Notes due November 15, 2010. The tender offer, which
    expired May 12, 2009, resulted in the repurchase of
    $75 million of the principal balance of the
    4.85% Senior Notes. In connection with the tender, the
    Company recorded a charge of $1.5 million, which included a
    premium of $0.9 million, unamortized discount and debt
    issuance fees of $0.2 million and certain third party costs
    of $0.4 million. These charges were recorded in interest
    expense in the consolidated statement of operations.

At maturity, on November 15, 2010, the Company repaid the
    remaining $75 million outstanding principal balance of its
    4.85% Senior Notes. The repayment was funded from
    additional borrowings under the Company’s credit facility.

Credit
    Agreement

On August 15, 2008, the Company entered into a
    $950 million Credit Agreement (the “Credit
    Agreement”), which replaced its $450 million Amended
    and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Prior Credit
    Agreement”). The Credit Agreement is provided by a group of
    financial institutions (similar to our Prior Credit Agreement)
    and has a maturity date of August 15, 2013. It is a
    revolving credit facility and is not subject to any scheduled
    principal payments prior to maturity. The obligations under the
    Credit Agreement are unsecured.

Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at current
    market rates plus a margin based on the Company’s senior
    unsecured credit ratings, which was, as of December 31,
    2010, set at LIBOR plus 0.70% (based on ratings of
    “BBB” by Standard & Poor’s and
    “Baa2” by Moody’s). The Company must also pay
    facility fees that are tied to its credit ratings. The Credit
    Agreement contains covenants, with which the Company was in
    compliance as of December 31, 2010, including maintaining a
    consolidated interest coverage ratio of not less than 3.5 to 1.0
    and a consolidated leverage ratio of not more than 3.25 to 1.0.
    The Credit Agreement also places certain limitations on the
    Company, including limiting the ability to incur liens or
    indebtedness at a subsidiary level. In addition, the Credit
    Agreement has several events of default, including upon a change
    of control. The Company capitalized $3.3 million in
    financing fees during 2008 associated with the Credit Agreement
    which are amortized to interest expense through 2013. As of
    December 31, 2010, approximately $387.9 million was
    available under the facility.

Other Local
    Arrangements

During 2006, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company issued and
    sold $10 million of redeemable equity instruments to one of
    the Company’s

non-U.S. sponsored

defined benefit plans. These instruments will be redeemable no
    earlier than July 2012 and, as such, are classified as long-term
    debt on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet.

The Company’s weighted average interest rate for the years
    ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was approximately 5% in
    both years. The carrying value of the Company’s debt
    obligations approximates fair value.

The number of authorized shares of the Company’s common
    stock is 125,000,000 shares with a par value of $0.01 per
    share. Holders of the Company’s common stock are entitled
    to one vote per share. At December 31, 2010,
    4,069,742 shares of the Company’s common stock were
    reserved for issuance pursuant to the Company’s stock
    option plans.

Preferred
    Stock

The Board of Directors, without further shareholder
    authorization, is authorized to issue up to
    10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per
    share in one or more series and to determine and fix the rights,
    preferences and privileges of each series, including dividend
    rights and preferences over dividends on the common stock and
    one or more series of the preferred stock, conversion rights,
    voting rights (in addition to those provided by law), redemption
    rights and the terms of any sinking fund therefore, and rights
    upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, including
    preferences over the common stock and one or more series of the
    preferred stock. The issuance of shares of preferred stock, or
    the issuance of rights to purchase such shares, may have the
    effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control
    of the Company or an unsolicited acquisition proposal.

Restricted Stock
    Units

In 2010 and 2009, the Company granted 43,485 and 57,194
    restricted stock units, respectively, to certain employees and
    directors. The weighted average grant-date fair value of the
    restricted stock units granted in 2010 and 2009 was $132.94 and
    $90.41 per unit, respectively, and the restricted units vest
    ratably primarily over a five-year period. The total fair value
    of the restricted stock units on the date of grant of
    $5.8 million for 2010 and $5.2 million for 2009 will
    be recorded as compensation expense ratably over the vesting
    period. Approximately $4.2 million and $3.4 million of
    compensation expense was recognized during the years ended
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Shareholder
    Rights Plan

On August 26, 2002, the Board of Directors adopted a
    Shareholder Rights Plan under which the Company declared a
    non-cash dividend of one right for each outstanding share of
    common stock. The Rights, which expire on September 5,
    2012, entitle stockholders to buy one one-thousandth of a share
    of preferred stock at an exercise price of $150. The Rights were
    distributed to those stockholders of record as of close of
    business on September 5, 2002 and are attached to all
    certificates representing those shares of common stock.

The Rights Plan provides that should any person or group
    acquire, or announce a tender or exchange offer for 15% or more
    of the Company’s common stock, each Right, other than
    Rights held by the acquiring person or group, would entitle its
    holder to purchase a number of shares of the Company’s
    common stock for 50% of its then-current market value. Unless a
    15% acquisition has occurred, the Rights may be redeemed by the
    Board of Directors of the Company at any time. The Rights Plan
    will not be triggered by a tender or exchange offer for all
    outstanding shares of the Company at a price and on terms that
    the Company’s Board of Directors determines to be adequate
    and in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders.

The Rights Plan exempts any stockholder that beneficially owned
    15% or more of the Company’s common stock as of
    August 26, 2002. However, the Rights will become
    exercisable if, at any time after August 26, 2002, any of
    these stockholders acquire additional shares of the
    Company’s common stock in an amount which is greater than
    2% of the Company’s outstanding common stock.

Share Repurchase
    Program

The Company has a $2.25 billion share repurchase program
    that was increased in November 2010, whereby the Board of
    Directors authorized the Company to repurchase an additional
    $750 million of common shares. The Company expects that the
    new authorization will be utilized over the next several years.
    As of December 31, 2010, there were $920.6 million of
    remaining common shares authorized to be repurchased under the
    program. The share repurchases are expected to be funded from
    cash balances, borrowings and cash generated from operating
    activities. Repurchases will be made through open market

    on business and market conditions, the stock price, trading
    restrictions, the level of acquisition activity and other
    factors. The Company has purchased 17.2 million shares
    since the inception of the program through December 31,
    2010.

The Company’s share repurchase program was suspended in
    October 2008 and restarted in December 2009. During the years
    ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company spent
    $240.0 million and $6.0 million on the repurchase of
    1,955,634 shares and 58,800 shares at an average price
    per share of $122.70 and $101.82, respectively. The Company
    reissued 527,276 shares and 308,154 shares held in
    treasury for the exercise of stock options and restricted stock
    units during 2010 and 2009, respectively.

The Company also reissued 2,549 shares and
    6,467 shares held in treasury during 2010 and 2009,
    respectively, pursuant to its 2007 Share Plan, which
    extends certain eligible employees the option to receive a

EQUITY INCENTIVE
    PLAN

The Company’s equity incentive plan provides employees and
    directors of the Company additional incentives to join

and/or

remain in the service of the Company as well as to maintain and
    enhance the long-term performance and profitability of the
    Company. The Company’s 2004 equity incentive plan was
    approved by shareholders on May 6, 2004 and provides that
    3.5 million shares of common stock, plus any options
    outstanding under the Company’s prior option plan that
    terminate without being exercised, may be the subject of awards.
    Of the 3.5 million shares of common stock available for
    awards, up to 2.1 million shares may be issued in the form
    of restricted stock or restricted stock units. The plan provides
    for the grant of options, restricted stock, restricted stock
    units and other equity-based awards. The exercise price of
    options granted shall not be less than the fair market value of
    the common stock on the date of the award. Options primarily
    vest equally over a five-year period from the date of grant and
    have a maximum term of up to 10 years and six months.
    Restricted units primarily vest equally over a five-year period
    from the date of grant. Since 2005, the compensation committee
    of the Board of Directors has generally granted restricted share
    units to participating managers and non-qualified stock options
    to executive officers.

All share-based compensation arrangements granted to employees,
    including stock option grants, are recognized in the
    consolidated statement of operations based on the grant-date
    fair value of the award over the period during which an employee
    is required to provide service in exchange for the award.
    Share-based compensation expense is recorded within selling,
    general and administrative in the consolidated statement of
    operations with a corresponding offset to additional paid-in
    capital in the consolidated balance sheet.

During the first quarter of 2008, the Company granted 213,850
    performance-based options, with a grant-date fair value of
    $32.20. Compensation expense will be recognized over the
    five-year vesting provisions based upon the probability of the
    performance condition being met.

The fair values of stock options granted were calculated using
    the Black-Scholes pricing model. The aggregate intrinsic value
    of an option is the amount by which the fair value of the

BENEFIT
    PLANS

Mettler-Toledo maintains a number of retirement and other
    post-retirement employee benefit plans.

Certain subsidiaries sponsor defined contribution plans.
    Benefits are determined and funded annually based upon the terms
    of the plans. Amounts recognized as cost under these plans
    amounted to $10.5 million, $11.6 million and
    $12.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2010,
    2009 and 2008, respectively.

Certain subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit plans. Benefits are
    provided to employees primarily based upon years of service and
    employees’ compensation for certain periods during the last
    years of employment. Prior to 2002, the Company’s
    U.S. operations also provided post-retirement medical
    benefits to their employees. Contributions for medical benefits
    are related to employee years of service.

The accumulated benefit obligations at December 31, 2010
    and 2009 were $125.3 million and $119.9 million,
    respectively, for the U.S. defined benefit pension plan and
    $634.8 million and $562.9 million, respectively, for
    all

non-U.S. plans.

Certain of the plans included within

non-U.S. pension

benefits have benefit obligations which exceed the fair value of
    plan assets. The projected benefit obligation, the accumulated
    benefit obligation and fair value of assets of these plans as of
    December 31, 2010 were $139.5 million,
    $126.8 million and $38.4 million, respectively.

The assumed discount rates and rates of increase in future
    compensation levels used in calculating the projected benefit
    obligations vary according to the economic conditions of the
    country in which the retirement plans are situated. The weighted

The projected post-retirement benefit obligation was principally
    determined using discount rates of 5.25% in 2010, 5.50% in 2009
    and 6.25% in 2008. Net periodic post-retirement benefit cost was
    principally determined using discount rates of 5.50% in 2010 and
    6.25% in both 2009 and 2008 and health care cost trend rates
    ranging from 7.5% to 9.0% in 2010, 7.5% to 10.0% in 2009 and
    7.5% to 11.0% in 2008, decreasing to 5.0% in 2015.

The health care cost trend rate assumption has a significant
    effect on the accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation and

return criteria are established by the pension committee or
    designated officers of each plan. Target asset allocation ranges
    for the U.S. pension plan include

30-50%%

equity securities,

15-35%

fixed
    income securities and

25-45%

other
    types of investments. International plan assets relate primarily
    to the Company’s Swiss plan with target allocations of

25-45%

in
    equities,

35-55%

in
    fixed income securities and

15-25%

in
    other types of investments. Actual results are monitored against
    targets and the trustees are required to report to the members
    of each plan, including an analysis of investment performance on
    an annual basis at a minimum.

Day-to-day

asset management is typically performed by third-party asset
    managers, reporting to the pension committees or designated
    officers.

The long-term rate of return on plan asset assumptions used to
    determine pension expense under U.S. GAAP are generally
    based on estimated future returns for the target investment mix
    determined by the trustees as well as historical investment
    performance.

The fair value of the Company’s stock and corporate and
    government bonds are valued at the year end closing price as
    reported on the securities exchange on which they are traded.
    Mutual funds are valued at the exchange-listed year end closing
    price or at the net asset value of shares held by the fund at
    the end of the year. Insurance contracts are valued by
    discounting the related cash flows using a current year end
    market rate or at cash surrender value, which is presumed to
    equal fair value. Funds of hedge funds are valued at the net
    asset value of shares held by the fund at the end of the year.

METTLER-TOLEDO
    INTERNATIONAL INC.

NOTES TO THE
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands,
    except share data, unless otherwise stated)

The Company believes that it is reasonably possible that the
    unrecognized tax benefit balance could change over the next
    twelve months, primarily related to potential disputes raised by
    the taxing authorities over income and expense recognition. An
    estimate of the range of these increases cannot currently be
    made. However, the Company does not expect a change would have a
    material impact on its financial position, results of operations
    or cash flows.

The Company has recorded valuation allowances related to certain
    of its deferred income tax assets due to the uncertainty of the
    ultimate realization of future benefits from such assets. The
    potential decrease or increase of the valuation allowance in the
    near term is dependent on the future ability of the Company to
    realize the deferred tax assets that are affected by the future
    profitability of operations in various worldwide jurisdictions.
    The $14.9 million decrease and $33.8 million increase
    in the total valuation allowance during 2010 and 2009,
    respectively, are primarily attributable to changes in the
    foreign tax credit carryforward and foreign currency differences
    recorded through other comprehensive income. $0.9 million
    of the Company’s total valuation allowance will be credited
    to shareholders’ equity if and when realized.

At December 31, 2010, the Company has various
    U.S. state net operating losses and various foreign net
    operating losses that have various expiration periods.

The Company plans to repatriate earnings from China,
    Switzerland, the United Kingdom and certain other countries in
    future years and believes that there will be no additional cost
    associated with the repatriation of such foreign earnings other
    than withholding taxes. All other undistributed earnings are
    considered to be permanently reinvested.

During the third quarter of 2010, the Company recorded discrete
    tax items resulting in a net tax benefit of $5.2 million
    primarily related to the favorable resolution of certain prior
    year tax matters.

During the first quarter of 2009, the Company recorded a
    discrete tax benefit of $8.3 million, primarily related to
    the favorable resolution of certain prior year tax matters.

During the first quarter of 2008, the Company recorded a
    discrete tax benefit of $2.5 million related to favorable
    withholding tax law changes in China. During the third quarter
    of 2008, the Company recorded discrete tax items resulting in a
    net tax benefit of $3.5 million primarily related to the
    closure of certain tax matters.

As of December 31, 2010, the major jurisdictions for which
    the Company is subject to examinations are Germany for years
    after 2007, the United States after 2006, France after 2005,
    Switzerland after 2008, the United Kingdom after 2008 and China
    after 2009. Additionally, the Company is currently under
    examination in various taxing jurisdictions in which it conducts
    business operations. While the Company has not yet received any
    material assessments from these taxing authorities, the Company
    believes that adequate amounts of taxes and related interest and
    penalties have been provided for any adverse adjustments as a
    result of these examinations and that the ultimate outcome of
    these examinations will not result in a material impact on the
    Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial
    position.

    completed. Charges under the program primarily comprise
    severance costs. Through December 31, 2010, total charges
    recognized were $42.7 million, of which $4.9 million,
    $31.4 million and $6.4 million was recognized during
    2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Cash paid for severance
    during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008
    totaled $11.1 million, $22.2 million and
    $0.7 million, respectively. Under the program, the
    Company’s workforce (including employees and temporary
    personnel) was reduced by approximately 1,000.

SEGMENT
    REPORTING

The Company has five reportable segments: U.S. Operations,
    Swiss Operations, Western European Operations, Chinese
    Operations and Other. U.S. Operations represent certain of
    the Company’s marketing and producing organizations located
    in the United States. Western European Operations include the
    Company’s marketing and producing organizations in Western
    Europe, excluding operations located in Switzerland. Swiss
    Operations include marketing and producing organizations located
    in Switzerland as well as extensive R&D operations that are
    responsible for the development, production and marketing of
    precision instruments, including weighing, analytical and
    measurement technologies for use in a variety of industrial and
    laboratory applications. Chinese Operations represent the
    Company’s marketing and producing organizations located in
    China. The Company’s market organizations are
    geographically focused and are responsible for all aspects of
    the Company’s sales and service. Operating segments that
    exist outside these reportable segments are included in Other.

The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same
    as those described in the summary of significant accounting
    policies. The Company evaluates performance based on segment
    profit for segment reporting (gross profit less research and
    development and selling, general and administrative expenses,
    before amortization, interest expense, restructuring charges,
    other charges (income), net and taxes). Inter-segment sales and
    transfers are priced to reflect consideration of market
    conditions and the regulations of the countries in which the
    transferring entities are located.

    operating segments:
