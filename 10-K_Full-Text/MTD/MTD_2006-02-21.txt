PART I

Item 1.

Business

We are a leading global supplier of precision instruments and
services. We are the world’s largest manufacturer of
weighing instruments for use in laboratory, industrial, product
inspection, transportation and logistics and food retailing
applications. We also hold top-three market positions in several
related analytical instruments, and are a leading provider of
automated chemistry systems used in drug and chemical compound
discovery and development. In addition, we are the world’s
largest manufacturer and marketer of metal detection and other

end-of

-line inspection
systems used in production and packaging, and hold a leading
position in certain process analytics applications.

Our business is geographically diversified, with sales in 2005
derived 42% from Europe, 41% from North and South America and
17% from Asia and other countries. Our customer base is also
diversified by industry and by individual customer.

Mettler-Toledo International Inc. was incorporated as a Delaware
corporation in 1991 and became a publicly traded company with
its initial public offering in November 1997. In November 2001,
we acquired Rainin Instrument, a leading manufacturer of
pipetting solutions used in pharmaceutical, biotech and medical
research applications.

Business Segments

We updated the geographic aggregation of our segments as of
March 31, 2005 and have determined there are five
reportable segments: U.S. Operations, Swiss Operations,
Western European Operations, Chinese Operations and Other. Prior
year segment information has been restated to conform with the
current period presentation. See Note 16 to the audited
consolidated financial statements and Item 7.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations under “Results of
Operations — by Operating Segment” for detailed
results by segment and geographic region.

We manufacture a wide variety of precision instruments and
provide value-added services to our customers. Our principal
products and principal services are set forth below. Given the
inherently global nature of our business, the following
description of our products, customers and distribution, sales
and services, research and development, manufacturing and other
elements of our business apply, for the most part, to each of
our segments. In some instances particular products are targeted
for particular segments but none of these products are material
in nature to the entire business or an individual segment.

Laboratory Instruments

We make a wide variety of precision laboratory instruments,
including laboratory balances, pipettes, titrators, thermal
analysis systems and other analytical instruments. The
laboratory instruments business accounted for approximately 45%
of our net sales in 2005.

Laboratory Balances

Our laboratory balances have weighing ranges from one
ten-millionth of a gram up to 32 kilograms. To cover a wide
range of customer needs and price points, we market our balances
in a range of product tiers offering different levels of
functionality. Based on the same technology platform, we also
manufacture mass comparators, which are used by weights and
measures regulators as well as laboratories to ensure the
accuracy of reference weights.

In addition to Mettler-Toledo branded products, we manufacture
and sell balances under the brand name “Ohaus.” Ohaus
branded products principally target the educational market and
other markets in which customers are interested in lower cost, a
more limited set of features and less comprehensive support and
service.



Pipettes

Pipettes are used in laboratories for dispensing small volumes
of liquids. In late 2001, we acquired Rainin Instrument, a
premier provider of pipetting solutions based in California.
Rainin develops, manufactures and distributes advanced pipettes,
tips and accessories, including single and multi-channel manual
and electronic pipettes. Rainin maintains service centers in the
key markets where customers periodically send in their pipettes
for certified recalibrations. Rainin’s principal end
markets are pharmaceutical, biotech, clinical and academia.

Analytical Instruments

Titrators measure the chemical composition of samples and are
used in laboratories as well as the food and beverage and other
industries. Our high-end titrators are multi-tasking models,
which can perform two determinations simultaneously on multiple
vessels. Our offering includes robotics to automate routine work
in quality control applications.

Thermal analysis systems measure material properties as a
function of temperature, such as weight, dimension, energy flow
and viscoelastic properties. Thermal analysis systems are used
in nearly every industry, but primarily in the plastics and
polymer industries and increasingly in the pharmaceutical
industry.

pH meters measure acidity in laboratory samples. We also sell
density and refractometry instruments, which measure chemical
concentrations in solutions. In addition, we manufacture and
sell moisture analyzers, which precisely determine the moisture
content of a sample by utilizing an infrared dryer to evaporate
moisture.

Laboratory Software

LabX, our PC-based laboratory software platform, manages and
analyzes data generated by our titrators and balances. LabX
provides full network capability, has efficient, intuitive
protocols, and enables customers to collect and archive data in
compliance with the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration’s traceability requirements for
electronically stored data (also known as 21 CFR
Part 11). We plan to expand LabX to include other
laboratory instruments.

Automated Chemistry Solutions

Our current Automated Chemistry offerings are focused on key
aspects of drug development process, including the
identification of new lead compounds and optimization of those
leads. Our automated lab reactors, in situ analysis systems, and
VirtualLab Informatics Suite are considered integral to the
process development and

scale-up

activities of
our customers. We offer a range of technologies including
synthesizer tools to support chemists working on lead
identification and optimization. In addition, we provide systems
for cleaning up and purifying synthesized products for use in
preclinical trials. Our on-line measurement technologies based
on infrared and laser light enables customers to monitor
chemical reactions and crystallization processes in the lab and
plant. We believe that our portfolio of integrated technologies
can bring significant efficiencies to the drug development
process, enabling our customers to create larger numbers of
higher quality candidate compounds and bring them to market
faster.

Process Analytics

Our process analytics business provides instruments for the
in-line measurement of liquid parameters used primarily in the
production process of pharmaceutical, biotech, beverage,
microelectronics, and chemical companies. About half of our
process analytics sales are to the pharmaceutical and biotech
markets, where our customers need fast and secure

scale-up

and production
that meets the validation processes required for GMP (Good
Manufacturing Processes) and other regulatory standards. We are
a leading solution provider for liquid analytical measurement to
control and optimize production processes. Our solutions include
sensor technology for pH, dissolved oxygen,
CO


,
conductivity, turbidity and TOC



and automated systems for calibration and cleaning of
measurement points. Our instruments offer leading
multi-parameter capabilities and plant-wide control system
integration, which are key for integrated measurement of
multiple parameters to secure production quality and efficiency.
With a worldwide network of specialists, we support customers in
critical process applications, compliance and systems
integration questions.

Industrial Instruments

We manufacture numerous industrial weighing instruments and
related terminals and we offer dedicated software solutions for
the chemical, pharmaceutical and food industries. We supply
automatic identification and data capture solutions, which
integrate in-motion weighing, dimensioning and identification
technologies for transport, shipping and logistics customers. We
also offer heavy industrial scales and related software. The
industrial instruments business accounted for approximately 42%
of our net sales in 2005.

Industrial Weighing Instruments

We offer a comprehensive line of industrial scales and balances,
such as bench scales and floor scales, for weighing loads from a
few grams to several thousand kilograms in applications ranging
from measuring materials in chemical production to weighing mail
and packages. Our products are used in a wide range of
applications, such as counting applications and in formulating
and mixing ingredients.

Industrial Terminals

Our industrial scale terminals integrate collected data and
control and automate manufacturing processes. They allow users
to remotely download programs or access setup data and can
minimize down time through predictive rather than reactive
maintenance.

Transportation and Logistics

We are a leading global supplier of automatic identification and
data capture solutions, which integrate in-motion weighing,
dimensioning and identification technologies. With these
solutions, customers can measure the weight and cubic volume of
packages for appropriate billing, logistics and quality control.
Our solutions also integrate into customers’ information
systems.

Vehicle Scale Systems

Our primary heavy industrial products are scales for weighing
trucks or railcars (i.e., weighing bulk goods as they enter or
leave a factory or at a toll station). Heavy industrial scales
are capable of measuring weights up to 500 tons and permit
accurate weighing under extreme environmental conditions. We
also offer advanced computer software that can be used with our
heavy industrial scales to facilitate a broad range of customer
solutions and provides a complete system for managing vehicle
transaction processing.

Industrial Software

We offer a wide range of software that can be used with our
industrial instruments. Examples include FreeWeigh.Net,
statistical quality control software, Formweigh.Net, our
formulation/batching software, and OverDrive. FreeWeigh.Net and
Formweigh.Net provide full network capability and enable
customers to collect and archive data in compliance with the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s traceability
requirements for electronically stored data (21 CFR part
11). In addition, our Q.i365 software controls batching
processes by monitoring the material transfer control process.
Q.i365 also provides statistical, diagnostic and operational
information for asset management, process control and database
applications.



Product Inspection

Increasing safety and consumer protection requirements are
driving the need for more and more sophisticated

end-of

-line inspection
systems (e.g., for use in food processing and packaging, and
pharmaceutical and other industries). We are a leading global
provider of metal detectors, x-ray visioning equipment and
checkweighers that are used in these industries. Metal detectors
are most commonly used to detect fine particles of metal that
may be contained in raw materials or may be generated by the
manufacturing process itself. X-ray-based vision inspection
helps detect non-metallic contamination, such as glass, stones
and pits, which enter the manufacturing process for similar
reasons. Our x-ray systems can detect metal in metallized
containers and can be used for mass control. Both x-ray and
metal detection systems may be used together with checkweighers
as components of integrated packaging lines. Checkweighers are
used to control the filling content of packaged goods such as
food, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. FreeWeigh.net is our
statistical and quality control software that optimizes package
filling, monitors weight-related data and integrates it in real
time into customers’ enterprise resource planning and/or
process control systems.

Retail Weighing Solutions

Supermarkets, hypermarkets and other food retail businesses make
use of multiple weighing and food labeling solutions for
handling fresh goods (such as meats, vegetables, fruits and
cheeses). We offer stand-alone scales for basic counter weighing
and pricing, price finding and printing. In addition, we offer
networked scales and software, which can integrate backroom,
counter, self-service and checkout functions and can incorporate
fresh goods item data into a supermarket’s overall food
item and inventory management system. Customer benefits are in
the areas of pricing, merchandising, inventory management, and
regulatory compliance. The retail business accounted for
approximately 13% of our net sales in 2005.

Retail Software

Our subsidiary SofTechnics provides retail software for in-store
item and inventory management solutions. SofTechnics’
offering complements our retail weighing solutions to food
retailers by providing the full scope of real-time item
management retailers can then match local store inventory levels
with local customer demand. As our traditional retail weighing
business extends further into the area of information
technology, the opportunity to cross-sell SofTechnics’
software and services expands. We continue to introduce
SofTechnics software for the improved inventory management of
fresh goods and plan to sell more complete and integrated data
management solutions for fresh goods now and in the future.

Customers and Distribution

Our principal customers include companies in the following key
end markets: the life science industry (pharmaceutical and
biotech companies, as well as independent research
organizations); food producers; food retailers; the beverage
industry; specialty chemicals and cosmetics companies; the
transportation and logistics industry; the metals industry; the
electronics industry; and the academic market.

Our products are sold through a variety of distribution
channels. Generally, more technically sophisticated products are
sold through our direct sales force, while less complicated
products are sold through indirect channels. Our sales through
direct channels exceed our sales through indirect channels. A
significant portion of our sales in the Americas is generated
through the indirect channels. We have a diversified customer
base, with no single customer accounting for more than 2% of
2005 net sales.

Sales and Service

Market Organizations

We maintain geographically focused market organizations around
the world that are responsible for all aspects of our sales and
service. The market organizations are local marketing and
service organizations designed to maintain close relationships
with our customers. Each market organization has the flexibility
to



adapt its marketing and service efforts to account for different
cultural and economic conditions. Market organizations also work
closely with our producing organizations (described below) by
providing feedback on manufacturing and product development
initiatives and relaying new product and application ideas.

We have one of the largest and broadest global sales and service
organizations among precision instrument manufacturers. At
December 31, 2005, our sales and services group consisted
of over 4,800 employees in sales, marketing and customer service
(including related administration) and post-sales technical
service, located in 35 countries. This field organization has
the capability to provide service and support to our customers
and distributors in major markets across the globe. This is
important because our customers are seeking to do more and more
business with a consistent global approach.

Service

We have expanded our service business from one centered on
repair and maintenance to one driven by regulatory compliance
and other value-added services, which we call Service XXL. We
have a unique offering to our pharmaceutical customers in
promoting use of our instruments in compliance with FDA
regulations and we can provide these services regardless of the
customer’s location throughout the world. This global
service network also is an important factor in our ability to
expand in emerging markets. We estimate that we have the largest
installed base of weighing instruments in the world. In 2005,
service (representing service contracts, repairs and replacement
parts) accounted for approximately 23% of our total net sales. A
significant portion of this amount is derived from sales of
replacement parts.

Beyond revenue opportunities, we believe service is a key part
of our solution offering and helps significantly in customer
retention. The close relationships and frequent contact with our
large customer base provides us with sales opportunities and
innovative product and application ideas.

Research and Development and Manufacturing

Producing Organizations

Our research, product development and manufacturing efforts are
organized into a number of producing organizations which
specialize in specific products on a global basis. Our focused
producing organizations help reduce product development time and
costs, improve customer focus and maintain technological
leadership. The producing organizations work together to share
ideas and best practices, and there is a close interface and
coordinated customer interaction among marketing organizations
and producing organizations.

Research and Development

We intend to continue to invest in product innovation in order
to provide technologically advanced products to our customers
for existing and new applications. Over the last three years, we
have invested $243.1 million in research and development
($81.9 million in 2005, $83.2 million in 2004, and
$78.0 million in 2003). In 2005, we spent approximately
5.5% of net sales on research and development. Our research and
development efforts fall into two categories:

•

technology advancements, which increase the value of our
    products. These advancements may be in the form of enhanced
    functionality, new applications for our technologies, more
    accurate or reliable measurement, additional software capability
    or automation through robotics or other means, and

•

cost reductions, which reduce the manufacturing cost of our
    products through better overall design.

We have devoted an increasing proportion of our research and
development budget to software development. This includes
software to process the signals captured by the sensors of our
instruments, application-specific software, and software that
connects our solutions into customers’ IT systems. We



closely integrate research and development with marketing,
manufacturing and product engineering. We have over 800
employees in research and development and product engineering.

Manufacturing

We are a worldwide manufacturer, with facilities principally in
the United States, Switzerland, Germany, the United Kingdom and
China. Laboratory instruments are produced mainly in Switzerland
and to a lesser extent in the United States and China, while our
remaining products are produced worldwide. We emphasize product
quality in our manufacturing operations, and most of our
products require very strict tolerances and exact
specifications. We use an extensive quality control system that
is integrated into each step of the manufacturing process. All
major manufacturing facilities have achieved ISO 9001
certification. We believe that our manufacturing capacity is
sufficient to meet our present and currently anticipated needs.

We generally manufacture only critical components ourselves,
usually components that contain proprietary technology. When
outside manufacturing is more efficient, we contract with others
for certain components. We use a wide range of suppliers. We
believe our supply arrangements to be adequate and that there
are no material constraints on the sources and availability of
materials. From time to time we rely on a single supplier for
all of our requirements of a particular component. Supply
arrangements for electronics are generally made globally.

Backlog; Seasonality

Our manufacturing turnaround time is generally sufficiently
short so as to permit us to manufacture to fill orders for most
of our products, which helps to limit inventory costs. Backlog
is therefore generally a function of requested customer delivery
dates and is typically no longer than one to two months.

Our business has historically experienced a slight amount of
seasonal variation, particularly the high-end laboratory
instruments business. Traditionally, sales in the first quarter
are slightly lower than, and sales in the fourth quarter are
slightly higher than sales in the second and third quarters.
Fourth quarter sales have historically generated approximately
27-28% of our net sales. This trend has a somewhat greater
effect on income from operations than on net sales because fixed
costs are spread evenly across all quarters.

Employees

As of December 31, 2005, we had approximately 8,800
employees throughout the world, including approximately 4,000 in
Europe, 2,900 in North and South America, and 1,900 in Asia and
other countries.

We believe our employee relations are good, and we have not
suffered any material employee work stoppage or strike during
the last five years, except for a strike in early 2003 at our
Bethune, France facility, which has been closed. Labor unions do
not represent a meaningful number of our employees.

Intellectual Property

We hold over 1,700 patents and trademarks, primarily in the
United States, Switzerland, Germany, the United Kingdom, France,
Japan and China. Our products generally incorporate a wide
variety of technological innovations, some of which are
protected by patents of various durations. Products are
generally not protected as a whole by individual patents, and as
a result, no one patent or group of related patents is material
to our business. We have numerous trademarks, including the
Mettler-Toledo name and logo, which are material to our
business. We regularly protect against infringement of our
intellectual property.

Regulation

Our products are subject to various regulatory standards and
approvals by weights and measures regulatory authorities. All of
our electrical components are subject to electrical safety
standards. We believe that we are in compliance in all material
respects with applicable regulations.



Approvals are required to ensure our instruments do not
impermissibly influence other instruments, and are themselves
not affected by other instruments. In addition, some of our
products are used in “legal for trade” applications,
in which prices based on weight are calculated, and for which
specific weights and measures approvals are required. Although
there are a large number of regulatory agencies across our
markets, there is an increasing trend toward harmonization of
standards, and weights and measures regulation is harmonized
across the European Union.

Our products may also be subject to special requirements
depending on the end-user and market. For example, laboratory
customers are typically subject to Good Laboratory Practices
(GLP), industrial customers to Good Manufacturing Practices
(GMP), pharmaceutical customers to U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) regulations, and customers in food
processing industries may be subject to Hazard Analysis and
Critical Control Point (HACCP) regulations. Products used
in hazardous environments may also be subject to special
requirements.

Environmental Matters

We are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the
jurisdictions in which we operate. We own or lease a number of
properties and manufacturing facilities around the world. Like
many of our competitors, we have incurred, and will continue to
incur, capital and operating expenditures and other costs in
complying with such laws and regulations in both the United
States and abroad.

We are currently involved in, or have potential liability with
respect to, the remediation of past contamination in certain of
our facilities in both the United States and abroad. Our
subsidiary Mettler-Toledo Hi-Speed, Inc. (“Hi-Speed”)
is one of two private parties ordered to perform certain ground
water contamination monitoring under an administrative consent
order that the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection (“NJDEP”) signed on June 13, 1988
with respect to certain property in Landing, New Jersey. GEI
International Corporation (“GEI”) is the other ordered
party. GEI has failed to fulfill its obligations under the NJDEP
order, and NJDEP has agreed with Hi-Speed that the residual
ground water contaminants can be monitored through the
establishment of a Classification Exception Area and concurrent
Well Restriction Area for the site. The NJDEP does not view
these vehicles as remedial measures, but rather as
“institutional controls” that must be adequately
maintained and periodically evaluated. We estimate that the
costs of compliance associated with monitoring ground water
contamination levels at the site will be approximately
$0.8 million over the next seven years.

In addition, certain of our present and former facilities have
or had been in operation for many decades and, over such time,
some of these facilities may have used substances or generated
and disposed of wastes which are or may be considered hazardous.
It is possible that these sites, as well as disposal sites owned
by third parties to which we have sent wastes, may in the future
be identified and become the subject of remediation.
Accordingly, although we believe that we are in substantial
compliance with applicable environmental requirements and to
date we have not incurred material expenditures in connection
with environmental matters, it is possible that we could become
subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future
that could result in a material adverse effect on our financial
condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Competition

Our markets are highly competitive. Weighing and analytical
instruments markets are fragmented both geographically and by
application, particularly the industrial and food retailing
markets. As a result, we face numerous regional or specialized
competitors, many of which are well established in their
markets. In addition, some of our competitors are divisions of
larger companies with potentially greater financial and other
resources than our own. Taken together, the competitive forces
present in our markets can impair our operating margins in
certain product lines and geographic markets.

We expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and
performance of their products and to introduce new products with
competitive prices. Although we believe that we have
technological and other competitive advantages over many of our
competitors, we may not be able to realize and maintain



these advantages. These advantages include our worldwide market
leadership positions; our global brand and reputation; our track
record of technological innovation; our comprehensive,
high-quality solution offering; our global sales and service
offering; our large installed base of weighing instruments; and
the fact that our revenue base is diversified by geographic
region, product range and customer. To remain competitive, we
must continue to invest in research and development, sales and
marketing and customer service and support. We cannot be sure
that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make these
investments or that we will be successful in identifying,
developing and maintaining any competitive advantages.

We believe that the principal competitive factors in developed
markets for purchasing decisions are the product itself,
application support, service support and price. In emerging
markets, where there is greater demand for less sophisticated
products, price is a more important factor than in developed
markets. Competition in the U.S. laboratory market is also
influenced by the presence of large distributors that sell not
only our products but those of our competitors as well.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

Factors affecting our future operating results

Currency fluctuations may affect our operating profits.

Because we conduct operations in many countries, our operating
income can be significantly affected by fluctuations in currency
exchange rates. Swiss franc-denominated expenses represent a
much greater percentage of our operating expenses than Swiss
franc-denominated sales represent of our net sales. In part,
this is because most of our manufacturing costs in Switzerland
relate to products that are sold outside Switzerland. Moreover,
a substantial percentage of our research and development
expenses and general and administrative expenses are incurred in
Switzerland. Therefore, if the Swiss franc strengthens against
all or most of our major trading currencies (e.g

.

, the
U.S. dollar, the euro, other major European currencies and
the Japanese yen), our operating profit is reduced. We also have
significantly more sales in European currencies (other than the
Swiss franc) than we have expenses in those currencies.
Therefore, when European currencies weaken against the
U.S. dollar and the Swiss franc, it also decreases our
operating profits. Accordingly, the Swiss franc exchange rate to
the euro is an important cross-rate monitored by the Company. We
estimate that a 1% strengthening of the Swiss franc against the
euro would result in a decrease in our earnings before tax of
approximately $1 million on an annual basis. In addition to
the effects of exchange rate movements on operating profits, our
debt levels can fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates,
particularly between the U.S. dollar and the Swiss franc.
Based on our outstanding debt at December 31, 2005, we
estimate that a 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar against
the currencies in which our debt is denominated would result in
an increase of approximately $33.4 million in the reported
U.S. dollar value of the debt.

We are subject to certain risks associated with our
    international operations and fluctuating conditions in emerging
    markets.

We conduct business in many countries, including emerging
markets in Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe and these
operations represent a significant potion of our sales and
earnings. For example our Chinese Operations account for
$116.9 million of sales to external customers and
$40.2 million of segment profit. In addition to the
currency risks discussed above, international operations pose
other substantial risks and problems for us. For instance,
various local jurisdictions in which we operate may revise or
alter their respective legal and regulatory requirements. In
addition, we may encounter one or more of the following
obstacles or risks:

We must also comply with a variety of regulations regarding the
conversion and repatriation of funds earned in local currencies.
For example, converting earnings from our operations in China
into other currencies and repatriating these funds require
governmental approvals. If we cannot comply with these or other
applicable regulations, we may face increased difficulties in
utilizing cash flow generated by these operations outside of
China.



Economic conditions in emerging markets have from time to time
deteriorated significantly, and some emerging markets are
experiencing recessionary trends, severe currency devaluations
and inflationary prices. Moreover, economic problems in
individual markets can spread to other economies, adding to the
adverse conditions we face in emerging markets. We remain
committed to emerging markets, particularly those in Asia, Latin
America and Eastern Europe. However, we expect the fluctuating
economic conditions will affect our results of operations in
these markets for the foreseeable future.

We operate in highly competitive markets, and it may be
    difficult to preserve operating margins, gain market share and
    maintain a technological advantage.

Our markets are highly competitive. Weighing and analytical
instruments markets are also fragmented both geographically and
by application, particularly the industrial and food retailing
markets. As a result, we face numerous regional or specialized
competitors, many of whom are well established in their markets.
In addition, some of our competitors are divisions of larger
companies with potentially greater financial and other resources
than our company. Taken together, the competitive forces present
in our markets can impair our operating margins in certain
product lines and geographic markets. We expect our competitors
to continue to improve the design and performance of their
products and to introduce new products with competitive prices.
Although we believe that we have certain technological and other
advantages over our competitors, we may not be able to realize
and maintain these advantages.

Our product development efforts may not produce commercially
    viable products in a timely manner.

We must introduce new products and enhancements in a timely
manner, or our products could become technologically obsolete
over time, which would harm our operating results. To remain
competitive, we must continue to make significant investments in
research and development, sales and marketing, and customer
service and support. We cannot be sure that we will have
sufficient resources to continue to make these investments. In
developing new products, we may be required to make substantial
investments before we can determine their commercial viability.
As a result, we may not be successful in developing new products
and we may never realize the benefits of our research and
development activities.

A prolonged downturn or additional consolidation in the
    pharmaceutical, food, food retailing and chemicals industries
    could adversely affect our operating results.

Our products are used extensively in the pharmaceutical, food
and beverage and chemical industries. Consolidation in the
pharmaceutical and chemicals industries hurt our sales in prior
years. A prolonged downturn or additional consolidation in any
of these industries could adversely affect our operating
results. In addition, the capital spending policies of our
customers in these industries are based on a variety of factors
we cannot control, including the resources available for
purchasing equipment, the spending priorities among various
types of equipment and policies regarding capital expenditures
generally. Any decrease or delay in capital spending by our
customers would cause our revenues to decline and could harm our
profitability.

We may face risks associated with future acquisitions.

We plan to pursue acquisitions of complementary product lines,
technologies or businesses. Acquisitions involve numerous risks,
including:

•

difficulties in the assimilation of the acquired operations,
    technologies and products;

•

diversion of management’s attention from other business
    concerns; and

•

potential departures of key employees of the acquired company.

If we successfully identify acquisitions in the future,
completing such acquisitions may result in:

•

new issuances of our stock that may be dilutive to current
    owners;

•

increases in our debt and contingent liabilities; and



•

additional amortization expenses related to intangible assets.

Any of these acquisition-related risks could materially
adversely affect our profitability.

Larger companies have identified life sciences and instruments
as businesses they will consider entering, which could change
the competitive dynamics of these markets. In addition, we may
not be able to identify, successfully complete or integrate
potential acquisitions in the future. However, even if we can do
so, we cannot be sure that these acquisitions will have a
positive impact on our business or operating results.

If we cannot protect our intellectual property rights, or if
    we infringe or misappropriate the proprietary rights of others,
    our operating results could be harmed.

Our success depends on our ability to obtain and enforce patents
on our technology and to protect our trade secrets. Our patents
may not provide complete protection, and competitors may develop
similar products that are not covered by our patents. Our
patents may also be challenged by third parties and invalidated
or narrowed. Although we take measures to protect confidential
information, improper use or disclosure of our trade secrets may
still occur.

We may be sued for infringing on the intellectual property
rights of others. The cost of any litigation could affect our
profitability regardless of the outcome, and management
attention could be diverted. If we are unsuccessful in such
litigation, we may have to pay damages, stop the infringing
activity and/or obtain a license. If we fail to obtain a
required license, we may be unable to sell some of our products,
which could result in a decline in our revenues.

Departures of key employees could impair our operations.

We have employment contracts with each of our key employees. In
addition, our key employees own shares of our common stock
and/or have options to purchase additional shares. Nevertheless,
such individuals could leave the Company. If any key employees
stopped working for us, our operations could be harmed. We have
no key man life insurance policies with respect to any of our
senior executives.

We may be adversely affected by environmental laws and
    regulations.

We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations,
including those relating to:

We incur capital and operating expenditures in complying with
environmental laws and regulations both in the U.S. and abroad.
We are currently involved in, or have potential liability with
respect to, the remediation of past contamination in facilities
both in the U.S. and abroad. In addition, some of these
facilities have or had been in operation for many decades and
may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes
that are hazardous or may be considered hazardous in the future.
These sites and disposal sites owned by others to which we sent
waste may in the future be identified as contaminated and
require remediation. Accordingly, it is possible that we could
become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the
future that may harm our results of operations or financial
condition.

We may be adversely affected by failure to comply with
    regulations of governmental agencies.

Our products are subject to regulation by governmental agencies.
These regulations govern a wide variety of activities relating
to our products, from design and development, to labeling,
manufacturing, promotion, sales and distribution. If we fail to
comply with these regulations, we may have to recall products
and cease their manufacture and distribution. In addition, we
could be subject to fines or criminal prosecution.



We may experience impairments of goodwill or other intangible
    assets.

Starting in 2002, our goodwill amortization charges have ceased.
As of December 31, 2005, our consolidated balance sheet
included goodwill of $423.0 million and other intangible
assets of $105.2 million.

Our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other
intangible assets, which affect the amount of future period
amortization expense and possible impairment expense that we
will incur. The determination of the value of such intangible
assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect our consolidated financial statements.

In accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets” (“SFAS 142”), our
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not
amortized, but are evaluated for impairment annually in the
fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in
circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired. The
evaluation is based on valuation models that estimate fair value
based on expected future cash flows and profitability
projections. In preparing the valuation models we consider a
number of factors, including operating results, business plans,
economic conditions, future cash flows, and transactions and
market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to
these factors and our judgment in applying them to the
impairment analyses. The significant estimates and assumptions
within our fair value models include sales growth, controllable
cost growth, perpetual growth, effective tax rates and discount
rates. Our assessments to date have indicated that there has
been no impairment of these assets.

Our drug discovery reporting unit is sensitive to changes in
biopharma capital spending. We currently estimate the fair value
of the Company’s drug discovery reporting unit exceeds its
carrying value as of December 31, 2005. In accordance with
the provisions of SFAS 142, the Company monitors the fair
value of this reporting unit closely to determine if the
business plans are being achieved. For example, we monitor
whether the forecasted benefits of our drug discovery cost
reduction programs are being realized.

Should any of these estimates or assumptions in the preceding
paragraphs change, or should we incur lower than expected
operating performance or cash flows, we may experience a
triggering event that requires a new fair value assessment for
our reporting units, possibly prior to the required annual
assessment. These types of events and resulting analysis could
result in impairment charges for goodwill and other
indefinite-lived intangible assets if the fair value estimate
declines below the carrying value.

Our amortization expense related to intangible assets with
finite lives may materially change should our estimates of their
useful lives change.

Unanticipated changes in our tax rates or exposure to
    additional income tax liabilities could impact our
    profitability.

We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and
various other foreign jurisdictions, and our domestic and
international tax liabilities are subject to allocation of
expenses among different jurisdictions. Our effective tax rates
could be adversely affected by:

In particular, the carrying value of deferred tax assets, which
are predominantly in the U.S., is dependent upon our ability to
generate future taxable income in the U.S. In addition, the
amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in
various jurisdictions and a material assessment by a governing
tax authority could affect our profitability.



We have substantial debt and we may incur substantially more
    debt, which could affect our ability to meet our debt
    obligations and may otherwise restrict our activities.

We have substantial debt and we may incur substantial additional
debt in the future. As of December 31, 2005, we had total
indebtedness of approximately $125.6 million, net of cash
of $324.6 million. We are also permitted by the terms of
our debt instruments to incur substantial additional
indebtedness, subject to the restrictions therein.

Our debt could have important consequences to you. For example,
it could:

To service our debt, we will require a significant amount of
    cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors
    beyond our control.

Our ability to make payments on our debt and to fund planned
capital expenditures and research and development efforts will
depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to
an extent, is subject to general economic, financial,
competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors,
including those described in this section, that are beyond our
control.

We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient
cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be
available to us under our credit facility in an amount
sufficient to enable us to pay our debt, or to fund our other
liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or a portion of
our indebtedness on or before maturity. We cannot assure you
that we will be able to refinance any of our debt, including our
credit facility and the senior notes, on commercially reasonable
terms or at all.

The agreements governing our debt impose restrictions on our
    business.

The indenture governing our senior notes and the agreements
governing our credit facility contain a number of covenants
imposing significant restrictions on our business. These
restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and
may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business
opportunities as they arise. The restrictions these covenants
place on us and our restricted subsidiaries include limitations
on our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to:

•

enter into sale and leaseback arrangements;

•

incur liens; and

•

consolidate, merge, sell or lease all or substantially all of
    our assets.

Our credit facility also requires us to meet several financial
ratios.

Our ability to comply with these agreements may be affected by
events beyond our control, including prevailing economic,
financial and industry conditions, and are subject to the risks
in this section. The breach of any of these covenants or
restrictions could result in a default under the indenture
governing the senior notes or under our credit facility. An
event of default under our credit facility would permit our
lenders to declare all amounts borrowed from them to be
immediately due and payable. Acceleration of



our other indebtedness may cause us to be unable to make
interest payments on the senior notes and repay the principal
amount of the senior notes.

CEO and CFO Certifications

Our CEO submits an annual written affirmation to the New York
Stock Exchange (NYSE) certifying the Company’s
compliance with NYSE listing rules. The most recent annual
affirmation was submitted in 2005.

Our CEO and CFO also provide certifications pursuant to
Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 in connection
with our quarterly and annual financial statement filings with
the Securities and Exchange Commission. The certifications

Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion and analysis of our financial
condition and results of operations should be read together with
our audited consolidated financial statements.

Overview

We operate a global business, with sales that are diversified by
geographic region, product range and customer. We hold leading
positions worldwide in many of our markets and attribute this
leadership to several factors, including the strength of our
brand name and reputation, our comprehensive offering of
innovative instruments and solutions, and the breadth and
quality of our global sales and service network.

Net sales in U.S. dollars increased by 6% and 8% in 2005
and 2004, respectively. Excluding the effect of currency
exchange rate fluctuations, or in local currencies, net sales
increased 5% and 3% in 2005 and 2004, respectively. We faced an
improved world economy in 2005 compared to recent years with
market conditions generally strong in Asia and improved in the
United States and Europe.

In respect to our end user markets, we experienced improved
results during 2005 in our laboratory-related end user markets,
such as pharmaceutical and biotech customers as well as the
laboratories of chemical companies, food and beverage companies
and universities. We believe that the long-term fundamentals of
the pharmaceutical and biotech markets are particularly
attractive and our solutions assist these companies in enhancing
their productivity as they meet the challenges of new drug
approval activity, heightened price regulation and industry
consolidation.

In our industrial markets, the principal growth driver in recent
years has been increased investment in China related to
production capacity. Although this provides a significant
opportunity for our Chinese operations, this manufacturing shift
has a negative impact on certain of our industrial end user
markets in the U.S. and Europe. In addition to pharmaceutical,
chemical and transportation and logistics companies, food
producers and packagers also remain a large part of our
industrial customer base. In recent years, we have benefited
from the efforts of food producers and packagers to improve
product quality and safety. However, this sector continues to
experience high levels of competitive pressure which may
negatively impact customer spending levels.

In our food retail end markets, we experienced strong results in
both the U.S. and Europe relative to weak activity in recent
years. Traditionally the spending levels in this sector have
experienced more volatility than our other customer sectors.
Increased spending in the past has come from events such as Y2K
and the introduction of the euro currency. We have not
experienced similar triggering events in recent years. Similar
to our industrial business, China is also an important driver of
growth as the expansion of their local economy is creating a
significant number of new retail stores each year.



In 2006, we expect to continue to pursue the overall business
growth strategies which we have followed in recent years:

Gaining Market Share.

Our global sales and marketing
initiative, “Spinnaker”, continues to be an important
growth strategy. We aim to reach above market sales growth by
improving the productivity and effectiveness of our global sales
and marketing processes. While this initiative is broad based,
initial efforts to improve these processes include the
implementation of more effective pricing strategies and
processes, increased activities for leads generation and further
automation of field processes. Our comprehensive service
offering also helps us further penetrate developed markets. In
addition to traditional services, we offer installation,
calibration, regulatory compliance services and remote service
support.

Expanding Emerging Markets.

We have a two-pronged
strategy in Asia: first, to capitalize on growth opportunities
in these markets and second, to leverage our low-cost
manufacturing operations in China. We have a long track record
in China, and our sales in Asia have grown more than
10% per year in local currency since 1999. We have
broadened our product offering to the Asian markets and are
benefiting as multinational customers shift production to China.
We are shifting more of our manufacturing to China to reduce
costs, where our three facilities manufacture for the local
markets as well as for export.

Extending Our Technology Lead.

We continue to focus on
product innovation. In the last three years, we spent between
5.5% and 6.0% of net sales on research and development. We seek
to drive shorter product life cycles, as well as improve our
product offerings and their capabilities with additional
integrated technologies and software.

Maintaining Cost Leadership.

We continue to strive to
improve our margins by reducing our cost structure. During the
period following our buyout in 1996, we reduced the number of
our manufacturing facilities from 29 to 19. Shifting production
to China has been an important component of this consolidation.
We have also implemented global procurement and supply chain
management programs over the last several years aimed at
lowering supply costs.

Pursuing Strategic Acquisitions.

While we have not
completed a significant acquisition since 2001, acquisitions
remain part of our growth strategy. We seek to pursue
acquisitions that may leverage our global sales and service
network, respected brand, extensive distribution channels and
technological leadership. We have identified life sciences,
product inspection and process analytics as three key areas for
acquisitions.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

We supplement our U.S. GAAP results with certain non-GAAP
financial measures. The principal non-GAAP financial measure we
use is Adjusted Operating Income, which we define as gross
profit less research and development, selling, general and
administrative expenses and restructuring charges, before
amortization, interest, other charges and taxes. The most
directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure is earnings
before taxes.

We believe that Adjusted Operating Income is important
supplemental information for investors. Adjusted Operating
Income is used internally as the principal profit measurement by
our segments in their reporting to management. We use this
measure because it excludes amortization, interest, other
charges and taxes, which are not allocated to the segments.

On a consolidated basis, we also believe Adjusted Operating
Income is an important supplemental method of measuring
profitability. It is used internally by senior management for
setting performance targets for managers and has historically
been used as one of the means of publicly providing guidance on
possible future results. We also believe that Adjusted Operating
Income is an important performance measure because it provides a
measure of comparability to other companies with different
capital or legal structures, which accordingly may be subject to
disparate interest rates and effective tax rates, and to
companies which may incur different amortization expenses or
impairment charges related to intangible assets.



Adjusted Operating Income is used in addition to and in
conjunction with results presented in accordance with
U.S. GAAP. Adjusted Operating Income is not intended to
represent operating income under U.S. GAAP and should not
be considered as an alternative to earnings before taxes as an
indicator of our performance because of the following
limitations.

Limitations of our non-GAAP measure, Adjusted Operating
    Income

Our non-GAAP measure, Adjusted Operating Income, has certain
material limitations as follows:

•

It does not include interest expense. Because we have borrowed
    money to finance some of our operations, interest is a necessary
    and ongoing part of our costs and has assisted us in generating
    revenue. Therefore any measure that excludes interest expense
    has material limitations;

•

It excludes amortization expense and other charges. Because
    these items are recurring, any measure that excludes them has
    material limitations.

Adjusted Operating Income should not be relied upon to the
exclusion of U.S. GAAP financial measures, but reflects an
additional measure of comparability and means of viewing aspects
of our operations that, when viewed together with our
U.S. GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliation to
earnings before taxes, provides a more complete understanding of
factors and trends affecting our business.

Because Adjusted Operating Income is not standardized, it may
not be possible to compare with other companies’ non-GAAP
financial measures having the same or a similar name. We
strongly encourage investors to review our consolidated
financial statements and publicly filed reports in their
entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.

Our Adjusted Operating Income increased from $161.9 million
in 2003 to $206.7 million in 2005. This performance was
achieved while we continued to invest in product development and
in our distribution and manufacturing infrastructure. Adjusted
Operating Income includes restructuring charges of
$5.4 million in 2003. This charge is described more fully
below. A reconciliation of Adjusted Operating Income to net
earnings for 2003 to 2005 is included in “Results of
Operations” below.

Restructuring Activities

During the first quarter of 2003, we recorded a restructuring
charge of $5.4 million ($3.8 million after tax)
related to the final union settlement on the closure of our
French Manufacturing facility. This charge comprised the
additional employee-related costs resulting from final
settlement of the social plan negotiated with the French
workers’ council during the first quarter of 2003.

We assess our accrual for restructuring activities on an ongoing
basis. During the third quarter of 2003, we recorded a reduction
in the restructuring accrual of $1.0 million, included
within Other charges, net, as a result of lower employee-related
charges than originally anticipated. Also, a restructuring
charge of $1.4 million was recorded related to an extension
of manufacturing consolidation activities. This charge comprised
severance of $1.0 million, included within Other charges,
net, and inventory write-downs of $0.4 million, included
within Cost of sales.

At December 31, 2003, we had substantially completed the
restructuring programs described above.

Results of Operations — Consolidated

Net sales

Net sales were $1,482.5 million for the year ended
December 31, 2005, compared to $1,404.5 million in
2004 and $1,304.4 million in 2003. This represents
increases in 2005 and 2004 of 6% and 8% in U.S. dollars and
5% and 3% in local currencies, respectively. Excluding exited
product lines, net sales increased 6% and 4% in local currencies
for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively.

In 2005, our net sales by geographic destination increased in
local currencies by 7% in the Americas, 3% in Europe and 9% in
Asia/Rest of World. A discussion of sales by operating segment
is included below.



As described in Note 16 to our consolidated financial
statements, our net sales comprise product sales of precision
instruments and related services. Service revenues are primarily
derived from regulatory compliance qualification, calibration,
certification and repair services, much of which is provided
under contracts, as well as sales of spare parts.

Net sales of products increased in 2005 and 2004 by 6% and 7% in
U.S. dollars and by 6% and 2% in local currencies,
respectively. Service revenue (including spare parts) increased
in 2005 and 2004 by 5% and 11% in U.S. dollars and by 5%
and 6% in local currencies, respectively.

Net sales for our laboratory-related products increased 5% in
local currencies during 2005 with strong growth across most
product lines, particularly process analytics and analytical
instruments. Our sales growth of laboratory-related products was
also reduced by approximately 1% during 2005 due to the exit of
our third party electronic component sales. Excluding the effect
of currency exchange rate fluctuations, net sales for our
laboratory-related products increased 4% during 2004, due to
growth in each major product category, particularly process
analytics.

Net sales of our industrial-related products increased 5% in
2005 in local currencies. We experienced increased
transportation and logistics project activity, as well as sales
growth in our core industrial products. Excluding the effect of
currency exchange rate fluctuations, net sales of
industrial-related products increased 1% during 2004.

In our food retailing markets, net sales increased 8% in 2005 in
local currencies over the previous year due to increased sales
across all geographic regions, particularly in the U.S., related
to strong project activity. The food retailing markets also
continue to experience improved sales growth of our in-store
retail item management software solutions and expansion of our
core retail products into Asia. Net sales in food retailing
increased 8% in 2004 excluding the effect of currency exchange
rate fluctuations. This increase was due to improvement of
customer spending patterns in the U.S. and Europe relative to
weak activity during the prior year.

Gross profit

Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 49.3% for 2005,
compared to 48.6% for 2004 and 47.4% for 2003.

Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for products was 53.2%
for 2005, compared to 52.3% for 2004 and 50.9% for 2003. Gross
profit as a percentage of net sales for services (including
spare parts) was 36.0% for 2005, compared to 36.1% for 2004 and
35.1% for 2003.

The increase in gross profit percentage reflects benefits from
our sales volume leveraging our fixed production costs, our cost
rationalization initiatives and the impact of increased pricing.
These trends were offset in part by unfavorable product mix.

Research and development and selling, general and
    administrative expenses

Research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales
were 5.5% for 2005, compared to 5.9% for 2004 and 6.0% in 2003.
Research and development expenses decreased by 2% in 2005 and
increased by 1% in 2004 in local currencies. The decrease in
2005 reflects improved productivity, timing of projects and our
desire to reallocate research and development resources to
marketing.

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of
net sales decreased to 29.8% for 2005, compared to 29.9% for
2004 and 28.6% for 2003. Selling, general and administrative
expenses increased 5% in 2005 and 8% in 2004 in local
currencies. This increase is due in part to sales and marketing
investments in China, promotional activities and higher
performance related compensation during 2005 compared to 2004.
During 2004, we also incurred $5.0 million related to an
investigation into allegations made by an employee with respect
to the Company and various Company processes. Our spending
during 2004 also includes a significant increase in
Sarbanes-Oxley regulatory compliance costs, including
approximately $3.5 million of external professional fees
during 2004. The increases in 2004 also included spending related



to product introductions, as well as higher performance related
compensation during 2004 compared to 2003.

Other charges, net

Other charges, net were $20.2 million in 2005, compared to
$0.1 million in 2004 and $4.6 million in 2003. Other
charges, net consisted primarily of charges related to interest
income, (gains) losses from foreign currency transactions,
(gains) losses from sales of assets and other items. During
2005, other charges, net also included a $21.8 million
charge related to pipette litigation. We wrote off a
$19.9 million intangible asset relating to an intellectual
property license that was subject to litigation with the grantor
in June 2005. This license enabled one of our wholly owned
subsidiaries exclusive rights to distribute certain third-party
manufactured pipettes in the United States. A judgment entered
on June 6, 2005 terminated the license agreement and
awarded damages to the other party. We also incurred
$1.9 million of related legal costs during 2005, which
included damages of $0.6 million. During the third quarter,
we appealed the trial court decision. Litigation concerning the
license and related issues is ongoing between us and the other
party to the license. We do not believe that the litigation will
have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial
condition, results of operations or cash flows. In 2004, we had
$13.9 million in sales of these third-party manufactured
pipettes in the U.S. which had declined 28% since 2001. We
expect to minimize any impact to our sales and profitability by
increasing the sales of our own higher margin pipettes,
including those we already manufacture and sell outside the
United States.

The 2003 amount included restructuring charges of
$5.4 million ($3.8 million after tax) comprising
severance, asset write-downs and other exit costs primarily
related to headcount reductions and manufacturing transfers,
described more fully in “Restructuring Activities”
above.

Interest expense and taxes

Interest expense was $14.9 million for 2005, compared to
$12.9 million for 2004 and $14.2 million for 2003. The
increase in 2005 was principally due to higher average
borrowings. The decrease in 2004 was primarily due to lower
average borrowings compared to 2003 which was partially offset
by an increase in the weighted average interest rate.

Pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, we
repatriated $396 million of cash during 2005 that was
generated over time by our foreign operations. As a result of
this repatriation, the Company recorded additional income tax
expense of $13.1 million. This amount reflects the federal
tax impact in the United States (including certain state taxes)
of $12.3 million, foreign withholding taxes of
$2.0 million and a net decrease of $1.2 million of
deferred tax liabilities associated with the reassessment of
pre-existing and future dividend repatriations. In addition, the
Company recorded tax benefits of $7.7 million related to
the favorable resolution of certain tax matters. Our tax rate
for 2005 also included a tax benefit associated with the
previously described pipette litigation. Excluding the tax
effects of the previously described earnings repatriation, tax
audit settlements and pipette litigation, our annual effective
tax rate would have been 30% for 2005. Including these items,
our annual effective tax rate was 32% and 30% for 2005 and 2004,
respectively.

Earnings before taxes and net earnings

Earnings before taxes were $160.2 million for 2005,
compared to $154.2 million in 2004 and $136.9 million
in 2003. Net earnings were $108.9 million for 2005,
compared to $108.0 million in 2004 and $95.8 million
in 2003.

The 2005 results included a net $5.4 million after tax
expense related to the two previously described tax items and a
one-time $13.1 million after tax charge related to the
pipette litigation described above. The 2004 results included
$5.0 million ($3.5 million after tax) related to the
previously mentioned investigation and $3.5 million
($2.5 million after tax) of external professional fees
related to Sarbanes-Oxley regulatory compliance costs. The 2003
results included the $5.4 million ($3.8 million after
tax) restructuring charge as



previously described. The increase in net earnings excluding
these items reflected improved sales volume in 2005 and the
benefits from our cost rationalization initiatives.

Supplemental data: Adjusted Operating Income

See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” above. Adjusted
Operating Income (gross profit less research and development,
selling, general and administrative expenses and restructuring
charges, before amortization, interest expense and other
charges) increased to $206.7 million or 13.9% of net sales
in 2005, compared to $179.4 million or 12.8% of net sales
for 2004 and $161.9 million or 12.4% of net sales in 2003.
Adjusted Operating Income included restructuring charges of
$5.4 million in 2003.

Adjusted Operating Income increased in 2005 and 2004 as a result
of our increased sales volume and benefits of our cost
rationalization initiatives. This performance was achieved while
we continued to invest in sales and marketing and our field
service infrastructure.

Results of Operations — by Operating Segment

The following is a discussion of the financial results of our
operating segments. We currently have five reportable segments:
U.S. Operations, Swiss Operations, Western European
Operations, Chinese Operations and Other. A more detailed
description of these segments is outlined in Note 16 to our
consolidated financial statements.

The increase in 2005 in total net sales reflected improved sales
to external customers across most product lines, including
particularly strong results in our food retailing and
transportation and logistics products due to significant project
activity as well as solid growth in laboratory balances, process
analytics and analytical instruments. In 2004, our
U.S. Operations segment benefited from improved market
conditions, as well as new product introductions. The 2004
increase in net sales to external customers reflected growth in
most products, particularly our food retailing end markets
primarily due to improved results relative to weak project
activity in 2003.

Segment profit or Adjusted Operating Income increased
$3.8 million in our U.S. Operations segment during
2005, compared to an increase of $3.0 million during 2004.
The increase in segment profit or Adjusted Operating Income of
our U.S. Operations segment during 2005 is due to an
increase in sales volume, partially offset by an unfavorable
product mix. The increase in segment profit or Adjusted
Operating Income of our U.S. Operations segment during 2004
reflects an increase in sales volume and benefits from our cost
rationalization initiatives.

Total net sales in local currency increased 4% in 2005 and 3% in
2004. Net sales to external customers in local currency
decreased 4% in 2005 and 3% in 2004. The exit of our third party
electronic component product line reduced total net sales by
approximately 1% in 2005 and 4% in 2004. The decrease in sales
to external customers during 2005 and 2004 related primarily to
the exit of our third party electronic component product line
combined with reduced food retailing project activity and
reduced direct export sales to emerging markets, partially
offset by a strong increase in our industrial-related products.
The decrease in 2004 was partially offset by an increase in our
food retailing products.

Segment profit or Adjusted Operating Income increased
$5.9 million in our Swiss Operations segment during 2005,
compared to an increase of $7.5 million during 2004. The
increase in segment profit or Adjusted Operating Income
primarily related to increased sales to other segments of
laboratory-related products as well as benefits from our cost
rationalization initiatives. The 2004 increase was impacted by
increased sales to other segments.

Total net sales in local currency increased 6% in 2005 and 0% in
2004. Net sales to external customers in local currency
increased 3% in 2005 and 0% in 2004. The 2005 increase was
primarily due to improved market conditions in the major
European economies, particularly Germany. We experienced sales
growth in 2005 across most product lines, particularly
laboratory-related products. Our 2004 local currency net sales
to external customers in our Western European segment primarily
reflected growth in our laboratory-related products and our food
retailing end markets. These trends were offset by a decline in
our industrial-related products, which included a decrease in
transportation and logistics products relative to strong 2003
project activity.

Segment profit or Adjusted Operating Income increased
$5.3 million in our Western European Operations segment
during 2005, compared to an increase of $9.9 million in
2004. The increase in segment profit or Adjusted Operating
Income in 2005 is principally a result of increased net sales
and benefits from our cost rationalization initiatives. The 2004
increase is primarily the result of reduced restructuring
charges, as well as benefits from our cost rationalization and
product transfer initiatives, improved sales volume and
favorable currency translation fluctuations.

compared to an increase of $8.7 million in 2004. The
increase in 2005 segment profit or Adjusted Operating Income is
primarily due to the continued improvement in sales volume and



leveraging our fixed production costs. The increase in 2004 is
principally the result of increased sales volume to external
customers and other segments and the benefits of product
transfer initiatives from our other segments.

increased 11% in 2005 and 2% in 2004. This performance reflected
increased sales in our Other Asian Pacific, Eastern European and

Segment profit or Adjusted Operating Income increased
$1.9 million in our Other Operations segment during 2005,
compared to an increase of $2.2 million during 2004.
Segment profit or Adjusted Operating Income increased during
2005 primarily due to the continued improvement in sales volume.
The increase in 2004 was primarily due to the increased sales
volume to external customers and other segments.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Liquidity is our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from
operating activities to meet our obligations and commitments. In
addition, liquidity includes the ability to obtain appropriate
financing. Currently, our liquidity needs arise primarily from
working capital requirements, capital expenditures and
acquisitions. In 2005, we have also increased our debt balance
in Europe and our cash balance in the United States as a result
of our foreign earnings repatriation associated with the
American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.

Cash provided by operating activities totaled
$177.1 million in 2005, compared to $166.0 million in
2004 and $117.2 million in 2003. The increase in 2005
resulted principally from improved operating results offset in
part by approximately $15 million of higher payments
relating to 2004 performance related compensation incentives
(bonus payments). Cash provided by operating activities in 2004
was impacted by voluntary incremental pension contributions of
$10.0 million to our U.S. pension plan. Cash provided
by operating activities in 2003 reflected voluntary incremental
pension contributions of $10.0 million to the
U.S. pension plan and $7.1 million to our U.K. pension
plan. Similar to previous years, we expect to make normal
employer pension contributions of approximately $13 million
in 2006. Cash provided by operating activities also includes
payments for restructuring and related activities in 2005, 2004
and 2003 of $2.0 million, $4.0 million and
$16.8 million, respectively.

The Company spent approximately $4.1 million on
acquisitions during 2005. We continue to explore other potential
acquisitions. In connection with any acquisition, we may incur
additional indebtedness. In addition, the terms of certain of
our acquisitions provide for possible additional earn-out
payments. However, we do not currently believe we will make any
material payments relating to such earn-outs.

Capital expenditures are made primarily for machinery, equipment
and the purchase and expansion of facilities. Our capital
expenditures totaled $32.5 million in 2005,
$27.9 million in 2004 and $27.2 million in 2003. We
expect capital expenditures to increase as our business grows
and to fluctuate as currency exchange rates change. In 2006, we
will be launching a building project for a new plant in China
which will cost in the range of $10 million to
$15 million over the next two years.

November 2005 Refinancing

On November 7, 2005, we entered into a revised credit
agreement (the “Amended Credit Agreement”), which
amends and restates the existing Credit Agreement, dated as of
November 12, 2003. The Amended



Credit Agreement increases the amount that can be borrowed under
the facility from $300 million to $450 million,
extends the maturity date to November 2010 and lowers the margin
applicable to the interest rate payable thereunder. The
remaining terms of the Amended Credit Agreement are
substantially the same as under the existing Credit Agreement.
The Company incurred fees of approximately $0.9 million in
conjunction with amending and restating the Credit Agreement
which are amortized to interest expense over five years.

Amended Credit Agreement

The $450 million Amended Credit Agreement is provided by a
group of financial institutions and has a maturity date of
November 5, 2010. It is not subject to any scheduled
principal payments. Borrowings under the Amended Credit
Agreement bear interest at current market rates plus a margin
based on our senior unsecured credit ratings (currently
“BBB” by Standard & Poor’s and
“Baa3” by Moody’s) and is currently set at LIBOR
plus 0.375%. We must also pay facility fees that are tied to our
credit ratings. The Amended Credit Agreement contains covenants,
including maintaining a ratio of debt to earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of less than 3.25
to 1.0 and an interest coverage ratio of more than 3.5 to 1.0.
This also places certain limitations on us, including limiting
the ability to grant liens or incur debt at a subsidiary level.
In addition, the Amended Credit Agreement has several events of
default, including upon a change of control. As of
December 31, 2005, approximately $146.2 million was
available under the facility. The Amended Credit Agreement is
unsecured.

Senior Notes

In November 2003, we issued $150 million of 4.85% unsecured
Senior Notes due November 15, 2010. The Senior Notes rank
equally with all our unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.
Interest is payable semi-annually in May and November. Discount
and issuance costs approximated $1.2 million and are being
amortized to interest expense over the seven-year term of the
Senior Notes.

At our option, the Senior Notes may be redeemed in whole or in
part at any time at a redemption price equal to the greater of:

•

The principal amount of the Senior Notes; or

•

The sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled
    payments of principal and interest thereon discounted to the
    redemption date on a semi-annual basis at a comparable treasury
    rate plus a margin of 0.20%.

The Senior Notes contain limitations on our ability to incur
liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions exceeding
10% of our consolidated net worth.

Our short-term borrowings and long-term debt consisted of the
following at December 31, 2005.

Changes in exchange rates between the currencies in which we
generate cash flow and the currencies in which our borrowings
are denominated affect our liquidity. In addition, because we
borrow in a variety of currencies, our debt balances fluctuate
due to changes in exchange rates.

At December 31, 2005, we were in compliance with all
covenants set forth in our Amended Credit Agreement and Senior
Notes. In addition, we do not have any downgrade triggers
relating to ratings from rating agencies that would accelerate
the maturity dates of our debt.

We currently believe that cash flow from operating activities,
together with liquidity available under our Amended Credit
Agreement and local working capital facilities, will be
sufficient to fund currently anticipated working capital needs
and capital spending requirements for at least the next several
years.

Contractual Obligations

The following summarizes certain of our contractual obligations
at December 31, 2005 and the effect such obligations are
expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future
periods. We do not have significant outstanding letters of
credit or other financial commitments.

We have purchase commitments for materials, supplies, services
and fixed assets in the normal course of business. Due to the
proprietary nature of many of our materials and processes,
certain supply contracts contain penalty provisions. We do not
expect potential payments under these provisions to materially
affect results of operations or financial condition. This
conclusion is based upon reasonably likely outcomes derived by
reference to historical experience and current business plans.

Share Repurchase Program

We have a share repurchase program that was announced in
February 2004 and updated in November 2004 and November 2005.
Under the program, we have been authorized to buy back up to
$100 million of equity shares over the two-year period
ending December 31, 2005, an additional $200 million
over the two-year period ending December 31, 2006 and an
additional $200 million over the two-year period ending
December 31, 2007. Our share repurchases are expected to be
funded from cash generated from operating activities.
Repurchases will be made through open market transactions, and
the timing will depend on the level of acquisition activity,
business and market conditions, the stock price, trading
restrictions and other factors.

During the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, we spent
$164.6 million and $103.8 million on the repurchase of
3,229,200 shares and 2,208,500 shares at an average
price of $50.94 and $46.97, respectively. An additional
$4.2 million and $1.4 million relating to the
settlement of shares repurchased as of December 31, 2005
and 2004 were cash settled during 2006 and 2005, respectively.
The Company reissued 1,261,332 shares and
794,428 shares held in treasury for the exercise of stock
options during 2005 and 2004, respectively. As of
December 31, 2005, there were $231.6 million of
remaining equity shares authorized to be repurchased under our
plan.



Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Currently, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have
or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on
our financial condition, changes in financial condition,
revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital
expenditures or capital resources that is material.

Effect of Currency on Results of Operations

Because we conduct operations in many countries, our operating
income can be significantly affected by fluctuations in currency
exchange rates. Swiss franc-denominated expenses represent a
much greater percentage of our operating expenses than Swiss
franc-denominated sales represent of our net sales. In part,
this is because most of our manufacturing costs in Switzerland
relate to products that are sold outside Switzerland. Moreover,
a substantial percentage of our research and development
expenses and general and administrative expenses are incurred in
Switzerland. Therefore, if the Swiss franc strengthens against
all or most of our major trading currencies (e.g

.

, the
U.S. dollar, the euro, other major European currencies and
the Japanese yen), our operating profit is reduced. We also have
significantly more sales in European currencies (other than the
Swiss franc) than we have expenses in those currencies.
Therefore, when European currencies weaken against the
U.S. dollar and the Swiss franc, it also decreases our
operating profits. Accordingly, the Swiss franc exchange rate to
the euro is an important cross-rate monitored by the Company. We
estimate that a 1% strengthening of the Swiss franc against the
euro would result in a decrease in our earnings before tax of
$0.9 million to $1.1 million on an annual basis. In
addition to the effects of exchange rate movements on operating
profits, our debt levels can fluctuate due to changes in
exchange rates, particularly between the U.S. dollar and
the Swiss franc. Based on our outstanding debt at
December 31, 2005, we estimate that a 10% weakening of the
U.S. dollar against the currencies in which our debt is
denominated would result in an increase of approximately
$33.4 million in the reported U.S. dollar value of the
debt.

Taxes

We are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions throughout the
world. Our effective tax rate and tax liability will be affected
by a number of factors, such as the amount of taxable income in
particular jurisdictions, the tax rates in such jurisdictions,
tax treaties between jurisdictions, the extent to which we
transfer funds between jurisdictions, earnings repatriations
between jurisdictions and changes in law. Generally, the tax
liability for each taxpayer within the group is determined
either (i) on a non-consolidated/non-combined basis or
(ii) on a consolidated/combined basis only with other
eligible entities subject to tax in the same jurisdiction, in
either case without regard to the taxable losses of
non-consolidated/non-combined affiliated legal entities. As a
result, we may pay income taxes to certain jurisdictions even
though on an overall basis we incur a net loss for the period.

We currently benefit from tax holidays in certain jurisdictions.
These holidays expire at various dates in the future and may or
may not be renewable. We do not believe that potential changes
in tax benefits from existing tax holidays will have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition or results of
operations.

Environmental Matters

We are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the
jurisdictions in which we operate. We own or lease a number of
properties and manufacturing facilities around the world. Like
many of our competitors, we have incurred, and will continue to
incur, capital and operating expenditures and other costs in
complying with such laws and regulations in both the United
States and abroad.

We are currently involved in, or have potential liability with
respect to, the remediation of past contamination in certain of
our facilities in both the United States and abroad. Our
subsidiary Mettler-Toledo Hi-Speed, Inc. (“Hi-Speed”)
is one of two private parties ordered to perform certain ground
water contamination monitoring under an administrative consent
order that the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection (“NJDEP”) signed on June 13, 1988
with respect to certain property in Landing, New Jersey. GEI
International Corporation (“GEI”) is the other ordered
party. GEI has failed to fulfill its



obligations under the NJDEP order, and NJDEP has agreed with
Hi-Speed that the residual ground water contaminants can be
monitored through the establishment of a Classification
Exception Area and concurrent Well Restriction Area for the
site. The NJDEP does not view these vehicles as remedial
measures, but rather as “institutional controls” that
must be adequately maintained and periodically evaluated. We
estimate that the costs of compliance associated with monitoring
ground water contamination levels at the site will be
approximately $0.8 million over the next seven years.

In addition, certain of our present and former facilities have
or had been in operation for many decades and, over such time,
some of these facilities may have used substances or generated
and disposed of wastes which are or may be considered hazardous.
It is possible that these sites, as well as disposal sites owned
by third parties to which we have sent wastes, may in the future
be identified and become the subject of remediation.
Accordingly, although we believe that we are in substantial
compliance with applicable environmental requirements and to
date we have not incurred material expenditures in connection
with environmental matters, it is possible that we could become
subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future
that could result in a material adverse effect on our financial
condition or results of operations.

Inflation

Inflation can affect the costs of goods and services that we
use, including raw materials to manufacture our products. The
competitive environment in which we operate limits somewhat our
ability to recover higher costs through increased selling
prices. Moreover, there may be differences in inflation rates
between countries in which we incur the major portion of our
costs and other countries in which we sell products, which may
limit our ability to recover increased costs. We remain
committed to operations in China and Eastern Europe, which have
experienced inflationary conditions. To date, inflationary
conditions have not had a material effect on our operating
results. However, as our presence in China and Eastern Europe
increases, these inflationary conditions could have a greater
impact on our operating results.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

We have only limited involvement with derivative financial
instruments and do not use them for trading purposes.

We have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to
economically hedge short-term intercompany balances with our
international businesses on a monthly basis. Such contracts
limit our exposure to both favorable and unfavorable currency
fluctuations. A sensitivity analysis to changes on these foreign
currency-denominated contracts indicates that if the primary
currency (U.S. dollar, Swiss franc and British pound)
declined by 10%, the fair value of these instruments would
decrease by $4.1 million at December 31, 2005, as
compared with a decrease of $5.6 million at
December 31, 2004. Any resulting changes in fair value
would be offset by changes in the underlying hedged balance
sheet position. The sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel
shift in foreign currency exchange rates. The assumption that
exchange rates change in parallel fashion may overstate the
impact of changing exchange rates on assets and liabilities
denominated in a foreign currency. We also have other currency
risks as described under “Effect of Currency on Results of
Operations”.

We have entered into certain interest rate swap agreements.
These contracts are more fully described in Note 5 to our
audited consolidated financial statements. The fair value of
these contracts was a $0.4 million loss and a
$0.4 million gain at December 31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. Based on our agreements outstanding at
December 31, 2005, a 100-basis-point increase in interest
rates would result in a decrease in the net aggregate market
value of these instruments of $1.3 million, as compared
with a decrease of $1.6 million at December 31, 2004.
Conversely, a 100-basis-point decrease in interest rates would
result in a $1.4 million increase in the net aggregate
market value of these instruments at December 31, 2005, as
compared with a net increase of $1.7 million at
December 31, 2004. Any change in fair value would not
affect our consolidated statement of operations unless such
agreements and the debt they hedge were prematurely settled.



Critical Accounting Policies

Management’s discussion and analysis of our financial
condition and results of operations is based upon our audited
consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in
accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these
consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates
and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we
evaluate our estimates, including those related to pensions and
other post-retirement benefits, inventories, intangible assets,
income taxes, revenue and warranty costs. We base our estimates
on historical experience and on various other assumptions that
are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the
results of which form the basis for making judgments about the
carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily
apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from
these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our
more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation
of our audited consolidated financial statements. For a detailed
discussion on the application of these and other accounting
policies, see Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial
statements.

Employee benefit plans

The net periodic pension cost for 2005 and projected benefit
obligation as of December 31, 2005 were $1.5 million
and $115.9 million, respectively, for our U.S. pension
plans, and $6.6 million and $479.3 million,
respectively, for our international pension plans. The net
periodic post-retirement cost for 2005 and projected benefit
obligation as of December 31, 2005 for our
U.S. post-retirement medical benefit plan were
$0.7 million and $25.2 million, respectively.

Pension and post-retirement benefit plan expense and obligations
are developed from assumptions in actuarial valuations. These
assumptions include the discount rate and expected return on
plan assets. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, actual results
that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized
over future periods. While management believes the assumptions
used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or
changes in assumptions may affect our plan obligations and
future expense.

The expected rates of return on the various defined benefit
pension plans’ assets are based on the asset allocation of
each plan and the long-term projected return of those assets,
which represent a diversified mix of U.S. and international
corporate equities and government and corporate debt securities.
In April 2002, we froze our U.S. defined benefit pension
plan and discontinued our retiree medical program for certain
current and all future employees. Consequently, no significant
future service costs will be incurred on these plans. For 2005,
the average return on assets assumption was 8.5% for the
U.S. plan and 5.2% for the international plans. A change in
the rate of return of 1% would impact annual benefit plan
expense by approximately $3.9 million after tax.

The discount rates for defined benefit and post-retirement plans
are set by benchmarking against high-quality corporate bonds.
For 2005, the average discount rate assumption was 5.5% for the
U.S. plans and 3.3% for the international plans,
representing a weighted average of local rates in countries
where such plans exist. A decrease in the discount rate of 1%
would impact annual benefit plan expense by approximately
$2.1 million after tax.

In 2004, we made voluntary incremental funding payments of
$10.0 million to reduce the under funded status of our U.S.
and U.K. pension plans. A similar payment was not made during
2005. In the future, we may make additional mandatory or
discretionary contributions to our plan or we could be required
to make additional cash funding payments or adjust the
$50.4 million additional minimum pension liability recorded
at December 31, 2005.

We also have employee stock option plans which are accounted for
under the intrinsic value recognition and measurement provisions
of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” and related
interpretations. As stock options have been issued with exercise
prices equal to the market value of the underlying shares on the
grant date, no compensation cost has resulted.



Notes 2 and 11 to the audited consolidated financial
statements provide supplemental information, including pro forma
earnings and earnings per share, as if we had accounted for
options based on the fair value method prescribed by
SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation.” That methodology yields an estimate of fair
value based in part on a number of management estimates,
including future volatility and estimated option lives. Changes
in these assumptions could significantly impact the estimated
fair value of stock options. See also Statement No. 123
(revised 2004) issued by the FASB in regards to
“Stock-Based Compensation” in Note 2, Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies, New Accounting Pronouncement.

Inventory

As of December 31, 2005, inventories were
$150.2 million.

We record our inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable
value. Cost, which includes direct materials, labor and
overhead, is generally determined using the first in, first out
(FIFO) method. The estimated net realizable value is based
on assumptions for future demand and related pricing.
Adjustments to the cost basis of our inventory are made for
excess and obsolete items based on forecast usage, orders and
technological obsolescence. If actual market conditions are less
favorable than those projected by management, reductions in the
value of inventory may be required.

Goodwill and other intangible assets

As of December 31, 2005, our consolidated balance sheet
included goodwill of $423.0 million and other intangible
assets of $105.2 million.

Our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other
intangible assets, which affect the amount of future period
amortization expense and possible impairment expense that we
will incur. The determination of the value of such intangible
assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect our consolidated financial statements.

In accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets” (“SFAS 142”), our
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not
amortized, but are evaluated for impairment annually in the
fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in
circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired. The
evaluation is based on valuation models that estimate fair value
based on expected future cash flows and profitability
projections. In preparing the valuation models, we consider a
number of factors, including operating results, business plans,
economic conditions, future cash flows, and transactions and
market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to
these factors and our judgment in applying them to the
impairment analyses. The significant estimates and assumptions
within our fair value models include sales growth, controllable
cost growth, perpetual growth, effective tax rates and discount
rates. Our assessments to date have indicated that there has
been no impairment of these assets.

Our drug discovery reporting unit is sensitive to changes in
biotech and pharmaceutical capital spending. We currently
estimate the fair value of the Company’s drug discovery
reporting unit exceeds its carrying value as of
December 31, 2005. In accordance with the provisions of
SFAS 142, the Company monitors the fair value of this
reporting unit closely to determine if the business plans are
being achieved. For example, we monitor whether the forecasted
benefits of our drug discovery cost reduction programs are being
realized.

As of December 31, 2004, our intangible assets included a
$19.9 million indefinite life intangible asset relating to
an intellectual property license. This license was previously
subject to litigation with the grantor, and on June 6,
2005, we were ordered to pay $0.6 million in damages and
the respective intellectual property license was terminated. Due
to the cancellation of the license, we concluded that the
intangible asset had no future benefit and as such, during the
second quarter, we wrote off the total value of the asset,
$19.9 million ($12 million after tax). This charge has
been included as a component of Other charges, net within the
Statement of Operations.



Should any of these estimates or assumptions in the preceding
paragraphs change, or should we incur lower than expected
operating performance or cash flows, we may experience a
triggering event that requires a new fair value assessment for
our reporting units, possibly prior to the required annual
assessment. These types of events and resulting analysis could
result in impairment charges for goodwill and other
indefinite-lived intangible assets if the fair value estimate
declines below the carrying value.

Our amortization expense related to intangible assets with
finite lives may materially change should our estimates of their
useful lives change.

Income taxes

Income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities
reflect management’s assessment of actual future taxes to
be paid on items in the consolidated financial statements. We
record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets
to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. While
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and
feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the
valuation allowance, in the event we were to determine that we
would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future
in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to the
deferred tax asset would increase income, equity or goodwill in
the period such determination was made. Likewise, should we
determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of
the net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the
deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such
determination was made.

In 2005 and 2004, provisions were made for U.S. income
taxes on certain undistributed earnings of

non-U.S.

subsidiaries
as a decision was made to repatriate these earnings rather than
permanently reinvest them. If we decide to repatriate an amount
of undistributed earnings in excess of those originally planned,
we could be subject to additional income tax.

The significant assumptions and estimates described in the
preceding paragraphs are important contributors to our ultimate
effective tax rate for each year in addition to our income mix
from geographical regions. If any of our assumptions or
estimates were to change, or should our income mix from our
geographical regions change, our effective tax rate can be
materially affected. Based on earnings before taxes of
$160.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2005,
each increase of $1.6 million in tax expense would increase
our effective tax rate by 1%.

Revenue recognition

Revenue is recognized when title to a product has transferred
and any significant customer obligations have been fulfilled.
Standard shipping terms are generally FOB shipping point in most
countries and, accordingly, title transfers upon shipment. In
countries where title cannot legally transfer before delivery,
we defer revenue recognition until delivery has occurred. Other
than a few small software applications, we do not sell software
products without the related hardware instrument as the software
is embedded in the instrument. Our typical solution requires no
significant production, modification or customization of the
hardware or software that is essential to the functionality of
the products. To the extent our solutions have a post shipment
obligation, such as customer acceptance, revenue is deferred
until the obligation has been completed. In addition, we also
defer revenue where installation is required, unless such
installation is perfunctory. We also generally maintain the
right to accept or reject a product return in our terms and
conditions and we also maintain accruals for outstanding
credits. Distributor discounts are offset against revenue at the
time such revenue is recognized. Revenues from service contracts
are recognized ratably over the contract period.

Warranty

We generally offer one-year warranties on most of our products.
Product warranties are recorded at the time revenue is
recognized for certain product shipments. While we engage in
extensive product quality programs and processes, our warranty
obligation is affected by product failure rates, material usage



and service costs incurred in correcting a product failure. If
we experience claims or significant cost changes in material,
freight and vendor charges, our cost of goods sold could be
affected.

Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls
    and Procedures and Changes in Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting

Our management carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of
our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the
period covered by this annual report under the supervision and
with the participation of our disclosure committee, our CFO and
CEO. Based upon that evaluation, our CFO and CEO concluded that
our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in
permitting us to comply with our disclosure obligations and
ensure that the material information required to be disclosed is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. There were
no changes in our internal control over financial reporting
during the quarter ended December 31, 2005 that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our controls over financial reporting.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of the Company’s
financial statements for external reporting purposes in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2005. In making this assessment, we used the
criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal
Control — Integrated Framework. Based on our
assessment, we concluded that, as of December 31, 2005, the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting is
effective.

Our management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2005 has been audited by
PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears on page
F-2.

INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

F-1


REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and

Shareholders of Mettler-Toledo International Inc.

We have completed an integrated audit of Mettler-Toledo
International Inc.’s 2005 consolidated financial statements
and of its internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2005 in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our
opinions, based on our audit, are presented below.

Consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Mettler-Toledo
International Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31,
2005, and the results of their operations and their cash flows
for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition,
in our opinion, the financial statement schedules listed in the
index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein when read
in conjunction with the related consolidated financial
statements. These financial statements and financial statement
schedules are the responsibility of the Company’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial statement schedules based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audit provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

Internal control over financial reporting

Also, in our opinion, management’s assessment, included in
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting appearing under Item 9A, that the Company
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2005 based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all material respects,
based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the
Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005,
based on criteria established in

Internal Control —
Integrated Framework

issued by COSO. The Company’s
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
responsibility is to express opinions on management’s
assessment and on the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We
conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An
audit of internal control over financial reporting includes
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control, and performing such other procedures as we consider
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance

F-2


of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

BUSINESS DESCRIPTION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

Mettler-Toledo International Inc. (“Mettler-Toledo” or
the “Company”) is a leading global supplier of
precision instruments and services. The Company manufactures
weighing instruments for use in laboratory, industrial,
packaging, logistics and food retailing applications. The
Company also manufactures several related analytical
instruments, and provides automated chemistry solutions used in
drug and chemical compound discovery and development. In
addition, the Company manufactures metal detection and other

end-of

-line inspection
systems used in production and packaging, and provides solutions
for use in certain process analytics applications. The
Company’s primary manufacturing facilities are located in
China, Germany, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United
States. The Company’s principal executive offices are
located in Greifensee, Switzerland.

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and
include all entities in which the Company has control, which are
its majority owned subsidiaries.

All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.
Investments in which the Company has voting rights between 20%
and 50% are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, as well as disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
periods. Actual results may differ from those estimates

.

Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts
to conform to the current year presentation.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with
original maturity dates of three months or less.

Trade Accounts Receivable

Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount
and do not bear interest. The allowance for doubtful accounts
represents the Company’s best estimate of probable credit
losses in its existing trade accounts receivable. Historically
the Company has had very minimal bad debts due to its customer
base.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable
value. Cost, which includes direct materials, labor and
overhead, is generally determined using the first in, first out
(FIFO) method. The estimated net realizable value is based
on assumptions for future demand and related pricing.
Adjustments to the cost basis of our inventory are made for
excess and obsolete items based on forecast usage, orders and
technological obsolescence. If actual market conditions are less
favorable than those projected by management, reductions in the
value of inventory may be required.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

(In thousands, except share data, unless otherwise stated)

Long-Lived Assets

a) Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less
accumulated depreciation. Repair and maintenance costs are
charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation is charged on a
straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the
assets as follows:

Buildings and improvements

15 to 50 years

Machinery and equipment

3 to 12 years

Computer software

3 to 5 years

Leasehold improvements

Shorter of useful life or lease term

b) Capitalized Software

In accordance with Statement of Position 98-1, “Accounting
for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for
Internal Use” (“SOP 98-1”), the Company
expenses all internal-use software costs incurred in the
preliminary project stage and capitalizes certain direct costs
associated with the development and purchase of internal-use
software within property, plant and equipment. Capitalized costs
are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful
lives of the software, generally not exceeding five years.

c) Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

In accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets” (“SFAS 142”),
goodwill, representing the excess of purchase price over the net
asset value of companies acquired, and indefinite-lived
intangible assets are not amortized, but are reviewed for
impairment annually in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if
events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might
be impaired. The annual evaluation is based on valuation models
that estimate fair value based on expected future cash flows and
profitability projections.

Other intangible assets also include definite-lived assets which
are subject to amortization. Where applicable, amortization is
charged on a straight-line basis over the expected period to be
benefited. The straight-line method of amortization reflects an
appropriate allocation of the cost of the intangible assets to
earnings in proportion to the amount of economic benefits
obtained by the company in each reporting period. The Company
assesses the recoverability of other intangible assets subject
to amortization in accordance with SFAS No. 144,
“Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets” (“SFAS 144”).

Accounting for Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

In accordance with SFAS 144, the Company assesses the need
to record impairment losses on long-lived assets with finite
lives when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. An impairment
loss would be recognized when future estimated undiscounted cash
flows expected to result from use of the asset are less than the
asset’s carrying value, with the loss measured at fair
value based on discounted expected cash flows.

Taxation

The Company files tax returns in each jurisdiction in which it
operates. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for
the future tax consequences attributable to differences between
the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating

F-10


METTLER-TOLEDO INTERNATIONAL INC.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

(In thousands, except share data, unless otherwise stated)

loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in the
respective jurisdictions in which the Company operates. In
assessing the ability to realize deferred tax assets, management
considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion
or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

Deferred taxes are not provided on the unremitted earnings of
subsidiaries outside of the United States when it is expected
that these earnings are permanently reinvested. Such earnings
may become taxable upon the sale or liquidation of these
subsidiaries or upon the remittance of dividends. Deferred taxes
are provided when the Company no longer considers subsidiary
earnings to be permanently invested, such as in situations where
the Company’s subsidiaries plan to make future dividend
distributions.

Currency Translation and Transactions

The reporting currency for the consolidated financial statements
of the Company is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency
for the Company’s operations is generally the applicable
local currency. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of
companies whose functional currency is other than the
U.S. dollar are included in the consolidated financial
statements by translating the assets and liabilities into the
reporting currency at the exchange rates applicable at the end
of the reporting period. The statements of operations and cash
flows of such

non-U.S.

dollar
functional currency operations are translated at the monthly
average exchange rates during the year. Translation gains or
losses are accumulated in other comprehensive income (loss) in
the consolidated statements of shareholders’ equity.
Transaction gains and losses are included as a component of net
earnings.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recognized when title to a product has transferred
and any significant customer obligations have been fulfilled.
Standard shipping terms are generally FOB shipping point in most
countries and, accordingly, title transfers upon shipment. In
countries where title cannot legally transfer before delivery,
we defer revenue recognition until delivery has occurred. Other
than a few small software applications, we do not sell software
products without the related hardware instrument as the software
is embedded in the instrument. The Company’s typical
solution requires no significant production, modification or
customization of the hardware or software that is essential to
the functionality of the products. To the extent the
Company’s solutions have a post shipment obligation, such
as customer acceptance, revenue is deferred until the obligation
has been completed. In addition, we also defer revenue where
installation is required, unless such installation is
perfunctory. We also generally maintain the right to accept or
reject a product return in our terms and conditions and we also
maintain accruals for outstanding credits. Distributor discounts
are offset against revenue at the time such revenue is
recognized. Revenues from service contracts are recognized
ratably over the contract period.

Research and Development

Research and development costs primarily consist of salaries,
consulting and other costs. The Company expenses these costs as
incurred.

Warranty

The Company generally offers one-year warranties on most of its
products. Product warranties are recorded at the time revenue is
recognized for certain product shipments. While the Company
engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, our
warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates,
material usage and service costs incurred in correcting a
product failure.

(In thousands, except share data, unless otherwise stated)

Earnings per Common Share

In accordance with the treasury stock method, the Company has
included 1,077,344, 1,246,755 and 1,034,934 equivalent shares in
the calculation of diluted weighted average number of common
shares for the years ending December 31, 2005, 2004 and
2003, respectively, relating to outstanding stock options.

Outstanding options to purchase 127,125, 748,813 and
1,955,938 shares of common stock for the years ending
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, have been
excluded from the calculation of diluted weighted average number
of common shares as such options would be anti-dilutive.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company applies the intrinsic valuation methodology under
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees”
(“APB 25”), and related interpretations in
accounting for its stock option plan.

Had compensation cost for the Company’s stock option plan
been determined based upon the fair value of such awards at the
grant date, consistent with the methods of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, “Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation” (“SFAS 123”),
the Company’s net earnings and basic and diluted net
earnings per common share for the years ended December 31
would have been as follows:

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company has only limited involvement with derivative
financial instruments and does not use them for trading
purposes. As described more fully in Note 5, the Company
enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to
economically hedge certain short-term intercompany balances
involving its international businesses. Such contracts limit the
Company’s exposure to both favorable and unfavorable
currency fluctuations on the items they hedge. These contracts
are adjusted to reflect market values as of

F-12


METTLER-TOLEDO INTERNATIONAL INC.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

(In thousands, except share data, unless otherwise stated)

each balance sheet date, with the resulting changes in fair
value being recognized in the appropriate financial statement
caption in the income statement consistent with the underlying
position.

The Company also enters into certain interest rate swap
agreements in order to manage its exposure to changes in
interest rates. The differential paid or received on interest
rate swap agreements is recognized as interest expense over the
life of the agreements as incurred. The Company’s floating
to fixed interest rate swap agreements are generally cash flow
hedges, while the fixed to floating interest rate swap
agreements are generally fair value hedges. The change in fair
value of outstanding interest rate swap agreements that are
effective cash flow hedges is included in the Company’s
consolidated statement of shareholders’ equity. The change
in fair value of outstanding interest rate swap agreements that
are effective as fair value hedges is recognized in earnings as
incurred and is offset by the change in fair value of the hedged
item.

Concentration of Credit Risk

The Company’s revenue base is widely diversified by
geographic region and by individual customer. The Company’s
products are utilized in many different industries, although
extensively in the pharmaceutical, food and beverage,
transportation and logistics and chemicals industries. The
Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its
customers’ financial condition and, generally, requires no
collateral from its customers.

New Accounting Pronouncement

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) issued FASB Statement No. 123R,
“Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS 123R”).
SFAS 123R replaces SFAS 123 and supersedes
APB 25. SFAS 123R requires public companies to
recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for
an award (with limited exceptions) over the period during which
an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the
award. Disclosure of the effect of expensing the fair value of
equity compensation is currently required under SFAS 123
(see

Stock-Based Compensation

within Note 2) by
continuing to apply the guidance in APB 25. On
April 15, 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission
issued a release that delayed the implementation of
SFAS 123R to annual periods beginning after June 15,
2005. The Company has assessed the impact of adopting
SFAS 123R in 2006. Based upon existing information, the
Company estimates its share-based compensation arrangements will
reduce 2006 net earnings between $5 million and
$6 million or approximately $0.13 per share. This
includes compensation expense associated with non-qualified
stock options as well as restricted stock units. As described in
Note 11, the compensation committee of the Board of
Directors determined in the fourth quarter of 2005 to grant
restricted share units to participating managers who previously
received non-qualified stock options in previous years.
Executive officers continued to receive non-qualified option
grants.

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

During the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, the
Company spent approximately $4.1 million and
$2.3 million, respectively, on acquisitions and additional
consideration related to

earn-out

periods
associated with acquisitions consummated in prior years.
Goodwill recognized in connection with these acquisition
payments totaled $3.4 million and $1.5 million,
respectively, which is included in the Company’s Western
European Operations, Swiss Operations and Other segments in 2005
and in the U.S. Operations, Swiss Operations, Chinese
Operations and Other segments in 2004. The Company accounted for
the acquisition payments and additional consideration using the
purchase method of accounting.

A reconciliation of the change in goodwill during the years
ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 is provided in Note 7
to these consolidated financial statements.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

As described in Note 9, on November 7, 2005, the
Company amended and restated its existing $300 million
Credit Agreement (the “Amended Credit Agreement”). The
Amended Credit Agreement increases the amount that can be
borrowed under the facility from $300 million to
$450 million, extends the maturity date to November 2010
and lowers the margin applicable to the interest rate payable
thereunder. The remaining terms of the Amended Credit Agreement
are substantially the same as under the prior Credit Agreement.
The Company incurred fees of approximately $0.9 million in
conjunction with amending and restating the Credit Agreement
which are amortized to interest expense over five years.

In November 2003, the Company issued $150 million of
seven-year Senior Notes (the “Senior Notes”). In
connection with this issuance, the Company entered into an
interest rate swap agreement, designated as a fair value hedge,
which changes the fixed interest obligation associated with
$30 million of the Senior Notes into a floating rate. This
agreement has a maturity date of November 15, 2010. Under
the swap, the Company will receive a fixed interest rate of
4.85% (i.e., the same rate as the Senior Notes) and pay interest
at a rate of LIBOR plus 0.22%. At December 31, 2005, the
fair value of the swap was approximately a $0.4 million
loss.

At December 31, 2005, the Company had outstanding foreign
currency forward contracts in the amount of $69.6 million,
in order to economically hedge short-term intercompany balances
with its foreign businesses.

The Company may be exposed to credit losses in the event of
nonperformance by the counterparties to its derivative financial
instrument contracts. Counterparties are established banks and
financial institutions with high credit ratings. The Company
does not believe that such counterparties will not be able to
fully satisfy their obligations under these contracts.

The fair values of all derivative financial instruments are
estimated based on current settlement prices of comparable
contracts obtained from dealer quotes. The values represent the
estimated amount the Company would pay or receive to terminate
the agreements at the reporting date.

straight-line basis over periods ranging from 7 to 45 years.

The Company had amortization expense associated with the above
intangible assets of $4.1 million for both the years ended
December 31, 2005 and 2004.

cancellation of the license, the Company has concluded that the
intangible asset has no future benefit and as such, during the
second quarter of 2005, has written off the total value of the
asset, $19.9 million ($12 million after tax). This
charge has been included as a component of Other charges, net
within the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

The Company has subsequently appealed the trial court decision.
Litigation concerning the license and related issues is ongoing
between the Company and the other party to the license. The
Company does not believe that the litigation will have a
material adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition,
results of operations or cash flows. In 2004, the Company had
$13.9 million in sales of these third party-manufactured
pipettes in the U.S. which had declined 28% since 2001. The
Company expects to minimize any impact to its sales and
profitability by increasing the sales of its own higher margin
pipettes, including those the Company already manufactures and
sells outside the United States.

November 2005 Refinancing

On November 7, 2005, the Company amended and restated its
Credit Agreement, which amends and restates its prior Credit
Agreement, dated as of November 12, 2003. The Amended
Credit Agreement increases the amount that can be borrowed under
the facility from $300 million to $450 million,
extends the maturity date to November 2010 and lowers the margin
applicable to the interest rate payable thereunder. The
remaining terms of the Amended Credit Agreement are
substantially the same as under the prior Credit Agreement. The
Company incurred fees of approximately $0.9 million in
conjunction with amending and restating the Credit Agreement
which are being amortized to interest expense over five years.

Amended Credit Agreement

The $450 million Amended Credit Agreement is provided by a
group of financial institutions and has a maturity date of
November 5, 2010. It is not subject to any scheduled
principal payments. Borrowings under the Amended Credit
Agreement bear interest at current market rates plus a margin
based on our senior unsecured credit ratings (currently
“BBB” by Standard & Poor’s and
“Baa3” by Moody’s) and is currently set at LIBOR
plus 0.375%. We must also pay facility fees that are tied to our
credit ratings. The Amended Credit Agreement contains covenants,
for which the Company was in compliance as of December 31,
2005, including maintaining a ratio of debt to earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of less than 3.25
to 1.0 and an interest coverage ratio of more than 3.5 to 1.0.
This also places certain limitations on us, including limiting
the ability to grant liens or incur debt at a subsidiary level.
In addition, the Amended Credit Agreement has several events of
default, including upon a change of control. As of
December 31, 2005, approximately $146.2 million was
available under the facility. The Amended Credit Agreement is
unsecured.

Senior Notes

In November 2003, the Company issued $150 million of 4.85%
unsecured Senior Notes due November 15, 2010. The Senior
Notes rank equally with all our unsecured and unsubordinated
indebtedness. Interest is payable semi-annually in May and
November. Discount and issuance costs approximated
$1.2 million and are being amortized to interest expense
over the seven-year term of the Senior Notes. At the
Company’s option, the Senior Notes may be redeemed in whole
or in part at any time at a redemption price equal to the
greater of:

•

The principal amount of the Senior Notes; or

•

The sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled
    payments of principal and interest thereon discounted to the
    redemption date on a semi-annual basis at a comparable treasury
    rate plus a margin of 0.20%.

The Senior Notes contain limitations on the ability to incur
liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions exceeding
10% of the Company’s consolidated net worth.

The Company’s weighted average interest rate for the years
ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 was approximately 6%. The
carrying value of the Company’s debt obligations
approximates fair value.

SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY

Common Stock

The number of authorized shares of the Company’s common
stock is 125,000,000 shares with a par value of
$0.01 per share. Holders of the Company’s common stock
are entitled to one vote per share. At December 31, 2005,
6,866,742 shares of the Company’s common stock were
reserved for issuance pursuant to the Company’s stock
option plan.

Preferred Stock

The Board of Directors, without further shareholder
authorization, is authorized to issue up to
10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value
$0.01 per share in one or more series and to determine and
fix the rights, preferences and privileges of each series,
including dividend rights and preferences over dividends on the
common stock and one or more series of the preferred stock,
conversion rights, voting rights (in addition to those provided
by law), redemption rights and the terms of any sinking fund
therefore, and rights upon liquidation, dissolution or winding
up, including preferences over the common

(In thousands, except share data, unless otherwise stated)

stock and one or more series of the preferred stock. The
issuance of shares of preferred stock, or the issuance of rights
to purchase such shares, may have the effect of delaying,
deferring or preventing a change in control of the Company or an
unsolicited acquisition proposal.

Restricted Stock Units

In 2005, the Company made its initial grant of 74,600 restricted
stock units to certain employees. The grant-date fair value of
the restricted stock unit was $52.37 and the restricted units
vest ratably over a five-year period. The intrinsic value of the
restricted stock units on the date of grant of $3.9 million
will be recorded as compensation expense ratably over the
vesting period. Approximately $0.1 million of compensation
expense was recognized during the year ended December 31,
2005.

Shareholder Rights Plan

On August 26, 2002, the Board of Directors adopted a
Shareholder Rights Plan under which the Company declared a
non-cash dividend of one right for each outstanding share of
common stock. The Rights, which expire on September 5,
2012, entitle stockholders to buy one one-thousandth of a share
of preferred stock at an exercise price of $150. The Rights were
distributed to those stockholders of record as of close of
business on September 5, 2002 and are attached to all
certificates representing those shares of common stock.

The Rights Plan provides that should any person or group
acquire, or announce a tender or exchange offer for 15% or more
of the Company’s common stock, each Right, other than
Rights held by the acquiring person or group, would entitle its
holder to purchase a number of shares of the Company’s
common stock for 50% of its then-current market value. Unless a
15% acquisition has occurred, the Rights may be redeemed by the
Board of Directors of the Company at any time. The Rights Plan
will not be triggered by a tender or exchange offer for all
outstanding shares of the Company at a price and on terms that
the Company’s Board of Directors determines to be adequate
and in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders.

The Rights Plan exempts any stockholder that beneficially owned
15% or more of the Company’s common stock as of
August 26, 2002. However, the Rights will become
exercisable if, at any time after August 26, 2002, any of
these stockholders acquire additional shares of the
Company’s common stock in an amount which is greater than
2% of the Company’s outstanding common stock.

Share Repurchase Program

The Company has a share repurchase program that was announced in
February 2004 and updated in November 2004 and November 2005.
Under the program, the Company has been authorized to buy back
up to $100 million of equity shares over the two-year
period ending December 31, 2005, an additional
$200 million over the two-year period ending
December 31, 2006 and an additional $200 million over
the two-year period ending December 31, 2007. The share
repurchases are expected to be funded from cash generated from
operating activities. Repurchases will be made through open
market transactions, and the timing will depend on the level of
acquisition activity, business and market conditions, the stock
price, trading restrictions and other factors.

During the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, the
Company spent $164.6 million and $103.8 million on the
repurchase of 3,229,200 shares and 2,208,500 shares at
an average price of $50.94 and $46.97, respectively. An
additional $4.2 million and $1.4 million relating to
the settlement of shares repurchased as of December 31,
2005 and 2004 were cash settled during 2006 and 2005,
respectively. The Company reissued 1,261,332 shares and
794,428 shares held in treasury for the exercise of stock
options

EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN

The Company’s equity incentive plan provides employees and
directors of the Company additional incentive to join and/or
remain in the service of the Company as well as to maintain and
enhance the long-term performance and profitability of the
Company. The Company’s 2004 equity incentive plan was
approved by shareholders on May 6, 2004 and provides that
3.5 million shares of common stock, plus any options
outstanding under the Company’s prior option plan that
terminate without being exercised, and 2.1 million
restricted units may be the subject of awards. The plan provides
for the grant of options, restricted stock, restricted stock
units and other equity-based awards. The exercise price of
options granted shall not be less than the fair market value of
the common stock on the date of grant. Options generally vest
equally over a five-year period from the date of grant and have
a maximum term of up to 10 years and six months of the
total shares authorized. Restricted units vest equally over a
five-year period from the date of grant. During 2005, the
compensation committee of the Board of Directors determined to
grant restricted share units to participating managers and
non-qualified stock options to executive officers.

BENEFIT PLANS

Mettler-Toledo maintains a number of retirement and other
post-retirement employee benefit plans.

Certain subsidiaries sponsor defined contribution plans.
Benefits are determined and funded annually based upon the terms
of the plans. Amounts recognized as cost under these plans
amounted to $9.2 million, $7.5 million and
$7.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2005,
2004 and 2003, respectively.

Certain subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit plans. Benefits are
provided to employees primarily based upon years of service and
employees’ compensation for certain periods during the last
years of employment. Prior to 2002, the Company’s
U.S. operations also provided post-retirement medical
benefits to their employees. Contributions for medical benefits
are related to employee years of service.

In May 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. 106-2
(“FSP 106-2”), “Accounting and Disclosure
Requirements related to the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003.” FSP 106-2
relates to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and
Modernization Act of 2003 (the “Act”) signed into law
on December 8, 2003. The Act introduced a prescription drug
benefit under Medicare (Medicare Part D), as well as
federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans
that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent
to Medicare Part D. During the third quarter of 2004, the
Company adopted the provisions of FSP 106-2. The Company
sponsors post-retirement health care plans that provide
prescription drug benefits that are deemed actuarially
equivalent to the Medicare Part D and elected to recognize
the impact of the federal subsidy on its accumulated
post-retirement benefit obligation and net post-retirement
benefit costs in the third quarter of 2004. Recognition of the
Medicare Drug Act decreased the Company’s accumulated
post-retirement benefit obligation by $3.5 million and
reduced its net post-retirement benefit cost by approximately
$0.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2004.

In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue
No. 03-4, “Accounting for Cash Balance Pension
Plans”
(“EITF

03-4”),

the Company determined in 2003 that its Swiss cash balance
pension plan met the requirements necessitating a change in the
method of expense attribution used in its actuarial calculations
from the “projected unit credit” method to the
“traditional unit credit” method. Unlike the projected
unit credit method, the traditional unit credit method does not
assume compensation increases in calculating the benefit
obligation, because the pension benefit is based on a guaranteed
return on pension contributions, rather than employees’
compensation for certain periods during the last years of
employment. Accordingly, this required change in methodology
resulted in a reduction in the projected benefit obligation of
approximately $53.3 million, which is subject to
amortization over the expected future service life of
Switzerland-based employees.

The Company uses a measurement date of September 30 for its
defined benefit pension and other benefit plans. The following
table sets forth the change in benefit obligation, the change in
plan assets, the funded status and amounts recognized in the
consolidated financial statements for the Company’s defined
benefit plans and post-retirement plans at December 31,
2005 and 2004:

(In thousands, except share data, unless otherwise stated)

The accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation and net
periodic post-retirement benefit cost were principally
determined using discount rates of 5.50% in 2005, 5.75% in 2004
and 6.25% in 2003 and health care cost trend rates ranging from
9% to 12% in 2005, 9% to 13.5% in 2004 and 9% to 14% in 2003,
decreasing to 4.5% in 2009.

The health care cost trend rate assumption has a significant
effect on the accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation and
net periodic post-retirement benefit cost. A

Investment policies and strategies for each of the
Company’s pension plans are determined periodically by
pension trustees for each plan, having regard for the potential
risks and returns offered by investment in the various assets
available. Target asset allocation and investment return
criteria are established by the trustees with the overriding
objective of stable earnings growth. Actual results are
monitored against those targets and the trustees are required to
report to the members of each plan, including an analysis of
investment performance on an annual basis at a minimum.

Day-to

-day asset
management is typically performed by a third party asset
management company, reporting to the pension trustees. The
long-term rate of return on plan asset assumptions used to
determine pension expense under U.S. GAAP are generally
based on historical investment performance and the target
investment return criteria for the future determined by the
trustees.

As a result of the voluntary incremental pension payments made
to the Company’s underfunded pension plans of
$10.0 million in 2004 and $17.1 million in 2003, the
Company is not required to make pension funding payments to its
U.S. and U.K. pension plans during the next two years. Similar
to 2004 and 2003, voluntary contributions to the Company’s
pension plans may be made.

In 2006, the Company expects to make normal employer pension
contributions of approximately $11 million to its

The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to
significant portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax
liabilities are presented below at December 31:

The Company has recorded valuation allowances related to its
deferred income tax assets due to the uncertainty of the
ultimate realization of future benefits from such assets. The
potential decrease or increase of the valuation allowance in the
near term is dependent on the future ability of the Company to
realize the deferred tax assets that are affected by the future
profitability of operations in various worldwide jurisdictions.
The Company did not realize a significant change in its
valuation allowance for 2005.

F-27


METTLER-TOLEDO INTERNATIONAL INC.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
(Continued)

(In thousands, except share data, unless otherwise stated)

$5.3 million and $1.4 million of the valuation
allowance will be credited to shareholders’ equity and
goodwill, respectively, if and when realized.

At December 31, 2005, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of
$2.1 million that expire in various amounts through 2021
and foreign tax credits of $8.4 million that expire in
various amounts through 2014. The Company has various
U.S. state net operating losses and various foreign net
operating losses that have various expiration periods.

The Company plans to repatriate in future years $75 million
of previously unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries.
Accordingly, a deferred tax liability of $12.6 million has
been established to account for the incremental tax costs
associated with the planned repatriation. No deferred tax
liability has been recognized on the residual unremitted
earnings approximating $2 million, as such earnings have
been permanently reinvested in the business.

As a result of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, the
Company repatriated $396 million of cash during 2005 that
has been generated over time by its foreign operations. As a
result of this repatriation, the Company recorded additional
income tax expense of $13.1 million. This amount reflects
the federal tax impact in the United States (including certain
state taxes) of $12.3 million, foreign withholding taxes of
$2.0 million and a net decrease of $1.2 million of
deferred tax liabilities associated with the reassessment of
pre-existing and future dividend repatriations. In addition, the
Company recorded tax benefits of $7.7 million related to
the favorable resolution of certain tax matters.

The Company is currently under examination in various taxing
jurisdictions in which it conducts business operations. While
the Company has not yet received any material assessments from
these taxing authorities, the Company believes that adequate
amounts of taxes and related interest and penalties have been
provided for any adverse adjustments as a result of these
examinations and that the ultimate outcome of these examinations
will not result in a material impact on the Company’s
consolidated results of operations or financial position.

The Company currently benefits from tax holidays in certain
jurisdictions. These holidays expire at various dates in the
future and may or may not be renewable. Management does not
believe that potential changes in tax benefits from existing tax
holidays will have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s financial condition or results of operations.

14.

OTHER CHARGES, NET

Other charges, net consists primarily of charges related to the
Company’s restructuring programs, interest income,
(gains) losses from foreign currency transactions,
(gains) losses from sales of assets and other items.

Other charges, net includes a $21.8 million charge related
to pipette litigation. In June of 2005, the Company wrote off a
non-cash $19.9 million ($12 million after tax)
intangible asset relating to an intellectual property license
that was subject to litigation with the grantor which is
included as a component of Other and Deferred taxes in the
interim consolidated statements of cash flows. This license
enabled a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company exclusive
rights to distribute certain third-party manufactured pipettes
in the United States. A judgment entered on June 6, 2005
terminated the license agreement and awarded damages to the
other party. The Company also incurred $1.9 million of
related legal costs during the three months ended June 30,
2005, which includes damages of $0.6 million due to the
grantor.

During the first quarter of 2003, we recorded a restructuring
charge of $5.4 million ($3.8 million after tax)
related to the final union settlement on the closure of our
French manufacturing facility. This charge

(In thousands, except share data, unless otherwise stated)

comprised the additional employee-related costs resulting from
final settlement of the social plan negotiated with the French
workers’ council during the first quarter of 2003.

We assess our accrual for restructuring activities on an ongoing
basis. During the third quarter of 2003, we recorded a reduction
in the restructuring accrual of $1.0 million, included
within Other charges, net, as a result of lower employee-related
charges than originally anticipated. Also, a restructuring
charge of $1.4 million was recorded related to an extension
of manufacturing consolidation activities. This charge comprised
severance of $1.0 million, included within Other charges,
net, and inventory write-downs of $0.4 million, included
within Cost of sales.

At December 31, 2003, we had substantially completed the
restructuring programs described above.

SEGMENT REPORTING

Operating segments are the individual reporting units within the
Company. These units are managed separately, and it is at this
level where the determination of resource allocation is made.
The units have been aggregated based on operating segments in
geographic regions that have similar economic characteristics
and meet the aggregation criteria of SFAS No. 131,
“Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
Information” (“SFAS 131”). The Company has
updated the geographic aggregation of its segments as of
March 31, 2005 and has determined there are five reportable
segments: U.S. Operations, Swiss Operations, Western
European Operations, Chinese Operations, and Other. Prior year
segment information has been restated to conform with current
period presentation.

U.S. Operations represent certain of the Company’s
marketing and producing organizations located in the United
States. Western European Operations include the Company’s
marketing and producing organizations in Western Europe,
excluding operations located in Switzerland. Swiss Operations
include marketing and producing organizations located in
Switzerland as well as extensive R&D operations that are

(In thousands, except share data, unless otherwise stated)

responsible for the development, production and marketing of
precision instruments, including weighing, analytical and
measurement technologies for use in a variety of industrial and
laboratory applications. Chinese Operations represents the
Company’s marketing and producing organizations located in
China. The Company’s market organizations are
geographically focused and are responsible for all aspects of
the Company’s sales and service. Operating segments that
exist outside these reportable segments are included in Other.

The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same
as those described in the summary of significant accounting
policies. The Company evaluates performance based on adjusted
operating income which is referred to as segment profit for
segment reporting (gross profit less research and development,
selling, general and administrative expenses and restructuring
charges, before amortization, interest, other charges and
taxes). Inter-segment sales and transfers are priced to reflect
consideration of market conditions and the regulations of the
countries in which the transferring entities are located. The
following tables show the operations of the Company’s
operating segments:

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

As part of the Rainin acquisition, the Company entered into an
agreement to lease certain property from the former owner and
current General Manager of Rainin. During the years ended
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company made lease
payments with respect to this agreement of $2.5 million,
$2.3 million and $2.2 million, respectively. In
addition, Rainin continued to purchase certain products from its
former owner. During the years ended December 31, 2005,
2004 and 2003, the volume of these purchases was
$0.1 million, $0.8 million and $1.1 million,
respectively. The formal agreement to purchase these products
was terminated during the third quarter of 2004. This
termination did not have a material impact on the Company’s
consolidated financial statements. All of the Company’s
transactions with the former owner of Rainin were in the normal
course of business.
