PART I

Item 1.

Business

We are a leading global supplier of precision instruments and
services. We are the world’s largest manufacturer of
weighing instruments for use in laboratory, industrial,
packaging, logistics and food retailing applications. We also
hold top-three market positions in several related analytical
instruments, and are a leading provider of automated chemistry
systems used in drug and chemical compound discovery and
development. In addition, we are the world’s largest
manufacturer and marketer of metal detection and other
end-of-line inspection systems used in production and packaging,
and hold a leading position in certain process analytics
applications.

Our business is geographically diversified, with sales in 2004
derived 43% from Europe, 40% from North and South America and
17% from Asia and other countries. Our customer base is also
diversified by industry and by individual customer.

Mettler-Toledo International Inc. was incorporated as a Delaware
corporation in 1991 and became a publicly traded company with
its initial public offering in November 1997. In November 2001,
we acquired Rainin Instrument, a leading manufacturer of
pipetting solutions used in pharmaceutical, biotech and medical
research applications.

Business Segments

We have six reportable segments: Principal U.S. Operations,
Other Western European Operations, Principal Central European
Operations, Swiss R&D and Manufacturing Operations, Asia and
Other. See Note 16 to the audited consolidated financial
statements and Item 7. Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under
“Results of Operations — by Operating
Segment” for detailed results by segment and geographic
region.

We manufacture a wide variety of precision instruments and
provide value-added services to our customers. Our principal
products and principal services are set forth below. Given the
inherently global nature of our business, the following
description of our products, customers and distribution, sales
and services, research and development, manufacturing and other
elements of our business apply, for the most part, to each of
our segments. In some instances particular products are targeted
for particular segments but none of these are material in nature
to the entire business or an individual segment.

Laboratory Instruments

We make a wide variety of precision laboratory instruments,
including laboratory balances, pipettes, titrators, thermal
analysis systems and other analytical instruments. The
laboratory instruments business accounted for approximately 45%
of our net sales in 2004.

Laboratory Balances

Our laboratory balances have weighing ranges from one
ten-millionth of a gram up to 32 kilograms. To cover a wide
range of customer needs and price points, we market our balances
in a range of product tiers offering different levels of
functionality. Based on the same technology platform, we also
manufacture mass comparators, which are used by weights and
measures regulators as well as laboratories to ensure the
accuracy of reference weights.

In addition to Mettler-Toledo branded products, we manufacture
and sell balances under the brand name “Ohaus.” Ohaus
branded products principally target the educational market and
other markets in which customers are interested in lower cost, a
more limited set of features and less comprehensive support and
service.

Pipettes

Pipettes are used in laboratories for dispensing small volumes
of liquids. In late 2001, we acquired Rainin Instrument, a
premier provider of pipetting solutions based in California.
Rainin develops, manufactures and distributes advanced pipettes,
tips and accessories, including single- and multi-channel manual
and electronic



pipettes. Rainin maintains service centers in the key markets
where customers periodically send in their pipettes for
certified recalibrations. Rainin’s principal end markets
are pharmaceutical, biotech, clinical and academia.

Titrators

Titrators measure the chemical composition of samples and are
used in laboratories as well as the food and beverage and other
industries. Our high-end titrators are multi-tasking models,
which can perform two determinations simultaneously on multiple
vessels. Our offering includes robotics to automate routine work
in quality control applications.

Thermal Analysis Systems

Thermal analysis systems measure material properties as a
function of temperature, such as weight, dimension, energy flow
and viscoelastic properties. Thermal analysis systems are used
in nearly every industry, but primarily in the plastics and
polymer industries and increasingly in the pharmaceutical
industry.

Other Analytical Instruments

pH meters measure acidity in laboratory samples. We also sell
density and refractometry instruments, which measure chemical
concentrations in solutions. In addition, we manufacture and
sell moisture analyzers, which precisely determine the moisture
content of a sample by utilizing an infrared dryer to evaporate
moisture.

Laboratory Software

LabX, our PC-based laboratory software platform, manages and
analyzes data generated by our titrators and balances. LabX
provides full network capability, has efficient, intuitive
protocols, and enables customers to collect and archive data in
compliance with the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration’s traceability requirements for
electronically stored data (also known as 21 CFR
Part 11). We plan to expand LabX to include other
laboratory instruments.

Automated Chemistry Solutions

Our current drug discovery offerings are focused on key aspects
of process development, as well as on identification of leads
and optimization of those leads. Our automated lab reactors and
reaction calorimeters are integral to the process research and
development and scale-up activities of our customers. We offer a
range of technologies including automated synthesizers to
support chemists working on lead identification and
optimization, automated workstations that support the synthesis
process, and systems for cleaning up and purifying synthesis
products. In addition, we allow customers to monitor the
reaction and crystallization processes with on-line measurement
technologies based on infrared and laser light. We believe that
our portfolio of integrated technologies can bring significant
efficiencies to the drug discovery process, enabling our
customers to create larger numbers of higher quality candidate
compounds and bring them to market faster.

Process Analytics

Our process analytics business provides instruments for the
in-line measurement of liquid parameters used primarily in the
production process of pharmaceutical, biotech, beverage,
microelectronics, and chemical companies. About half of our
process analytics sales are to the pharmaceutical and biotech
markets, where our customers need fast and secure scale-up and
production that meets the validation processes required for GMP
(Good Manufacturing Processes) and other regulatory standards.
We are a leading solution provider for liquid analytical
measurement to control and optimize production processes. Our
solutions include sensor technology for pH, dissolved oxygen,
CO


, conductivity, turbidity and TOC and automated
systems for calibration and cleaning of measurement points. Our
instruments offer leading multi-parameter capabilities and
plant-wide control system integration, which are key for
integrated measurement of multiple parameters to secure
production quality and efficiency. With a worldwide network of
specialists, we support customers in critical process
applications, compliance and systems integration questions.



Industrial Instruments

We manufacture numerous industrial weighing instruments and
related terminals and we offer dedicated software solutions for
the chemical, pharmaceutical and food industries. We supply
automatic identification and data capture solutions, which
integrate in-motion weighing, dimensioning and identification
technologies for transport, shipping and logistics customers. We
also offer heavy industrial scales and related software. The
industrial instruments business accounted for approximately 42%
of our net sales in 2004.

Industrial Weighing Instruments

We offer a comprehensive line of industrial scales and balances,
such as bench scales and floor scales, for weighing loads from a
few grams to several thousand kilograms in applications ranging
from measuring materials in chemical production to weighing mail
and packages. Our products are used in a wide range of
applications, such as counting applications and in formulating
and mixing ingredients.

Industrial Terminals

Our industrial scale terminals integrate collected data and
control and automate manufacturing processes. They allow users
to remotely download programs or access setup data and can
minimize down time through predictive rather than reactive
maintenance.

Transportation/ Shipping and Logistics

We are a leading global supplier of automatic identification and
data capture solutions, which integrate in-motion weighing,
dimensioning and identification technologies. With these
solutions, customers can measure the weight and cubic volume of
packages for appropriate billing, logistics and quality control.
Our solutions also integrate into customers’ information
systems.

Vehicle Scale Systems

Our primary heavy industrial products are scales for weighing
trucks or railcars (i.e., weighing bulk goods as they enter or
leave a factory or at a toll station). Heavy industrial scales
are capable of measuring weights up to 500 tons and permit
accurate weighing under extreme environmental conditions. We
also offer advanced computer software, including, that can be
used with our heavy industrial scales to facilitate a broad
range of customer solutions and provides a complete system for
managing vehicle transaction processing.

Industrial Software

We offer a wide range of software that can be used with our
industrial instruments. Examples include FreeWeigh.net, a
statistical quality control software, Formweigh, our
formulation/batching software, and OverDrive. FreeWeigh.net and
Formweigh provide full network capability and enable customers
to collect and archive data in compliance with the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s traceability
requirements for electronically stored data (21 CFR part
11). In addition, our Q.i365 software controls batching
processes by monitoring the material transfer control process.
Q.i365 also provides statistical, diagnostic and operational
information for asset management, process control and database
applications.

Product Inspection

Increasing safety and consumer protection requirements are
driving the need for more and more sophisticated end-of-line
inspection systems (e.g., for use in food processing and
packaging, and pharmaceutical and other industries). We are the
world’s leading provider of metal detectors, x-ray
visioning equipment and checkweighers that are used in these
industries. Metal detectors are most commonly used to detect
fine particles of metal that may be contained in raw materials
or may be generated by the manufacturing process itself.
X-ray-based vision inspection helps detect non-metallic
contamination, such as glass, stones and pits, which enter the
manufacturing process for similar reasons. Our x-ray systems can
detect metal in metallized containers and can be used for mass
control. Both x-ray and metal detection systems may be used
together with checkweighers as components of integrated packaging



lines. Checkweighers are used to control the filling content of
packaged goods such as food, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics.
FreeWeigh.net is our statistical and quality control software
that optimizes package filling, monitors weight-related data and
integrates it in real time into customers’ enterprise
resource planning and/or process control systems.

Retail Weighing Solutions

Supermarkets, hypermarkets and other food retail organizations
make use of multiple weighing applications for handling fresh
goods (such as meats, vegetables, fruits and cheeses). We offer
stand-alone scales for basic counter weighing and pricing, price
finding and printing. In addition, we offer network scales and
software, which can integrate backroom, counter, self-service
and checkout functions and can incorporate weighing data into a
supermarket’s overall fresh goods management system.
Customer benefits are in the areas of pricing, merchandising,
inventory management, and regulatory compliance. The retail
business accounted for approximately 13% of our net sales in
2004.

Retail Software

Our subsidiary SofTechnics provides retail software for in-store
item and inventory management solutions. SofTechnics’
offering complements our solutions to food retailers. Its
software provides the full scope of real-time item management,
thereby allowing retailers to match local store inventory levels
with local customer demand. As our traditional retail weighing
business become more focused on information technology, the
opportunity to cross-sell SofTechnics’ software and
services expands. We have begun to introduce SofTechnics
software for the improved management of fresh goods and plan to
sell more integrated data management solutions for fresh goods
now and in the future.

Customers and Distribution

Our principal customers include companies in the following key
end markets: the life science industry (pharmaceutical and
biotech companies, as well as independent research
organizations); food producers; food retailers; the beverage
industry; specialty chemicals and cosmetics companies; the
transportation and logistics industry; the metals industry; the
electronics industry; and the academic market.

Our products are sold through a variety of distribution
channels. Generally, more technically sophisticated products are
sold through our direct sales force, while less complicated
products are sold through indirect channels. Our sales through
direct channels exceed our sales through indirect channels. A
significant portion of our sales in the Americas is generated
through the indirect channels. We have a diversified customer
base, with no single customer accounting for more than 2% of
2004 net sales.

Sales and Service

Market Organizations

We maintain geographically focused market organizations around
the world that are responsible for all aspects of our sales and
service. The market organizations are local marketing and
service organizations designed to maintain close relationships
with our customers. Each market organization has the flexibility
to adapt its marketing and service efforts to account for
different cultural and economic conditions. Market organizations
also work closely with our producing organizations (described
below) by providing feedback on manufacturing and product
development initiatives and relaying new product and application
ideas.

We have one of the largest and broadest global sales and service
organizations among precision instrument manufacturers. At
December 31, 2004, our sales and services group consisted
of over 4,500 employees in sales, marketing and customer service
(including related administration) and post-sales technical
service, located in 37 countries. This field organization has
the capability to provide service and support to our customers
and distributors in major markets across the globe. This is
important because our customers are seeking to do more and more
business with a consistent global approach.



Service

We have expanded our service business from one centered on
calibration, repair and maintenance to one driven by regulatory
compliance and other value-added services, which we call Service
XXL. We have a unique offering to our pharmaceutical customers
in assuring that our instruments are used in compliance with FDA
regulations and we can provide these services regardless of the
customer’s location throughout the world. This global
service network also is an important factor in our ability to
expand in emerging markets. We estimate that we have the largest
installed base of weighing instruments in the world. In 2004,
service (representing service contracts, repairs and replacement
parts) accounted for approximately 23% of our total net sales. A
significant portion of this amount is derived from replacement
parts.

Beyond revenue opportunities, we believe service is a key part
of our solution offering and helps significantly in customer
retention. The close relationships and frequent contact with our
large customer base provides us with sales opportunities and
innovative product and application ideas.

Research and Development and Manufacturing

Producing Organizations

Our research, product development and manufacturing efforts are
organized into a number of producing organizations which
specialize in specific products on a global basis. Our focused
producing organizations help reduce product development time and
costs, improve customer focus and maintain technological
leadership. The producing organizations work together to share
ideas and best practices, and there is a close interface and
coordinated customer interaction among marketing organizations
and producing organizations.

Research and Development

We intend to continue to invest in product innovation in order
to provide technologically advanced products to our customers
for existing and new applications. Over the last three years, we
have invested $231.8 million in research and development
($83.2 million in 2004, $78.0 million in 2003, and
$70.6 million in 2002). In 2004, we spent approximately
5.9% of net sales on research and development. Our research and
development efforts fall into two categories:

•

technology advancements, which increase the value of our
    products. These advancements may be in the form of enhanced
    functionality, new applications for our technologies, more
    accurate or reliable measurement, additional software capability
    or automation through robotics or other means, and

•

cost reductions, which reduce the manufacturing cost of our
    products through better overall design.

We have devoted an increasing proportion of our research and
development budget to software development. This includes
software to process the signals captured by the sensors of our
instruments, application-specific software, and software that
connects our solutions into customers’ IT systems. We
closely integrate research and development with marketing,
manufacturing and product engineering. We have over 800
employees in research and development and product engineering.

Manufacturing

We are a worldwide manufacturer, with facilities principally in
the United States, Switzerland, Germany, the United Kingdom and
China. Laboratory instruments are produced mainly in Switzerland
and to a lesser extent in the United States and China, while our
remaining products are produced worldwide. We emphasize product
quality in our manufacturing operations, and most of our
products require very strict tolerances and exact
specifications. We use an extensive quality control system that
is integrated into each step of the manufacturing process. All
major manufacturing facilities have achieved ISO 9001
certification. We believe that our manufacturing capacity is
sufficient to meet our present and currently anticipated needs.

We generally manufacture only critical components ourselves,
usually components that contain proprietary technology. When
outside manufacturing is more efficient, we contract with others
for certain components. We use a wide range of suppliers. We
believe our supply arrangements to be adequate and that there
are no material



constraints on the sources and availability of materials. From
time to time we rely on a single supplier for all of our
requirements of a particular component. Supply arrangements for
electronics are generally made globally.

Backlog; Seasonality

Our manufacturing turnaround time is generally sufficiently
short so as to permit us to manufacture to fill orders for most
of our products, which helps to limit inventory costs. Backlog
is therefore generally a function of requested customer delivery
dates and is typically no longer than one to two months.

Our business has historically experienced a slight amount of
seasonal variation, particularly the high-end laboratory
instruments business. Traditionally, sales in the first quarter
are slightly lower than, and sales in the fourth quarter are
slightly higher than, sales in the second and third quarters.
Fourth quarter sales have historically generated approximately
27-28% of our sales. This trend has a somewhat greater effect on
income from operations than on net sales because fixed costs are
spread evenly across all quarters.

Employees

As of December 31, 2004, we had approximately 8,700
employees throughout the world, including approximately 4,100 in
Europe, 3,000 in North and South America, and 1,600 in Asia and
other countries.

We believe our employee relations are good, and we have not
suffered any material employee work stoppage or strike during
the last five years, except for a strike in early 2003 at our
Bethune, France facility, which has been closed. Labor unions do
not represent a meaningful number of our employees.

Intellectual Property

We hold over 1,700 patents and trademarks, primarily in the
United States, Switzerland, Germany, the United Kingdom, France,
Japan and China. Our products generally incorporate a wide
variety of technological innovations, some of which are
protected by patents of various durations. Products are
generally not protected as a whole by individual patents, and as
a result, no one patent or group of related patents is material
to our business. We have numerous trademarks, including the
Mettler-Toledo name and logo, which are material to our
business. We regularly protect against infringement of our
intellectual property.

Regulation

Our products are subject to various regulatory standards and
approvals by weights and measures regulatory authorities. All of
our electrical components are subject to electrical safety
standards. We believe that we are in compliance in all material
respects with applicable regulations.

Approvals are required to ensure our instruments do not
impermissibly influence other instruments, and are themselves
not affected by other instruments. In addition, some of our
products are used in “legal for trade” applications,
in which prices based on weight are calculated, and for which
specific weights and measures approvals are required. Although
there are a large number of regulatory agencies across our
markets, there is an increasing trend toward harmonization of
standards, and weights and measures regulation is harmonized
across the European Union.

Our products may also be subject to special requirements
depending on the end-user and market. For example, laboratory
customers are typically subject to Good Laboratory Practices
(GLP), industrial customers to Good Manufacturing Practices
(GMP), pharmaceutical customers to U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) regulations, and customers in food
processing industries may be subject to Hazard Analysis and
Critical Control Point (HACCP) regulations. Products used
in hazardous environments may also be subject to special
requirements.

Environmental Matters

We are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the
jurisdictions in which we operate. We own or lease a number of
properties and manufacturing facilities around the world. Like
many of our competitors, we have



incurred, and will continue to incur, capital and operating
expenditures and other costs in complying with such laws and
regulations in both the United States and abroad.

We are currently involved in, or have potential liability with
respect to, the remediation of past contamination in certain of
our facilities in both the United States and abroad. Our
subsidiary Hi-Speed Checkweigher Co., Inc.
(“Hi-Speed”) is one of two private parties ordered to
perform certain remedial actions under an administrative consent
order that the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection (“NJDEP”) signed on June 13, 1988
with respect to certain property in Landing, New Jersey. GEI
International Corporation (“GEI”) is the other ordered
party. GEI has failed to fulfil all its obligations under the
NJDEP order, and Hi-Speed has recently entered into discussions
with the NJDEP about the next steps to be undertaken as a
result. NJDEP has agreed with Hi-Speed that the residual
contaminants can be addressed through the establishment of a
Classification Exception Area and concurrent Well Restriction
Area for the site. The NJDEP does not view these vehicles as
remedial measures, but rather as “institutional
controls” that must be adequately maintained and
periodically evaluated. We estimate that the costs of compliance
associated with the site will be approximately $0.3 million
over the next seven years.

In addition, certain of our present and former facilities have
or had been in operation for many decades and, over such time,
some of these facilities may have used substances or generated
and disposed of wastes which are or may be considered hazardous.
It is possible that these sites, as well as disposal sites owned
by third parties to which we have sent wastes, may in the future
be identified and become the subject of remediation.
Accordingly, although we believe that we are in substantial
compliance with applicable environmental requirements and to
date we have not incurred material expenditures in connection
with environmental matters, it is possible that we could become
subject to material environmental liabilities in the future.

Competition

Our markets are highly competitive. Weighing and analytical
instruments markets are fragmented both geographically and by
application, particularly the industrial and food retailing
markets. As a result, we face numerous regional or specialized
competitors, many of which are well established in their
markets. In addition, some of our competitors are divisions of
larger companies with potentially greater financial and other
resources than our own. Taken together, the competitive forces
present in our markets can impair our operating margins in
certain product lines and geographic markets.

We expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and
performance of their products and to introduce new products with
competitive prices. Although we believe that we have
technological and other competitive advantages over many of our
competitors, we may not be able to realize and maintain these
advantages. These advantages include our worldwide market
leadership positions; our global brand and reputation; our track
record of technological innovation; our comprehensive,
high-quality solution offering; our global sales and service
offering; our large installed base of weighing instruments; and
the fact that our revenue base is diversified by geographic
region, product range and customer. To remain competitive, we
must continue to invest in research and development, sales and
marketing and customer service and support. We cannot be sure
that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make these
investments or that we will be successful in identifying,
developing and maintaining any competitive advantages.

We believe that the principal competitive factors in developed
markets for purchasing decisions are the product itself,
application support, service support and price. In emerging
markets, where there is greater demand for less sophisticated
products, price is a more important factor than in developed
markets. Competition in the U.S. laboratory market is also
influenced by the presence of large distributors that sell not
only our products but those of our competitors as well.



Factors affecting our future operating results

We have substantial debt and we may incur substantially
    more debt, which could affect our ability to meet our debt
    obligations and may otherwise restrict our activities.

We have substantial debt and we may incur substantial additional
debt in the future. As of December 31, 2004, we had total
indebtedness of approximately $136.0 million, net of cash
of $67.2 million. We are also permitted by the terms of our
debt instruments to incur substantial additional indebtedness,
subject to the restrictions therein.

Our debt could have important consequences to you. For example,
it could:

To service our debt, we will require a significant amount
    of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors
    beyond our control.

Our ability to make payments on our debt and to fund planned
capital expenditures and research and development efforts will
depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to
an extent, is subject to general economic, financial,
competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors,
including those described in this section, that are beyond our
control.

We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient
cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be
available to us under our senior credit facility in an amount
sufficient to enable us to pay our debt, or to fund our other
liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or a portion of
our indebtedness on or before maturity. We cannot assure you
that we will be able to refinance any of our debt, including our
senior credit facility and the senior notes, on commercially
reasonable terms or at all.

The agreements governing our debt impose restrictions on
    our business.

The indenture governing our senior notes and the agreements
governing our senior credit facility contain a number of
covenants imposing significant restrictions on our business.
These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our
business and may limit our ability to take advantage of
potential business opportunities as they arise. The restrictions
these covenants place on us and our restricted subsidiaries
include limitations on our ability and the ability of our
restricted subsidiaries to:

•

enter into sale and leaseback arrangements;

•

incur liens; and

•

consolidate, merge, sell or lease all or substantially all of
    our assets.

Our senior credit facility also requires us to meet several
financial ratios.

Our ability to comply with these agreements may be affected by
events beyond our control, including prevailing economic,
financial and industry conditions, and are subject to the risks
in this section. The breach of any of these covenants or
restrictions could result in a default under the indenture
governing the senior notes or under our senior credit facility.
An event of default under our senior credit facility would
permit our lenders to declare all amounts



borrowed from them to be immediately due and payable.
Acceleration of our other indebtedness may cause us to be unable
to make interest payments on the senior notes and repay the
principal amount of the senior notes.

Currency fluctuations may affect our operating
    profits.

Because we conduct operations in many countries, our operating
income can be significantly affected by fluctuations in currency
exchange rates. Swiss franc-denominated expenses represent a
much greater percentage of our operating expenses than Swiss
franc-denominated sales represent of our net sales. In part,
this is because most of our manufacturing costs in Switzerland
relate to products that are sold outside Switzerland. Moreover,
a substantial percentage of our research and development
expenses and general and administrative expenses are incurred in
Switzerland. Therefore, if the Swiss franc strengthens against
all or most of our major trading currencies (e.g

.

, the
U.S. dollar, the euro, other major European currencies and
the Japanese yen), our operating profit is reduced. We also have
significantly more sales in European currencies (other than the
Swiss franc) than we have expenses in those currencies.
Therefore, when European currencies weaken against the
U.S. dollar and the Swiss franc, it also decreases our
operating profits. Accordingly, the Swiss franc exchange rate to
the euro is an important cross-rate monitored by the Company. We
estimate that a 1% strengthening of the Swiss franc against the
euro would result in a decrease in our earnings before tax of
$0.9 million to $1.1 million on an annual basis. In
addition to the effects of exchange rate movements on operating
profits, our debt levels can fluctuate due to changes in
exchange rates, particularly between the U.S. dollar and
the Swiss franc. Based on our outstanding debt at
December 31, 2004, we estimate that a 10% weakening of the
U.S. dollar against the currencies in which our debt is
denominated would result in an increase of approximately
$2.8 million in the reported U.S. dollar value of the
debt.

We are subject to certain risks associated with our
    international operations and fluctuating conditions in emerging
    markets.

We conduct business in many countries, including emerging
markets in Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe. In addition
to the currency risks discussed above, international operations
pose other substantial risks and problems for us. For instance,
various local jurisdictions in which we operate may revise or
alter their respective legal and regulatory requirements. In
addition, we may encounter one or more of the following
obstacles or risks:

We must also comply with a variety of regulations regarding the
conversion and repatriation of funds earned in local currencies.
For example, converting earnings from our operations in China
into other currencies and repatriating these funds require
governmental approvals. If we cannot comply with these or other
applicable regulations, we may face increased difficulties in
utilizing cash flow generated by these operations outside of
China.

Economic conditions in emerging markets have from time to time
deteriorated significantly, and some emerging markets are
experiencing recessionary trends, severe currency devaluations
and inflationary prices. Moreover, economic problems in
individual markets can spread to other economies, adding to the
adverse conditions we face in emerging markets. We remain
committed to emerging markets, particularly those in Asia, Latin
America and Eastern Europe. However, we expect the fluctuating
economic conditions will affect our results of operations in
these markets for the foreseeable future.



We operate in highly competitive markets, and it may be
    difficult to preserve operating margins, gain market share and
    maintain a technological advantage.

Our markets are highly competitive. Weighing and analytical
instruments markets are also fragmented both geographically and
by application, particularly the industrial and food retailing
markets. As a result, we face numerous regional or specialized
competitors, many of whom are well established in their markets.
In addition, some of our competitors are divisions of larger
companies with potentially greater financial and other resources
than our company. Taken together, the competitive forces present
in our markets can impair our operating margins in certain
product lines and geographic markets. We expect our competitors
to continue to improve the design and performance of their
products and to introduce new products with competitive prices.
Although we believe that we have certain technological and other
advantages over our competitors, we may not be able to realize
and maintain these advantages.

Our product development efforts may not produce
    commercially viable products in a timely manner.

We must introduce new products and enhancements in a timely
manner, or our products could become technologically obsolete
over time, which would harm our operating results. To remain
competitive, we must continue to make significant investments in
research and development, sales and marketing, and customer
service and support. We cannot be sure that we will have
sufficient resources to continue to make these investments. In
developing new products, we may be required to make substantial
investments before we can determine their commercial viability.
As a result, we may not be successful in developing new products
and we may never realize the benefits of our research and
development activities.

A prolonged downturn or additional consolidation in the
    pharmaceutical, food, food retailing and chemicals industries
    could adversely affect our operating results.

Our products are used extensively in the pharmaceutical, food
and beverage and chemical industries. Consolidation in the
pharmaceutical and chemicals industries hurt our sales in prior
years. A prolonged downturn or additional consolidation in any
of these industries could adversely affect our operating
results. In addition, the capital spending policies of our
customers in these industries are based on a variety of factors
we cannot control, including the resources available for
purchasing equipment, the spending priorities among various
types of equipment and policies regarding capital expenditures
generally. Any decrease or delay in capital spending by our
customers would cause our revenues to decline and could harm our
profitability.

We may face risks associated with future
    acquisitions.

We plan to pursue acquisitions of complementary product lines,
technologies or businesses. Acquisitions involve numerous risks,
including:

•

difficulties in the assimilation of the acquired operations,
    technologies and products;

•

diversion of management’s attention from other business
    concerns; and

•

potential departures of key employees of the acquired company.

If we successfully identify acquisitions in the future,
completing such acquisitions may result in:

•

new issuances of our stock that may be dilutive to current
    owners;

•

increases in our debt and contingent liabilities; and

•

additional amortization expenses related to intangible assets.

Any of these acquisition-related risks could materially
adversely affect our profitability.

Larger companies have identified life sciences and instruments
as businesses they will consider entering, which could change
the competitive dynamics of these markets. In addition, we may
not be able to identify, successfully complete or integrate
potential acquisitions in the future. However, even if we can do
so, we cannot be sure that these acquisitions will have a
positive impact on our business or operating results.



If we cannot protect our intellectual property rights, or
    if we infringe or misappropriate the proprietary rights of
    others, our operating results could be harmed.

Our success depends on our ability to obtain and enforce patents
on our technology and to protect our trade secrets. Our patents
may not provide complete protection, and competitors may develop
similar products that are not covered by our patents. Our
patents may also be challenged by third parties and invalidated
or narrowed. Although we take measures to protect confidential
information, improper use or disclosure of our trade secrets may
still occur.

We may be sued for infringing on the intellectual property
rights of others. The cost of any litigation could affect our
profitability regardless of the outcome, and management
attention could be diverted. If we are unsuccessful in such
litigation, we may have to pay damages, stop the infringing
activity and/or obtain a license. If we fail to obtain a
required license, we may be unable to sell some of our products,
which could result in a decline in our revenues.

Departures of key employees could impair our
    operations.

We have employment contracts with each of our key employees. In
addition, our key employees own shares of our common stock
and/or have options to purchase additional shares. Nevertheless,
such individuals could leave the Company. If any key employees
stopped working for us, our operations could be harmed. We have
no key man life insurance policies with respect to any of our
senior executives.

We may be adversely affected by environmental laws and
    regulations.

We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations,
including those relating to:

We incur capital and operating expenditures in complying with
environmental laws and regulations both in the U.S. and abroad.
We are currently involved in, or have potential liability with
respect to, the remediation of past contamination in facilities
both in the U.S. and abroad. In addition, some of these
facilities have or had been in operation for many decades and
may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes
that are hazardous or may be considered hazardous in the future.
These sites and disposal sites owned by others to which we sent
waste may in the future be identified as contaminated and
require remediation. Accordingly, it is possible that we could
become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the
future that may harm our results of operations or financial
condition.

We may be adversely affected by failure to comply with
    regulations of governmental agencies.

Our products are subject to regulation by governmental agencies.
These regulations govern a wide variety of activities relating
to our products, from design and development, to labeling,
manufacturing, promotion, sales and distribution. If we fail to
comply with these regulations, we may have to recall products
and cease their manufacture and distribution. In addition, we
could be subject to fines or criminal prosecution.

We may experience impairments of goodwill or other
    intangible assets.

Starting in 2002, our goodwill amortization charges have ceased.
As at December 31, 2004, our consolidated balance sheet
included goodwill of $433.7 million and other intangible
assets of $126.5 million.

Our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other
intangible assets, which affect the amount of future period
amortization expense and possible impairment expense that we
will incur. The determination of the value of such intangible
assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect our consolidated financial statements.

In accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets” (“SFAS 142”), our
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not
amortized, but are evaluated for impairment annually in the
fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in
circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired. The
evaluation is



based on valuation models that estimate fair value based on
expected future cash flows and profitability projections. In
preparing the valuation models we consider a number of factors,
including operating results, business plans, economic
conditions, future cash flows, and transactions and market place
data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors
and our judgment in applying them to the impairment analyses.
The significant estimates and assumptions within our fair value
models include sales growth, controllable cost growth, perpetual
growth, effective tax rates and discount rates. Our assessments
to date have indicated that there has been no impairment of
these assets.

Our drug discovery reporting unit is sensitive to changes in
biopharma capital spending. We currently estimate the fair value
of the Company’s drug discovery reporting unit exceeds its
carrying value of $34.2 million as of December 31,
2004. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS 142, the
Company monitors the fair value of this reporting unit closely
to determine if the business plans are being achieved. For
example, we monitor whether the forecasted benefits of our drug
discovery cost reduction programs are being realized.

The Company’s intangible assets include a
$19.9 million indefinite life intangible asset relating to
an intellectual property license. This license is currently
subject to litigation with the grantor. While the Company
believes its rights under the license will be upheld, if they
were not to be upheld, expected cash flows generated by the
license would be reduced and the related $19.9 million
asset could be impaired, causing a non-cash charge of up to
$14 million after tax. Management does not believe this
outcome or any other consequences of the case will have a
material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated
financial condition or results of operations.

Should any of these estimates or assumptions in the preceding
paragraphs not be accurate, or should we incur lower than
expected operating performance or cash flows, we may experience
a triggering event that requires a new fair value assessment for
our reporting units, possibly prior to the required annual
assessment. These types of events and resulting analysis could
result in impairment charges for goodwill and other
indefinite-lived intangible assets if the fair value estimate
declines below the carrying value.

Our amortization expense related to intangible assets with
finite lives may materially change should our estimates of their
useful lives change.

Unanticipated changes in our tax rates or exposure to
    additional income tax liabilities could impact our
    profitability.

We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and
various other foreign jurisdictions, and our domestic and
international tax liabilities are subject to allocation of
expenses among different jurisdictions. Our effective tax rates
could be adversely affected by:

In particular, the carrying value of deferred tax assets, which
are predominantly in the U.S., is dependent upon our ability to
generate future taxable income in the U.S. In addition, the
amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in
various jurisdictions and a material assessment by a governing
tax authority could affect our profitability.

Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion and analysis of our financial
condition and results of operations should be read together with
our audited consolidated financial statements.

Overview

We operate a global business, with sales that are diversified by
geographic region, product range and customer. We hold leading
positions worldwide in many of our markets and attribute this
leadership to several factors, including the strength of our
brand name and reputation, our comprehensive offering of
innovative instruments and solutions, and the breadth and
quality of our global sales and service network.

Net sales in U.S. dollars increased by 8% and 7% in 2004
and 2003, respectively, of which 5% and 7% was due to currency
exchange rate fluctuations. We have continued to face a
challenging world economy in 2004 with conditions generally
strong in Asia and stabilizing to improving in the United States
and Europe.

Looking forward to 2005, we anticipate overall customer spending
patterns to be similar to 2004 with certain differences based on
geographic regions. In Asia we expect continued growth, but at a
slower level than 2004. Specifically, we believe growth in China
will be less than the 21% growth we experienced in 2004. In the
U.S. we expect to see similar customer spending levels to
what we saw in 2004 and in Europe we expect some improvement
from the relatively weak levels of recent years.

In respect of our end user markets, we experienced improved
results during 2004 in our laboratory-related end user markets,
such as pharmaceutical and biotech customers. We believe that
the long-term fundamentals of this market are attractive and our
solutions assist these companies in enhancing their productivity
as they meet the challenges of new drug approval activity,
heightened price regulation and industry consolidation.

In our industrial markets, the principal growth driver in recent
years has been increased investment in China related to
production capacity. Although this provides a significant
opportunity for our Chinese operations, this manufacturing shift
has a negative impact on certain of our industrial end user
markets in the U.S. and Europe. Food producers and packagers
also remain a large part of our industrial customer base. In
recent years, we have benefited from these companies’
efforts to improve product quality and safety. However, this
sector is experiencing high levels of competitive pressure which
may negatively impact customer spending levels.

In our retail end markets, we experienced improved results in
both the U.S. and Europe relative to weak activity in recent
years. Traditionally the spending levels in this sector have
experienced more volatility than our other customer sectors.
Increased spending in the past has come from events such as Y2K
and the introduction of the euro currency. We have not
experienced similar triggering events in recent years. Similar
to our industrial business, China is also an important driver of
growth as the expansion of their local economy is creating a
significant number of new retail stores each year.

In 2005, we expect to continue to pursue the overall business
growth strategies which we have followed in recent years:

Gaining Market Share.

We launched a global sales and
marketing initiative during 2004. We aim to accelerate our sales
growth by improving the productivity and effectiveness of our
global sales and marketing processes. While this initiative is
broad based, initial efforts to improve these processes include
the implementation of more effective pricing strategies and
processes, increased activities for leads generation and further
automation of field processes. Our comprehensive service
offering also helps us further penetrate developed markets. In
addition to traditional services, we offer installation,
calibration, regulatory compliance services and remote service
support.

Expanding Emerging Markets.

We have a two-pronged
strategy in Asia: first, to capitalize on growth opportunities
in these markets and second, to leverage our low-cost
manufacturing operations in China. We have a long track record
in China, and our sales in Asia have grown at more than
10% per year in local currency since 1999. We have
broadened our product offering to the Asian markets and are
benefiting as multinational customers shift production to China.
We are shifting more of our manufacturing to China to reduce
costs, where our three facilities manufacture for the local
markets as well as for export.



Extending Our Technology Lead.

We continue to focus on
product innovation. In the last three years, we spent between
5.5% and 6.0% of net sales on research and development. We seek
to drive shorter product life cycles, as well as improve our
product offerings and their capabilities with additional
integrated technologies and software.

Maintaining Cost Leadership.

We continue to strive to
improve our margins by reducing our cost basis. During the
period following our buyout in 1996, we reduced the number of
our manufacturing facilities from 29 to 19. Shifting production
to China has been an important component of this consolidation.
We have also implemented global procurement programs over the
last several years aimed at lowering supply costs.

Pursuing Strategic Acquisitions.

While we have not
completed a significant acquisition since 2001, acquisitions
remain part of our growth strategy. We seek to pursue
acquisitions that may leverage our global sales and service
network, respected brand, extensive distribution channels and
technological leadership. We have identified life sciences,
packaging and process analytics as three key areas for
acquisitions.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

We supplement our U.S. GAAP results with non-GAAP financial
measures. The principal non-GAAP financial measure we use is
Adjusted Operating Income, which we define as gross profit less
research and development, selling, general and administrative
expenses and restructuring charges, before amortization,
interest, other charges and taxes. The most directly comparable
U.S. GAAP financial measure is net earnings.

We believe that Adjusted Operating Income is important
supplemental information for investors. Adjusted Operating
Income is used internally as the principal profit measurement by
our segments in their reporting to management. We use this
measure because it excludes amortization, interest, other
charges and taxes, which are not allocated to the segments.

On a consolidated basis, we also believe Adjusted Operating
Income is an important supplemental method of measuring
profitability. It is used internally by senior management for
measuring profitability, setting performance targets for
managers and has historically been used as one of the means of
publicly providing guidance on possible future results. We also
believe that Adjusted Operating Income is an important
performance measure because it provides a measure of
comparability to other companies with different capital or legal
structures, which accordingly may be subject to disparate
interest rates and effective tax rates, and to companies which
may incur different amortization expenses or impairment charges
related to intangible assets.

Adjusted Operating Income is used in addition to and in
conjunction with results presented in accordance with
U.S. GAAP. Adjusted Operating Income is not intended to
represent operating income under U.S. GAAP and should not
be considered as an alternative to net earnings as an indicator
of our performance because of the following limitations.

Limitations of our non-GAAP measure, Adjusted Operating
    Income

Our non-GAAP measure, Adjusted Operating Income, has certain
material limitations as follows:

•

It does not include interest expense. Because we have borrowed
    money to finance some of our operations, interest is a necessary
    and ongoing part of our costs and has assisted us in generating
    revenue. Therefore any measure that excludes interest expense
    has material limitations;

•

It does not include taxes. Because payment of taxes is a
    necessary and ongoing part of our operations, any measure that
    excludes taxes has material limitations; and

•

It excludes amortization expense and other charges. Because
    these items are recurring, any measure that excludes them has
    material limitations.

Adjusted Operating Income should not be relied upon to the
exclusion of U.S. GAAP financial measures, but reflects an
additional measure of comparability and means of viewing aspects
of our operations that, when viewed together with our
U.S. GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliation to
net earnings, provides a more complete understanding of factors
and trends affecting our business.



Because Adjusted Operating Income is not standardized, it may
not be possible to compare with other companies’ non-GAAP
financial measures having the same or a similar name. We
strongly encourage investors to review our financial statements
and publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on
any single financial measure.

Our Adjusted Operating Income increased from $136.5 million
in 2002 to $179.4 million in 2004. This performance was
achieved while we continued to invest in product development and
in our distribution and manufacturing infrastructure. Adjusted
Operating Income includes restructuring charges of
$28.7 million in 2002. This charge is described more fully
below. A reconciliation of Adjusted Operating Income to net
earnings for 2002 to 2004 is included in “Results of
Operations” below.

Restructuring Activities

As further described in Note 14 to our audited consolidated
financial statements, during the three months ended
June 30, 2002 we recorded a restructuring charge of
$28.7 million ($20.1 million after tax) which
comprised severance, asset write-downs and other exit costs,
primarily related to headcount reductions and manufacturing
transfers. As a result of these actions, we eliminated
approximately $18 million of costs from the business. We
estimate that approximately $6 million of these savings
were realized in 2002, $8 million in 2003, and
$4 million in 2004.

In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the charge taken in the
second quarter of 2002 related to the exit of our French
manufacturing facility was limited to the minimum contractual
payment required by French law. During the three months ended
March 31, 2003, we recorded a restructuring charge of
$5.4 million ($3.8 million after tax), related to the
final union settlement on the closure of this facility. This
charge comprised the additional employee-related costs resulting
from final settlement of the social plan negotiated with the
French workers’ council during the first quarter of 2003.

We assess our accrual for restructuring activities on an ongoing
basis. During the three months ended September 30, 2003, we
recorded a reduction in the restructuring accrual of
$1.0 million, included within Other charges (income), net,
as a result of lower employee-related charges than originally
anticipated. Also, a restructuring charge of $1.4 million
was recorded during the three months ended September 30,
2003, related to an extension of manufacturing consolidation
activities. This charge comprised severance of
$1.0 million, included within Other charges (income), net,
and inventory write-downs of $0.4 million, included within
Cost of sales.

At December 31, 2003, we had substantially completed the
restructuring programs described above.

    Operating Income is defined as gross profit less research and
    development, selling, general and administrative expenses and
    restructuring charges, before amortization, interest expense and
    other charges. Restructuring charges that have been included are
    the costs set forth in Note (b) below.

(b)

Other charges, net consists primarily of charges related to
    our restructuring programs, interest income, (gains) losses
    from foreign currency transactions, (gains) losses from
    sales of assets and other items. The 2003 and 2002 amounts
    include restructuring charges of $5,444 and $28,661
    respectively, related primarily to headcount reductions and
    manufacturing transfers.

Results of Operations – Consolidated

Net sales

Net sales were $1,404.5 million for the year ended
December 31, 2004, compared to $1,304.4 million in
2003 and $1,213.7 million in 2002. This represents
increases in U.S. dollars of 8% and 7% in 2004 and 2003,
respectively, of which 5% and 7% was due to currency exchange
rate fluctuations.

In 2004, our net sales by geographic destination in
U.S. dollars increased by 2% in the Americas, 9% in Europe
and 19% in Asia/ Rest of World, of which 9% and 4% in Europe and
Asia/ Rest of World, respectively, was due to currency exchange
rate fluctuations. A discussion of sales by operating segment is
included below.

As described in Note 16 to our consolidated financial
statements, our net sales comprise product sales of precision
instruments and related services. Service revenues are primarily
derived from regulatory compliance qualification, calibration,
certification and repair services, much of which is provided
under contracts, as well as sales of spare parts.

Net sales of products increased in U.S. dollars by 7% and
6% in 2004 and 2003, respectively, of which 5% and 7% was due to
currency exchange rate fluctuations. Service revenue (including
spare parts) increased in U.S. dollars by 11% and 12% in
2004 and 2003, respectively, of which 5% and 9% was due to
currency exchange rate fluctuations.

Excluding the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations, net
sales for our laboratory-related products increased 4% during
2004. This includes growth in each major product category,
particularly process analytics. Our sales growth of
laboratory-related products was also reduced by approximately 2%
during 2004 due to the phase-out of our exit of third party
electronic component sales. Excluding the effect of currency
exchange rate fluctuations, net sales for our laboratory-related
products decreased 1% during 2003, primarily due to a decrease
in drug discovery products as a result of weakness in customer
spending.

Net sales of our industrial-related products increased 1% in
2004 excluding the effect of currency exchange rate
fluctuations. We experienced sales growth in our core industrial
and packaging products, offset by a decrease in sales of
transportation and logistics products relative to strong project
activity in 2003. While the long-term fundamentals of the market
for our transportation and logistics products are strong, the
timing of projects can impact the year-over-year comparison
significantly. Excluding the effect of currency exchange rate
fluctuations, net sales of industrial-related products increased
5% during 2003.



In our food retailing markets, net sales excluding the effect of
currency exchange rate fluctuations increased 8% in 2004 over
the previous year, as customer spending patterns in the U.S. and
Europe continue to improve relative to weak activity last year.
Retail sales growth also includes improved sales of our in-store
retail item management software solutions and expansion of our
core retail products into Asia. Net sales in food retailing
decreased 6% in 2003 excluding the effect of currency exchange
rate fluctuations. This decrease was principally due to
difficult comparisons relating to strong U.S. project
activity in 2002, as well as suppressed spending patterns in
Europe after the significant euro conversion-related investments
by customers in previous years and weak consumer confidence in
major European economies.

Gross profit

Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 48.6% for 2004,
compared to 47.4% for 2003 and 46.8% for 2002. Improvements in
the margin over the two-year-period reflect the benefits of our
cost rationalization and product transfer initiatives, partially
offset by adverse currency impacts.

Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for products was 52.3%
for 2004, compared to 50.9% for 2003 and 50.8% for 2002. These
improvements also reflect the benefits of our cost
rationalization and product transfer initiatives, offset by
adverse currency impacts.

Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for services
(including spare parts) was 36.1% for 2004, compared to 35.1%
for 2003 and 32.0% for 2002. The increase in the margin over the
two years reflects improved productivity, as well as the
expansion of higher margin regulatory compliance service sales.

Research and development and selling, general and
    administrative expenses

Research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales
were 5.9% for 2004, compared to 6.0% for 2003 and 5.8% in 2002.
Research and development expenses increased in U.S. dollars
by 7% in 2004 and 10% in 2003, of which 6% and 8% was due to
currency exchange rate fluctuations. The increases in 2004 and
2003 are principally due to investments in our new laboratory
and other products.

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of
net sales increased to 29.9% for 2004, compared to 28.6% for
2003 and 27.4% for 2002. Selling, general and administrative
expenses increased in U.S. dollars by 13% in 2004 and 12%
in 2003, of which 5% and 8% was due to currency exchange rate
fluctuations. During 2004 we incurred $5.0 million related
to an investigation into allegations made by an employee with
respect to the Company and various company processes. Our
spending also includes a significant increase in Sarbanes Oxley
regulatory compliance costs, including approximately
$3.5 million of external professional fees during 2004. The
increases in 2004 and 2003 also include spending related to our
new product introductions as well as higher performance related
compensation during 2004.

Other charges (income), net

Other charges (income), net were $0.1 million in 2004,
compared to $4.6 million in 2003 and $28.2 million in
2002. The 2003 and 2002 amounts include restructuring charges of
$5.4 million ($3.8 million after tax) and
$28.7 million ($20.1 million after tax), respectively,
comprising severance, asset write-downs and other exit costs
primarily related to headcount reductions and manufacturing
transfers, described more fully in “Restructuring
Activities” above.

Interest expense and taxes

Interest expense was $12.9 million for 2004, compared to
$14.2 million for 2003 and $17.2 million for 2002. The
decreases are principally due to lower average borrowings.

The provision for taxes is based upon our effective tax rate for
the related periods, which was 30% for 2004 and 2003 and 9% for
2002. During the three months ended June 30, 2002 we
recorded a one-time tax gain of $23.1 million related to
the completion of a tax reorganization program and related tax
audits, which contributed to an overall lower effective tax rate
in 2002.



During the fourth quarter of 2002, we began a program of
repatriating foreign subsidiary earnings to the United States in
a tax efficient manner. This program resulted in a repatriation
of foreign earnings of $85 million during 2002,
$100 million during 2003 and a further $5 million in
2004. In addition, this program will result in the repatriation
of $75 million of foreign earnings over the next few years.
The 2002 repatriation of $85 million created additional
U.S. taxable income resulting in the utilization of certain
historical tax attributes related to our U.S. operations
and release of the related U.S. federal deferred tax
valuation allowance. The tax effects related to the future
repatriation of $75 million have been accrued.

The Company is currently under examination in various taxing
jurisdictions in which it conducts business operations. While
the Company has not yet received any material assessments from
these taxing authorities, the Company believes that adequate
amounts of taxes and related interest and penalties have been
provided for any adverse adjustments as a result of these
examinations and that the ultimate outcome of these examinations
will not result in an adverse material impact on the
Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial
position.

Earnings before taxes and net earnings

Earnings before taxes were $154.2 million for 2004,
compared to $136.9 million in 2003 and $110.4 million
in 2002. Net earnings were $108.0 million for 2004,
compared to $95.8 million in 2003 and $100.4 million
in 2002.

The 2004 results include $5.0 million ($3.5 million
after tax) related to the previously mentioned investigation and
$3.5 million ($2.5 million after tax) of external
professional fees related to Sarbanes Oxley regulatory
compliance costs.

These results also include the restructuring charge of
$5.4 million ($3.8 million after tax) in 2003 and the
restructuring charge of $28.7 million ($20.1 million
after tax) and one-time tax gain of $23.1 million in 2002.

Supplemental data: Adjusted Operating Income

See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” above. Adjusted
Operating Income (gross profit less research and development,
selling, general and administrative expenses and restructuring
charges, before amortization, interest expense and other
charges) increased to $179.4 million or 12.8% of net sales
for 2004, compared to $161.9 million or 12.4% of net sales
in 2003 and $136.5 million or 11.2% of net sales in 2002.
Adjusted Operating Income includes restructuring charges of
$5.4 million in 2003 and $28.7 million in 2002.

Adjusted Operating Income increased in 2004 and 2003 as a result
of our increased sales volume, benefits of our cost
rationalization and product transfer initiatives and a decrease
in restructuring charges recorded in 2003 and 2002. These
benefits were offset in part by higher research and development
costs and selling costs principally related to new products, as
well as the previously mentioned costs in 2004 associated with
the investigation and external professional fees related to
Sarbanes Oxley regulatory compliance.

Results of Operations – by Operating Segment

The following is a discussion of the financial results of our
operating segments. We currently have six reportable segments:
Principal U.S. Operations, Other Western European
Operations, Principal Central European Operations, Swiss R&D
and Manufacturing Operations, Asia and Other. A more detailed
description of these segments is outlined in Note 16 to our
consolidated financial statements.

Net sales to external customers in our Principal
U.S. Operations segment increased 4% in 2004, compared to a
decrease of 3% in 2003. Our Principal U.S. Operations
segment benefited from improved market conditions in 2004, as
well as new product introductions. The 2004 increase in net
sales to external customers reflects growth in most products,
particularly our food retailing end markets.

The net sales growth in our food retail business was primarily
due to improved results relative to weak project activity in
2003. Our U.S. food retail sales growth also includes
improved sales of our in-store retail item management software
solutions. Net sales to external customers of our
laboratory-related products increased during 2004 due to solid
performance of our process analytics end market and growth in
our liquid handling products. We also experienced increased net
sales of industrial related products during 2004 primarily due
to improved results in most product lines, offset in part by a
decrease of approximately $5.8 million in industrial OEM
product sales. Net sales to external customers in our Principal
U.S. Operations segment also benefited by approximately 1%
from business transfers from our Other segment.

The decrease in 2003 sales of our Principal U.S. Operations
was primarily the result of a decline in laboratory customer
spending, as well as a decrease in our retail business due to
relative strong 2002 project activity.

The decrease in segment profit or Adjusted Operating Income of
our Principal U.S. Operations segment during 2004 reflects
the impact of our product transfer initiatives on this segment,
as well as additional costs related to product launches, a North
American sales meeting held once every five years, increased
employee healthcare costs and an impairment charge relating to a
building held for sale of $1.3 million during 2004
pertaining to this segment.

The increase in 2003 segment profit or Adjusted Operating Income
is due primarily to the restructuring charge recorded in 2002,
of which $11.8 million relates to this segment. Adjusted
Operating Income in 2003 was also impacted by the reduced sales
volume.

Currency exchange rate fluctuations increased net sales growth
to external customers of our Other Western European Operations
segment by 10% and 17% in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Local
currency net sales to external customers of our Other Western
European Operations segment increased 1% in 2004, compared to a
decrease of 1% in 2003.

Western Europe benefited from improved market conditions in most
countries during 2004, as well as new product introductions. Our
2004 local currency net sales to external customers in our Other
Western European Operations segment primarily reflects growth in
our laboratory-related products and our food retailing end
markets. These trends were partially offset by a decline in our
industrial-related products, which includes a decrease in
transportation and logistics products relative to strong 2003
project activity.

Sales trends in 2003 were particularly notable in the major
Western European economies, which faced low consumer confidence.
Our local currency sales decline in 2003 was also the result of
the declines in our laboratory and retail end markets, partially
offset by solid results for packaging and transportation and
logistics products. The



decline in sales of our European retail end markets in 2003 was
partly due to the significant euro conversion related
investments by customers in 2001.

Segment profit or Adjusted Operating Income increased
$6.1 million in our Other Western European Operations
segment during 2004, compared to an increase of
$14.8 million in 2003. These increases are principally the
result of reduced restructuring charges, as well as benefits of
our cost rationalization and product transfer initiatives and
favorable currency translation fluctuations. Restructuring
charges had the effect of reducing Adjusted Operating Income of
our Other Western European Operations segment by
$4.4 million and $11.4 million in 2003 and 2002,
respectively. In addition, this segment benefited in 2004 due to
a $1.1 million reduction of our restructuring related
accruals as a result of lower employee related charges than
originally anticipated.

Operations segment by 9% and 18% in 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Local currency net sales to external customers of our Principal
Central European Operations segment increased 1% in 2004,
compared to a decrease of 4% in 2003.

Similar to our Other Western European Operations segment,
Central Europe benefited from improved market conditions in most
countries during 2004, as well as new product introductions. Our
2004 local currency net sales to external customers in our
Principal Central European segment primarily reflects growth in
our laboratory-related products and our food retailing end
markets. These trends were partially offset by a decline in our
industrial-related products, which includes a decrease in
transportation and logistics products relative to strong 2003
project activity.

Sales trends in 2003 were particularly notable in the major
Central European economies, which faced low consumer confidence.
Our local currency sales decline in 2003 was also the result of
the declines in our laboratory and retail end markets, partially
offset by solid results for packaging and transportation and
logistics products. The decline in sales of our European retail
end markets in 2003 was partly due to the significant euro
conversion related investments by customers in 2001.

Segment profit or Adjusted Operating Income increased
$2.2 million in our Principal Central European Operations
segment during 2004, compared to an increase of
$7.1 million in 2003. The 2004 increase is primarily the
result of improved sales volume and favorable currency
translation fluctuations. The 2003 increase is principally the
result of reduced restructuring charges, as well as benefits of
our cost rationalization and product transfer initiatives and
favorable currency translation fluctuations. Restructuring
charges had the effect of reducing Adjusted Operating Income of
our Principal Central European Operations segment by
$2.8 million in 2002.

Operations segment by 7% and 14% in 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Local currency net sales to external customers of our Swiss
R&D and Manufacturing Operations segment decreased 12% in
2004 and 13% in 2003. This decrease is primarily due to the exit
of our third party electronic component product line, which had
the



effect of reducing net sales growth to external customers in
this segment by approximately 22% during 2004. Excluding the
effect of the exit of our third party electronic component
product line, net sales to external customers increased
approximately 10% in local currency, primarily due to the
benefit of business transfers from our Other segment, as well as
increased sales of laboratory balances and analytical
instruments.

Segment profit or Adjusted Operating Income increased
$4.1 million in our Swiss R&D and Manufacturing
Operations segment during 2004, compared to a decrease of
$7.2 million in 2003. The increase in 2004 is principally
the result of increased sales to other segments of
laboratory-related products, benefits of our cost
rationalization initiatives and favorable currency translation
fluctuations.

Currency exchange rate fluctuations had the effect of increasing
our Asian segment net sales growth to external customers by 2%
and 3% in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Local currency net sales
to external customers in our Asian segment increased 19% and 21%
in 2004 and 2003, respectively.

The 2004 increase in local currency net sales to external
customers in Asia reflects 21% growth in China and 9% growth in
Japan. These results compare to a 2003 increase of 40% in China
and a decrease of 8% in Japan. We have continued to experience
solid sales growth in China based upon the expansion of their
economy, as well as returns on investments in our Chinese
business including the addition of a new manufacturing facility
in 2003. Despite this significant sales growth, our Chinese net
sales growth to external customers slowed during the fourth
quarter of 2004 due to exceptional project activity in the prior
year comparable period. In addition, we believe our Chinese
customer spending patterns may be reduced as a result of the
Chinese government’s efforts to slow the Chinese economy.

Segment profit or Adjusted Operating Income increased
$11.7 million in Asia during 2004, compared to an increase
of $8.6 million in 2003. These increases were primarily due
to the increased sales volume to external customers and other
segments, and the benefits of product transfer initiatives from
our other segments.

Net sales in local currencies to external customers in our Other
operating segment was flat in 2004, compared to an increase of
3% in 2003. These results reflect sales growth in geographies
such as Russia, Eastern Europe and Mexico. In addition, our net
sales to external customers in this segment were reduced by
approximately 5% due to business transfers to our Principal
U.S. Operations and Swiss Manufacturing and R&D
Operations segments.

Segment profit or Adjusted Operating Income increased
$9.3 million in 2004, compared to an increase of
$5.0 million in 2003. The 2004 increase is primarily due to
favorable currency translation fluctuations, the benefits of our
cost rationalization programs as well as certain product
transfers. The 2003 increase was due to the impact of
restructuring charges in the prior year and improved sales
volume. In addition, 2002 was also negatively affected by the
economic downturn in Latin America.



Liquidity and Capital Resources

Liquidity is our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from
operating activities to meet our obligations and commitments. In
addition, liquidity includes the ability to obtain appropriate
financing. Currently, our liquidity needs arise primarily from
working capital requirements, capital expenditures and
acquisitions.

Cash provided by operating activities totaled
$166.0 million in 2004, compared to $117.2 million in
2003 and $115.4 million in 2002. The increase in 2004
resulted principally from increased net earnings and improved
management of operating assets and liabilities. Cash provided by
operating activities in 2004 was impacted by voluntary
incremental pension contributions of $10.0 million to our
U.S. pension plan. The increase in 2003 cash provided by
operating activities also resulted principally from improved
management of operating assets and liabilities, partially offset
by higher restructuring and tax payments. Cash provided by
operating activities in 2003 reflected voluntary incremental
pension contributions of $10.0 million to the
U.S. pension plan and $7.1 million to our U.K. pension
plan. Cash provided by operating activities in 2002 includes a
voluntary contribution of $19.0 million to the
U.S. pension plan. Similar to previous years, we expect to
make normal employer pension contributions of $14.7 million
in 2005. Cash provided by operating activities also includes
payments for restructuring and related activities in 2004, 2003
and 2002 of $4.0 million, $16.8 million and
$11.1 million, respectively.

During 2004, we spent approximately $2.3 million on
acquisitions, including additional consideration related to
earn-out periods associated with acquisitions consummated in
prior years. The cash portions of these purchases were funded
from cash generated from operations. We continue to explore
potential acquisitions. In connection with any acquisition, we
may incur additional indebtedness. In addition, the terms of
certain of our acquisitions provide for possible additional
earn-out payments. However, we do not currently believe we will
make any material payments relating to such earn-outs.

Capital expenditures are a significant use of funds and are made
primarily for machinery, equipment and the purchase and
expansion of facilities. Our capital expenditures totaled
$27.9 million in 2004, $27.2 million in 2003 and
$33.2 million in 2002. We expect capital expenditures to
increase as our business grows, and to fluctuate as currency
exchange rates change.

November 2003 refinancing

On November 12, 2003, we closed a new five-year
$300 million credit facility and completed the issuance of
$150 million seven-year Senior Notes. The proceeds from
this refinancing were immediately used to repay all of the
borrowings under our former credit agreement, which was then
terminated.

Credit Facility Agreement

The $300 million credit facility is provided by a group of
financial institutions and has a bullet maturity in November
2008. It is not subject to any scheduled principal payments.
Borrowings under the $300 million credit facility bear
interest at current market rates plus a margin based on our
senior unsecured credit ratings (currently “BBB” by
Standard & Poor’s and “Baa3” by
Moody’s), and is currently set at LIBOR plus 0.6%. We must
also pay utilization and facility fees that are tied to our
credit ratings. The $300 million credit facility contains
covenants including maintaining a ratio of debt to earnings
before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of less than
3.25 to 1.0 and an interest coverage ratio of more than 3.5 to
1.0. The facility also places certain limitations on us,
including limiting the ability to grant liens or incur debt at a
subsidiary level. In addition, the $300 million credit
facility has several events of default including upon a change
of control. The credit facility is unsecured.

Senior Notes

In November 2003, we issued $150 million of 4.85% unsecured
Senior Notes due November 15, 2010. The Senior Notes rank
equally with all our unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.
Interest is payable semi-annually in May and November. Discount
and issuance costs approximated $1.2 million and are being
amortized to interest expense over the seven-year term of the
Senior Notes.



At our option, the Senior Notes may be redeemed in whole or in
part at any time at a redemption price equal to the greater of:

•

The principal amount of the Senior Notes; or

•

The sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled
    payments of principal and interest thereon discounted to the
    redemption date on a semi-annual basis at a comparable treasury
    rate plus a margin of 0.20%.

The Senior Notes contain limitations on our ability to incur
liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions exceeding
10% of our consolidated net worth.

At December 31, 2004, our consolidated debt, net of cash of
$67.2 million, was $136.0 million. In addition to the
Senior Notes, we had borrowings of $46.1 million under our
credit facility and $6.9 million under various other local
arrangements. Also at December 31, 2004, we had
$244.6 million of availability remaining under the credit
facility.

At December 31, 2004, approximately $27.6 million of
the borrowings under the credit facility and local working
capital facilities were denominated in U.S. dollars. The
balance of the borrowings under the credit facility and local
working capital facilities were denominated in certain of our
other principal trading currencies amounting to approximately
$25.4 million. Changes in exchange rates between the
currencies in which we generate cash flow and the currencies in
which our borrowings are denominated affect our liquidity. In
addition, because we borrow in a variety of currencies, our debt
balances fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates.

At December 31, 2004, we were in compliance with all
covenants set forth in our credit facility and Senior Notes
agreements. In addition, we do not have any downgrade triggers
relating to ratings from rating agencies that would accelerate
the maturity dates of our debt.

We currently believe that cash flow from operating activities,
together with liquidity available under our credit facility and
local working capital facilities, will be sufficient to fund
currently anticipated working capital needs and capital spending
requirements for at least the next several years.

Contractual obligations

The following summarizes certain of our contractual obligations
at December 31, 2004 and the effect such obligations are
expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future
periods. We do not have significant outstanding letters of
credit or other financial commitments.

We have purchase commitments for materials, supplies, services
and fixed assets in the normal course of business. Due to the
proprietary nature of many of our materials and processes,
certain supply contracts contain penalty provisions. We do not
expect potential payments under these provisions to materially
affect results of operations or financial condition. This
conclusion is based upon reasonably likely outcomes derived by
reference to historical experience and current business plans.



Share repurchase program

On February 5, 2004, we announced a share repurchase
program, commencing with an initial buyback of up to
$100 million over the two-year period ending
December 31, 2005. In November 2004, in addition to the
$100 million buyback amount the Company’s Board of
Directors approved an additional buyback of up to
$200 million under its share repurchase program over the
two-year period ending December 31, 2006. Our share
repurchases are expected to be funded from cash generated from
operating activities. Repurchases will be made through open
market transactions, and the timing will depend on the level of
acquisition activity, business and market conditions, the stock
price, trading restrictions and other factors.

During the year ending December 31, 2004, we spent
$103.8 million on the repurchase of 2,208,500 shares
at an average price of $46.97.

As of December 31, 2004, approximately 1.0 million
stock options were outstanding that are scheduled to expire in
October 2006. These options were granted before the
Company’s initial public offering in connection with the
buy-out from Ciba-Geigy. The Company expects that these options
will be exercised before their expiration date. Any purchases
under the share repurchase program over this time would operate
to offset the dilution from these exercises.

Investigation

At the April 2004 Audit Committee meeting, management informed
the committee that the Company had received allegations from an
employee. As a matter of good corporate governance, management
recommended, and the Audit Committee agreed, to conduct an
independent investigation of the allegations. The allegations
covered a number of accounting, disclosure and non-financial
statement-related items.

The Audit Committee retained independent outside counsel and
forensic accountants to conduct an investigation of these
matters, as well as certain other areas directly or indirectly
related to the Company’s preparation of its financial
statements.

In August 2004, the Company announced the completion of the
financial aspects of the investigation and that the Audit
Committee and Board of Directors concluded there would be no
change to the Company’s financial statements. Based on the
investigation, the Board (based on the recommendation of the
Audit Committee) made changes to improve the leadership and
oversight of its financial operations and to reinforce the
Board’s commitment to maintaining strong corporate
governance. Mr. William Donnelly, who was Chief Financial
Officer from 1997 to mid-2002 returned from an operating job
inside the Company to the position of CFO in August 2004. The
Company has also stated that it plans additional changes to
enhance its financial organization, as well as the methods by
which complaints may be reported.

All aspects of the Audit Committee’s investigation are now
complete.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Currently, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have
or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on
our financial condition, changes in financial condition,
revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital
expenditures or capital resources that is material.

Effect of Currency on Results of Operations

Because we conduct operations in many countries, our operating
income can be significantly affected by fluctuations in currency
exchange rates. Swiss franc-denominated expenses represent a
much greater percentage of our operating expenses than Swiss
franc-denominated sales represent of our net sales. In part,
this is because most of our manufacturing costs in Switzerland
relate to products that are sold outside Switzerland. Moreover,
a substantial percentage of our research and development
expenses and general and administrative expenses are incurred in
Switzerland. Therefore, if the Swiss franc strengthens against
all or most of our major trading currencies (e.g

.

, the
U.S. dollar, the euro, other major European currencies and
the Japanese yen), our operating profit is reduced. We also have
significantly more sales in European currencies (other than the
Swiss franc) than we have expenses in



those currencies. Therefore, when European currencies weaken
against the U.S. dollar and the Swiss franc, it also
decreases our operating profits. Accordingly, the Swiss franc
exchange rate to the euro is an important cross-rate monitored
by the Company. We estimate that a 1% strengthening of the Swiss
franc against the euro would result in a decrease in our
earnings before tax of $0.9 million to $1.1 million on
an annual basis. In addition to the effects of exchange rate
movements on operating profits, our debt levels can fluctuate
due to changes in exchange rates, particularly between the
U.S. dollar and the Swiss franc. Based on our outstanding
debt at December 31, 2004, we estimate that a 10% weakening
of the U.S. dollar against the currencies in which our debt
is denominated would result in an increase of approximately
$2.8 million in the reported U.S. dollar value of the
debt.

Taxes

We are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions throughout the
world. Our effective tax rate and tax liability will be affected
by a number of factors, such as the amount of taxable income in
particular jurisdictions, the tax rates in such jurisdictions,
tax treaties between jurisdictions, the extent to which we
transfer funds between jurisdictions, earnings repatriations
between jurisdictions and changes in law. Generally, the tax
liability for each taxpayer within the group is determined
either (i) on a non-consolidated/non-combined basis or
(ii) on a consolidated/combined basis only with other
eligible entities subject to tax in the same jurisdiction, in
either case without regard to the taxable losses of
non-consolidated/non-combined affiliated legal entities. As a
result, we may pay income taxes to certain jurisdictions even
though on an overall basis we incur a net loss for the period.

Our effective tax rates for the years ended December 31,
2004, 2003 and 2002 were approximately 30%, 30% and 9%,
respectively, as described in “Results of
Operations — Consolidated — Interest expense
and taxes”.

Environmental Matters

We are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the
jurisdictions in which we operate. We own or lease a number of
properties and manufacturing facilities around the world. Like
many of our competitors, we have incurred, and will continue to
incur, capital and operating expenditures and other costs in
complying with such laws and regulations in both the United
States and abroad.

We are currently involved in, or have potential liability with
respect to, the remediation of past contamination in certain of
our facilities in both the United States and abroad. Our
subsidiary Hi-Speed Checkweigher Co., Inc.
(“Hi-Speed”) is one of two private parties ordered to
perform certain remedial actions under an administrative consent
order that the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection (“NJDEP”) signed on June 13, 1988
with respect to certain property in Landing, New Jersey. GEI
International Corporation (“GEI”) is the other ordered
party. GEI has failed to fulfill all its obligations under the
NJDEP order, and Hi-Speed has recently entered into discussions
with the NJDEP about the next steps to be undertaken as a
result. NJDEP has agreed with Hi-Speed that the residual
contaminants can be addressed through the establishment of a
Classification Exception Area and concurrent Well Restriction
Area for the site. The NJDEP does not view these vehicles as
remedial measures, but rather as “institutional
controls” that must be adequately maintained and
periodically evaluated. The Company estimates that the costs of
compliance associated with the site will be approximately
$0.3 million over the next seven years.

In addition, certain of our present and former facilities have
or had been in operation for many decades and, over such time,
some of these facilities may have used substances or generated
and disposed of wastes which are or may be considered hazardous.
It is possible that these sites, as well as disposal sites owned
by third parties to which we have sent wastes, may in the future
be identified and become the subject of remediation.
Accordingly, although we believe that we are in substantial
compliance with applicable environmental requirements and to
date we have not incurred material expenditures in connection
with environmental matters, it is possible that we could become
subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future
that could result in a material adverse effect on our financial
condition or results of operations.

Inflation

Inflation can affect the costs of goods and services that we
use, including raw materials to manufacture our products. The
competitive environment in which we operate limits somewhat our
ability to recover higher costs through increased selling
prices. Moreover, there may be differences in inflation rates
between countries in which we



incur the major portion of our costs and other countries in
which we sell products, which may limit our ability to recover
increased costs. We remain committed to operations in China and
Eastern Europe, which have experienced inflationary conditions.
To date, inflationary conditions have not had a material effect
on our operating results. However, as our presence in China and
Eastern Europe increases, these inflationary conditions could
have a greater impact on our operating results.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

We have only limited involvement with derivative financial
instruments and do not use them for trading purposes.

We have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to
economically hedge short-term intercompany balances with our
international businesses and a portion of our Swiss franc/ euro
exposure on a monthly basis. Such contracts limit our exposure
to both favorable and unfavorable currency fluctuations. A
sensitivity analysis to changes in the U.S. dollar and
Swiss franc on these foreign currency-denominated contracts
indicates that if the U.S. dollar and Swiss franc uniformly
worsened by 10% against all of our currency exposures, the fair
value of these instruments would decrease by $5.6 million
at December 31, 2004, as compared with $4.5 million at
December 31, 2003. Any resulting changes in fair value
would be offset by changes in the underlying hedged balance
sheet position. The sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel
shift in foreign currency exchange rates. The assumption that
exchange rates change in parallel fashion may overstate the
impact of changing exchange rates on assets and liabilities
denominated in a foreign currency. We also have other currency
risks as described under “Effect of Currency on Results of
Operations”.

We have entered into certain interest rate swap agreements.
These contracts are more fully described in Note 5 to our
audited consolidated financial statements. The market value of
these contracts at both December 31, 2004 and 2003 was
$0.4 million. Based on our agreements outstanding at
December 31, 2004, a 100-basis-point increase in interest
rates would result in a decrease in the net aggregate market
value of these instruments of $1.6 million, as compared
with a decrease of $1.9 million at December 31, 2003.
Conversely, a 100-basis-point decrease in interest rates would
result in a $1.7 million increase in the net aggregate
market value of these instruments, as compared with a net
increase of $1.9 million at December 31, 2003. Any
change in fair value would not affect our consolidated statement
of operations unless such agreements and the debt they hedge
were prematurely settled.

Critical Accounting Policies

Management’s discussion and analysis of our financial
condition and results of operations is based upon our audited
consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in
accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these
financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments
that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our
estimates, including those related to pensions and other
post-retirement benefits, inventories, intangible assets, income
taxes, revenue and warranty costs. We base our estimates on
historical experience and on various other assumptions that are
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results
of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying
values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
from other sources. Actual results may differ from these
estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our
more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation
of our audited consolidated financial statements. For a detailed
discussion on the application of these and other accounting
policies, see Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial
statements.

Employee benefit plans

The net periodic pension cost for 2004 and projected benefit
obligation as of December 31, 2004 were $2.5 million
and $107.4 million, respectively, for our U.S. pension
plans, and $7.1 million and $465.3 million,
respectively, for our international pension plans. The net
periodic post-retirement cost for 2004 and projected benefit
obligation as of December 31, 2004 for our
U.S. post-retirement medical benefit plan were
$1.0 million and $26.3 million, respectively.



Pension and post-retirement benefit plan expense and obligations
are developed from assumptions in actuarial valuations. These
assumptions include the discount rate and expected return on
plan assets. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, actual results
that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized
over future periods. While management believes the assumptions
used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or
changes in assumptions may affect our plan obligations and
future expense.

The expected rates of return on the various defined benefit
pension plans’ assets are based on the asset allocation of
each plan and the long-term projected return of those assets,
which represent a diversified mix of U.S. and international
corporate equities and government and corporate debt securities.
In April 2002, we froze our U.S. defined benefit pension
plan and discontinued our retiree medical program for certain
current and all future employees. Consequently, no significant
future service costs will be incurred on these plans. For 2004,
the average return on assets assumption was 8.5% for the
U.S. plan and 5.2% for the international plans. A change in
the rate of return of 1% would impact annual benefit plan
expense by approximately $4.0 million after tax.

The discount rates for defined benefit and post-retirement plans
are set by benchmarking against high-quality corporate bonds.
For 2004, the average discount rate assumption was 5.75% for the
U.S. plans and 4.2% for the international plans,
representing a weighted average of local rates in countries
where such plans exist. A decrease in the discount rate of 1%
would impact annual benefit plan expense by approximately
$1.6 million after tax.

In 2004 and 2003, we made voluntary incremental funding payments
of $10.0 million and $17.1 million, respectively, to
reduce the underfunded status of our U.S. and U.K. pension
plans. As a result of these voluntary incremental pension
payments, we do not expect to make any significant required
pension payments during the next two years. However, if the
equity markets do not mirror expected rates of return, in the
future we could be required to make additional cash funding
payments or adjust the $46.9 million additional minimum
pension liability recorded at December 31, 2004.

The Company also has employee stock option plans which are
accounted for under the intrinsic value recognition and
measurement provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees” and related interpretations. As stock options
have been issued with exercise prices equal to the market value
of the underlying shares on the grant date, no compensation cost
has resulted. Notes 2 and 11 to the audited consolidated
financial statements provide supplemental information, including
pro forma earnings and earnings per share, as if the Company had
accounted for options based on the fair value method prescribed
by SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation.” That methodology yields an estimate of fair
value based in part on a number of management estimates,
including future volatility and estimated option lives. Changes
in these assumptions could significantly impact the estimated
fair value of stock options. See also Statement No. 123
(revised 2004) issued by the FASB in regards to “Stock
Based Compensation” in Note 2, Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies, New Accounting Pronouncements.

Inventory

As of December 31, 2004, inventories net of allowances were
$156.5 million.

We record our inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable
value. Cost, which includes direct materials, labor and
overhead, is generally determined using the first in, first out
(FIFO) method. The estimated net realizable value is based
on assumptions for future demand and related pricing. Excess and
obsolete reserves are established based on forecast usage,
orders and technological obsolescence. If actual market
conditions are less favorable than those projected by
management, reductions in the value of inventory may be required.

Goodwill and other intangible assets

As of December 31, 2004, our consolidated balance sheet
included goodwill of $433.7 million and other intangible
assets of $126.5 million.

Our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other
intangible assets, which affect the amount of future period
amortization expense and possible impairment expense that we
will incur. The determination of the value of such intangible
assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect our consolidated financial statements.



In accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets” (“SFAS 142”), our
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not
amortized, but are evaluated for impairment annually in the
fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in
circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired. The
evaluation is based on valuation models that estimate fair value
based on expected future cash flows and profitability
projections. In preparing the valuation models, we consider a
number of factors, including operating results, business plans,
economic conditions, future cash flows, and transactions and
market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to
these factors and our judgment in applying them to the
impairment analyses. The significant estimates and assumptions
within our fair value models include sales growth, controllable
cost growth, perpetual growth, effective tax rates and discount
rates. Our assessments to date have indicated that there has
been no impairment of these assets.

Our drug discovery reporting unit is sensitive to changes in
biotech and pharmaceutical capital spending. We currently
estimate the fair value of the Company’s drug discovery
reporting unit exceeds its carrying value of $34.2 million
as of December 31, 2004. In accordance with the provisions
of SFAS 142, the Company monitors the fair value of this
reporting unit closely to determine if the business plans are
being achieved. For example, we monitor whether the forecasted
benefits of our drug discovery cost reduction programs are being
realized.

The Company’s intangible assets include a
$19.9 million indefinite life intangible asset relating to
an intellectual property license. This license is currently
subject to litigation with the grantor. While the Company
believes its rights under the license will be upheld, if they
were not to be upheld, expected cash flows generated by the
license would be reduced and the related $19.9 million
asset could be impaired, causing a non-cash charge of up to
$14 million after tax. Management does not believe this
outcome or any other consequences of the case will have a
material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated
financial condition or results of operations.

Should any of these estimates or assumptions in the preceding
paragraphs not be accurate, or should we incur lower than
expected operating performance or cash flows, we may experience
a triggering event that requires a new fair value assessment for
our reporting units, possibly prior to the required annual
assessment. These types of events and resulting analysis could
result in impairment charges for goodwill and other
indefinite-lived intangible assets if the fair value estimate
declines below the carrying value.

Our amortization expense related to intangible assets with
finite lives may materially change should our estimates of their
useful lives change.

Income taxes

Income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities
reflect management’s assessment of actual future taxes to
be paid on items in the financial statements. We record a
valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the
amount that is more likely than not to be realized. While we
have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and
feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the
valuation allowance, in the event we were to determine that we
would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future
in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to the
deferred tax asset would increase income, equity or goodwill in
the period such determination was made. Likewise, should we
determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of
the net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the
deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such
determination was made.

In 2002 and 2004, provisions were made for U.S. income
taxes on certain undistributed earnings of
non-U.S. subsidiaries as a decision was made to repatriate
these earnings rather than permanently reinvest them. If we
decide to repatriate an amount of undistributed earnings in
excess of those originally planned, we could be subject to
additional income tax.

The significant assumptions and estimates described in the
preceding paragraphs are important contributors to our ultimate
effective tax rate for each year in addition to our income mix
from geographical regions. If any of our assumptions or
estimates were to change, or should our income mix from our
geographical regions change, our effective tax rate can be
materially affected. Based on pre-tax income of
$154.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2004,
each increase of $1.5 million in tax expense would increase
our effective tax rate by 1%.



Revenue recognition

Revenue is recognized when title to a product has transferred
and any significant customer obligations have been fulfilled.
Standard shipping terms are generally FOB shipping point in most
countries and, accordingly, title transfers upon shipment. In
countries where title cannot legally transfer before delivery,
we defer revenue recognition until delivery has occurred. Other
than a few small software applications, Mettler-Toledo does not
sell its software products without the related hardware
instrument as the software is embedded in the instrument. The
Company’s typical solution requires no significant
production, modification or customization of the hardware or
software that is essential to the functionality of the products.
We also generally maintain the right to accept or reject a
product return in our terms and conditions. To the extent the
Company’s solutions have a post shipment obligation, such
as customer acceptance, revenue is deferred until the obligation
has been completed. In addition, we also defer revenue where
installation is required, unless such installation is
perfunctory. Distributor discounts are offset against revenue at
the time such revenue is recognized. We also maintain accruals
for outstanding credits. Revenues from service contracts are
recognized ratably over the contract period.

Warranty

The Company generally offers one-year warranties on most of its
products. Product warranties are recorded at the time revenue is
recognized for certain product shipments. While the Company
engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, our
warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates,
material usage and service costs incurred in correcting a
product failure. If we experience claims or significant cost
changes in material, freight and vendor charges, our cost of
goods sold could be affected.

acquisitions, which involve known and unknown risks,
uncertainties and other factors that may cause our or our
businesses’ actual results, levels of activity, performance
or achievements to be materially different from those expressed
or implied by any forward-looking statements. In some cases, you
can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as
“may,” “will,” “could,”
“would,” “should,” “expect,”
“plan,” “anticipate,” “intend,”
“believe,” “estimate,” “predict,”
“potential” or “continue” or the negative of
those terms or other comparable terminology. These statements
are only predictions. Actual events or results may differ
materially because of market conditions in our industries or
other factors. Moreover, we do not, nor does any other person,
assume responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of those
statements. Unless otherwise required by applicable laws, we
disclaim any intention or obligation to publicly update or
revise any of the forward-looking statements after the date of
this annual report to conform them to actual results, whether as
a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. All of
the forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety
by reference to the factors discussed under the captions
“Factors affecting our future operating results” in
the “Business” and “Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations” sections of this annual report, which describe
risks and factors that could cause results to differ materially
from those projected in those forward-looking statements.



We caution the reader that the above list of risks and
factors that may affect results addressed in the forward-looking
statements may not be exhaustive. Other sections of this annual
report and other documents incorporated by reference may
describe additional risks or factors that could adversely impact
our business and financial performance. We operate in a
continually changing business environment, and new risk factors
emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict these new
risk factors, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of these new
risk factors on our businesses or the extent to which any
factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to
differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking
statements. Accordingly, forward-looking statements should not
be relied upon as a prediction of actual results.

Controls and Procedures

Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure
    Controls and Procedures and Changes in Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting

Our management carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of
our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the
period covered by this annual report under the supervision and
with the participation of our disclosure committee, our CFO and
CEO. Based upon that evaluation, our CFO and CEO concluded that
our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in
permitting us to comply with our disclosure obligations and
ensure that the material information required to be disclosed is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. There were
no changes in our internal control over financial reporting
during the quarter ended December 31, 2004 that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our controls over financial reporting.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over
    Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of the Company’s
financial statements for external reporting purposes in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2004. In making this assessment, we used the
criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal
Control — Integrated Framework. Based on our
assessment, we concluded that, as of December 31, 2004, the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting is
effective.

Our management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2004 has been audited by
PricewaterhouseCoopers AG, an independent registered public
accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears on page
F-2.

METTLER-TOLEDO INTERNATIONAL INC.

INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

F-1


REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and

Shareholders of Mettler-Toledo International Inc.

We have completed an integrated audit of Mettler-Toledo
International Inc.’s 2004 consolidated financial statements
and of its internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2004 and audits of its 2003 and 2002
consolidated financial statements in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Our opinions, based on our audits, are
presented below.

Consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Mettler-Toledo
International Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31,
2004 and 2003, and the results of their operations and their
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2004 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition,
in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the
index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein when read
in conjunction with the related consolidated financial
statements. These financial statements and financial statement
schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial statement schedule based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

Internal control over financial reporting

Also, in our opinion, management’s assessment, included in
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting appearing under Item 9A, that the Company
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2004 based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all material respects,
based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the
Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004,
based on criteria established in

Internal Control —
Integrated Framework

issued by COSO. The Company’s
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our
responsibility is to express opinions on management’s
assessment and on the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We
conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An
audit of internal control over financial reporting includes
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control, and performing such other procedures as we consider
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
reasonable

F-2


assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

BUSINESS DESCRIPTION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

Mettler-Toledo International Inc. (“Mettler-Toledo” or
the “Company”) is a global supplier of precision
instruments and services. The Company manufactures weighing
instruments for use in laboratory, industrial, packaging,
logistics and food retailing applications. The Company also
manufactures several related analytical instruments, and
provides automated chemistry solutions used in drug and chemical
compound discovery and development. In addition, the Company
manufactures metal detection and other end-of-line inspection
systems used in production and packaging, and provides solutions
for use in certain process analytics applications. The
Company’s primary manufacturing facilities are located in
Switzerland, the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom and
China. The Company’s principal executive offices are
located in Greifensee, Switzerland.

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and
include all entities in which the Company has control, which are
its majority owned subsidiaries.

All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.
Investments in which the Company has voting rights between 20%
and 50% are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities, as well as disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements,
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting periods. Actual results may differ from those
estimates

.

Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts
to conform to the current year presentation.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with
original maturity dates of three months or less.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable
value. Cost, which includes direct materials, labor and
overhead, is generally determined using the first in, first out
(FIFO) method. The estimated net realizable value is based
on assumptions for future demand and related pricing. Reserves
for excess and obsolete inventories are established based on
forecast usage, orders and technological obsolescence.

Long-Lived Assets

a) Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less
accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is charged on a
straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the
assets as follows:

b) Capitalized Software

In accordance with Statement of Position 98-1, “Accounting
for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for
Internal Use” (“SOP 98-1”), the Company
expenses all internal-use software costs incurred in the

F-8


METTLER-TOLEDO INTERNATIONAL INC.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands, except share data, unless otherwise stated)

preliminary project stage and capitalizes certain direct costs
associated with the development and purchase of internal-use
software within property, plant and equipment. Capitalized costs
are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful
lives of the software, generally not exceeding five years.

c) Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

In accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets” (“SFAS 142”),
goodwill, representing the excess of purchase price over the net
asset value of companies acquired, and indefinite lived
intangible assets are not amortized, but are reviewed for
impairment annually in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if
events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might
be impaired. The annual evaluation is based on valuation models
that estimate fair value based on expected future cash flows and
profitability projections.

Other intangible assets include indefinite lived assets and
assets subject to amortization. Where applicable, amortization
is charged on a straight-line basis over the expected period to
be benefited. The Company assesses the recoverability of other
intangible assets subject to amortization in accordance with
SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” (“SFAS 144”).

Accounting for Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

In accordance with SFAS 144, the Company assesses the need
to record impairment losses on long-lived assets with finite
lives when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. An impairment
loss would be recognized when future estimated undiscounted cash
flows expected to result from use of the asset are less than the
asset’s carrying value, with the loss measured at fair
value based on discounted expected cash flows.

Taxation

The Company files tax returns in each jurisdiction in which it
operates. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for
the future tax consequences attributable to differences between
the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss
and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in the
respective jurisdictions in which the Company operates. In
assessing the ability to realize deferred tax assets, management
considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion
or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

Deferred taxes are not provided on the unremitted earnings of
subsidiaries outside of the United States when it is expected
that these earnings are permanently reinvested. Such earnings
may become taxable upon the sale or liquidation of these
subsidiaries or upon the remittance of dividends. Deferred taxes
are provided when the Company no longer considers subsidiary
earnings to be permanently invested, such as in situations where
the Company’s subsidiaries plan to make future dividend
distributions.

Currency Translation and Transactions

The reporting currency for the consolidated financial statements
of the Company is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency
for the Company’s operations is generally the applicable
local currency. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of
companies whose functional currency is other than the
U.S. dollar are included in the consolidated financial
statements by translating the assets and liabilities into the
reporting currency at the exchange rates applicable at the end
of the reporting period. The statements of operations and cash
flows of such non-U.S. dollar functional currency
operations are translated at the monthly average exchange rates
during the year. Translation gains or losses are accumulated in
other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated statements
of shareholders’ equity.

METTLER-TOLEDO INTERNATIONAL INC.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands, except share data, unless otherwise stated)

Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recognized when title to a product has transferred
and any significant customer obligations have been fulfilled.
Standard shipping terms are generally FOB shipping point in most
countries and, accordingly, title transfers upon shipment. In
countries where title cannot legally transfer before delivery,
we defer revenue recognition until delivery has occurred. Other
than a few small software applications, Mettler-Toledo does not
sell its software products without the related hardware
instrument as the software is embedded in the instrument. The
Company’s typical solution requires no significant
production, modification or customization of the hardware or
software that is essential to the functionality of the products.
We also generally maintain the right to accept or reject a
product return in our terms and conditions. To the extent the
Company’s solutions have a post shipment obligation, such
as customer acceptance, revenue is deferred until the obligation
has been completed. In addition, we also defer revenue where
installation is required, unless such installation is
perfunctory. Distributor discounts are offset against revenue at
the time such revenue is recognized. We also maintain accruals
for outstanding credits. Revenues from service contracts are
recognized ratably over the contract period.

Research and Development

Research and development costs primarily consist of salaries,
consulting and other costs. The Company expenses these costs as
incurred.

Warranty

The Company generally offers one-year warranties on most of its
products. Product warranties are recorded at the time revenue is
recognized for certain product shipments. While the Company
engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, our
warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates,
material usage and service costs incurred in correcting a
product failure.

Earnings per Common Share

In accordance with the treasury stock method, the Company has
included 1,246,755, 1,034,934 and 1,089,448 equivalent shares in
the calculation of diluted weighted average number of common
shares for the years ending December 31, 2004, 2003 and
2002, respectively, relating to outstanding stock options.

Outstanding options to purchase 748,813, 1,955,938 and
1,360,600 shares of common stock for the years ending
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, have been
excluded from the calculation of diluted weighted average number
of common shares as such options would be anti-dilutive.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company applies the intrinsic valuation methodology under
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and
related interpretations in accounting for its stock option plan.

F-10


METTLER-TOLEDO INTERNATIONAL INC.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands, except share data, unless otherwise stated)

Had compensation cost for the Company’s stock option plan
been determined based upon the fair value of such awards at the
grant date, consistent with the methods of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, “Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation,” the Company’s net
earnings and basic and diluted net earnings per common share for
the years ended December 31 would have been as follows:

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company has only limited involvement with derivative
financial instruments and does not use them for trading
purposes. As described more fully in Note 5, the Company
enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to
economically hedge certain short-term intercompany transactions
involving its international businesses. Such contracts limit the
Company’s exposure to both favorable and unfavorable
currency fluctuations on the items they hedge. These contracts
are adjusted to reflect market values as of each balance sheet
date, with the resulting changes in fair value being recognized
in the appropriate financial statement caption in the income
statement consistent with the underlying position.

The Company also enters into certain interest rate swap
agreements in order to manage its exposure to changes in
interest rates. The differential paid or received on interest
rate swap agreements is recognized as interest expense over the
life of the agreements as incurred. The Company’s floating
to fixed interest rate swap agreements are generally cash flow
hedges, while the fixed to floating interest rate swap
agreements are generally fair value hedges. The change in fair
value of outstanding interest rate swap agreements that are
effective cash flow hedges is included in the Company’s
consolidated statement of shareholders’ equity. The change
in fair value of outstanding interest rate swap agreements that
are effective as fair value hedges is recognized in earnings as
incurred and is offset by the change in fair value of the hedged
item.

Concentration of Credit Risk

The Company’s revenue base is widely diversified by
geographic region and by individual customer. The Company’s
products are utilized in many different industries, although
extensively in the pharmaceutical, food and

F-11


METTLER-TOLEDO INTERNATIONAL INC.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands, except share data, unless otherwise stated)

beverage, transportation and logistics and chemicals industries.
The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its
customers’ financial condition and, generally, requires no
collateral from its customers.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
issued FASB Statement No. 123R, “Share-Based
Payment” (“SFAS 123R”). SFAS 123R
replaces FASB Statement No. 123, “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation”, and supersedes APB Opinion
No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees”. SFAS 123R requires public companies to
recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for
an award of equity instruments. The cost of such service will be
based on the grant-date fair value of the equity award (with
limited exceptions) over the period during which an employee is
required to provide service in exchange for the award.
Disclosure of the effect of expensing the fair value of equity
compensation is currently required under SFAS 123 (see
previous page). SFAS 123R will become effective for periods
beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company is in the
process of evaluating the cost of its equity awards in
accordance with SFAS 123R.

In November 2004, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 151,
“Inventory Costs” (“SFAS 151”), an
amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4. The amendments
made by Statement 151 require that abnormal amounts of idle
facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted materials
(spoilage) should be recognized as current-period charges
and by requiring the allocation of fixed production overheads to
inventory based on the normal capacity of the production
facilities. The guidance is effective for inventory costs
incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005.
The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact, if any,
that will result from adopting SFAS 151.

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

During the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, the
Company spent approximately $2.3 million and
$4.5 million, respectively, on acquisitions and additional
consideration related to earn-out periods associated with
acquisitions consummated in prior years. Goodwill recognized in
connection with these acquisition payments totaled
$1.5 million and $4.4 million, respectively, which is
included in the Company’s Principal U.S. Operations,
Principal Central European Operations and Asian segments in 2004
and in the Company’s Principal U.S. Operations segment
in 2003. The Company accounted for the acquisition payments and

on acquisitions, including the acquisition of SofTechnics Inc.
and approximately $4.2 million of additional consideration
related to earn-out periods associated with acquisitions
consummated in prior years. SofTechnics is a provider of
in-store retail item management software solutions. Goodwill
recognized in connection with these acquisition payments totaled
$18.8 million, which is primarily included in the
Company’s Principal U.S. Operations segment. The
Company accounted for the acquisition payments using the
purchase method of accounting.

A reconciliation of the change in goodwill during the years
ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 is provided in Note 7
to these consolidated financial statements.

The terms of certain of our acquisitions in 2004 and earlier
years provide for possible additional earn-out payments. The
Company does not currently believe it will make any material
payments relating to such earn-outs. Any additional earn-out
payments incurred will be treated as additional purchase price
and accounted for using the purchase method of accounting.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

As described in Note 9, on November 12, 2003 the
Company completed a five-year $300 million credit facility
and the issuance of $150 million seven-year Senior Notes.
The proceeds from this refinancing were immediately used to
repay all of the Company’s borrowings under its former
credit agreement, which was then terminated. In connection with
this refinancing, the Company unwound the outstanding swap
agreements that were cash flow hedges relating to its previous
credit facility. The resulting loss of $1.0 million was
settled in cash and was charged to interest expense over the
original life of the agreements up to May 2004.

Also in connection with the refinancing, the Company entered
into a new interest rate swap agreement, designated as a fair
value hedge, which changes the fixed interest obligation
associated with $30 million of the Senior Notes into a
floating rate. This agreement has a maturity date of
November 15, 2010. Under the swap, the Company will receive
a fixed interest rate of 4.85% (i.e. the same rate as the Senior
Notes) and pay interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 0.22%. At
December 31, 2004, the fair value of the swap was
approximately $0.4 million.

At December 31, 2004, the Company had outstanding foreign
currency forward contracts in the amount of $110.8 million,
in order to economically hedge short-term intercompany balances
with its foreign businesses. The fair value of these contracts
was not materially different from the carrying value at
December 31, 2004.

The Company may be exposed to credit losses in the event of
nonperformance by the counterparties to its derivative financial
instrument contracts. Counterparties are established banks and
financial institutions with high credit ratings. The Company
does not believe that such counterparties will not be able to
fully satisfy their obligations under these contracts.

The fair values of all derivative financial instruments are
estimated based on current settlement prices of comparable
contracts obtained from dealer quotes. The values represent the
estimated amount the Company would pay or receive to terminate
the agreements at the reporting date, taking into account
current creditworthiness of the counterparties.

November 2003 Refinancing

On November 12, 2003, the Company completed a
$300 million credit facility (“the $300 million
Credit Facility” or “the Credit Facility”) and
the issuance of $150 million seven-year Senior Notes. The
proceeds from this refinancing were immediately used to repay
all of the Company’s borrowings under its former credit
agreement, which was then terminated.

Credit Facility Agreement

The $300 million Credit Facility is provided by a group of
financial institutions and has a bullet maturity in November
2008. It is not subject to any scheduled principal payments.
Borrowings under the $300 million Credit Facility bear
interest at current market rates plus a margin which is based on
the Company’s senior unsecured credit ratings (currently
“BBB” by Standard & Poor’s and
“Baa3” by Moody’s), and is currently set at LIBOR
plus 0.6%. The Company must also pay utilization and facility
fees that are tied to the Company’s credit ratings. The
$300 million Credit Facility contains covenants including
maintaining a ratio of debt to earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization of less than 3.25 to 1.0 and an
interest coverage ratio of more than 3.5 to 1.0. The facility
also places certain limitations on the Company including
limiting the ability to grant liens or incur debt at a
subsidiary level. In addition, the $300 million Credit
Facility has several events of default including upon a change
of control. As of December 31, 2004, approximately
$244.6 million was available under the facility. The Credit
Facility is unsecured.

Senior Notes

In November 2003, the Company issued $150 million of 4.85%
unsecured Senior Notes due November 15, 2010 (“the
Senior Notes”). The Senior Notes rank equally with all our
unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. Interest is payable
semi-annually in May and November. Discount and issuance costs
approximated $1.2 million and are being amortized to
interest expense over the seven-year term of the Senior Notes.
At the Company’s option, the Senior Notes may be redeemed
in whole or in part at any time at a redemption price equal to
the greater of:

•

The principal amount of the Senior Notes; or

•

The sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled
    payments of principal and interest thereon discounted to the
    redemption date on a semi-annual basis at a comparable treasury
    rate plus a margin of 0.20%.

The Senior Notes contain limitations on the ability to incur
liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions exceeding
10% of the Company’s consolidated net worth.

The Company’s weighted average interest rate for the year
ended December 31, 2004 was approximately 6% compared with
the weighted average interest rate for the year ended
December 31, 2003 of approximately 5%. The carrying value
of the Company’s debt obligations approximates fair value.

SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY

Common Stock

The number of authorized shares of the Company’s common
stock is 125,000,000 shares with a par value of
$0.01 per share. Holders of the Company’s common stock
are entitled to one vote per share. At December 31, 2004,
8,094,154 shares of the Company’s common stock were
reserved for issuance pursuant to the Company’s stock
option plan.

Preferred Stock

The Board of Directors, without further shareholder
authorization, is authorized to issue up to
10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value
$0.01 per share in one or more series and to determine and
fix the rights, preferences and privileges of each series,
including dividend rights and preferences over dividends on the
common stock and one or more series of the preferred stock,
conversion rights, voting rights (in addition to those provided
by law), redemption rights and the terms of any sinking fund
therefore, and rights upon liquidation, dissolution or winding
up, including preferences over the common stock and one or more
series of the preferred stock. The issuance of shares of
preferred stock, or the issuance of rights to purchase such
shares, may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing
a change in control of the Company or an unsolicited acquisition
proposal.

Shareholder Rights Plan

On August 26, 2002, the Board of Directors adopted a
Shareholder Rights Plan under which the Company declared a
non-cash dividend of one right for each outstanding share of
common stock. The Rights, which expire on September 5,
2012, entitle stockholders to buy one one-thousandth of a share
of preferred stock at an exercise price of $150. The Rights were
distributed to those stockholders of record as of close of
business on September 5, 2002 and are attached to all
certificates representing those shares of common stock.

The Rights Plan provides that should any person or group
acquire, or announce a tender or exchange offer for 15% or more
of the Company’s common stock, each Right, other than
Rights held by the acquiring person or group, would entitle its
holder to purchase a number of shares of the Company’s
common stock for 50% of its then-current market value. Unless a
15% acquisition has occurred, the Rights may be redeemed by the
Board of Directors of the

F-16


METTLER-TOLEDO INTERNATIONAL INC.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands, except share data, unless otherwise stated)

Company at any time. The Rights Plan will not be triggered by a
tender or exchange offer for all outstanding shares of the
Company at a price and on terms that the Company’s Board of
Directors determines to be adequate and in the best interest of
the Company and its stockholders.

The Rights Plan exempts any stockholder that beneficially owned
15% or more of the Company’s common stock as of
August 26, 2002. However, the Rights will become
exercisable if, at any time after August 26, 2002, any of
these stockholders acquire additional shares of the
Company’s common stock in an amount which is greater than
2% of the Company’s outstanding common stock.

Share Repurchase Program

On February 5, 2004, the Company announced a share
repurchase program, commencing with an initial buyback of up to
$100 million over the two-year period ending
December 31, 2005. The share repurchase program is funded
from cash generated from operating activities. Treasury stock is
accounted for by the cost method. The repurchases are made
through open market transactions, and the timing depends on the
level of acquisition activity, business and market conditions,
the stock price, trading restrictions and other factors.

In November 2004, in addition to the $100 million buyback
amount the Company’s Board of Directors approved an
additional buyback of up to $200 million to its share
repurchase program over the two-year period ending
December 31, 2006. The additional share repurchases are
also expected to be funded from cash generated from operating
activities. The Company cannot assure that it will repurchase
shares representing the full value of the program over the
two-year period.

During the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company spent
$103.8 million on the repurchase of 2,208,500 shares
at an average price of $46.97 of which $1.4 million was
unsettled at the year end.

EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN

The Company’s equity incentive plan provides employees and
directors of the Company additional incentive to join and/or
remain in the service of the Company as well as to maintain and
enhance the long-term performance and profitability of the
Company. The Company’s 2004 equity incentive plan was
approved by shareholders on May 6, 2004 and provides that
3.5 million shares of common stock, plus any options
outstanding under the Company’s prior option plan that
terminate without being exercised, may be the subject of awards.
The plan provides for the grant of options, restricted stock,
performance units and other equity-based awards. The exercise
price of options granted shall not be less than the fair market
value of the common stock on the date of grant. Options
generally vest equally over a five-year period from the date of
grant and have a maximum term of up to 10 years and
6 months of the total shares authorized. Up to
2.1 million shares may be granted in the form of restricted
stock, restricted stock units, performance awards and share
awards.

BENEFIT PLANS

Mettler-Toledo maintains a number of retirement and other
post-retirement employee benefit plans.

Certain subsidiaries sponsor defined contribution plans.
Benefits are determined and funded annually based upon the terms
of the plans. Amounts recognized as cost under these plans
amounted to $7.5 million, $7.0 million and
$3.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively.

Certain subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit plans. Benefits are
provided to employees primarily based upon years of service and
employees’ compensation for certain periods during the last
years of employment. Prior to 2002, the Company’s
U.S. operations also provided post-retirement medical
benefits to their employees. Contributions for medical benefits
are related to employee years of service.

As described in Note 14, during the year ended
December 31, 2002 the Company revised its U.S. defined
benefit pension plan to freeze the benefits for current
participants and to discontinue the plan for all future
employees, resulting in an expense of $1.1 million. In
addition, the Company’s U.S. retiree medical program
was also discontinued during 2002 for certain current and all
future active employees, resulting in a curtailment gain of
$1.3 million.

In May 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. 106-2
(“FSP 106-2”), “Accounting and Disclosure
Requirements related to the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003.” FSP 106-2
relates to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and
Modernization Act of 2003 (the “Act”) signed into law
on December 8, 2003. The Act introduced a prescription drug
benefit under Medicare (Medicare Part D), as well as
federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans
that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent
to Medicare Part D. During the third quarter of 2004, the
Company adopted the provisions of FSP 106-2. The Company
sponsors post-retirement health care plans that provide
prescription drug benefits that are deemed actuarially
equivalent to the Medicare Part D and elected to recognize
the impact of the federal subsidy on its accumulated
post-retirement benefit obligation and net post-retirement
benefit costs in the third quarter of 2004. Recognition of the
Medicare Drug Act decreased the Company’s accumulated
post-retirement benefit obligation by $3.5 million and
reduced its net post-retirement benefit cost by approximately
$0.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2004.

In accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue
No. 03-4, “Accounting for Cash Balance Pension
Plans” (“EITF 03-4”), the Company determined
in 2003 that its Swiss cash balance pension plan met the
requirements necessitating a change in the method of expense
attribution used in its actuarial calculations from the
“projected unit credit’ method to the
“traditional unit credit’ method. Unlike the projected
unit credit method, the traditional unit credit method does not
assume compensation increases in calculating the benefit
obligation, because the pension benefit is based on a guaranteed
return on pension contributions, rather than employees’
compensation for certain periods during the last years of
employment. Accordingly, this required change in methodology
resulted in a reduction in the projected benefit obligation of
approximately $53.3 million, which is subject to
amortization over the expected future service life of
Switzerland-based employees.

Investment policies and strategies for each of the
Company’s pension plans are determined periodically by
pension trustees for each plan, having regard for the potential
risks and returns offered by investment in the various assets
available. Target asset allocation and investment return
criteria are established by the trustees with the overriding
objective of stable earnings growth. Actual results are
monitored against those targets and the trustees are required to
report to the members of each plan, including an analysis of
investment performance on an annual basis at a minimum.
Day-to-day asset management is typically performed by a third
party asset management company, reporting to the pension
trustees. The long-term rate of return on plan asset assumptions
used to determine pension expense under U.S. GAAP are
generally based on historical investment performance and the
target investment return criteria for the future determined by
the trustees.

The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future
service as appropriate, are expected to be paid:

As a result of the voluntary incremental pension payments made
to the Company’s underfunded pension plans of
$10.0 million in 2004 and $17.1 million in 2003, the
Company is not required to make pension funding payments to its
U.S. and U.K. pension plans during the next two years. Similar
to 2004 and 2003, voluntary contributions to the Company’s
pension plans may be made.

In 2005, the Company expects to make normal employer pension
contributions of approximately $11.9 million to its
non-U.S. pension plans and normal employer contributions of
approximately $2.8 million to its U.S. post-retirement
medical plan.

The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to
significant portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax
liabilities are presented below at December 31:

The Company has recorded valuation allowances related to its
deferred income tax assets due to the uncertainty of the
ultimate realization of future benefits from such assets. The
potential decrease or increase of the valuation allowance in the
near term is dependent on the future ability of the Company to
realize the deferred tax assets that are affected by the future
profitability of operations in various worldwide jurisdictions.
The 2004 net change in the valuation allowance includes a
$10.9 million release of the valuation allowance
attributable to tax credit carryforwards and a $2.4 million
increase of valuation allowance attributable to tax loss
carryforwards. The 2004 $10.9 million valuation allowance
release relates to tax benefits associated with stock option
exercises and

accordingly has been recorded in the consolidated statement of
shareholders’ equity. $3.0 million and
$3.2 million of the valuation allowance will be credited to
shareholders’ equity and goodwill, respectively, if and
when realized.

At December 31, 2004, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of
$3.3 million that expire in various amounts through 2021
and foreign tax credits of $11.6 million that will expire
in various amounts through 2014. The Company has various
U.S. state net operating losses and various foreign net
operating losses that have various expiration periods.

The Company plans to repatriate in future years $75 million
of previously unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries.
Accordingly, a deferred tax liability of $8.8 million was
established to account for the incremental tax costs associated
with the planned repatriation. No deferred tax liability has
been recognized on the residual unremitted earnings
approximating $316 million, as such earnings have been
permanently reinvested in the business.

In October, 2004, the United States enacted the American Jobs
Creation Act of 2004 (the “Act”). The Act creates a
temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate
accumulated income earned abroad by providing an 85 percent
dividends received deduction for certain dividends from
controlled foreign corporations. The deduction is subject to a
number of limitations and, as of today, uncertainty remains as
to how to interpret numerous provisions in the Act. As such,
Management is not yet in a position to decide on whether, and to
what extent, the Company might repatriate foreign earnings
subject to these new provisions. Management expects to finalize
their assessment during 2005.

The Company is currently under examination in various taxing
jurisdictions in which it conducts business operations. While
the Company has not yet received any material assessments from
these taxing authorities, the Company believes that adequate
amounts of taxes and related interest and penalties have been
provided for any adverse adjustments as a result of these
examinations and that the ultimate outcome of these examinations
will not result in an adverse material impact on the
Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial
position.

OTHER CHARGES (INCOME), NET

Other charges (income), net consists primarily of charges
related to the Company’s restructuring programs, interest
income, (gains) losses from foreign currency transactions,
(gains) losses from sales of assets and other items.

During the three months ended June 30, 2002, the Company
recorded a restructuring charge of $28.7 million
($20.1 million after tax), primarily related to the exit of
manufacturing facilities in France and the United States, and in
order to further reduce the Company’s expense structure.
This charge comprised restructuring liabilities of
$24.3 million and related asset impairments of
$4.4 million. In total, the restructuring plan resulted in
cash outlays of approximately $20.2 million and non-cash
items of $8.5 million. The charge comprised involuntary
employee separation benefits, write-downs of impaired assets to
be disposed and other exit costs. The Company involuntarily
terminated approximately net 300 employees in targeted
manufacturing and administrative areas. The asset impairments of
$4.4 million primarily relate to plant and equipment
disposals resulting from the exit of certain manufacturing
facilities. Fair value of these assets was determined on the
basis of their net realizable value on disposal.

As part of this restructuring program, the Company revised its
U.S. defined benefit pension plan to freeze the benefits
for current participants and to discontinue the plan for all
future employees, resulting in an expense of $1.1 million.
In addition, the Company’s U.S. retiree medical
program was also discontinued for certain current and all future
active employees, resulting in a curtailment gain of
$1.3 million.

As noted in previous filings, in accordance with U.S. GAAP,
the charge taken in the second quarter of 2002 related to the
exit of the Company’s French manufacturing facility was
limited to the minimum contractual payment required by French
law. During the three months ended March 31, 2003, the
Company recorded a restructuring

F-25


METTLER-TOLEDO INTERNATIONAL INC.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands, except share data, unless otherwise stated)

charge of $5.4 million ($3.8 million after tax),
related to the final union settlement on the closure of this
facility. This charge comprises the additional employee-related
costs resulting from final settlement of the social plan
negotiated with the French workers’ council during the
first quarter of 2003.

The Company assesses its accrual for restructuring activities on
an ongoing basis. During the three months ended
September 30, 2003, the Company recorded a reduction in the
restructuring accrual of $1.0 million, included within
Other charges (income), net, as a result of lower
employee-related charges than originally anticipated. Also, a
restructuring charge of $1.4 million was recorded during
the three months ended September 30, 2003, related to an
extension of manufacturing consolidation activities. This charge
comprised severance of $1.0 million, included within Other
charges (income), net, and inventory write-downs of
$0.4 million, included within Cost of sales.

The Company’s aforementioned restructuring programs and
related accruals were substantially completed at
December 31, 2003.

SEGMENT REPORTING

Operating segments are the individual reporting units within the
Company. These units are managed separately, and it is at this
level where the determination of resource allocation is made.
The units have been aggregated based on operating segments in
geographic regions that have similar economic characteristics
and meet the aggregation criteria of SFAS 131. The Company
has determined that as of December 31, 2004 there are six
reportable segments: Principal U.S. Operations, Other
Western European Operations, Principal Central European
Operations, Swiss R&D and Manufacturing Operations, Asia and
Other.

Principal U.S. Operations represent certain of the
Company’s marketing and producing organizations located in
the United States. Other Western European Operations include the
Company’s market organizations in Western Europe that are
not included in Principal Central European Operations. Principal
Central European Operations primarily include the Company’s
German marketing and producing organizations that primarily
serve the German market and, to a lesser extent, Europe. Swiss
R&D and Manufacturing Operations consist of the
organizations located in Switzerland that are responsible for
the development, production and marketing of precision
instruments, including weighing, analytical and measurement
technologies for use in a variety of industrial and laboratory
applications. Asia represents the Company’s marketing and
producing organizations located in Asia. The Company’s
market organizations are geographically focused and are
responsible for all aspects of the Company’s sales and
service. Operating segments that exist outside these reportable
segments are included in Other.
