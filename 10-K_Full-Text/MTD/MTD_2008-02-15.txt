PART I

Item 1.

Business

We are a leading global supplier of precision instruments and
    services. We have strong leadership positions in all of our
    businesses and believe we hold global number one market
    positions in a majority of them. Specifically, we are the
    largest provider of weighing instruments for use in laboratory,
    industrial and food retailing applications. We are also a
    leading provider of analytical instruments for use in life
    science, reaction engineering and real-time analytic systems
    used in drug and chemical compound development, and process
    analytics instruments used for in-line measurement in production
    processes. In addition, we are the largest supplier of
    end-of-line inspection systems used in production and packaging
    for food, pharmaceutical and other industries.

Our business is geographically diversified, with net sales in
    2007 derived 43% from Europe, 38% from North and South America
    and 19% from Asia and other countries. Our customer base is also
    diversified by industry and by individual customer.

Mettler-Toledo International Inc. was incorporated as a Delaware
    corporation in 1991 and became a publicly traded company with
    its initial public offering in 1997. In 2001, we acquired Rainin
    Instrument, a leading manufacturer of pipetting solutions used
    in pharmaceutical, biotech and medical research applications.

Business
    Segments

We have five reportable segments: U.S. Operations, Swiss
    Operations, Western European Operations, Chinese Operations and
    Other. See Note 15 to the audited consolidated financial
    statements and Item 7. Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under
    “Results of Operations — by Operating
    Segment” included herein for detailed results by segment
    and geographic region.

We manufacture a wide variety of precision instruments and
    provide value-added services to our customers. Our principal
    products and principal services are set forth below. We have
    followed this description of our products and services with
    descriptions of our customers and distribution, sales and
    service, research and development, manufacturing and certain
    other matters. These descriptions apply to substantially all of
    our products and related segments.

Laboratory
    Instruments

We make a wide variety of precision laboratory instruments,
    including laboratory balances, pipettes, titrators, thermal
    analysis systems and other analytical instruments. The
    laboratory instruments business accounted for approximately 44%
    of our net sales in 2007 and 2006 and 45% in 2005.

Laboratory
    Balances

Our laboratory balances have weighing ranges from one
    ten-millionth of a gram up to 64 kilograms. To cover a wide
    range of customer needs and price points, we market our balances
    in a range of product tiers offering different levels of
    functionality. Based on the same technology platform, we also
    manufacture mass comparators, which are used by weights and
    measures regulators as well as laboratories to ensure the
    accuracy of reference weights. Laboratory balances are primarily
    used in the pharmaceutical, food, chemical, cosmetics and other
    industries.

Pipettes

Pipettes are used in laboratories for dispensing small volumes
    of liquids. We operate our pipette business with the Rainin
    brand name. Rainin develops, manufactures and distributes
    advanced pipettes, tips and accessories, including single and
    multi-channel manual and electronic pipettes. Rainin maintains
    service centers in the key markets where customers periodically
    send their pipettes for certified recalibrations. Rainin’s
    principal end markets are pharmaceutical, biotech and academia.



Analytical
    Instruments

Titrators measure the chemical composition of samples and are
    used in environmental and research laboratories as well as in
    quality control labs in the pharmaceutical, food and beverage
    and other industries. Our high-end titrators are multi-tasking
    models, which can perform two determinations simultaneously on
    multiple vessels. Our offering includes robotics to automate
    routine work in quality control applications.

Thermal analysis systems measure material properties as a
    function of temperature, such as weight, dimension, energy flow
    and viscoelastic properties. Thermal analysis systems are used
    in nearly every industry, but primarily in the plastics and
    polymer industries and increasingly in the pharmaceutical
    industry.

pH meters measure acidity in laboratory samples. We also sell
    density and refractometry instruments, which measure chemical
    concentrations in solutions. In addition, we manufacture and
    sell moisture analyzers, which precisely determine the moisture
    content of a sample by utilizing an infrared dryer to evaporate
    moisture.

Laboratory
    Software

LabX, our PC-based laboratory software platform, manages and
    analyzes data generated by our balances, titrators, pH meters,
    moisture analyzers and other analytical instruments. LabX
    provides full network capability, has efficient, intuitive
    protocols, and enables customers to collect and archive data in
    compliance with the U.S. Food and Drug
    Administration’s traceability requirements for
    electronically stored data (also known as 21 CFR
    Part 11).

Automated
    Chemistry Solutions

Our current automated chemistry solutions focus on selected
    applications in the chemical and drug discovery process. Our
    automated lab reactors and in situ analysis systems are
    considered integral to the process development and

scale-up

activities of our customers. Our on-line measurement
    technologies based on infrared and laser light scattering
    enables customers to monitor chemical reactions and
    crystallization processes in real time in the lab and plant. We
    believe that our portfolio of integrated technologies can bring
    significant efficiencies to the development process, enabling
    our customers to bring new chemicals and drugs to market faster.

Process
    Analytics

Our process analytics business provides instruments for the
    in-line measurement of liquid parameters used primarily in the
    production process of pharmaceutical, biotech, beverage,
    microelectronics, chemical and refining companies. Approximately
    half of our process analytics sales are to the pharmaceutical
    and biotech markets, where our customers need fast and secure

scale-up

and
    production that meets the validation processes required for GMP
    (Good Manufacturing Processes) and other regulatory standards.
    We are a leading solution provider for liquid analytical
    measurement to control and optimize production processes. Our
    solutions include sensor technology for measuring pH, dissolved
    oxygen, carbon dioxide, conductivity, turbidity, ozone and total
    organic carbons and automated systems for calibration and
    cleaning of measurement points. Intelligent sensor diagnostics
    capabilities enable improved asset management solutions for our
    customers to reduce process downtime and maintenance costs. Our
    instruments offer leading multi-parameter capabilities and
    plant-wide control system integration, which are key for
    integrated measurement of multiple parameters to secure
    production quality and efficiency. With a worldwide network of
    specialists, we support customers in critical process
    applications, compliance and systems integration questions.

Industrial
    Instruments

We manufacture numerous industrial weighing instruments and
    related terminals and offer dedicated software solutions for the
    pharmaceutical, chemical, food and other industries. In
    addition, we manufacture metal detection and other end-of-line
    inspection systems used in production and packaging. We supply
    automatic identification and data capture solutions, which
    integrate in-motion weighing, dimensioning and



identification technologies for transport, shipping and
    logistics customers. We also offer heavy industrial scales and
    related software. The industrial instruments business accounted
    for approximately 43% of our net sales in 2007 and 42% in both
    2006 and 2005.

Industrial
    Weighing Instruments

We offer a comprehensive line of industrial scales and balances,
    such as bench scales and floor scales, for weighing loads from a
    few grams to several thousand kilograms in applications ranging
    from measuring materials in chemical production to weighing mail
    and packages. Our products are used in a wide range of
    applications, such as counting applications and in formulating
    and mixing ingredients.

Industrial
    Terminals

Our industrial scale terminals collect data and integrate it
    into manufacturing processes, helping to automate them. Our
    terminals allow users to remotely download programs or access
    setup data and can minimize downtime through predictive rather
    than reactive maintenance.

Transportation
    and Logistics

We are a leading global supplier of automatic identification and
    data capture solutions, which integrate in-motion weighing,
    dimensioning and identification technologies. With these
    solutions, customers can measure the weight and cubic volume of
    packages for appropriate billing, logistics and quality control.
    Our solutions also integrate into customers’ information
    systems.

Vehicle Scale
    Systems

Our primary heavy industrial products are scales for weighing
    trucks or railcars (i.e., weighing bulk goods as they enter or
    leave a factory or at a toll station). Heavy industrial scales
    are capable of measuring weights up to 500 tons and permit
    accurate weighing under extreme environmental conditions. We
    also offer advanced computer software that can be used with our
    heavy industrial scales to facilitate a broad range of customer
    solutions and provides a complete system for managing vehicle
    transaction processing.

Industrial
    Software

We offer software that can be used with our industrial
    instruments. Examples include FreeWeigh.Net, statistical quality
    control software, Formweigh.Net, our formulation/batching
    software and OverDrive. FreeWeigh.Net and Formweigh.Net provide
    full network capability and enable customers to collect and
    archive data in compliance with 21 CFR Part 11.

Product
    Inspection

Increasing safety and consumer protection requirements are
    driving the need for more sophisticated end-of-line inspection
    systems (e.g., for use in food processing and packaging,
    pharmaceutical and other industries). We are a leading global
    provider of metal detectors, x-ray visioning equipment and
    checkweighers that are used in these industries. Metal detectors
    are most commonly used to detect fine particles of metal that
    may be contained in raw materials or may be generated by the
    manufacturing process itself. X-ray-based vision inspection
    helps detect non-metallic contamination, such as glass, stones
    and pits, which enter the manufacturing process for similar
    reasons. Our x-ray systems can also detect metal in metallized
    containers and can be used for mass control. Checkweighers are
    used to control the filling content of packaged goods such as
    food, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. Both x-ray and metal
    detection systems may be used together with checkweighers as
    components of integrated packaging lines. FreeWeigh.Net is our
    statistical and quality control software that optimizes package
    filling, monitors weight-related data and integrates it in real
    time into customers’ enterprise resource planning

and/or

process control systems.



Retail Weighing
    Solutions

Supermarkets, hypermarkets and other food retail businesses make
    use of multiple weighing and food labeling solutions for
    handling fresh goods (such as meats, vegetables, fruits and
    cheeses). We offer stand-alone scales for basic counter weighing
    and pricing, price finding and printing. In addition, we offer
    networked scales and software, which can integrate backroom,
    counter, self-service and checkout functions and can incorporate
    fresh goods item data into a supermarket’s overall food
    item and inventory management system. Customer benefits are in
    the areas of pricing, merchandising, inventory management and
    regulatory compliance. The retail business accounted for
    approximately 13% of our net sales in 2007, 14% in 2006 and 13%
    in 2005.

Retail
    Software

Our subsidiary SofTechnics provides retail software for in-store
    item and inventory management solutions. SofTechnics’
    offering complements our retail weighing solutions to food
    retailers by providing the full scope of real-time item
    management. Retailers can then match local store inventory
    levels with local customer demand. Our instruments have been
    expanded to allow in-store marketing which permits customer to
    make more decisions at the point of sale.

Customers and
    Distribution

Our principal customers include companies in the following key
    end markets: the life science industry (pharmaceutical and
    biotech companies, as well as independent research
    organizations); food and beverage producers; food retailers;
    chemical, specialty chemicals and cosmetics companies; the
    transportation and logistics industry; the metals industry; the
    electronics industry; and the academic community.

Our products are sold through a variety of distribution
    channels. Generally, more technically sophisticated products are
    sold through our direct sales force, while less complicated
    products are sold through indirect channels. Our sales through
    direct channels exceed our sales through indirect channels. A
    significant portion of our sales in the Americas is generated
    through the indirect channels, including sales of our
    “Ohaus” branded products. Ohaus branded products
    target markets in which customers are interested in lower cost,
    a more limited set of features and less comprehensive support
    and service such as the educational market. We have a
    diversified customer base, with no single customer accounting
    for more than 2% of 2007 net sales.

Sales and
    Service

Market
    Organizations

We maintain geographically focused market organizations around
    the world that are responsible for all aspects of our sales and
    service. The market organizations are local marketing and
    service organizations designed to maintain close relationships
    with our customers. Each market organization has the flexibility
    to adapt its marketing and service efforts to account for
    different cultural and economic conditions. Market organizations
    also work closely with our producing organizations (described
    below) by providing feedback on manufacturing and product
    development initiatives and relaying new product and application
    ideas.

We have one of the largest and broadest global sales and service
    organizations among precision instrument manufacturers. At
    December 31, 2007, our sales and services group consisted
    of over 5,400 employees in sales, marketing and customer
    service (including related administration) and post-sales
    technical service, located in 35 countries. This field
    organization has the capability to provide service and support
    to our customers and distributors in major markets across the
    globe. This is important because our customers increasingly seek
    to do business with a consistent global approach.



Service

Our service business remains successful with a focus on repair
    and maintenance as well as further expansion of our offerings to
    include value-added services for a range of market needs,
    including regulatory compliance. We have a unique offering to
    our pharmaceutical customers in promoting use of our instruments
    in compliance with FDA regulations and we can provide these
    services regardless of the customer’s location around the
    world. This global service network is also an important factor
    in our ability to expand in emerging markets. We estimate that
    we have the largest installed base of weighing instruments in
    the world. Service (representing service contracts, repairs and
    replacement parts) accounted for approximately 23% of our total
    net sales in 2007, 2006 and 2005. A significant portion of this
    amount is derived from the sale of replacement parts.

Beyond revenue opportunities, we believe service is a key part
    of our solution offering and helps significantly in customer
    retention. The close relationships and frequent contact with our
    large customer base provides us with sales opportunities and
    innovative product and application ideas.

Research and
    Development and Manufacturing

Producing
    Organizations

Our research, product development and manufacturing efforts are
    organized into a number of producing organizations. Our focused
    producing organizations help reduce product development time and
    costs, improve customer focus and maintain technological
    leadership. The producing organizations work together to share
    ideas and best practices, and there is a close interface and
    coordinated customer interaction among marketing organizations
    and producing organizations.

Research and
    Development

We continue to invest in product innovation to provide
    technologically advanced products to our customers for existing
    and new applications. Over the last three years, we have
    invested $257.1 million in research and development
    ($92.4 million in 2007, $82.8 million in 2006 and
    $81.9 million in 2005). In 2007, we spent approximately
    5.1% of net sales on research and development. Our research and
    development efforts fall into two categories:

•

technology advancements, which generate new products and
    increase the value of our products. These advancements may be in
    the form of enhanced or new functionality, new applications for
    our technologies, more accurate or reliable measurement,
    additional software capability or automation through robotics or
    other means, which allows us to design products more specific to
    the needs of the industries the company serves, and

•

cost reductions, which reduce the manufacturing cost of our
    products through better overall design.

We continue to devote an increasing proportion of our research
    and development budget to software development. This includes
    software to process the signals captured by the sensors of our
    instruments, application-specific software and software that
    connects our solutions into customers’ existing IT systems.
    We closely integrate research and development with marketing,
    manufacturing and product engineering. We have over
    900 employees in research and development and product
    engineering.

Manufacturing

We are a worldwide manufacturer, with facilities principally
    located in China, Germany, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and
    the United States. Laboratory instruments are produced mainly in
    Switzerland and to a lesser extent in the United States and
    China, while our remaining products are manufactured worldwide.
    We emphasize product quality in our manufacturing operations,
    and most of our products require very strict tolerances and
    exact specifications. We use an extensive quality control system
    that is integrated into each step of the manufacturing process.
    All major manufacturing facilities have achieved ISO 9001
    certification. We believe that our manufacturing capacity is
    sufficient to meet our present and currently anticipated demand.



We generally manufacture only critical components, which are
    components that contain proprietary technology. When outside
    manufacturing is more efficient, we contract with other
    manufacturers for certain nonproprietary components. We use a
    wide range of suppliers. We believe our supply arrangements are
    adequate and that there are no material constraints on the
    sources and availability of materials. From time to time we may
    rely on a single supplier for all of our requirements of a
    particular component. Supply arrangements for electronic
    components are generally made globally.

Backlog;
    Seasonality

Our manufacturing turnaround time is generally short, which
    permits us to manufacture orders to fill for most of our
    products. Backlog is generally a function of requested customer
    delivery dates and is typically no longer than one to two months.

Our business has historically experienced a slight amount of
    seasonal variation, particularly the high-end laboratory
    instruments business. Traditionally, sales in the first quarter
    are slightly lower than, and sales in the fourth quarter are
    slightly higher than sales in the second and third quarters.
    Fourth quarter sales have historically generated approximately
    27% to 30% of our net sales. This trend has a somewhat greater
    effect on income from operations than on net sales because fixed
    costs are spread evenly across all quarters.

Employees

As of December 31, 2007, we had approximately
    9,500 employees throughout the world, including
    approximately 4,200 in Europe, 3,000 in North and South America
    and 2,300 in Asia and other countries.

We believe our employee relations are good, and we have not
    suffered any material employee work stoppage or strike during
    the last five years, except for a strike in early 2003 at our
    Bethune, France facility, which has been closed. Labor unions do
    not represent a meaningful number of our employees.

Intellectual
    Property

We hold over 2,000 patents and trademarks, primarily in the
    United States, Switzerland, Germany, the United Kingdom, France,
    Japan, China and India. Our products generally incorporate a
    wide variety of technological innovations, some of which are
    protected by patents of various durations. Products are
    generally not protected as a whole by individual patents, and as
    a result, no one patent or group of related patents is material
    to our business. We have numerous trademarks, including the
    Mettler-Toledo name and logo, which are material to our
    business. We regularly protect against infringement of our
    intellectual property.

Regulation

Our products are subject to various regulatory standards and
    approvals by weights and measures regulatory authorities. All of
    our electrical components are subject to electrical safety
    standards. We believe that we are in compliance in all material
    respects with applicable regulations.

Approvals are required to ensure our instruments do not
    impermissibly influence other instruments and are themselves not
    affected by other instruments. In addition, some of our products
    are used in “legal for trade” applications, in which
    prices based on weight are calculated and for which specific
    weights and measures approvals are required. Although there are
    a large number of regulatory agencies across our markets, there
    is an increasing trend toward harmonization of standards, and
    weights and measures regulation is harmonized across the
    European Union.

Our products may also be subject to special requirements
    depending on the end-user and market. For example, laboratory
    customers are typically subject to Good Laboratory Practices
    (GLP), industrial customers to Good Manufacturing Practices
    (GMP) and pharmaceutical customers to U.S. Food and Drug
    Administration (FDA) regulations, and customers in food
    processing industries may be subject to Hazard Analysis and
    Critical Control Point (HACCP) regulations. Products used in
    hazardous environments may also be subject to special
    requirements.



Environmental
    Matters

We are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the
    jurisdictions in which we operate. We own or lease a number of
    properties and manufacturing facilities around the world. Like
    many of our competitors, we have incurred, and will continue to
    incur, capital and operating expenditures and other costs in
    complying with such laws and regulations.

We are currently involved in, or have potential liability with
    respect to, the remediation of past contamination in certain of
    our facilities. Our former subsidiary Mettler-Toledo Hi-Speed,
    Inc. (“Hi-Speed”) was one of two private parties
    ordered to perform certain ground water contamination monitoring
    under an administrative consent order that the New Jersey
    Department of Environmental Protection (“NJDEP”)
    signed on June 13, 1988 with respect to certain property in
    Landing, New Jersey. GEI International Corporation
    (“GEI”) is the other ordered party. GEI has failed to
    fulfill its obligations under the NJDEP consent order, and NJDEP
    has agreed with Hi-Speed that the residual ground water
    contaminants can be monitored through the establishment of a
    Classification Exception Area and concurrent Well Restriction
    Area for the site. The NJDEP does not view these vehicles as
    remedial measures, but rather as “institutional
    controls” that must be adequately maintained and
    periodically evaluated. We estimate that the costs of compliance
    associated with monitoring ground water contamination levels at
    the site will be approximately $0.5 million in the coming
    years.

In addition, certain of our present and former facilities have
    or had been in operation for many decades and, over such time,
    some of these facilities may have used substances or generated
    and disposed of wastes which are or may be considered hazardous.
    It is possible that these sites, as well as disposal sites owned
    by third parties to which we have sent wastes, may in the future
    be identified and become the subject of remediation. Although we
    believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable
    environmental requirements and, to date, we have not incurred
    material expenditures in connection with environmental matters,
    it is possible that we could become subject to additional
    environmental liabilities in the future that could have a
    material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of
    operations or cash flows.

Competition

Our markets are highly competitive. Many of the markets in which
    we compete are fragmented both geographically and by
    application, particularly the industrial and food retailing
    markets. As a result, we face numerous regional or specialized
    competitors, many of which are well established in their
    markets. For example, some of our competitors are divisions of
    larger companies with potentially greater financial and other
    resources than our own. In addition, some of our competitors are
    domiciled in emerging markets and may have a lower cost
    structure than ours. We are confronted with new competitors in
    emerging markets, who although relatively small in size today,
    could become larger companies in their home markets. Given the
    sometimes significant growth rates of these emerging markets,
    and in light of their cost advantage over developed markets,
    emerging market competitors could become more significant global
    competitors. Taken together, the competitive forces present in
    our markets can impair our operating margins in certain product
    lines and geographic markets.

We expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and
    performance of their products and to introduce new products with
    competitive prices. Although we believe that we have
    technological and other competitive advantages over many of our
    competitors, we may not be able to realize and maintain these
    advantages. These advantages include our worldwide market
    leadership positions; our global brand and reputation; our track
    record of technological innovation; our comprehensive,
    high-quality solution offering; our global sales and service
    offering; our large installed base of weighing instruments; and
    the diversification of our revenue base by geographic region,
    product range and customer. To remain competitive, we must
    continue to invest in research and development, sales and
    marketing and customer service and support. We cannot be sure
    that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make these
    investments or that we will be successful in identifying,
    developing and maintaining any competitive advantages.

We believe the principal competitive factors in developed
    markets for purchasing decisions are the product itself,
    application support, service support and price. In emerging
    markets, where there is greater



demand for less sophisticated products, price is a more
    important factor than in developed markets. Competition in the
    U.S. laboratory market is also influenced by the presence
    of large distributors that sell not only our products but those
    of our competitors as well.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

Factors Affecting
    Our Future Operating Results

We are subject to
    certain risks associated with our international operations and
    fluctuating conditions in emerging markets.

We conduct business in many countries, including emerging
    markets in Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe, and these
    operations represent a significant portion of our sales and
    earnings. For example, our Chinese operations account for
    $168.3 million of sales to external customers and
    $57.5 million of segment profit. In addition to the
    currency risks discussed below, international operations pose
    other substantial risks and problems for us. For instance,
    various local jurisdictions in which we operate may revise or
    alter their respective legal and regulatory requirements. In
    addition, we may encounter one or more of the following
    obstacles or risks:

•

tariffs and trade barriers;

•

difficulties in staffing and managing local operations

and/or

mandatory salary increases for local employees;

•

credit risks arising from financial difficulties facing local
    customers and distributors;

•

difficulties in protecting intellectual property;

•

nationalization of private enterprises may result in the
    confiscation of assets as we hold significant assets around the
    world in the form of property, plant and equipment, inventory
    and accounts receivable, as well as $58.1 million of cash
    at December 31, 2007 in our Chinese subsidiaries;

•

restrictions on investments

and/or

limitations regarding foreign ownership;

•

adverse tax consequences, including tax disputes, imposition or
    increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other
    payments by subsidiaries; and

•

other uncertain local economic, political and social conditions,
    including hyper-inflationary conditions or periods of low or no
    productivity growth.

We must also comply with a variety of regulations regarding the
    conversion and repatriation of funds earned in local currencies.
    For example, converting earnings from our operations in China
    into other currencies and repatriating these funds require
    governmental approvals. If we cannot comply with these or other
    applicable regulations, we may face increased difficulties in
    utilizing cash flow generated by these operations outside of
    China.

Economic conditions in emerging markets have from time to time
    deteriorated significantly, and some emerging markets are
    experiencing recessionary trends, severe currency devaluations
    and inflationary prices. Moreover, economic problems in
    individual markets can spread to other economies, adding to the
    adverse conditions we may face in emerging markets. We remain
    committed to emerging markets, particularly those in Asia, Latin
    America and Eastern Europe. However, we expect the fluctuating
    economic conditions will affect our results of operations in
    these markets for the foreseeable future.

The majority of
    our business is derived from companies in developed countries.
    Economic downturns or recessions in these countries would likely
    adversely affect our operating results.

Although the percentage of our sales coming from emerging
    markets is growing, the majority of our business is still
    derived from companies in developed countries. Because our
    customers often decrease or delay capital expenditures in
    difficult economic times, economic downturns or recessions in
    developed countries would likely adversely affect our operating
    results. Customers may also purchase lower-cost products made by
    competitors and not resume purchasing our products even after
    economic conditions improve. These conditions would reduce our
    revenues and profitability.



We operate in
    highly competitive markets, and it may be difficult to preserve
    operating margins, gain market share and maintain a
    technological advantage.

Our markets are highly competitive. Many of the markets in which
    we compete are fragmented both geographically and by
    application, particularly the industrial and food retailing
    markets. As a result, we face numerous regional or specialized
    competitors, many of which are well established in their
    markets. In addition, some of our competitors are divisions of
    larger companies with potentially greater financial and other
    resources than our Company. Some of our competitors are
    domiciled or operate in emerging markets and may have a lower
    cost structure than ours. We are confronted with new competitors
    in emerging markets, who although relatively small in size
    today, could become larger companies in their home markets.
    Given the sometimes significant growth rates of these emerging
    markets, and in light of their cost advantage over developed
    markets, emerging market competitors could become more
    significant global competitors. Taken together, the competitive
    forces present in our markets can impair our operating margins
    in certain product lines and geographic markets. We expect our
    competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of
    their products and to introduce new products with competitive
    prices. Although we believe that we have certain technological
    and other advantages over our competitors, we may not be able to
    realize and maintain these advantages.

Our product
    development efforts may not produce commercially viable products
    in a timely manner.

We must introduce new products and enhancements in a timely
    manner, or our products could become technologically obsolete
    over time, which would harm our operating results. To remain
    competitive, we must continue to make significant investments in
    research and development, sales and marketing and customer
    service and support. We cannot be sure that we will have
    sufficient resources to continue to make these investments. In
    developing new products, we may be required to make substantial
    investments before we can determine their commercial viability.
    As a result, we may not be successful in developing new products
    and we may never realize the benefits of our research and
    development activities.

Our ability to
    deliver products and services may be disrupted.

An interruption in our business due to events such as natural
    disasters, pandemics or other health crises, fires, explosions
    or issues with the supply chain may cause us to temporarily be
    unable to deliver products or services to our customers. It may
    be expensive to resolve these issues, even though some of these
    risks are covered by insurance policies. More importantly,
    customers may switch to competitors and may not return to us
    even if we resolve the interruption.

A prolonged
    downturn or additional consolidation in the pharmaceutical,
    food, food retailing and chemicals industries could adversely
    affect our operating results.

Our products are used extensively in the pharmaceutical, food
    and beverage and chemical industries. Consolidation in the
    pharmaceutical and chemicals industries hurt our sales in prior
    years. A prolonged downturn or additional consolidation in any
    of these industries could adversely affect our operating
    results. In addition, the capital spending policies of our
    customers in these industries are based on a variety of factors
    we cannot control, including the resources available for
    purchasing equipment, the spending priorities among various
    types of equipment and policies regarding capital expenditures.
    Any decrease or delay in capital spending by our customers would
    cause our revenues to decline and could harm our profitability.

We may face risks
    associated with future acquisitions.

We may pursue acquisitions of complementary product lines,
    technologies or businesses. Acquisitions involve numerous risks,
    including difficulties in the assimilation of the acquired
    operations, technologies and products; diversion of
    management’s attention from other business concerns; and
    potential departures of key employees of the acquired company.
    If we successfully identify acquisitions in the future,
    completing such acquisitions may result in new issuances of our
    stock that may be dilutive to current owners, increases in our



debt and contingent liabilities and additional amortization
    expenses related to intangible assets. Any of these
    acquisition-related risks could have a material adverse affect
    on our profitability.

Larger companies have identified life sciences and instruments
    as businesses they will consider entering, which could change
    the competitive dynamics of these markets. In addition, we may
    not be able to identify, successfully complete or integrate
    potential acquisitions in the future. However, even if we can do
    so, we cannot be sure that these acquisitions will have a
    positive impact on our business or operating results.

If we cannot
    protect our intellectual property rights, or if we infringe or
    misappropriate the proprietary rights of others, our operating
    results could be harmed.

Our success depends on our ability to obtain and enforce patents
    on our technology, maintain our trademarks and protect our trade
    secrets. Our patents may not provide complete protection, and
    competitors may develop similar products that are not covered by
    our patents. Our patents may also be challenged by third parties
    and invalidated or narrowed. Competitors sometimes seek to take
    advantage of our trademarks or brands in ways that may create
    customer confusion or weaken our brand. Although we take
    measures to protect confidential information, improper use or
    disclosure of our trade secrets may still occur.

We may be sued for infringing on the intellectual property
    rights of others. The cost of any litigation could affect our
    profitability regardless of the outcome, and management
    attention could be diverted. If we are unsuccessful in such
    litigation, we may have to pay damages, stop the infringing
    activity

and/or

obtain a license. If we fail to obtain a required license, we
    may be unable to sell some of our products, which could result
    in a decline in our revenues.

Departures of key
    employees could impair our operations.

We generally have employment contracts with each of our key
    employees. Our executive officers own shares of our common stock

and/or

have
    options to purchase additional shares. Nevertheless, such
    individuals could leave the Company. If any key employees
    stopped working for us, our operations could be harmed.
    Important R&D personnel may leave and join competitors,
    which could substantially delay or hinder ongoing development
    projects. We have no key man life insurance policies with
    respect to any of our senior executives.

We may be
    adversely affected by environmental laws and
    regulations.

We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations,
    including those relating to air emissions, wastewater
    discharges, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous
    wastes and the remediation of contamination associated with the
    use and disposal of hazardous substances.

We incur expenditures in complying with environmental laws and
    regulations. We are currently involved in, or have potential
    liability with respect to, the remediation of past contamination
    in various facilities. In addition, some of our facilities are
    or have been in operation for many decades and may have used
    substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are
    hazardous or may be considered hazardous in the future. These
    sites and disposal sites owned by others to which we sent waste
    may in the future be identified as contaminated and require
    remediation. Accordingly, it is possible that we could become
    subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future
    that may harm our results of operations or financial condition.

We may be
    adversely affected by failure to comply with regulations of
    governmental agencies or by the adoption of new
    regulations.

Our products are subject to regulation by governmental agencies.
    These regulations govern a wide variety of activities relating
    to our products, from design and development, to product safety,
    labeling, manufacturing, promotion, sales and distribution. If
    we fail to comply with these regulations, or if new regulations
    are adopted that substantially change existing practice or
    impose new burdens, we may have to recall products and cease
    their manufacture and distribution. In addition, we could be
    subject to fines or criminal prosecution.



We may experience
    impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets.

As of December 31, 2007, our consolidated balance sheet
    included goodwill of $440.8 million and other intangible
    assets of $100.0 million.

Our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other
    intangible assets, which affect the amount of future period
    amortization expense and possible impairment expense that we
    might incur. The determination of the value of such intangible
    assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions
    that affect our consolidated financial statements.

In accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and
    Other Intangible Assets” (“SFAS 142”), our
    goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not
    amortized, but are evaluated for impairment annually in the
    fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired. The
    evaluation is based on valuation models that estimate fair value
    based on expected future cash flows and profitability
    projections. In preparing the valuation models we consider a
    number of factors, including operating results, business plans,
    economic conditions, future cash flows, and transactions and
    market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to
    these factors and our judgment in applying them to the
    impairment analyses. The significant estimates and assumptions
    within our fair value models include sales growth, controllable
    cost growth, perpetual growth, effective tax rates and discount
    rates. Our assessments to date have indicated that there has
    been no impairment of these assets.

Should any of these estimates or assumptions change, or should
    we incur lower-than-expected operating performance or cash
    flows, we may experience a triggering event that requires a new
    fair value assessment for our reporting units, possibly prior to
    the required annual assessment. These types of events and
    resulting analysis could result in impairment charges for
    goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets if the
    fair value estimate declines below the carrying value.

Our amortization expense related to intangible assets with
    finite lives may materially change should our estimates of their
    useful lives change.

Unanticipated
    changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax
    liabilities could impact our profitability.

We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and
    various other foreign jurisdictions, and our domestic and
    international tax liabilities are subject to allocation of
    expenses among different jurisdictions. Our effective tax rates
    could be adversely affected by: changes in the mix of earnings
    by jurisdiction, changes in tax laws or tax rates, changes in
    the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and
    material adjustments from tax audits.

In particular, the carrying value of deferred tax assets, which
    are predominantly in the U.S., is dependent upon our ability to
    generate future taxable income in the U.S. In addition, the
    amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in
    various jurisdictions and a material assessment by a governing
    tax authority could affect our profitability.

Currency
    fluctuations affect our operating profits.

Because we conduct operations in many countries, our operating
    income can be significantly affected by fluctuations in currency
    exchange rates. Swiss franc-denominated expenses represent a
    much greater percentage of our total operating expenses than
    Swiss franc-denominated sales represent of our total net sales.
    In part, this is because most of our manufacturing costs in
    Switzerland relate to products that are sold outside
    Switzerland. Moreover, a substantial percentage of our research
    and development expenses and general and administrative expenses
    are incurred in Switzerland. Therefore, if the Swiss franc
    strengthens against all or most of our major trading currencies
    (e.g

.

, the U.S. dollar, the euro, other major
    European currencies, the Chinese yuan and the Japanese yen), our
    operating profit is reduced. We also have significantly more
    sales in European currencies (other than the Swiss franc) than
    we have expenses in those currencies. Therefore, when European
    currencies weaken against the U.S. dollar and the Swiss
    franc, it also decreases our operating profits. Accordingly, the
    Swiss franc exchange rate to the euro is an important



cross-rate monitored by the Company. We estimate that a 1%
    strengthening of the Swiss franc against the euro would result
    in a decrease in our earnings before tax of approximately
    $1.1 million on an annual basis. In addition to the effects
    of exchange rate movements on operating profits, our debt levels
    can fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates, particularly
    between the U.S. dollar and the Swiss franc. Based on our
    outstanding debt at December 31, 2007, we estimate that a
    10% weakening of the U.S. dollar against the currencies in
    which our debt is denominated would result in an increase of
    approximately $12.4 million in the reported
    U.S. dollar value of the debt.

We have
    substantial debt and we may incur substantially more debt, which
    could affect our ability to meet our debt obligations and may
    otherwise restrict our activities.

We have substantial debt and we may incur substantial additional
    debt in the future. As of December 31, 2007, we had total
    indebtedness of approximately $315.4 million, net of cash
    of $81.2 million. We are also permitted by the terms of our
    debt instruments to incur substantial additional indebtedness,
    subject to the restrictions therein.

Our debt could have important consequences. For example, it
    could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations
    under our debt instruments; require us to dedicate a substantial
    portion of our cash flow to payments on our indebtedness, which
    would reduce the amount of cash flow available to fund working
    capital, capital expenditures, product development and other
    corporate requirements; increase our vulnerability to general
    adverse economic and industry conditions, including changes in
    raw material costs; limit our ability to respond to business
    opportunities; limit our ability to borrow additional funds,
    which may be necessary; and subject us to financial and other
    restrictive covenants, which, if we fail to comply with these
    covenants and our failure is not waived or cured, could result
    in an event of default under our debt.

The agreements
    governing our debt impose restrictions on our
    business.

The indenture governing our senior notes and the agreements
    governing our credit facility contain covenants imposing various
    restrictions on our business. These restrictions may affect our
    ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to
    take advantage of potential business opportunities as they
    arise. The restrictions these covenants place on us include
    limitations on our ability to enter into sale and leaseback
    arrangements; incur liens; and consolidate, merge, sell or lease
    all or substantially all of our assets. Our credit facility also
    requires us to meet certain financial ratios.

Our ability to comply with these agreements may be affected by
    events beyond our control, including prevailing economic,
    financial and industry conditions, and are subject to the risks
    in this section. The breach of any of these covenants or
    restrictions could result in a default under the indenture
    governing the senior notes

and/or

under
    our credit facility. An event of default under our credit
    facility would permit our lenders to declare all amounts
    borrowed from them to be immediately due and payable.
    Acceleration of our other indebtedness may cause us to be unable
    to make interest payments on the senior notes and repay the
    principal amount of the senior notes.

Our ability to
    generate cash depends on factors beyond our control.

Our ability to make payments on our debt and to fund planned
    capital expenditures and research and development efforts will
    depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to
    an extent, is subject to general economic, financial,
    competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors,
    including those described in this section, that are beyond our
    control.

We cannot ensure that our business will generate sufficient cash
    flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available
    to us under our credit facility in an amount sufficient to
    enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs.
    We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on
    or before maturity. We cannot ensure that we will be able to
    refinance any of our debt, including our credit facility and the
    senior notes, on commercially reasonable terms or at all.

We have a share repurchase program that was announced in
    February 2004. Under the program, we have been authorized to buy
    back up to $1.5 billion of the Company’s common
    shares. We have purchased 13.0 million common shares since
    the inception of the program through December 31, 2007, at
    a total cost of



$858.9 million. As of December 31, 2007, there was
    $641.1 million remaining authorized for repurchases under
    the plan by December 31, 2010. The share repurchases are
    expected to be funded from existing cash balances, borrowings
    under existing credit arrangements or cash generated from
    operating activities. Repurchases will be made through open
    market transactions, and the timing will depend on the level of
    acquisition activity, business and market conditions, the stock
    price, trading restrictions and other factors.

During the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, we spent
    $324.6 million and $265.9 million on the repurchase of
    3,384,731 shares and 4,141,559 shares at an average
    price per share of $95.88 and $64.18, respectively.

Item 7.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

The following discussion and analysis of our financial
    condition and results of operations should be read together with
    our audited consolidated financial statements.

Overview

We operate a global business, with sales that are diversified by
    geographic region, product range and customer. We hold leading
    positions worldwide in many of our markets and attribute this
    leadership to several factors, including the strength of our
    brand name and reputation, our comprehensive offering of
    innovative instruments and solutions, and the breadth and
    quality of our global sales and service network.

Net sales in U.S. dollars increased by 12% and 8% in 2007
    and 2006, respectively. Excluding the effect of currency
    exchange rate fluctuations, or in local currencies, net sales
    increased 8% and 7% in 2007 and 2006, respectively. We enjoyed a
    strong world economy in 2007 with favorable market conditions in
    Europe, continued solid growth in the United States and
    generally strong demand in most Asian countries.

In respect to our end-user markets, we experienced improved
    results during 2007 in our laboratory-related end-user markets,
    such as pharmaceutical and biotech customers as well as the
    laboratories of chemical companies, food and beverage companies
    and universities. We believe that the long-term fundamentals of
    the pharmaceutical and biotech markets are particularly
    attractive and our solutions assist these companies in enhancing
    their productivity as they meet the challenges of new drug
    approval activity, heightened price regulation and industry
    consolidation.

In our industrial markets, the principal growth driver in recent
    years has been increased investment in China related to
    increasing production capacity for the domestic and export
    markets. Although this provides a significant opportunity for
    our Chinese operations, this manufacturing shift has a negative
    impact on certain of our industrial end user markets in the
    U.S. and Europe. However despite this challenge, our
    U.S. and European industrial end-user markets experienced
    solid sales growth during 2007.

In our food retail end markets, we faced difficult comparisons
    in both Europe and the U.S. related to previous year
    project activity. Traditionally the spending levels in this
    sector have experienced more volatility than our other customer
    sectors. Increased spending in the past has come from events
    such as Y2K and the introduction of the euro currency. Similar
    to our industrial business, China also provides growth as the
    expansion of its local economy is creating a significant number
    of new retail stores each year.



In 2008, we expect to continue to pursue the overall business
    growth strategies which we have followed in recent years:

Gaining Market Share.

Our global sales and
    marketing initiative, “Spinnaker,” continues to be an
    important growth strategy. We aim to achieve above market sales
    growth by improving the productivity and effectiveness of our
    global sales and marketing processes. While this initiative is
    broad based, efforts to improve these processes include
    increased segment marketing and leads generation activities, the
    implementation of more effective pricing strategies and
    processes and other sales and marketing topics. Our
    comprehensive service offering also helps us further penetrate
    developed markets. We estimate that we have the largest
    installed base of weighing instruments in the world. In addition
    to traditional repair and maintenance, our service offerings
    continue to expand into value-added services for a range of
    market needs, including regulatory compliance.

Expanding Emerging Markets.

Emerging markets,
    comprising Asia (excluding Japan), Eastern Europe, Latin
    America, the Middle East and Africa, account for approximately
    25% of our total net sales. We have a two-pronged strategy in
    emerging markets: first, to capitalize on growth opportunities
    in these markets and second, to leverage our low-cost
    manufacturing operations in China. We have a 20 year track
    record in China, and our sales in Asia have grown more than 15%
    in local currency since 1999. We have broadened our product
    offering to the Asian markets and are benefiting as
    multinational customers shift production to China. We are also
    experiencing rapid growth in India from increased life science
    research activities, as well as our acquisition of our
    distribution channel for laboratory products in 2005. In
    addition, Russia continues to be an important growth driver due
    in part to the expansion of its local economy. To reduce costs,
    we are also shifting more of our manufacturing to China where
    our three facilities manufacture for the local markets as well
    as for export.

Extending Our Technology Lead.

We continue to
    focus on product innovation. In the last three years, we spent
    between 5.1% and 5.5% of net sales on research and development.
    We seek to drive shorter product life cycles, as well as improve
    our product offerings and their capabilities with additional
    integrated technologies and software. In addition, we aim to
    create value for our customers by having an intimate knowledge
    of their processes via our significant installed product base.

Maintaining Cost Leadership.

We continue to
    strive to improve our margins by reducing our cost structure. As
    previously mentioned, shifting production to China has been an
    important component of our cost savings initiatives. We have
    also implemented global procurement and supply chain management
    programs over the last several years aimed at lowering supply
    costs. Our cost leadership initiatives are also focused on
    continuously improving our invested capital efficiency, such as
    reducing our working capital levels and ensuring appropriate
    returns on our expenditures.

Pursuing Strategic Acquisitions.

While we have
    not completed a significant acquisition since 2001, acquisitions
    remain part of our growth strategy. We seek to pursue
    acquisitions that may leverage our global sales and service
    network, respected brand, extensive distribution channels and
    technological leadership. We have identified life sciences,
    product inspection and process analytics as three key areas for
    acquisitions.

Results of
    Operations — Consolidated

Net
    sales

Net sales were $1,793.7 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2007, compared to $1,594.9 million in
    2006 and $1,482.5 million in 2005. This represents
    increases in 2007 and 2006 of 12% and 8% in U.S. dollars
    and 8% and 7% in local currencies, respectively.

In 2007, our net sales by geographic destination increased in
    local currencies by 6% in the Americas, 6% in Europe and 16% in
    Asia/Rest of World. A discussion of sales by operating segment
    is included below.

As described in Note 15 to our consolidated financial
    statements, our net sales comprise product sales of precision
    instruments and related services. Service revenues are primarily
    derived from regulatory



compliance qualification, calibration, certification and repair
    services, much of which is provided under contracts, as well as
    sales of spare parts.

Net sales of products increased in 2007 and 2006 by 13% and 8%
    in U.S. dollars and by 8% and 7% in local currencies,
    respectively. Service revenue (including spare parts) increased
    in 2007 and 2006 by 11% and 8% in U.S. dollars and by 6%
    and 7% in local currencies, respectively.

Net sales of our laboratory-related products increased by 7% in
    local currencies during 2007 principally driven by strong growth
    across most product categories, especially analytical
    instruments and process analytics. Our laboratory-related
    product sales were also reduced by 1% during 2007 due to product
    line exits.

Net sales of our industrial-related products increased by 10% in
    local currencies during 2007. We experienced strong sales growth
    in our product inspection products, especially x-ray products.
    We also benefited from solid sales growth in our core industrial
    products throughout most geographies, particularly China.

In our food retailing markets, net sales increased by 3% in
    local currencies during 2007 over the previous year due to
    increased sales in Asia and the Americas. European sales were
    flat versus the previous year due to difficult comparisons
    associated with strong project activity during 2006. The food
    retailing markets also continue to experience improved growth of
    software solutions.

Gross
    profit

Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 50.0% for 2007,
    compared to 49.6% for 2006 and 49.3% for 2005.

Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for products was 53.8%
    for 2007, compared to 53.3% for 2006 and 53.2% for 2005. Gross
    profit as a percentage of net sales for services (including
    spare parts) was 36.9% for 2007, compared to 36.9% for 2006 and
    36.0% for 2005.

The increase in gross profit reflects several factors, including
    increased sales volume leveraging our fixed production costs,
    partially offset by increased product costs, most notably steel
    prices.

Research and
    development and selling, general and administrative
    expenses

Research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales
    were 5.1% for 2007, 5.2% for 2006 and 5.5% in 2005. Research and
    development expenses increased by 7% in 2007 and increased by 1%
    in 2006 in local currencies. Our research and development
    spending levels reflect increased research and development
    investments.

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of
    net sales decreased to 29.5% for 2007, compared to 30.2% for
    2006 and 29.8% for 2005. Selling, general and administrative
    expenses increased by 5% in 2007 and 9% in 2006 in local
    currencies. This is primarily due to continued sales and
    marketing investments, especially in China and other emerging
    market countries, as well as higher performance-related
    compensation costs. These increases are partly offset by savings
    from our cost reduction initiatives implemented during the
    second half of 2006.

Other (income)
    charges, net

Other (income) charges, net consisted of other income, net of
    $0.9 million in 2007 and $7.9 million in 2006,
    compared to other charges, net of $20.2 million in 2005.
    Other (income) charges, net consisted primarily of interest
    income, (gains) losses from foreign currency transactions and
    other items. The decrease in other charges (income), net for
    2007 compared to the prior year is due to lower interest income
    associated with the decrease in cash balances resulting from
    share repurchases. In 2006, other (income) charges, net included
    increased interest income associated with higher cash balances
    in the U.S. as a result of our foreign earnings
    repatriation during 2005 associated with the American Jobs
    Creation Act of 2004. During 2005, other (income) charges, net
    included a $21.8 million charge related to litigation. We
    wrote off a $19.9 million intangible asset relating to an
    intellectual property license that was subject to litigation
    with the grantor in



June 2005. This license granted one of our wholly owned
    subsidiaries exclusive rights to distribute certain third-party
    manufactured pipettes in the United States. A judgment entered
    on June 6, 2005 terminated the license agreement and
    awarded damages to the other party. We also incurred
    $1.9 million of related legal costs during 2005, which
    included damages of $0.6 million. The damages of
    $0.6 million were subsequently reversed during 2006.

Interest expense
    and taxes

Interest expense was $21.0 million for 2007, compared to
    $17.5 million for 2006 and $14.9 million for 2005. The
    increase in 2007 is due to higher average borrowing rates offset
    in part by reduced average borrowings versus 2006. The increase
    in 2006 and 2005 was principally due to higher average
    borrowings over the prior year due to our increased debt balance
    in Europe as a result of our foreign earnings repatriation
    during 2005 associated with the American Jobs Creation Act of
    2004.

During the third quarter of 2007, we recorded certain discrete
    tax items which resulted in a net tax benefit of
    $1.1 million. The discrete items include a benefit of
    $3.4 million related to a favorable resolution of certain
    tax matters and other adjustments related to prior years, which
    were partially offset by a charge of $2.3 million primarily
    due to a tax law change in Germany.

During the third quarter of 2006, we implemented a legal
    reorganization that resulted in a reduction of the estimated
    annual effective tax rate before discrete items from 30% to 27%.
    In addition to the change in our annual effective tax rate, we
    recorded three discrete tax items: a charge of
    $10.5 million related to the establishment of a valuation
    allowance on foreign tax credit carryforwards, a benefit of
    $13.4 million associated with a reduction of a liability
    previously established for estimated costs to repatriate
    unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries, and a favorable tax
    law change resulting in a benefit of $5.1 million.

Pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, we
    repatriated $396 million of cash during 2005 that was
    generated over time by our foreign operations. As a result of
    this repatriation, we recorded additional income tax expense of
    $13.1 million. This amount reflected the federal tax impact
    in the United States (including certain state taxes) of
    $12.3 million, foreign withholding taxes of
    $2.0 million and a net decrease of $1.2 million of
    deferred tax liabilities associated with the reassessment of
    pre-existing and future dividend repatriations. In addition, we
    recorded tax benefits of $7.7 million related to a
    favorable resolution of certain tax matters. Our tax rate for
    2005 also included a tax benefit associated with the previously
    described litigation.

Our annual effective tax rate was 27%, 23% and 32% for 2007,
    2006 and 2005, respectively. The previously described discrete
    tax items had the effect of lowering our annual effective tax
    rate by 4% in 2006, and raising it by 2% in 2005.

Results of
    Operations — by Operating Segment

The following is a discussion of the financial results of our
    operating segments. We currently have five reportable segments:
    U.S. Operations, Swiss Operations, Western European
    Operations, Chinese Operations and Other. A more detailed
    description of these segments is outlined in Note 15 to our
    consolidated financial statements.

The increase in total net sales during 2007 reflects growth
    across most product lines, particularly our laboratory-related
    and industrial-related products. Our laboratory-related and
    industrial-related products experienced especially strong growth
    in analytical instruments and product inspection, respectively.
    Net sales were reduced by 1% related to product line exits.

Segment profit increased by $15.5 million in our
    U.S. Operations segment during 2007, compared to an
    increase of $9.9 million during 2006. The increase in
    segment profit in 2007 was primarily due to increased sales
    volume, leveraging our fixed production costs and benefits of
    our cost reduction initiatives. Segment profit also benefited
    from the resolution of two legal matters, which were partially
    offset by a $1.1 million loss on the sale of a product line.

    increased by 9% in 2007 and increased by 10% in 2006. The
    increase in sales to external customers during 2007 relates to
    continued growth in our laboratory-related products. We also
    continue to experience strong export sales growth to emerging
    markets.

Segment profit increased by $11.1 million in our Swiss
    Operations segment during 2007, compared to an increase of
    $4.6 million during 2006. The increase in segment profit in
    2007 is primarily due to increased sales volume, favorable
    product mix, and favorable currency translation fluctuations,
    partially offset by increased research and development and sales
    and marketing investments.

    in 2006. Net sales to external customers in local currency
    increased by 5% in 2007 and 5% in 2006. The 2007 increase is
    primarily due to strong sales growth in our product inspection,
    laboratory-related and core industrial products due to benefits
    from our sales and marketing initiatives as well as improved
    market conditions, offset in part by a decline in food retailing
    products related to strong customer project activity in the
    prior year.

Segment profit increased by $7.9 million in our Western
    European Operations segment during 2007, compared to an increase
    of $5.2 million in 2006. The increase in segment profit in
    2007 is principally a result of increased sales volume
    leveraging our fixed production costs, favorable product mix,
    favorable currency translation fluctuations and benefits of our
    cost reduction initiatives, partially offset by charges
    associated with cost reduction initiatives.

Total net sales in local currency increased by 15% in 2007 and
    14% in 2006. Net sales to external customers in local currency
    increased 13% in 2007 and 14% in 2006. This performance reflects
    increased sales growth across most product lines in our Other
    Asian Pacific, Eastern European and Other North American markets.

Segment profit increased by $8.5 million in our Other
    segment during 2007, compared to an increase of
    $6.7 million during 2006. Segment profit increased during
    2007 primarily due to strong sales volume and benefits from our
    cost reduction programs, partially offset by costs associated
    with a contractual termination.

Liquidity and
    Capital Resources

Liquidity is our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from
    operating activities to meet our obligations and commitments. In
    addition, liquidity includes the ability to obtain appropriate
    financing. Currently, our financing requirements are primarily
    driven by working capital requirements, capital expenditures,
    share repurchases and acquisitions. In 2005, we increased our
    debt balance in Europe and our cash balance in the United States
    as a result of our foreign earnings repatriation associated with
    the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.

Cash provided by operating activities totaled
    $228.2 million in 2007, compared to $191.6 million in
    2006 and $177.1 million in 2005. The increase in 2007
    resulted principally from improved operating results and a
    reduction in tax payments which included a $6 million tax
    refund, offset in part by approximately $9 million of
    higher payments related to 2007 performance-related compensation
    incentives (bonus payments) compared to the corresponding period
    in 2006. We also made a $8 million voluntary incremental
    pension contribution to our U.S. plan in 2007 compared to a
    $6 million contribution to our U.K. plan in 2006. The
    increase in 2006, as compared to 2005, resulted principally from
    improved operating results and reduced inventory levels, which
    was offset in part by a $6 million voluntary incremental
    pension contribution to our U.K. pension plan. Similarly to
    previous years, we expect to make normal employer pension
    contributions of approximately $17.8 million in 2008.



Capital expenditures are made primarily for investments in
    information systems and technology, machinery, equipment and the
    purchase and expansion of facilities. Our capital expenditures
    totaled $47.5 million in 2007, $34.3 million in 2006
    and $32.5 million in 2005. We expect capital expenditures
    to increase as our business grows and to fluctuate as currency
    exchange rates change. Our capital expenditures in 2007 included
    $7.1 million of investments related to our new Chinese
    facility, compared to $6.4 million in 2006. In 2007,
    capital expenditures also included $5 million of software
    licenses relating to investments in corporate information
    technology systems.

We continue to explore potential acquisitions. In connection
    with any acquisition, we may incur additional indebtedness.

Credit
    Agreement

In November 2005, we entered into an amended and restated credit
    agreement (“the Credit Agreement”). The
    $450 million Credit Agreement is provided by a group of
    financial institutions and has a maturity date of
    November 5, 2010. It is not subject to any scheduled
    principal payments. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear
    interest at current market rates plus a margin based on our
    senior unsecured credit ratings (currently “BBB” by
    Standard & Poor’s and “Baa3” by
    Moody’s) and is currently set at LIBOR plus 0.375%. We must
    also pay facility fees that are tied to our credit ratings. The
    Credit Agreement contains covenants, including maintaining a
    ratio of debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
    amortization of less than 3.25 to 1.0 and an interest coverage
    ratio of more than 3.5 to 1.0. The Credit Agreement also places
    certain limitations on us, including limiting the ability to
    grant liens or incur debt at a subsidiary level. In addition,
    the Credit Agreement has several events of default, including
    upon a change of control. As of December 31, 2007,
    approximately $216.8 million was available under the
    facility. The Credit Agreement is unsecured. We incurred fees of
    approximately $0.9 million in conjunction with amending and
    restating the Credit Agreement which are amortized to interest
    expense through 2010.

Senior
    Notes

In November 2003, we issued $150 million of 4.85% unsecured
    Senior Notes due November 15, 2010. The Senior Notes rank
    equally with all our unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.
    Interest is payable semi-annually in May and November. Discount
    and issuance costs approximated $1.2 million and are being
    amortized to interest expense over the seven-year term of the
    Senior Notes.

At our option, the Senior Notes may be redeemed in whole or in
    part at any time at a redemption price equal to the greater of:

•

the principal amount of the Senior Notes, or

•

the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled
    payments of principal and interest thereon discounted to the
    redemption date on a semi-annual basis at a comparable treasury
    rate plus a margin of 0.20%.

The Senior Notes contain limitations on our ability to incur
    liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions exceeding
    10% of our consolidated net worth.

Changes in exchange rates between the currencies in which we
    generate cash flow and the currencies in which our borrowings
    are denominated affect our liquidity. In addition, because we
    borrow in a variety of currencies, our debt balances fluctuate
    due to changes in exchange rates.

At December 31, 2007, we were in compliance with all
    covenants set forth in our Amended Credit Agreement and Senior
    Notes. In addition, we do not have any downgrade triggers
    relating to ratings from rating agencies that would accelerate
    the maturity dates of our debt.

We currently believe that cash flow from operating activities,
    together with liquidity available under our Amended Credit
    Agreement and local working capital facilities, will be
    sufficient to fund currently anticipated working capital needs
    and capital spending requirements for at least the next several
    years.

Contractual
    Obligations

The following summarizes certain of our contractual obligations

In addition to the above table, we also have liabilities for
    income taxes, pension and post-retirement funding. However we
    cannot determine the timing or the amounts for periods beyond
    2007 for income taxes and beyond 2008 for pension and
    post-retirement funding.

We have purchase commitments for materials, supplies, services
    and fixed assets in the normal course of business. Due to the
    proprietary nature of many of our materials and processes,
    certain supply contracts contain penalty provisions. We do not
    expect potential payments under these provisions to materially
    affect results of operations or financial condition. This
    conclusion is based upon reasonably likely outcomes derived by
    reference to historical experience and current business plans.



Share Repurchase
    Program

We have a share repurchase program that was announced in 2004.
    Under the program, we have been authorized to buy back up to
    $1.5 billion of the Company’s common shares. As of
    December 31, 2007, there were $641.1 million of
    remaining common shares authorized to be repurchased under the
    plan by December 31, 2010. The share repurchases are
    expected to be funded from cash balances, borrowings and cash
    generated from operating activities. Repurchases will be made
    through open market transactions, and the timing will depend on
    the level of acquisition activity, business and market
    conditions, the stock price, trading restrictions and other
    factors. We have purchased 13.0 million shares since the
    inception of the program through December 31, 2007.

During the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, we spent
    $324.6 million and $265.9 million on the repurchase of
    3,384,731 shares and 4,141,559 shares at an average
    price per share of $95.88 and $64.18, respectively. An
    additional $5.2 million and $5.4 million relating to
    the settlement of shares repurchased as of December 31,
    2007 and 2006 were cash settled during 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. We reissued 567,205 shares and
    1,152,892 shares held in treasury for the exercise of stock
    options during 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Off-Balance Sheet
    Arrangements

Currently, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have
    or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on
    our financial condition, changes in financial condition,
    revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital
    expenditures or capital resources that is material.

Effect of
    Currency on Results of Operations

Because we conduct operations in many countries, our operating
    income can be significantly affected by fluctuations in currency
    exchange rates. Swiss franc-denominated expenses represent a
    much greater percentage of our operating expenses than Swiss
    franc-denominated sales represent of our net sales. In part,
    this is because most of our manufacturing costs in Switzerland
    relate to products that are sold outside Switzerland. Moreover,
    a substantial percentage of our research and development
    expenses and general and administrative expenses are incurred in
    Switzerland. Therefore, if the Swiss franc strengthens against
    all or most of our major trading currencies (e.g

.

, the
    U.S. dollar, the euro, other major European currencies, the
    Chinese yuan and the Japanese yen), our operating profit is
    reduced. We also have significantly more sales in European
    currencies (other than the Swiss franc) than we have expenses in
    those currencies. Therefore, when European currencies weaken
    against the U.S. dollar and the Swiss franc, it also
    decreases our operating profits. Accordingly, the Swiss franc
    exchange rate to the euro is an important cross-rate that we
    monitor. We estimate that a 1% strengthening of the Swiss franc
    against the euro would result in a decrease in our earnings
    before tax of $1.1 million to $1.3 million on an
    annual basis. In addition to the effects of exchange rate
    movements on operating profits, our debt levels can fluctuate
    due to changes in exchange rates, particularly between the
    U.S. dollar and the Swiss franc. Based on our outstanding
    debt at December 31, 2007, we estimate that a 10% weakening
    of the U.S. dollar against the currencies in which our debt
    is denominated would result in an increase of approximately
    $12.4 million in the reported U.S. dollar value of the
    debt.

Taxes

We are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions throughout the
    world. Our effective tax rate and tax liability will be affected
    by a number of factors, such as the amount of taxable income in
    particular jurisdictions, the tax rates in such jurisdictions,
    tax treaties between jurisdictions, the extent to which we
    transfer funds between jurisdictions, earnings repatriations
    between jurisdictions and changes in law. Generally, the tax
    liability for each taxpayer within the group is determined
    either (i) on a non-consolidated/non-combined basis or
    (ii) on a consolidated/combined basis only with other
    eligible entities subject to tax in the same jurisdiction, in
    either case without regard to the taxable losses of
    non-consolidated/non-combined affiliated legal entities.



Environmental
    Matters

We are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the
    jurisdictions in which we operate. We own or lease a number of
    properties and manufacturing facilities around the world. Like
    many of our competitors, we have incurred, and will continue to
    incur, capital and operating expenditures and other costs in
    complying with such laws and regulations.

We are currently involved in, or have potential liability with
    respect to, the remediation of past contamination in certain of
    our facilities in both the United States and abroad. Our former
    subsidiary, Hi-Speed, was one of two private parties ordered to
    perform certain ground water contamination monitoring under an
    administrative consent order that NJDEP signed on June 13,
    1988 with respect to certain property in Landing, New Jersey.
    GEI is the other ordered party. GEI has failed to fulfill its
    obligations under the NJDEP consent order, and NJDEP has agreed
    with Hi-Speed that the residual ground water contaminants can be
    monitored through the establishment of a Classification
    Exception Area and concurrent Well Restriction Area for the
    site. The NJDEP does not view these vehicles as remedial
    measures, but rather as “institutional controls” that
    must be adequately maintained and periodically evaluated. We
    estimate that the costs of compliance associated with monitoring
    ground water contamination levels at the site will be
    approximately $0.5 million in the coming years.

In addition, certain of our present and former facilities have
    or had been in operation for many decades and, over such time,
    some of these facilities may have used substances or generated
    and disposed of wastes which are or may be considered hazardous.
    It is possible that these sites, as well as disposal sites owned
    by third parties to which we have sent wastes, may in the future
    be identified and become the subject of remediation.
    Accordingly, although we believe that we are in substantial
    compliance with applicable environmental requirements and to
    date we have not incurred material expenditures in connection
    with environmental matters, it is possible that we could become
    subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future
    that could result in a material adverse effect on our financial
    condition or results of operations or cash flows.

Inflation

Inflation can affect the costs of goods and services that we
    use, including raw materials to manufacture our products. The
    competitive environment in which we operate limits somewhat our
    ability to recover higher costs through increased selling prices.

Moreover, there may be differences in inflation rates between
    countries in which we incur the major portion of our costs and
    other countries in which we sell products, which may limit our
    ability to recover increased costs. We remain committed to
    operations in China and Eastern Europe, which have experienced
    inflationary conditions. To date, inflationary conditions have
    not had a material effect on our operating results. However, as
    our presence in China and Eastern Europe increases, these
    inflationary conditions could have a greater impact on our
    operating results.

Quantitative and
    Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

We have only limited involvement with derivative financial
    instruments and do not use them for trading purposes.

We have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to
    economically hedge short-term intercompany balances with our
    international businesses on a monthly basis. Such contracts
    limit our exposure to both favorable and unfavorable currency
    fluctuations. The fair value of these contracts was a
    $0.6 million gain and a $0.2 million gain at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. A sensitivity
    analysis to changes on these foreign currency-denominated
    contracts indicates that if the primary currency
    (U.S. dollar, Swiss franc and British pound) declined by
    10%, the fair value of these instruments would decrease by
    $1.6 million at December 31, 2007, as compared with a
    decrease of $3.5 million at December 31, 2006. Any
    resulting changes in fair value would be offset by changes in
    the underlying hedged balance sheet position. The sensitivity
    analysis assumes a parallel shift in foreign currency exchange
    rates. The assumption that exchange rates change in parallel
    fashion may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on
    assets and liabilities



denominated in a foreign currency. We also have other currency
    risks as described under “Effect of Currency on Results of
    Operations.”

We have entered into certain interest rate swap agreements.
    These contracts are more fully described in Note 4 to our
    audited consolidated financial statements. The fair value of
    these contracts was a $0.6 million gain at
    December 31, 2007 and a $0.4 million loss at
    December 31, 2006. Based on our agreements outstanding at
    December 31, 2007, a 100-basis-point increase in interest
    rates would result in a decrease in the net aggregate market
    value of these instruments of $0.8 million, as compared
    with a decrease of $1.0 million at December 31, 2006.
    Conversely, a 100-basis-point decrease in interest rates would
    result in a $0.9 million increase in the net aggregate
    market value of these instruments at December 31, 2007, as
    compared with a net increase of $1.1 million at
    December 31, 2006. Any change in fair value would not
    affect our consolidated statement of operations unless such
    agreements and the debt they hedge were prematurely settled.

Critical
    Accounting Policies

Management’s discussion and analysis of our financial
    condition and results of operations is based upon our audited
    consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in
    accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these
    consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates
    and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
    liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of
    contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we
    evaluate our estimates, including those related to pensions and
    other post-retirement benefits, inventories, intangible assets,
    income taxes, revenue and warranty costs. We base our estimates
    on historical experience and on various other assumptions that
    are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the
    results of which form the basis for making judgments about the
    carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily
    apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from
    these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our
    more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation
    of our audited consolidated financial statements. For a detailed
    discussion on the application of these and other accounting
    policies, see Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial
    statements.

Employee benefit
    plans

The net periodic pension cost for 2007 and projected benefit
    obligation as of December 31, 2007 were $0.8 million
    and $107.2 million, respectively, for our U.S. pension
    plans and $8.2 million and $605.3 million,
    respectively, for our international pension plans. The net
    periodic post-retirement cost for 2007 and expected
    postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2007
    for our U.S. post-retirement medical benefit plan were
    $0.8 million and $22.0 million, respectively.

Pension and post-retirement benefit plan expense and obligations
    are developed from assumptions utilized in actuarial valuations.
    The most significant of these assumptions include the discount
    rate and expected return on plan assets. In accordance with
    U.S. GAAP, actual results that differ from the assumptions
    are accumulated and deferred over future periods. While
    management believes the assumptions used are appropriate,
    differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may
    affect our plan obligations and future expense.

The expected rates of return on the various defined benefit
    pension plans’ assets are based on the asset allocation of
    each plan and the long-term projected return of those assets,
    which represent a diversified mix of U.S. and international
    corporate equities and government and corporate debt securities.
    In April 2002, we froze our U.S. defined benefit pension
    plan and discontinued our retiree medical program for certain
    current and all future employees. Consequently, no significant
    future service costs will be incurred on these plans. For 2007,
    the weighted average return on assets assumption was 8.5% for
    the U.S. plan and 5.2% for the international plans. A
    change in the rate of return of 1% would impact annual benefit
    plan expense by approximately $5.3 million after tax.



The discount rates for defined benefit and post-retirement plans
    are set by benchmarking against high-quality corporate bonds.
    For 2007, the average discount rate assumption was 6.25% for the
    U.S. plans and 3.90% for the international plans,
    representing a weighted average of local rates in countries
    where such plans exist. A decrease in the discount rate of 1%
    would impact annual benefit plan expense by approximately
    $2.7 million after tax.

In 2007 and 2006, we made voluntary incremental funding payments
    of $7.7 million and $6.0 million, respectively, to
    reduce the underfunded status of our U.S. and U.K. pension
    plans. In the future, we may make additional mandatory or
    discretionary contributions to our plan or we could be required
    to make additional cash funding payments.

Equity
    compensation

We also have an equity incentive plan that provides for the
    grant of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units
    and other equity-based awards which, as of January 1, 2006,
    are accounted for and recognized in the consolidated statement
    of operations based on the grant-date fair value of the award
    under SFAS No. 123R, “Share-Based Payment”
    (“SFAS 123R”). Prior to January 1, 2006,
    these equity awards were accounted for under the intrinsic value
    method pursuant to Accounting Principles Board Opinion
    No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
    Employees” and related interpretations. Note 10 to the
    audited consolidated financial statements provides supplemental
    information, including pro forma earnings and earnings per
    share, as if we had accounted for options based on the fair
    value method prescribed by SFAS No. 123,
    “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.” These
    methodologies yield an estimate of fair value based in part on a
    number of management estimates, the most significant of which
    include future volatility and estimated option lives. Changes in
    these assumptions could significantly impact the estimated fair
    value of stock options.

Inventory

As of December 31, 2007, inventories were
    $173.7 million.

We record our inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable
    value. Cost, which includes direct materials, labor and
    overhead, is generally determined using the first in, first out
    (FIFO) method. The estimated net realizable value is based on
    assumptions for future demand and related pricing. Adjustments
    to the cost basis of our inventory are made for excess and
    obsolete items based on usage, orders and technological
    obsolescence. If actual market conditions are less favorable
    than those projected by management, reductions in the value of
    inventory may be required.

Goodwill and
    other intangible assets

As of December 31, 2007, our consolidated balance sheet
    included goodwill of $440.8 million and other intangible
    assets of $100.0 million.

Our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other
    intangible assets, which affect the amount of future period
    amortization expense and possible impairment expense that we
    will incur. The determination of the value of such intangible
    assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions
    that affect our consolidated financial statements.

In accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and
    Other Intangible Assets” (“SFAS 142”), our
    goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not
    amortized, but are evaluated for impairment annually in the
    fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired. The
    evaluation is based on valuation models that estimate fair value
    based on expected future cash flows and profitability
    projections. In preparing the valuation models, we consider a
    number of factors, including operating results, business plans,
    economic conditions, future cash flows and transactions and
    market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to
    these factors and our judgment in applying them to the
    impairment analyses. The most significant of these estimates and
    assumptions within our fair value models include estimated cash
    flows resulting from estimates of sales growth and controllable
    cost growth, perpetual



growth, effective tax rates and discount rates. Our assessments
    to date have indicated that there has been no impairment of
    these assets.

Should any of these estimates or assumptions in the preceding
    paragraphs change, or should we incur lower than expected
    operating performance or cash flows, we may experience a
    triggering event that requires a new fair value assessment for
    our reporting units, possibly prior to the required annual
    assessment. These types of events and resulting analysis could
    result in impairment charges for goodwill and other
    indefinite-lived intangible assets if the fair value estimate
    declines below the carrying value.

Our amortization expense related to intangible assets with
    finite lives may materially change should our estimates of their
    useful lives change.

As of December 31, 2004, our intangible assets included a
    $19.9 million indefinite life intangible asset relating to
    an intellectual property license. This license was previously
    subject to litigation with the grantor, and on June 6,
    2005, we were ordered to pay $0.6 million in damages and
    the respective intellectual property license was terminated. Due
    to the cancellation of the license, we concluded that the
    intangible asset had no future benefit and as such, during the
    second quarter of 2005, we wrote off the total value of the
    asset, $19.9 million ($12 million after tax). This
    charge has been included as a component of Other (income)
    charges, net within the Statement of Operations. The damages of
    $0.6 million were subsequently reversed during 2006.

Income
    taxes

Income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities
    reflect management’s assessment of actual future taxes to
    be paid on items in the consolidated financial statements. We
    record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets
    to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. While
    we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and
    feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the
    valuation allowance, in the event we were to determine that we
    would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future
    in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to the
    deferred tax asset would increase income, equity or goodwill in
    the period such determination was made. Likewise, should we
    determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of
    the net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the
    deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such
    determination was made.

We have undistributed earnings of

non-U.S. subsidiaries

and currently believe that there will be no cost associated with
    the repatriation of such foreign earnings.

The significant assumptions and estimates described in the
    preceding paragraphs are important contributors to our ultimate
    effective tax rate for each year in addition to our income mix
    from geographical regions. If any of our assumptions or
    estimates were to change, or should our income mix from our
    geographical regions change, our effective tax rate could be
    materially affected. Based on earnings before taxes of
    $242.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2007,
    each increase of $2.4 million in tax expense would increase
    our effective tax rate by 1%.

Revenue
    recognition

Revenue is recognized when title to a product has transferred
    and any significant customer obligations have been fulfilled.
    Standard shipping terms are generally FOB shipping point in most
    countries and, accordingly, title transfers upon shipment. In
    countries where title cannot legally transfer before delivery,
    we defer revenue recognition until delivery has occurred. Other
    than a few small software applications, we do not sell software
    products without the related hardware instrument as the software
    is embedded in the instrument. Our typical solution requires no
    significant production, modification or customization of the
    hardware or software that is essential to the functionality of
    the products. To the extent our solutions have a post shipment
    obligation, such as customer acceptance, revenue is deferred
    until the obligation has been completed. In addition, we also
    defer revenue where installation is required, unless such
    installation is perfunctory. We also generally maintain the
    right to accept or reject a product return in our terms and
    conditions and we also maintain accruals for outstanding
    credits. Distributor discounts are offset against



revenue at the time such revenue is recognized. Revenues from
    service contracts are recognized ratably over the contract
    period. Shipping and handling costs charged to customers are
    included in total net sales and the associated expense is
    recorded in cost of sales for all periods presented.

Warranty

We generally offer one-year warranties on most of our products.
    Product warranties are recorded at the time revenue is
    recognized for certain product shipments. While we engage in
    extensive product quality programs and processes, our warranty
    obligation is affected by product failure rates, material usage
    and service costs incurred in correcting a product failure. If
    we experience claims or significant cost changes in material,
    freight and vendor charges, our cost of goods sold could be
    affected.

Conclusions
    Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and
    Procedures and Changes in Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting

Our management carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of
    our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the
    period covered by this annual report under the supervision and
    with the participation of our disclosure committee, our Chief
    Financial Officer and Chief Executive Officer. Based upon that
    evaluation, our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Executive
    Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
    are effective in permitting us to comply with our disclosure
    obligations and ensure that the material information required to
    be disclosed is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
    within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the
    SEC. There were no changes in our internal control over
    financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31,
    2007 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
    materially affect, our control over financial reporting.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal
    control over financial reporting is a process designed to
    provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
    financial reporting and the preparation of the Company’s
    financial statements for external reporting purposes in
    accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2007. In making this assessment, we used the
    criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
    of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework. Based on our
    assessment, we concluded that, as of December 31, 2007, the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting is
    effective.

PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm that audited the financial statements included
    in this Report on

Form 10-K,

has issued an attestation report on our internal control over
    financial reporting which appears on

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and

Shareholders of Mettler-Toledo International Inc.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
    the index appearing on

page F-1

present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
    of Mettler-Toledo International Inc. and its subsidiaries at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the results of their operations
    and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
    ended December 31, 2007 in conformity with accounting
    principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
    In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedules
    appearing on

page S-1

present fairly, in all material respects, the information set
    forth therein when read in conjunction with the related
    consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the
    Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
    control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007,
    based on criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The
    Company’s management is responsible for these financial
    statements and financial statement schedules, for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our
    responsibility is to express opinions on these financial
    statements, on the financial statement schedules, and on the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance
    with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
    Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
    perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
    the financial statements are free of material misstatement and
    whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
    maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial
    statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence
    supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
    statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
    significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
    overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal
    control over financial reporting included obtaining an
    understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
    assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
    and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
    internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also
    included performing such other procedures as we considered
    necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
    provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

As described in Note 10 to the consolidated financial
    statements, effective January 1, 2006 the Company changed
    the manner in which it accounts for share-based compensation. As
    described in Note 11, at December 31, 2006, the
    Company changed the manner in which it records the funded status
    of its defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans.
    In addition, as described in Note 12 effective
    January 1, 2007 the Company changed the manner in which it
    accounts for uncertain tax positions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

F-2


Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

    INTERNATIONAL INC.

NOTES TO THE
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(In thousands,
    except share data, unless otherwise stated)

1.

BUSINESS
    DESCRIPTION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

Mettler-Toledo International Inc. (“Mettler-Toledo” or
    the “Company”) is a leading global supplier of
    precision instruments and services. The Company manufactures
    weighing instruments for use in laboratory, industrial,
    packaging, logistics and food retailing applications. The
    Company also manufactures several related analytical instruments
    and provides automated chemistry solutions used in drug and
    chemical compound discovery and development. In addition, the
    Company manufactures metal detection and other

end-of-line

inspection systems used in production and packaging and provides
    solutions for use in certain process analytics applications. The
    Company’s primary manufacturing facilities are located in
    China, Germany, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United
    States. The Company’s principal executive offices are
    located in Greifensee, Switzerland and Columbus, Ohio.

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
    accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and
    include all entities in which the Company has control, which are
    its majority-owned subsidiaries.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and
    assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
    liabilities, as well as disclosure of contingent assets and
    liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the
    reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
    periods. Actual results may differ from those estimates.

All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.

2.

SUMMARY OF
    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Cash and Cash
    Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with
    original maturity dates of three months or less. The carrying
    value of these cash equivalents approximates fair value.

Trade Accounts
    Receivable

Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount
    and do not bear interest. The allowance for doubtful accounts
    represents the Company’s best estimate of probable credit
    losses in its existing trade accounts receivable. The Company
    determines the allowance based upon a review of both specific
    accounts for collection and the age of the accounts receivable
    portfolio.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable
    value. Cost, which includes direct materials, labor and
    overhead, is generally determined using the first in, first out
    (FIFO) method. The estimated net realizable value is based on
    assumptions for future demand and related pricing. Adjustments
    to the cost basis of our inventory are made for excess and
    obsolete items based on usage, orders and technological
    obsolescence. If actual market conditions are less favorable
    than those projected by management, reductions in the value of
    inventory may be required.

NOTES TO THE
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands,
    except share data, unless otherwise stated)

Long-Lived
    Assets

a)  Property,
    Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less
    accumulated depreciation. Repair and maintenance costs are
    charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation and amortization
    are charged on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful
    lives of the assets as follows:

Buildings and improvements

15 to 50 years

Machinery and equipment

3 to 12 years

Computer software

3 to 5 years

Leasehold improvements

Shorter of useful life or lease term

b)  Capitalized
    Software

In accordance with Statement of Position

98-1,

“Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or
    Obtained for Internal Use”

(“SOP 98-1”),

the Company expenses all internal-use software costs incurred in
    the preliminary project stage and capitalizes certain direct
    costs associated with the development and purchase of
    internal-use software within property, plant and equipment.
    Capitalized costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over
    the estimated useful lives of the software, generally not
    exceeding five years.

c)  Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets

In accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and
    Other Intangible Assets” (“SFAS 142”),
    goodwill, representing the excess of purchase price over the net
    asset value of companies acquired, and indefinite-lived
    intangible assets are not amortized, but are reviewed for
    impairment annually in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if
    events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might
    be impaired. The annual evaluation is based on valuation models
    that estimate fair value based on expected future cash flows and
    profitability projections.

Other intangible assets also include definite-lived assets which
    are subject to amortization. Where applicable, amortization is
    charged on a straight-line basis over the expected period to be
    benefited. The straight-line method of amortization reflects an
    appropriate allocation of the cost of the intangible assets to
    earnings in proportion to the amount of economic benefits
    obtained by the Company in each reporting period. The Company
    assesses the recoverability of other intangible assets subject
    to amortization in accordance with SFAS No. 144,
    “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
    Assets” (“SFAS 144”).

Accounting for
    Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

In accordance with SFAS 144, the Company assesses the need
    to record impairment losses on long-lived assets with finite
    lives when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
    carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. An impairment
    loss would be recognized when future estimated undiscounted cash
    flows expected to result from use of the asset are less than the
    asset’s carrying value, with the loss measured at fair
    value based on discounted expected cash flows.

Taxation

The Company files tax returns in each jurisdiction in which it
    operates. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for
    the future tax consequences attributable to differences between
    the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
    liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss
    and tax

    INTERNATIONAL INC.

NOTES TO THE
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands,
    except share data, unless otherwise stated)

credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
    measured using enacted tax rates in the respective jurisdictions
    in which the Company operates. In assessing the ability to
    realize deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is
    more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred
    tax assets will not be realized.

Deferred taxes are not provided on the unremitted earnings of
    subsidiaries outside of the United States when it is expected
    that these earnings are permanently reinvested. Such earnings
    may become taxable upon the sale or liquidation of these
    subsidiaries or upon the remittance of dividends. Deferred taxes
    are provided when the Company no longer considers subsidiary
    earnings to be permanently invested, such as in situations where
    the Company’s subsidiaries plan to make future dividend
    distributions.

The Company recognizes accrued amounts of interest and penalties
    related to its uncertain tax positions as part of income tax
    expense within its consolidated statement of operations.

Currency
    Translation and Transactions

The reporting currency for the consolidated financial statements
    of the Company is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency
    for the Company’s operations is generally the applicable
    local currency. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of
    companies whose functional currency is other than the
    U.S. dollar are included in the consolidated financial
    statements by translating the assets and liabilities into the
    reporting currency at the exchange rates applicable at the end
    of the reporting period. The statements of operations and cash
    flows of such

non-U.S. dollar

functional currency operations are translated at the monthly
    average exchange rates during the year. Translation gains or
    losses are accumulated in other comprehensive income (loss) in
    the consolidated statements of shareholders’ equity.
    Transaction gains and losses are included as a component of net
    earnings.

Revenue
    Recognition

Revenue is recognized when title to a product has transferred
    and any significant customer obligations have been fulfilled.
    Standard shipping terms are generally FOB shipping point in most
    countries and, accordingly, title transfers upon shipment. In
    countries where title cannot legally transfer before delivery,
    we defer revenue recognition until delivery has occurred. Other
    than a few small software applications, we do not sell software
    products without the related hardware instrument as the software
    is embedded in the instrument. The Company’s products
    typically require no significant production, modification or
    customization of the hardware or software that is essential to
    the functionality of the products. To the extent the
    Company’s solutions have a post shipment obligation, such
    as customer acceptance, revenue is deferred until the obligation
    has been completed. In addition, we also defer revenue where
    installation is required, unless such installation is deemed
    perfunctory. We also generally maintain the right to accept or
    reject a product return in our terms and conditions and we also
    maintain accruals for outstanding credits. Distributor discounts
    are offset against revenue at the time such revenue is
    recognized. Revenues from service contracts are recognized
    ratably over the contract period. Shipping and handling costs
    charged to customers are included in total net sales and the
    associated expense is recorded in cost of sales for all periods
    presented.

Research and
    Development

Research and development costs primarily consist of salaries,
    consulting and other costs. The Company expenses these costs as
    incurred.

Warranty

The Company generally offers one-year warranties on most of its
    products. Product warranties are recorded at the time revenue is
    recognized for certain product shipments. While the Company
    engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, our
    warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates,
    material usage and service costs incurred in correcting a
    product failure.

Earnings per
    Common Share

In accordance with the treasury stock method, the Company has
    included 927,714, 719,757 and 1,077,344 equivalent shares in the
    calculation of diluted weighted average number of common shares
    for the years ending December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively, relating to outstanding stock options and
    restricted stock units.

Outstanding options to purchase 146,125, 416,375 and
    127,125 shares of common stock for the years ending
    December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, have been
    excluded from the calculation of diluted weighted average number
    of common and common equivalent shares as such options would be
    anti-dilutive.

Equity-Based
    Compensation

The Company applies the fair value methodology under Statement
    of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R,
    “Share-Based Compensation”
    (“SFAS 123R”), and related interpretations in
    accounting for its equity-based compensation plan.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

The Company has only limited involvement with derivative
    financial instruments and does not use them for trading
    purposes. As described more fully in Note 4, the Company
    enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to
    economically hedge certain short-term intercompany balances
    involving its international businesses. Such contracts limit the
    Company’s exposure to currency fluctuations on the items
    they hedge. These contracts are adjusted to fair market value as
    of each balance sheet date, with the resulting changes in fair
    value being recognized in the appropriate financial statement
    caption in the income statement consistent with the underlying
    hedged item.

The Company also enters into certain interest rate swap
    agreements in order to manage its exposure to changes in
    interest rates. The differential paid or received on interest
    rate swap agreements is recognized in interest expense over the
    life of the agreements as incurred. The Company’s fixed to
    floating interest rate swap agreements are accounted for as fair
    value hedges. The change in fair value of outstanding interest
    rate swap agreements that are effective as fair value hedges is
    recognized in earnings as incurred and is offset by the change
    in fair value of the hedged item.

New Accounting
    Pronouncements

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued FASB Statement No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS 157”)
    which clarifies how companies are required to use a fair value
    measure for recognition or disclosure. SFAS 157 establishes
    a common definition of fair value, establishes a framework for
    measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value
    measurements. The Statement will be effective for financial
    statements issued by the Company beginning January 1, 2008
    and for the interim periods within 2008. In January 2008 the
    FASB issued FASB Staff Position

FAS 157-b,

“Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157”
    (“FSP 157-b”). FSP 157-b delays the
    effective date of SFAS 157,

Fair Value Measurements,

for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities,
    except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in
    the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least
    annually) until fiscal years beginning after

November 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal
    years. The Company does not believe that the adoption of
    SFAS 157 or FSP 157-b will have a material impact on
    its consolidated results of operations or financial position.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,
    “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities” (“SFAS 159”). SFAS 159
    permits companies to elect on an

instrument-by-instrument

basis to fair value certain financial assets and financial
    liabilities with changes in fair value recognized in earnings as
    they occur. The election to fair value is generally irrevocable.
    The Statement will be effective for the Company beginning
    January 1, 2008. The Company has elected not to take the
    fair value option allowable under this Statement.

In December 2007, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 141R,
    “Business Combinations” (“SFAS 141R”).
    SFAS 141R establishes principles and requirements for how
    the acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements
    the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and
    any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree, measures the
    goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a
    bargain purchase and what information to disclose to enable
    users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and
    financial effects of the business combination. SFAS 141R
    will be effective for the Company beginning after
    January 1, 2009 and will impact business combination
    transactions that close subsequent to that date.

FINANCIAL
    INSTRUMENTS

In November 2003, the Company issued $150 million of
    seven-year Senior Notes (the “Senior Notes”). In
    connection with this issuance, the Company entered into an
    interest rate swap agreement, designated as a fair value hedge,
    which changes the fixed interest obligation associated with
    $30 million of the Senior Notes into a floating rate. This
    agreement has a maturity date of November 15, 2010. Under
    the swap, the Company will receive a fixed interest rate of
    4.85% (i.e., the same rate as the Senior Notes) and pay interest
    at a rate of LIBOR plus 0.22%. At December 31, 2007 and
    2006, the fair value of the swap was a gain of approximately
    $0.6 million and a loss of $0.4 million, respectively.

At December 31, 2007, the Company had outstanding foreign
    currency forward contracts with notional amounts of
    $67.6 million, in order to economically hedge short-term
    intercompany balances with its foreign businesses. The fair
    value of these contracts was a $0.6 million gain and a
    $0.2 million gain as of December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively.

The Company may be exposed to credit losses in the event of
    nonperformance by the counterparties to its derivative financial
    instrument contracts. Counterparties are established banks and
    financial institutions with high credit ratings. The Company
    believes that such counterparties will be able to fully satisfy
    their obligations under these contracts.

    periods ranging from 7 to 45 years. The straight-line
    method of amortization reflects an appropriate allocation of the
    cost of the intangible assets to

Credit
    Agreement

In November 2005, we entered into an amended and restated credit
    agreement (the “Credit Agreement”). The
    $450 million Amended Credit Agreement is provided by a
    group of financial institutions and has a maturity date of
    November 5, 2010. It is not subject to any scheduled
    principal payments. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear
    interest at current market rates plus a margin based on our
    senior unsecured credit ratings (currently “BBB” by
    Standard & Poor’s and “Baa3” by
    Moody’s) and is currently set at LIBOR plus 0.375%. We must
    also pay facility fees that are tied to our credit ratings. The
    Credit Agreement contains covenants, for which the Company was
    in compliance as of December 31, 2007, including
    maintaining a ratio of debt to earnings before interest, tax,
    depreciation and amortization of less than 3.25 to 1.0 and an
    interest coverage ratio of more than 3.5 to 1.0. The Credit
    Agreement also places certain limitations on us, including

F-14


METTLER-TOLEDO
    INTERNATIONAL INC.

NOTES TO THE
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands,
    except share data, unless otherwise stated)

limiting the ability to grant liens or incur debt at a
    subsidiary level. In addition, the Credit Agreement has several
    events of default, including upon a change of control. The
    borrowings under the Credit Agreement have been classified as
    long-term debt in accordance with the Company’s intent and
    ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis. As
    of December 31, 2007, approximately $216.8 million was
    available under the facility. The Credit Agreement is unsecured.
    The Company incurred fees of approximately $0.9 million in
    conjunction with amending and restating the Credit Agreement
    which are being amortized to interest expense through 2010.

Senior
    Notes

In November 2003, the Company issued $150 million of 4.85%
    unsecured Senior Notes due November 15, 2010. The Senior
    Notes rank equally with all our unsecured and unsubordinated
    indebtedness. Interest is payable semi-annually in May and
    November. Discount and issuance costs approximated
    $1.2 million and are being amortized to interest expense
    over the seven-year term of the Senior Notes. At the
    Company’s option, the Senior Notes may be redeemed in whole
    or in part at any time at a redemption price equal to the
    greater of:

•

the principal amount of the Senior Notes, or

•

the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled
    payments of principal and interest thereon discounted to the
    redemption date on a semi-annual basis at a comparable treasury
    rate plus a margin of 0.20%.

The Senior Notes contain limitations on the ability to incur
    liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions exceeding
    10% of the Company’s consolidated net worth.

Other Local
    Arrangements

During 2006, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company issued and
    sold $10 million of redeemable equity instruments to one of
    the Company’s

non-U.S. sponsored

defined benefit plans. These instruments are redeemable
    beginning in July 2011 and, as such, are classified as long-term
    debt on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet.

The Company’s weighted average interest rate for the years
    ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was approximately 6% and
    4% respectively. The carrying value of the Company’s debt
    obligations approximates fair value.

SHAREHOLDERS’
    EQUITY

Common
    Stock

The number of authorized shares of the Company’s common
    stock is 125,000,000 shares with a par value of $0.01 per
    share. Holders of the Company’s common stock are entitled
    to one vote per share. At December 31, 2007,
    5,112,020 shares of the Company’s common stock were
    reserved for issuance pursuant to the Company’s stock
    option plans.

Preferred
    Stock

The Board of Directors, without further shareholder
    authorization, is authorized to issue up to
    10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per
    share in one or more series and to determine and fix the rights,
    preferences and privileges of each series, including dividend
    rights and preferences over dividends on the common stock and
    one or more series of the preferred stock, conversion rights,
    voting rights (in addition to those provided by law), redemption
    rights and the terms of any sinking fund therefore, and

F-15


METTLER-TOLEDO
    INTERNATIONAL INC.

NOTES TO THE
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands,
    except share data, unless otherwise stated)

rights upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, including
    preferences over the common stock and one or more series of the
    preferred stock. The issuance of shares of preferred stock, or
    the issuance of rights to purchase such shares, may have the
    effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control
    of the Company or an unsolicited acquisition proposal.

Restricted Stock
    Units

In 2007 and 2006, the Company granted 43,885 and 61,100,
    respectively, restricted stock units to certain employees and
    directors. The grant-date fair value of the restricted stock
    units granted in 2007 and 2006 was $105.11 and $68.06 per unit,
    respectively, and the restricted units vest ratably over a
    five-year period. The total fair value of the restricted stock
    units on the date of grant for 2007 and 2006 of
    $4.6 million and $4.2 million, respectively, will be
    recorded as compensation expense ratably over the vesting
    period. Approximately $1.7 million and $0.9 million of
    compensation expense was recognized during the years ended
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Shareholder
    Rights Plan

On August 26, 2002, the Board of Directors adopted a
    Shareholder Rights Plan under which the Company declared a
    non-cash dividend of one right for each outstanding share of
    common stock. The Rights, which expire on September 5,
    2012, entitle stockholders to buy one one-thousandth of a share
    of preferred stock at an exercise price of $150. The Rights were
    distributed to those stockholders of record as of close of
    business on September 5, 2002 and are attached to all
    certificates representing those shares of common stock.

The Rights Plan provides that should any person or group
    acquire, or announce a tender or exchange offer for 15% or more
    of the Company’s common stock, each Right, other than
    Rights held by the acquiring person or group, would entitle its
    holder to purchase a number of shares of the Company’s
    common stock for 50% of its then-current market value. Unless a
    15% acquisition has occurred, the Rights may be redeemed by the
    Board of Directors of the Company at any time. The Rights Plan
    will not be triggered by a tender or exchange offer for all
    outstanding shares of the Company at a price and on terms that
    the Company’s Board of Directors determines to be adequate
    and in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders.

The Rights Plan exempts any stockholder that beneficially owned
    15% or more of the Company’s common stock as of
    August 26, 2002. However, the Rights will become
    exercisable if, at any time after August 26, 2002, any of
    these stockholders acquire additional shares of the
    Company’s common stock in an amount which is greater than
    2% of the Company’s outstanding common stock.

Share Repurchase
    Program

The Company has a share repurchase program that was announced in
    2004. Under the program, the Company has been authorized to buy
    back up to $1.5 billion of common shares. As of
    December 31, 2007, there were $641.1 million of
    remaining common shares authorized to be repurchased under the
    plan by December 31, 2010. The share repurchases are
    expected to be funded from cash balances, borrowings and cash
    generated from operating activities. Repurchases will be made
    through open market transactions, and the timing will depend on
    the level of acquisition activity, business and market
    conditions, the stock price, trading restrictions and other
    factors. The Company has purchased 13.0 million shares
    since the inception of the program through December 31,
    2007.

During the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, the
    Company spent $324.6 million and $265.9 million on the
    repurchase of 3,384,731 shares and 4,141,559 shares at
    an average price per share of $95.88 and $64.18, respectively.
    $5.2 million and $5.4 million relating to the
    settlement of shares repurchased as of December 31, 2007
    and 2006 were cash settled during 2008 and 2007, respectively.
    The Company reissued

567,205 shares and 1,152,892 shares held in treasury
    for the exercise of stock options during 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. In connection with prior reissuances, during 2006,
    the Company has reclassified amounts within stockholders’
    equity to reflect the differential between treasury stock cost
    and option proceeds as part of retained earnings rather than
    additional paid-in capital.

EQUITY INCENTIVE
    PLAN

The Company’s equity incentive plan provides employees and
    directors of the Company additional incentive to join

and/or

remain in the service of the Company as well as to maintain and
    enhance the long-term performance and profitability of the
    Company. The Company’s 2004 equity incentive plan was
    approved by shareholders on May 6, 2004 and provides that
    3.5 million shares of common stock, plus any options
    outstanding under the Company’s prior option plan that
    terminate without being exercised, may be the subject of awards.
    Of the 3.5 million shares of common stock available for
    awards, up to 2.1 million shares may be issued in the form
    of restricted stock or restricted stock units. The plan provides
    for the grant of options, restricted stock, restricted stock
    units and other equity-based awards. The exercise price of
    options granted shall not be less than the fair market value of
    the common stock on the date of the award. Options generally
    vest equally over a five-year period from the date of grant and
    have a maximum term of up to 10 years and six months.
    Restricted units vest equally over a five-year period from the
    date of grant. During 2005, the compensation committee of the
    Board of Directors determined to grant restricted share units to
    participating managers and non-qualified stock options to
    executive officers.

On January 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS 123R and
    Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 107,
    “Share-Based Payments,” applying the modified
    prospective method. SFAS 123R requires all share-based
    compensation arrangements granted to employees, including stock
    option grants, to be recognized in the consolidated statement of
    operations based on the grant date fair value of the award over
    the period during which an employee is required to provide
    service in exchange for the award. Under the modified
    prospective method, the Company is required to record
    share-based compensation expense for all awards granted after
    the date of adoption and for the unvested portion of previously
    granted awards outstanding as of the date of adoption.

Share-based compensation expense is recorded within selling,
    general and administrative in the consolidated statement of
    operations with a corresponding offset to additional paid-in
    capital in the

BENEFIT
    PLANS

Mettler-Toledo maintains a number of retirement and other
    post-retirement employee benefit plans.

Certain subsidiaries sponsor defined contribution plans.
    Benefits are determined and funded annually based upon the terms
    of the plans. Amounts recognized as cost under these plans
    amounted to $13.8 million, $11.1 million and
    $9.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2007,
    2006 and 2005, respectively.

Certain subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit plans. Benefits are
    provided to employees primarily based upon years of service and
    employees’ compensation for certain periods during the last
    years of employment. Prior to 2002, the Company’s
    U.S. operations also provided post-retirement medical
    benefits to their employees. Contributions for medical benefits
    are related to employee years of service.

    respectively, for the U.S. defined benefit pension plan and
    $530.7 million and $497.7 million, respectively, for

non-U.S. plans.

Certain of the plans included within

non-U.S. Pension

Benefits have benefit obligations which exceed the fair value of

The projected post-retirement benefit obligation was principally
    determined using discount rates of 6.25% in 2007, 5.75% in 2006
    and 5.50% in 2005 and net periodic post-retirement benefit cost
    was principally determined using discount rates of 5.75% in
    2007, 5.50% in 2006 and 5.75% in 2005 and health care cost trend
    rates ranging from 8.0% to 11% in 2007, 8.5% to 12% in 2006 and
    9% to 12.0% in 2005, decreasing to 5.0% in 2011.

The health care cost trend rate assumption has a significant

Investment policies and strategies for each of the
    Company’s pension plans are determined periodically by
    pension trustees for each plan, having regard for the potential
    risks and returns offered by investment in the various assets
    available. Target asset allocation and investment return
    criteria are established by the trustees with the overriding
    objective of stable earnings growth. Actual results are
    monitored against those targets and the trustees are required to
    report to the members of each plan, including an analysis of
    investment performance on an annual basis at a minimum.

Day-to-day

asset management is typically performed by a third-party asset
    management company, reporting to the pension trustees. The
    long-term rate of return on plan asset assumptions used to
    determine pension expense under U.S. GAAP are generally
    based on historical investment performance and the target
    investment return criteria for the future determined by the
    trustees.

    service as appropriate, are expected to be paid:

On January 1, 2007, the Company adopted FASB Interpretation
    No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
    Taxes — an interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109” (“FIN 48”). FIN 48
    prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for
    recording in the financial statements uncertain tax positions
    taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Additionally,
    FIN 48 provides guidance regarding uncertain tax positions
    relating to derecognition, classification, interest and
    penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and
    transition. As of the date of adoption, the Company recognized a
    $4.1 million increase in the liability for unrecognized tax
    benefits with a corresponding reduction in retained earnings.
    The Company’s total balance of unrecognized tax benefits as
    of January 1, 2007 was $24.4 million.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of
    unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

NOTES TO THE

    except share data, unless otherwise stated)

amounts of interest and penalties related to its uncertain tax
    positions as part of its income tax expense within its
    consolidated statement of operations. The amount of accrued
    interest and penalties included within other non-current
    liabilities within the Company’s consolidated balance sheet
    as of December 31, 2007 was $2.3 million.

The Company believes that it is reasonably possible that the
    unrecognized tax benefit balance could change over the next
    12 months, primarily related to potential disputes raised
    by the taxing authorities over income and expense recognition.
    An estimate of the range of these increases cannot currently be
    made. However, the Company does not expect a change would have a
    material impact on its financial position, results of operations
    or cash flows.

The Company has recorded valuation allowances related to certain
    of its deferred income tax assets due to the uncertainty of the
    ultimate realization of future benefits from such assets. The
    potential decrease or increase of the valuation allowance in the
    near term is dependent on the future ability of the Company to
    realize the deferred tax assets that are affected by the future
    profitability of operations in various worldwide jurisdictions.
    The $8.1 million decrease in the total valuation allowance
    during 2007 is primarily attributable to $4.8 million
    related to the expiration or utilization of tax loss
    carryforwards and $3.3 million related to the adoption of
    FIN 48. During 2006, the Company incurred a
    $10.5 million charge related to the establishment of a
    valuation allowance for foreign tax credit carryforwards
    described below. $2.7 million of the Company’s total
    valuation allowance will be credited to shareholders’
    equity if and when realized.

At December 31, 2007, the Company has various
    U.S. state net operating losses and various foreign net
    operating losses that have various expiration periods.

The Company plans to repatriate earnings from China,
    Switzerland, the United Kingdom and certain other countries in
    future years. All other undistributed earnings are considered to
    be permanently reinvested. The Company currently believes that
    there will be no additional cost associated with the
    repatriation of such foreign earnings other than withholding
    taxes.

During the third quarter of 2007, the Company recorded certain
    discrete tax items which resulted in a net tax benefit of
    $1.1 million. The discrete items include a benefit of
    $3.4 million related to a favorable resolution of certain
    tax matters and other adjustments related to prior years, which
    were partially offset by a charge of $2.3 million primarily
    due to a tax law change in Germany.

During 2006, the Company implemented a legal reorganization that
    resulted in a reduction of the estimated annual effective tax
    rate before discrete items from 30% to 27%. In addition to the
    change in the Company’s annual effective tax rate, the
    Company recorded three discrete tax items: a charge of
    $10.5 million related to the establishment of a valuation
    allowance on foreign tax credit carryforwards, a benefit of
    $13.4 million associated with a reduction of a liability
    previously established for estimated costs to repatriate
    unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries and a favorable tax
    law change resulting in a benefit of $5.1 million.

As a result of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, the
    Company repatriated $396 million of cash during 2005 that
    had been generated over time by its foreign operations. As a
    result of this repatriation, the Company recorded additional
    income tax expense of $13.1 million during 2005. This
    amount reflects the federal tax impact in the United States
    (including certain state taxes) of $12.3 million, foreign
    withholding taxes of $2.0 million and a net decrease of
    $1.2 million of deferred tax liabilities associated with
    the reassessment of pre-existing and future dividend
    repatriations. In addition, the Company recorded tax benefits of
    $7.7 million during 2005 related to a favorable resolution
    of certain tax matters.

As of December 31, 2007, the major jurisdictions for which
    the Company is subject to examinations are Germany for years
    after 2002, the United States after 2003, France and Switzerland
    after 2004, the United

Kingdom after 2005 and China after 2006. Additionally, the
    Company is currently under examination in various taxing
    jurisdictions in which it conducts business operations. While
    the Company has not yet received any material assessments from
    these taxing authorities, the Company believes that adequate
    amounts of taxes and related interest and penalties have been
    provided for any adverse adjustments as a result of these
    examinations and that the ultimate outcome of these examinations
    will not result in a material impact on the Company’s
    consolidated results of operations or financial position.

13.

OTHER (INCOME)
    CHARGES, NET

Other (income) charges, net consists primarily of interest
    income, (gains) losses from foreign currency transactions and
    other items.

In 2005, other (income) charges, net included a
    $21.8 million charge related to litigation. In 2005, the
    Company wrote-off a non-cash $19.9 million
    ($12 million after tax) intangible asset relating to an
    intellectual property license that was subject to litigation
    with the grantor which is included as a component of Other and
    Deferred taxes in the interim consolidated statements of cash
    flows. This license enabled a wholly owned subsidiary of the
    Company exclusive rights to distribute certain third-party
    manufactured pipettes in the United States. A judgment entered
    on June 6, 2005 terminated the license agreement and
    awarded damages to the other party. The Company also incurred
    $1.9 million of related legal costs during 2005, which
    includes damages of $0.6 million due to the grantor. The
    damages of $0.6 million were subsequently reversed during
    2006.

    respectively.

Legal

The Company is party to various legal proceedings, including
    certain environmental matters, incidental to the normal course
    of business. Management does not expect that any of such
    proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the
    Company’s financial condition or results of operations.

SEGMENT
    REPORTING

Operating segments are the individual reporting units within the
    Company. These units are managed separately, and it is at this
    level where the determination of resource allocation is made.
    The units have been aggregated based on operating segments in
    geographic regions that have similar economic characteristics

NOTES TO THE

and meet the aggregation criteria of SFAS No. 131,
    “Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
    Information” (“SFAS 131”). The Company has
    determined there are five reportable segments:
    U.S. Operations, Swiss Operations, Western European
    Operations, Chinese Operations and Other.

U.S. Operations represent certain of the Company’s
    marketing and producing organizations located in the United
    States. Western European Operations include the Company’s
    marketing and producing organizations in Western Europe,
    excluding operations located in Switzerland. Swiss Operations
    include marketing and producing organizations located in
    Switzerland as well as extensive R&D operations that are
    responsible for the development, production and marketing of
    precision instruments, including weighing, analytical and
    measurement technologies for use in a variety of industrial and
    laboratory applications. Chinese Operations represent the
    Company’s marketing and producing organizations located in
    China. The Company’s market organizations are
    geographically focused and are responsible for all aspects of
    the Company’s sales and service. Operating segments that
    exist outside these reportable segments are included in Other.

The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same
    as those described in the summary of significant accounting
    policies. The Company evaluates performance based on segment
    profit for segment reporting (gross profit less research and
    development, selling, general and administrative expenses and
    restructuring charges, before amortization, interest expense and
    other charges (income) and taxes). Inter-segment sales and
    transfers are priced to reflect consideration of market
    conditions and the regulations of the countries in which the
    transferring entities are located. The following tables show the
    operations of the Company’s operating segments:
