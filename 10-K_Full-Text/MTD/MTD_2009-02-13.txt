PART I

Item 1.

Business

We are a leading global supplier of precision instruments and
    services. We have strong leadership positions in all of our
    businesses and believe we hold global number-one market
    positions in a majority of them. Specifically, we are the
    largest provider of weighing instruments for use in laboratory,
    industrial and food retailing applications. We are also a
    leading provider of analytical instruments for use in life
    science, reaction engineering and real-time analytic systems
    used in drug and chemical compound development, and process
    analytics instruments used for in-line measurement in production
    processes. In addition, we are the largest supplier of
    end-of-line inspection systems used in production and packaging
    for food, pharmaceutical and other industries.

Our business is geographically diversified, with net sales in
    2008 derived 43% from Europe, 35% from North and South America
    and 22% from Asia and other countries. Our customer base is also
    diversified by industry and by individual customer.

Mettler-Toledo International Inc. was incorporated as a Delaware
    corporation in 1991 and became a publicly traded company with
    its initial public offering in 1997. In 2001, we acquired Rainin
    Instrument, a leading manufacturer of pipetting solutions used
    in pharmaceutical, biotech and medical research applications.

Business
    Segments

We have five reportable segments: U.S. Operations, Swiss
    Operations, Western European Operations, Chinese Operations and
    Other. See Note 16 to the audited consolidated financial
    statements and Item 7. Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under
    “Results of Operations — by Operating
    Segment” included herein for detailed results by segment
    and geographic region.

We manufacture a wide variety of precision instruments and
    provide value-added services to our customers. Our principal
    products and principal services are set forth below. We have
    followed this description of our products and services with
    descriptions of our customers and distribution, sales and
    service, research and development, manufacturing and certain
    other matters. These descriptions apply to substantially all of
    our products and related segments.

Laboratory
    Instruments

We make a wide variety of precision laboratory instruments,
    including laboratory balances, pipettes, titrators, thermal
    analysis systems and other analytical instruments. The
    laboratory instruments business accounted for approximately 44%
    of our net sales in 2008, 2007 and 2006.

Laboratory
    Balances

Our laboratory balances have weighing ranges from one
    ten-millionth of a gram up to 64 kilograms. To cover a wide
    range of customer needs and price points, we market our balances
    in a range of product tiers offering different levels of
    functionality. Based on the same technology platform, we also
    manufacture mass comparators, which are used by weights and
    measures regulators as well as laboratories to ensure the
    accuracy of reference weights. Laboratory balances are primarily
    used in the pharmaceutical, food, chemical, cosmetics and other
    industries.

In 2008, we introduced Quantos, an automated powder dosing
    solution for small sample sizes, which is controlled and
    monitored by the balance. The first step in sample preparation
    for analytical methods is precise weighing of substances, which
    has traditionally been done by hand using a spatula. The Quantos
    dosing system offers automated measuring performance of 200
    grams to 0.005 milligrams.



Pipettes

Pipettes are used in laboratories for dispensing small volumes
    of liquids. We operate our pipette business with the Rainin
    brand name. Rainin develops, manufactures and distributes
    advanced pipettes, tips and accessories, including single- and
    multi-channel manual and electronic pipettes. Rainin maintains
    service centers in the key markets where customers periodically
    send their pipettes for certified recalibrations. Rainin’s
    principal end markets are pharmaceutical, biotech and academia.

Analytical
    Instruments

Titrators measure the chemical composition of samples and are
    used in environmental and research laboratories as well as in
    quality control labs in the pharmaceutical, food and beverage
    and other industries. Our high-end titrators are multi-tasking
    models, which can perform two determinations simultaneously on
    multiple vessels. Our offering includes robotics to automate
    routine work in quality control applications.

Thermal analysis systems measure material properties as a
    function of temperature, such as weight, dimension, energy flow
    and viscoelastic properties. Thermal analysis systems are used
    in nearly every industry, but primarily in the plastics and
    polymer industries and increasingly in the pharmaceutical
    industry.

pH meters measure acidity in laboratory samples. We also sell
    density and refractometry instruments, which measure chemical
    concentrations in solutions. In addition, we manufacture and
    sell moisture analyzers, which precisely determine the moisture
    content of a sample by utilizing an infrared dryer to evaporate
    moisture.

Laboratory
    Software

LabX, our PC-based laboratory software platform, manages and
    analyzes data generated by our balances, titrators, pH meters,
    moisture analyzers and other analytical instruments. LabX
    provides full network capability; has efficient, intuitive
    protocols; and enables customers to collect and archive data in
    compliance with the U.S. Food and Drug
    Administration’s traceability requirements for
    electronically stored data (also known as 21 CFR
    Part 11).

Automated
    Chemistry Solutions

Our current automated chemistry solutions focus on selected
    applications in the chemical and drug discovery process. Our
    automated lab reactors and in situ analysis systems are
    considered integral to the process development and

scale-up

activities of our customers. Our on-line measurement
    technologies based on infrared and laser light scattering
    enables customers to monitor chemical reactions and
    crystallization processes in real time in the lab and plant. We
    believe that our portfolio of integrated technologies can bring
    significant efficiencies to the development process, enabling
    our customers to bring new chemicals and drugs to market faster.

Process
    Analytics

Our process analytics business provides instruments for the
    in-line measurement of liquid parameters used primarily in the
    production process of pharmaceutical, biotech, beverage,
    microelectronics, chemical and refining companies. Approximately
    half of our process analytics sales are to the pharmaceutical
    and biotech markets, where our customers need fast and secure

scale-up

and
    production that meets the validation processes required for GMP
    (Good Manufacturing Processes) and other regulatory standards.
    We are a leading solution provider for liquid analytical
    measurement to control and optimize production processes. Our
    solutions include sensor technology for measuring pH, dissolved
    oxygen, carbon dioxide, conductivity, turbidity, ozone and total
    organic carbons and automated systems for calibration and
    cleaning of measurement points. Intelligent sensor diagnostics
    capabilities enable improved asset management solutions for our
    customers to reduce process downtime and maintenance costs. Our
    instruments offer leading multi-parameter capabilities and
    plant-wide control system integration, which are key for
    integrated measurement of multiple parameters to secure
    production quality and efficiency. With a worldwide network of
    specialists, we support customers in critical process
    applications, compliance and systems integration questions.



Industrial
    Instruments

We manufacture numerous industrial weighing instruments and
    related terminals and offer dedicated software solutions for the
    pharmaceutical, chemical, food and other industries. In
    addition, we manufacture metal detection and other end-of-line
    inspection systems used in production and packaging. We supply
    automatic identification and data capture solutions, which
    integrate in-motion weighing, dimensioning and identification
    technologies for transport, shipping and logistics customers. We
    also offer heavy industrial scales and related software. The
    industrial instruments business accounted for approximately 43%
    of our net sales in both 2008 and 2007 and 42% in 2006.

Industrial
    Weighing Instruments

We offer a comprehensive line of industrial scales and balances,
    such as bench scales and floor scales, for weighing loads from a
    few grams to several thousand kilograms in applications ranging
    from measuring materials in chemical production to weighing mail
    and packages. Our products are used in a wide range of
    applications, such as counting applications and in formulating
    and mixing ingredients.

Industrial
    Terminals

Our industrial scale terminals collect data and integrate it
    into manufacturing processes, helping to automate them. Our
    terminals allow users to remotely download programs or access
    setup data and can minimize downtime through predictive rather
    than reactive maintenance.

Transportation
    and Logistics

We are a leading global supplier of automatic identification and
    data capture solutions, which integrate in-motion weighing,
    dimensioning and identification technologies. With these
    solutions, customers can measure the weight and cubic volume of
    packages for appropriate billing, logistics and quality control.
    Our solutions also integrate into customers’ information
    systems.

Vehicle Scale
    Systems

Our primary heavy industrial products are scales for weighing
    trucks or railcars (i.e., weighing bulk goods as they enter or
    leave a factory or at a toll station). Heavy industrial scales
    are capable of measuring weights up to 500 tons and permit
    accurate weighing under extreme environmental conditions. We
    also offer advanced computer software that can be used with our
    heavy industrial scales to facilitate a broad range of customer
    solutions and provides a complete system for managing vehicle
    transaction processing.

Industrial
    Software

We offer software that can be used with our industrial
    instruments. Examples include FreeWeigh.Net, statistical quality
    control software, Formweigh.Net, our formulation/batching
    software and OverDrive, which supports the operation of vehicle
    scales. FreeWeigh.Net and Formweigh.Net provide full network
    capability and enable customers to collect and archive data in
    compliance with 21 CFR Part 11.

Product
    Inspection

Increasing safety and consumer protection requirements are
    driving the need for more sophisticated end-of-line inspection
    systems (e.g., for use in food processing and packaging,
    pharmaceutical and other industries). We are a leading global
    provider of metal detectors, x-ray visioning equipment and
    checkweighers that are used in these industries. Metal detectors
    are most commonly used to detect fine particles of metal that
    may be contained in raw materials or may be generated by the
    manufacturing process itself.

X-ray-based

vision inspection helps detect non-metallic contamination, such
    as glass, stones and pits, which enter the manufacturing process
    for similar reasons. Our x-ray systems can also detect metal in
    metallized containers and can be used for mass control.
    Checkweighers are used to control the filling content of
    packaged goods such as food, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. Both
    x-ray and metal detection systems may



be used together with checkweighers as components of integrated
    packaging lines. FreeWeigh.Net is our statistical and quality
    control software that optimizes package filling, monitors
    weight-related data and integrates it in real time into
    customers’ enterprise resource planning

and/or

process control systems.

Retail Weighing
    Solutions

Supermarkets, hypermarkets and other food retail businesses make
    use of multiple weighing and food labeling solutions for
    handling fresh goods (such as meats, vegetables, fruits and
    cheeses). We offer stand-alone scales for basic counter weighing
    and pricing, price finding and printing. In addition, we offer
    networked scales and software, which can integrate backroom,
    counter, self-service and checkout functions and can incorporate
    fresh goods item data into a supermarket’s overall food
    item and inventory management system. Customer benefits are in
    the areas of pricing, merchandising, inventory management and
    regulatory compliance. Our instruments have been expanded to
    allow in-store marketing which permits customers to make more
    decisions at the point of sale. The retail business accounted
    for approximately 13% of our net sales in both 2008 and 2007 and
    14% in 2006.

Retail
    Software

Our subsidiary SofTechnics provides retail software for in-store
    item and inventory management solutions. SofTechnics’
    offering complements our retail weighing solutions to food
    retailers by providing the full scope of real-time item
    management. Retailers can then match local store inventory
    levels with local customer demand. Our instruments have been
    expanded to allow in-store marketing which permits customers to
    make more decisions at the point of sale.

Customers and
    Distribution

Our principal customers include companies in the following key
    end markets: the life science industry (pharmaceutical and
    biotech companies, as well as independent research
    organizations); food and beverage producers; food retailers;
    chemical, specialty chemicals and cosmetics companies; the
    transportation and logistics industry; the metals industry; the
    electronics industry; and the academic community.

Our products are sold through a variety of distribution
    channels. Generally, more technically sophisticated products are
    sold through our direct sales force, while less complicated
    products are sold through indirect channels. Our sales through
    direct channels exceed our sales through indirect channels. A
    significant portion of our sales in the Americas is generated
    through the indirect channels, including sales of our
    “Ohaus” branded products. Ohaus branded products
    target markets, such as the educational market, in which
    customers are interested in lower cost, a more limited set of
    features and less comprehensive support and service. We have a
    diversified customer base, with no single customer accounting
    for more than 1% of 2008 net sales.

Sales and
    Service

Market
    Organizations

We maintain geographically focused market organizations around
    the world that are responsible for all aspects of our sales and
    service. The market organizations are customer-focused, with an
    emphasis on building and maintaining value-added relationships
    with customers in our target market segments. Each market
    organization has the ability to leverage best practices from
    other units while maintaining the flexibility to adapt its
    marketing and service efforts to account for different cultural
    and economic conditions. Market organizations also work closely
    with our producing organizations (described below) by providing
    feedback on manufacturing and product development initiatives,
    new product and application ideas and information about key
    market segments.

We have one of the largest and broadest global sales and service
    organizations among precision instrument manufacturers. At
    December 31, 2008, our sales and services group consisted
    of over 5,600 employees in sales, marketing and customer
    service (including related administration) and post-sales



technical service, located in 35 countries. This field
    organization has the capability to provide service and support
    to our customers and distributors in major markets across the
    globe. This is important because our customers increasingly seek
    to do business with a consistent global approach.

Service

Our service business remains successful with a focus on repair
    services as well as further expansion of our offerings to
    include value-added services for a range of market needs,
    including regulatory compliance qualification, calibration,
    certification and preventative maintenance. We have a unique
    offering to our pharmaceutical customers in promoting use of our
    instruments in compliance with FDA regulations, and we can
    provide these services regardless of the customer’s
    location around the world. This global service network is also
    an important factor in our ability to expand in emerging
    markets. We estimate that we have the largest installed base of
    weighing instruments in the world. Service (representing service
    contracts, repairs and replacement parts) accounted for
    approximately 22% of our total net sales in 2008 and 23% in both
    2007 and 2006. A significant portion of this amount is derived
    from the sale of replacement parts.

Beyond revenue opportunities, we believe service is a key part
    of our solution offering and helps significantly in customer
    retention. The close relationships and frequent contact with our
    large customer base provide us with sales opportunities and
    innovative product and application ideas.

Research and
    Development and Manufacturing

Producing
    Organizations

Our research, product development and manufacturing efforts are
    organized into a number of producing organizations. Our focused
    producing organizations help reduce product development time and
    costs, improve customer focus and maintain technological
    leadership. The producing organizations work together to share
    ideas and best practices, and there is a close interface and
    coordinated customer interaction among marketing organizations
    and producing organizations.

Research and
    Development

We continue to invest in product innovation to provide
    technologically advanced products to our customers for existing
    and new applications. Over the last three years, we have
    invested $277.5 million in research and development
    ($102.3 million in 2008, $92.4 million in 2007 and
    $82.8 million in 2006). In 2008, we spent approximately
    5.2% of net sales on research and development. Our research and
    development efforts fall into two categories:

•

technology advancements, which generate new products and
    increase the value of our products. These advancements may be in
    the form of enhanced or new functionality, new applications for
    our technologies, more accurate or reliable measurement,
    additional software capability or automation through robotics or
    other means, which allow us to design products more specific to
    the needs of the industries the Company serves, and

•

cost reductions, which reduce the manufacturing cost of our
    products through better overall design.

We devote a substantial proportion of our research and
    development budget to software development. This includes
    software to process the signals captured by the sensors of our
    instruments, application-specific software and software that
    connects our solutions into customers’ existing IT systems.
    We closely integrate research and development with marketing,
    manufacturing and product engineering. We have over
    1,000 employees in research and development and product
    engineering in countries around the globe.

Manufacturing

We are a worldwide manufacturer, with facilities principally
    located in China, Germany, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and
    the United States. Laboratory instruments are produced mainly in
    Switzerland and to a lesser extent in the United States and
    China, while our remaining products are manufactured worldwide.
    We



emphasize product quality in our manufacturing operations, and
    most of our products require very strict tolerances and exact
    specifications. We use an extensive quality control system that
    is integrated into each step of the manufacturing process. All
    major manufacturing facilities have achieved ISO 9001
    certification. We believe that our manufacturing capacity is
    sufficient to meet our present and currently anticipated demand.

We generally manufacture only critical components, which are
    components that contain proprietary technology. When outside
    manufacturing is more efficient, we contract with other
    manufacturers for certain nonproprietary components. We use a
    wide range of suppliers. We believe our supply arrangements are
    adequate and that there are no material constraints on the
    sources and availability of materials. From time to time we may
    rely on a single supplier for all of our requirements of a
    particular component. Supply arrangements for electronic
    components are generally made globally.

Backlog;
    Seasonality

Our manufacturing turnaround time is generally short, which
    permits us to manufacture orders to fill for most of our
    products. Backlog is generally a function of requested customer
    delivery dates and is typically no longer than one to two months.

Our business has historically experienced a slight amount of
    seasonal variation, particularly the high-end laboratory
    instruments business. Traditionally, sales in the first quarter
    are slightly lower than, and sales in the fourth quarter are
    slightly higher than, sales in the second and third quarters.
    Fourth quarter sales have historically generated approximately
    26% to 30% of our net sales. This trend has a somewhat greater
    effect on income from operations than on net sales because fixed
    costs are spread evenly across all quarters.

Employees

As of December 31, 2008, we had approximately
    10,000 employees throughout the world, including
    approximately 4,500 in Europe, 3,000 in North and South America
    and 2,500 in Asia and other countries.

We believe our employee relations are good, and we have not
    suffered any material employee work stoppage or strike during
    the last five years. Labor unions do not represent a meaningful
    number of our employees.

Blue Ocean
    Program

“Blue Ocean” refers to our program to establish a new
    global operating model, with standardized, automated and
    integrated processes, with high levels of global data
    transparency. It will encompass a new enterprise architecture,
    with a global, single instance ERP system. Within our IT systems
    we are moving toward integrated, homogeneous applications and
    common data structures. We will also largely standardize our key
    business processes. The implementation of the systems and
    processes will proceed on a staggered basis over a several year
    period with the initial go-live rollout expected to occur in
    2010. We expect capitalized project costs in the first phase to
    exceed $100 million. We expect the return on this
    investment when complete to be reduced operating costs and
    working capital requirements.

Intellectual
    Property

We hold over 3,500 patents and trademarks (including pending
    applications), primarily in the United States, Switzerland,
    Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, France, Japan, China, South
    Korea, Brazil and India. Our products generally incorporate a
    wide variety of technological innovations, some of which are
    protected by patents of various durations. Products are
    generally not protected as a whole by individual patents, and as
    a result, no one patent or group of related patents is material
    to our business. We have numerous trademarks, including the
    Mettler-Toledo name and logo, which are material to our
    business. We regularly protect against infringement of our
    intellectual property.



Regulation

Our products are subject to various regulatory standards and
    approvals by weights and measures regulatory authorities. All of
    our electrical components are subject to electrical safety
    standards. We believe that we are in compliance in all material
    respects with applicable regulations.

Approvals are required to ensure our instruments do not
    impermissibly influence other instruments and are themselves not
    affected by other instruments. In addition, some of our products
    are used in “legal for trade” applications, in which
    prices based on weight are calculated and for which specific
    weights and measures approvals are required. Although there are
    a large number of regulatory agencies across our markets, there
    is an increasing trend toward harmonization of standards, and
    weights and measures regulation is harmonized across the
    European Union.

Our products may also be subject to special requirements
    depending on the end-user and market. For example, laboratory
    customers are typically subject to Good Laboratory Practices
    (GLP), industrial customers to Good Manufacturing Practices
    (GMP), pharmaceutical customers to U.S. Food and Drug
    Administration (FDA) regulations, and customers in food
    processing industries may be subject to Hazard Analysis and
    Critical Control Point (HACCP) regulations. Products used in
    hazardous environments may also be subject to special
    requirements.

Environmental
    Matters

We are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the
    jurisdictions in which we operate. We own or lease a number of
    properties and manufacturing facilities around the world. Like
    many of our competitors, we have incurred, and will continue to
    incur, capital and operating expenditures and other costs in
    complying with such laws and regulations.

We are currently involved in, or have potential liability with
    respect to, the remediation of past contamination in certain of
    our facilities. Our former subsidiary Mettler-Toledo Hi-Speed,
    Inc. (“Hi-Speed”) was one of two private parties
    ordered to perform certain ground water contamination monitoring
    under an administrative consent order that the New Jersey
    Department of Environmental Protection (“NJDEP”)
    signed on June 13, 1988 with respect to certain property in
    Landing, New Jersey. GEI International Corporation
    (“GEI”) is the other ordered party. GEI has failed to
    fulfill its obligations under the NJDEP consent order, and NJDEP
    has agreed with Hi-Speed that the residual ground water
    contaminants can be monitored through the establishment of a
    Classification Exception Area and concurrent Well Restriction
    Area for the site. The NJDEP does not view these vehicles as
    remedial measures, but rather as “institutional
    controls” that must be adequately maintained and
    periodically evaluated. We estimate that the costs of compliance
    associated with monitoring ground water contamination levels at
    the site will be approximately $0.6 million in the coming
    years.

In addition, certain of our present and former facilities have
    or had been in operation for many decades and, over such time,
    some of these facilities may have used substances or generated
    and disposed of wastes which are or may be considered hazardous.
    It is possible that these sites, as well as disposal sites owned
    by third parties to which we have sent wastes, may in the future
    be identified and become the subject of remediation. Although we
    believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable
    environmental requirements and, to date, we have not incurred
    material expenditures in connection with environmental matters,
    it is possible that we could become subject to additional
    environmental liabilities in the future that could have a
    material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of
    operations or cash flows.

Competition

Our markets are highly competitive. Many of the markets in which
    we compete are fragmented both geographically and by
    application, particularly the industrial and food retailing
    markets. As a result, we face numerous regional or specialized
    competitors, many of which are well established in their
    markets. For example, some of our competitors are divisions of
    larger companies with potentially greater financial and other
    resources than our own. In addition, some of our competitors are
    domiciled in emerging markets and may have a lower cost
    structure than ours. We are confronted with new competitors in
    emerging markets



who, although relatively small in size today, could become
    larger companies in their home markets. Given the sometimes
    significant growth rates of these emerging markets, and in light
    of their cost advantage over developed markets, emerging market
    competitors could become more significant global competitors.
    Taken together, the competitive forces present in our markets
    can impair our operating margins in certain product lines and
    geographic markets.

We expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and
    performance of their products and to introduce new products with
    competitive prices. Although we believe that we have
    technological and other competitive advantages over many of our
    competitors, we may not be able to realize and maintain these
    advantages. These advantages include our worldwide market
    leadership positions; our global brand and reputation; our track
    record of technological innovation; our comprehensive,
    high-quality solution offering; our global sales and service
    offering; our large installed base of weighing instruments; and
    the diversification of our revenue base by geographic region,
    product range and customer. To remain competitive, we must
    continue to invest in research and development, sales and
    marketing and customer service and support. We cannot be sure
    that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make these
    investments or that we will be successful in identifying,
    developing and maintaining any competitive advantages.

We believe the principal competitive factors in developed
    markets for purchasing decisions are the product itself,
    application support, service support and price. In emerging
    markets, where there is greater demand for less sophisticated
    products, price is a more important factor than in developed
    markets. Competition in the U.S. laboratory market is also
    influenced by the presence of large distributors that sell not
    only our products but those of our competitors as well.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

Factors Affecting
    Our Future Operating Results

The majority of
    our business is derived from companies in developed countries.
    The current economic downturns or recessions in these countries
    can be expected to adversely affect our operating
    results.

Although the percentage of our sales coming from emerging
    markets is growing, the majority of our business is still
    derived from companies in developed countries. Because our
    customers often decrease or delay capital expenditures in
    difficult economic times, economic downturns or recessions in
    developed countries would likely adversely affect our operating
    results. Given the current economic uncertainty, we are starting
    to see both decreases and delays in customer expenditures, and
    we expect these to continue and possibly worsen. Customers may
    also purchase lower-cost products made by competitors and not
    resume purchasing our products even after economic conditions
    improve. These conditions would reduce our revenues and
    profitability.

We are subject to
    certain risks associated with our international operations and
    fluctuating conditions in emerging markets.

We conduct business in many countries, including emerging
    markets in Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe, and these
    operations represent a significant portion of our sales and
    earnings. For example, our Chinese operations account for
    $228.9 million of sales to external customers and
    $59.0 million of segment profit. In addition to the
    currency risks discussed below, international operations pose
    other substantial risks and problems for us. For instance,
    various local jurisdictions in which we operate may revise or
    alter their respective legal and regulatory requirements. In
    addition, we may encounter one or more of the following
    obstacles or risks:

•

tariffs and trade barriers;

•

difficulties in staffing and managing local operations

and/or

mandatory salary increases for local employees;

•

credit risks arising from financial difficulties facing local
    customers and distributors;

•

difficulties in protecting intellectual property;

•

nationalization of private enterprises may result in the
    confiscation of assets as we hold significant assets around the
    world in the form of property, plant and equipment, inventory
    and accounts receivable, as well as $52.9 million of cash
    at December 31, 2008 in our Chinese subsidiaries;

•

restrictions on investments

and/or

limitations regarding foreign ownership;

•

adverse tax consequences, including tax disputes, imposition or
    increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other
    payments by subsidiaries; and

•

other uncertain local economic, political and social conditions,
    including hyper-inflationary conditions or periods of low or no
    productivity growth.

We must also comply with a variety of regulations regarding the
    conversion and repatriation of funds earned in local currencies.
    For example, converting earnings from our operations in China
    into other currencies and repatriating these funds require
    governmental approvals. If we cannot comply with these or other
    applicable regulations, we may face increased difficulties in
    utilizing cash flow generated by these operations outside of
    China.

Economic conditions in emerging markets have from time to time
    deteriorated significantly, and some emerging markets are
    currently experiencing recessionary trends, severe currency
    devaluations and inflationary prices. Moreover, economic
    problems in individual markets can spread to other economies,
    adding to the adverse conditions we may face in emerging
    markets. Even where economies are currently growing, such as
    China, we are already seeing significant slowdowns compared with
    historical growth rates, and believe economic conditions in
    these markets will decline further. We remain committed to
    emerging markets,



particularly those in Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe.
    However, we expect the fluctuating economic conditions will
    affect our results of operations in these markets for the
    foreseeable future.

We operate in
    highly competitive markets, and it may be difficult to preserve
    operating margins, gain market share and maintain a
    technological advantage.

Our markets are highly competitive. Many of the markets in which
    we compete are fragmented both geographically and by
    application, particularly the industrial and food retailing
    markets. As a result, we face numerous regional or specialized
    competitors, many of which are well established in their
    markets. In addition, some of our competitors are divisions of
    larger companies with potentially greater financial and other
    resources than our Company. Some of our competitors are
    domiciled or operate in emerging markets and may have a lower
    cost structure than ours. We are confronted with new competitors
    in emerging markets who, although relatively small in size
    today, could become larger companies in their home markets.
    Given the sometimes significant growth rates of these emerging
    markets, and in light of their cost advantage over developed
    markets, emerging market competitors could become more
    significant global competitors. Taken together, the competitive
    forces present in our markets can impair our operating margins
    in certain product lines and geographic markets. We expect our
    competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of
    their products and to introduce new products with competitive
    prices. Although we believe that we have certain technological
    and other advantages over our competitors, we may not be able to
    realize and maintain these advantages.

Our product
    development efforts may not produce commercially viable products
    in a timely manner.

We must introduce new products and enhancements in a timely
    manner, or our products could become technologically obsolete
    over time, which would harm our operating results. To remain
    competitive, we must continue to make significant investments in
    research and development, sales and marketing and customer
    service and support. We cannot be sure that we will have
    sufficient resources to continue to make these investments. In
    developing new products, we may be required to make substantial
    investments before we can determine their commercial viability.
    As a result, we may not be successful in developing new products
    and we may never realize the benefits of our research and
    development activities.

Our ability to
    deliver products and services may be disrupted.

An interruption in our business due to events such as natural
    disasters, pandemics or other health crises, fires, explosions
    or issues with the supply chain may cause us to temporarily be
    unable to deliver products or services to our customers. It may
    be expensive to resolve these issues, even though some of these
    risks are covered by insurance policies. More importantly,
    customers may switch to competitors and may not return to us
    even if we resolve the interruption.

A widespread
    outbreak of an illness or other health issue could negatively
    affect our business, making it more difficult and expensive to
    meet our obligations to our customers, and could result in
    reduced demand from our customers.

A number of countries in the Asia Pacific region have
    experienced outbreaks of SARS

and/or

avian
    influenza (bird flu) in recent years. As a result of such an
    outbreak, businesses can be shut down and individuals can become
    ill or quarantined. Outbreaks of infectious diseases such as
    these, particularly in North America, Europe, China or other
    locations significant to our operations, could adversely affect
    general commercial activity, which could have a material adverse
    effect on our financial condition, results of operations,
    business or prospects. If our operations are curtailed because
    of health issues, we may need to seek alternate sources of
    supply for services and staff and these alternate sources may be
    more expensive. Alternate sources may not be available or may
    result in delays in shipments to our customers, each of which
    would affect our results of operations. In addition, a
    curtailment of our product design operations could result in
    delays in the development of new products. Further, if our
    customers’ businesses are affected by health issues, they
    might delay or reduce purchases from us, which could adversely
    affect our results of operations.



We are vulnerable
    to system failures, which could harm our business.

We rely on our technology infrastructure, among other functions,
    to interact with suppliers, sell our products and services,
    support our customers, fulfill orders and bill, collect and make
    payments. Our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption
    from natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures,
    terrorist attacks, computer viruses, computer denial-of-service
    attacks and other events. When we upgrade or change systems, we
    may suffer interruptions in service, loss of data or reduced
    functionality. A significant number of our systems are not
    redundant, and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient
    for every eventuality. Despite any precautions we may take, such
    problems could result in, among other consequences,
    interruptions in our services, which could harm our reputation
    and financial condition. We do not carry business interruption
    insurance sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result
    from interruptions in our services as a result of system
    failures.

We also recently initiated our “Blue Ocean” program, a
    program to standardize our global business processes and
    information technology systems that includes the implementation
    of a Company-wide enterprise resource planning system. The
    implementation of this program will proceed on a staggered basis
    over a several-year period with the initial go-live rollouts
    expected to occur during 2010. If the implementation of any unit
    is flawed, we could suffer interruptions in operations and
    customer-facing activities which could harm our reputation and
    financial condition, lose data, experience reduced functionality
    or have delays in reporting financial information. It may take
    us longer to implement the Blue Ocean program than we have
    planned for, and the project may cost us more than we have
    estimated, either of which would negatively impact our ability
    to generate cost savings or other efficiencies.

A prolonged
    downturn or additional consolidation in the pharmaceutical,
    food, food retailing and chemical industries could adversely
    affect our operating results.

Our products are used extensively in the pharmaceutical, food
    and beverage and chemical industries. Consolidation in the
    pharmaceutical and chemical industries hurt our sales in prior
    years. A prolonged economic downturn or additional consolidation
    in any of these industries could adversely affect our operating
    results, and some industries are already experiencing
    significant economic declines such as the chemical industry. In
    addition, the capital spending policies of our customers in
    these industries are based on a variety of factors we cannot
    control, including the resources available for purchasing
    equipment, the spending priorities among various types of
    equipment and policies regarding capital expenditures. Any
    decrease or delay in capital spending by our customers would
    cause our revenues to decline and could harm our profitability.

We may face risks
    associated with future acquisitions.

We may pursue acquisitions of complementary product lines,
    technologies or businesses. Acquisitions involve numerous risks,
    including difficulties in the assimilation of the acquired
    operations, technologies and products; diversion of
    management’s attention from other business concerns; and
    potential departures of key employees of the acquired company.
    If we successfully identify acquisitions in the future,
    completing such acquisitions may result in new issuances of our
    stock that may be dilutive to current owners, increases in our
    debt and contingent liabilities and additional amortization
    expenses related to intangible assets. Any of these
    acquisition-related risks could have a material adverse affect
    on our profitability.

Larger companies have identified life sciences and instruments
    as businesses they will consider entering, which could change
    the competitive dynamics of these markets. In addition, we may
    not be able to identify, successfully complete or integrate
    potential acquisitions in the future. However, even if we can do
    so, we cannot be sure that these acquisitions will have a
    positive impact on our business or operating results.

If we cannot
    protect our intellectual property rights, or if we infringe or
    misappropriate the proprietary rights of others, our operating
    results could be harmed.

Our success depends on our ability to obtain and enforce patents
    on our technology, maintain our trademarks and protect our trade
    secrets. Our patents may not provide complete protection, and
    competitors



may develop similar products that are not covered by our
    patents. Our patents may also be challenged by third parties and
    invalidated or narrowed. Competitors sometimes seek to take
    advantage of our trademarks or brands in ways that may create
    customer confusion or weaken our brand. Although we take
    measures to protect confidential information, improper use or
    disclosure of our trade secrets may still occur.

We may be sued for infringing on the intellectual property
    rights of others. The cost of any litigation could affect our
    profitability regardless of the outcome, and management
    attention could be diverted. If we are unsuccessful in such
    litigation, we may have to pay damages, stop the infringing
    activity

and/or

obtain a license. If we fail to obtain a required license, we
    may be unable to sell some of our products, which could result
    in a decline in our revenues.

Departures of key
    employees could impair our operations.

We generally have employment contracts with each of our key
    employees. Our executive officers own shares of our common stock

and/or

have
    options to purchase additional shares. Nevertheless, such
    individuals could leave the Company. If any key employees
    stopped working for us, our operations could be harmed.
    Important R&D personnel may leave and join competitors,
    which could substantially delay or hinder ongoing development
    projects. We have no key man life insurance policies with
    respect to any of our senior executives.

We may be
    adversely affected by environmental laws and
    regulations.

We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations,
    including those relating to air emissions, wastewater
    discharges, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous
    wastes and the remediation of contamination associated with the
    use and disposal of hazardous substances.

We incur expenditures in complying with environmental laws and
    regulations. We are currently involved in, or have potential
    liability with respect to, the remediation of past contamination
    in various facilities. In addition, some of our facilities are
    or have been in operation for many decades and may have used
    substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are
    hazardous or may be considered hazardous in the future. These
    sites and disposal sites owned by others to which we sent waste
    may in the future be identified as contaminated and require
    remediation. Accordingly, it is possible that we could become
    subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future
    that may harm our results of operations or financial condition.

We may be
    adversely affected by failure to comply with regulations of
    governmental agencies or by the adoption of new
    regulations.

Our products are subject to regulation by governmental agencies.
    These regulations govern a wide variety of activities relating
    to our products, from design and development, to product safety,
    labeling, manufacturing, promotion, sales and distribution. If
    we fail to comply with these regulations, or if new regulations
    are adopted that substantially change existing practice or
    impose new burdens, we may have to recall products and cease
    their manufacture and distribution. In addition, we could be
    subject to fines or criminal prosecution.

We may experience
    impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets.

As of December 31, 2008, our consolidated balance sheet
    included goodwill of $424.4 million and other intangible
    assets of $96.3 million.

Our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other
    intangible assets, which affect the amount of future period
    amortization expense and possible impairment expense that we
    might incur. The determination of the value of such intangible
    assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions
    that affect our consolidated financial statements.

In accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and
    Other Intangible Assets” (“SFAS 142”), our
    goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not
    amortized, but are evaluated for impairment annually in the
    fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired.



The evaluation is based on valuation models that estimate fair
    value based on expected future cash flows and profitability
    projections. In preparing the valuation models we consider a
    number of factors, including operating results, business plans,
    economic conditions, future cash flows, and transactions and
    market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to
    these factors and our judgment in applying them to the
    impairment analyses. The significant estimates and assumptions
    within our fair value models include sales growth, controllable
    cost growth, perpetual growth, effective tax rates and discount
    rates. Our assessments to date have indicated that there has
    been no impairment of these assets.

Should any of these estimates or assumptions change, or should
    we incur lower-than-expected operating performance or cash
    flows, including from a prolonged economic slowdown, we may
    experience a triggering event that requires a new fair value
    assessment for our reporting units, possibly prior to the
    required annual assessment. These types of events and resulting
    analysis could result in impairment charges for goodwill and
    other indefinite-lived intangible assets if the fair value
    estimate declines below the carrying value.

Our amortization expense related to intangible assets with
    finite lives may materially change should our estimates of their
    useful lives change.

Unanticipated
    changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax
    liabilities could impact our profitability.

We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and
    various other foreign jurisdictions, and our domestic and
    international tax liabilities are subject to allocation of
    expenses among different jurisdictions. Our effective tax rates
    could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings by
    jurisdiction, changes in tax laws or tax rates, changes in the
    valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and material
    adjustments from tax audits.

In particular, the carrying value of deferred tax assets, which
    are predominantly in the U.S., is dependent upon our ability to
    generate future taxable income in the U.S. In addition, the
    amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in
    various jurisdictions, and a material assessment by a governing
    tax authority could affect our profitability.

Currency
    fluctuations affect our operating profits.

Because we conduct operations in many countries, our operating
    income can be significantly affected by fluctuations in currency
    exchange rates. Swiss franc-denominated expenses represent a
    much greater percentage of our total operating expenses than
    Swiss franc-denominated sales represent of our total net sales.
    In part, this is because most of our manufacturing costs in
    Switzerland relate to products that are sold outside
    Switzerland. Moreover, a substantial percentage of our research
    and development expenses and general and administrative expenses
    are incurred in Switzerland. Therefore, if the Swiss franc
    strengthens against all or most of our major trading currencies
    (e.g

.

, the U.S. dollar, the euro, other major
    European currencies, the Chinese yuan and the Japanese yen), our
    operating profit is reduced. We also have significantly more
    sales in European currencies (other than the Swiss franc) than
    we have expenses in those currencies. Therefore, when European
    currencies weaken against the U.S. dollar and the Swiss
    franc, it also decreases our operating profits. Accordingly, the
    Swiss franc exchange rate to the euro is an important cross-rate
    monitored by the Company. In recent months, we have seen
    substantially higher volatility in exchange rates generally than
    in the past, and the Swiss franc has strengthened significantly
    against the euro. We estimate that a 1% strengthening of the
    Swiss franc against the euro would result in a decrease in our
    earnings before tax of $1.0 million to $1.4 million on
    an annual basis. In addition to the Swiss franc and major
    European currencies, we also conduct business in many
    geographies throughout the world, including Asia Pacific,
    Eastern Europe, Latin America and Canada. Fluctuations in these
    currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar can also
    affect our operating results. In addition to the effects of
    exchange rate movements on operating profits, our debt levels
    can fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates, particularly
    between the U.S. dollar and the Swiss franc. Based on our
    outstanding debt at December 31, 2008, we estimate that a
    10% weakening of the U.S. dollar against the currencies in
    which our debt is denominated would result in an increase of
    approximately $5.0 million in the reported U.S. dollar
    value of the debt.



We have
    substantial debt and we may incur substantially more debt, which
    could affect our ability to meet our debt obligations and may
    otherwise restrict our activities.

We have substantial debt and we may incur substantial additional
    debt in the future. As of December 31, 2008, we had total
    indebtedness of approximately $376.0 million, net of cash
    of $78.1 million. We are also permitted by the terms of our
    debt instruments to incur substantial additional indebtedness,
    subject to the restrictions therein.

Our debt could have important consequences. For example, it
    could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations
    under our debt instruments; require us to dedicate a substantial
    portion of our cash flow to payments on our indebtedness, which
    would reduce the amount of cash flow available to fund working
    capital, capital expenditures, product development and other
    corporate requirements; increase our vulnerability to general
    adverse economic and industry conditions, including changes in
    raw material costs; limit our ability to respond to business
    opportunities; limit our ability to borrow additional funds,
    which may be necessary; and subject us to financial and other
    restrictive covenants, which, if we fail to comply with these
    covenants and our failure is not waived or cured, could result
    in an event of default under our debt.

In the current difficult environment, banks can be expected to
    strictly enforce the terms of our credit agreement. Although we
    believe we are currently in compliance with all credit agreement
    requirements, if we fail to comply in the future with a
    requirement, our access to the facility and ability to borrow
    further may be limited. In such circumstances, we may not be
    able to refinance our existing debt or only be able to do so at
    significantly higher costs.

The agreements
    governing our debt impose restrictions on our
    business.

The indenture governing our senior notes and the agreements
    governing our credit facility contain covenants imposing various
    restrictions on our business. These restrictions may affect our
    ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to
    take advantage of potential business opportunities as they
    arise. The restrictions these covenants place on us include
    limitations on our ability to incur liens and consolidate,
    merge, sell or lease all or substantially all of our assets. Our
    credit facility also requires us to meet certain financial
    ratios.

Our ability to comply with these agreements may be affected by
    events beyond our control, including prevailing economic,
    financial and industry conditions, and are subject to the risks
    in this section. The breach of any of these covenants or
    restrictions could result in a default under the indenture
    governing the senior notes

and/or

under
    our credit facility. An event of default under our credit
    facility would permit our lenders to declare all amounts
    borrowed from them to be immediately due and payable.
    Acceleration of our other indebtedness may cause us to be unable
    to make interest payments on the senior notes and repay the
    principal amount of the senior notes.

We make from time
    to time forward-looking statements, and actual events or results
    may differ materially from these statements because assumptions
    we have made prove incorrect due to market conditions in our
    industries or other
    factors

.

We from time to time provide forward-looking statements both in
    our filings with the SEC and orally in connection with our
    quarterly earnings calls, including guidance on anticipated
    earnings per share. These statements are only predictions.
    Actual events or results may differ materially from these
    statements because assumptions we have made prove incorrect due
    to market conditions in our industries or other factors. We
    refer you to the factors discussed under the captions
    “Factors affecting our future operating results” in
    the “Business” section and the “Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations” section of this annual report on

Form 10-K,

which describe risks and factors that could cause results to
    differ materially from those projected in those forward-looking
    statements. We operate in a continually changing business
    environment, and new risk factors emerge from time to time.
    Management cannot predict these new risk factors, nor can it
    assess the impact, if any, of these new risk factors on our
    businesses or the extent to which any factor, or combination of
    factors, may cause actual results to differ



materially from those projected in any forward-looking
    statements. Accordingly, forward-looking statements should not
    be relied upon as a prediction of actual results.

In providing guidance on our future earnings, our management
    evaluates our budgets, our strategic plan and certain factors
    relating to our business. This evaluation requires management to
    make several key assumptions relating to both external and
    internal factors. Some of the key external assumptions include:

•

the outlook for our end markets and the global economy;

•

impact of external factors on our competition;

•

economies in emerging markets will slow from the growth we had
    in 2008;

•

financial position of our customers;

•

the estimated costs of purchasing materials;

•

developments in personnel costs; and

•

rates for currency exchange, particularly between the Swiss
    franc and the euro.

Some of these assumptions may prove to be incorrect over time.
    For example, although no one customer accounts for more than 1%
    of our revenues, if a number of our customers experienced
    significant deteriorations in their financial positions
    concurrently, it could have an impact on our results of
    operations.

Some of our key internal assumptions include the following:

•

our ability to implement our business strategy;

•

effectiveness of our marketing programs such as our Spinnaker
    initiatives;

•

our ability to develop and deliver innovative products and
    services;

•

continued growth in our sales in emerging markets;

•

our ability to implement price increases as forecasted; and

•

the effectiveness of our cost saving initiatives, including our
    restructuring activities.

These internal assumptions may also prove to be incorrect over
    time. For example, with respect to our ability to realize our
    planned price increases without disturbing our customer base in
    core markets, in certain markets, such as emerging markets,
    price tends to be a more significant factor in customers’
    decisions to purchase our products. Furthermore, we can have no
    assurance that our cost reduction programs will be effective or
    that we will be able to execute them in the estimated time
    frames. Additionally, although we have included certain
    restructuring costs in our forecast, it may become necessary to
    take additional restructuring actions resulting in additional
    restructuring costs.

We believe our current assumptions are reasonable and prudent
    for planning purposes. However, should any of these assumptions
    prove to be incorrect, or should we incur lower-than-expected
    operating performance or cash flows, we may experience results
    different than our projections.

Our ability to
    generate cash depends on factors beyond our control.

Our ability to make payments on our debt and to fund planned
    capital expenditures and research and development efforts will
    depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to
    an extent, is subject to general economic, financial,
    competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors,
    including those described in this section, that are beyond our
    control.

We cannot ensure that our business will generate sufficient cash
    flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available
    to us under our credit facility in an amount sufficient to
    enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs.
    We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on
    or before maturity. We cannot ensure that we will be able to
    refinance any of our debt, including our credit facility and the
    senior notes, on commercially reasonable terms or at all.

We have a share repurchase program that was announced in
    February 2004. Under the program, we have been authorized to buy
    back up to $1.5 billion of the Company’s common
    shares. We have purchased 15.2 million common shares since
    the inception of the program through December 31, 2008, at
    a total cost of



$1.1 billion. As of December 31, 2008, there was
    $416.6 million remaining authorized for repurchases under
    the plan by December 31, 2010. The share repurchases are
    expected to be funded from existing cash balances, borrowings
    under existing credit arrangements or cash generated from
    operating activities. Repurchases will be made through open
    market transactions, and the timing will depend on the level of
    acquisition activity, business and market conditions, the stock
    price, trading restrictions and other factors.

During the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, we spent
    $224.5 million and $324.6 million on the repurchase of
    2,232,188 shares and 3,384,731 shares at an average
    price per share of $100.55 and $95.88, respectively.

Other charges (income), net consists primarily of
    restructuring charges, interest income, (gains) losses from
    foreign currency transactions, and other items. The 2008 amount
    includes a $6.4 million restructuring charge primarily
    related to severance costs. The 2005 amount includes a
    $21.8 million one-time litigation charge related to a
    $19.9 million non-cash write-off of an intellectual
    property license and $1.9 million of related legal
    costs.

(b)

The provision for taxes for 2008 includes a discrete tax
    benefit of $2.5 million related to favorable withholding
    tax law changes in China recorded during the first quarter and a
    discrete tax benefit of $3.5 million primarily related to
    the closure of certain tax matters recorded during the third
    quarter.

The provision for taxes for 2007 includes $1.1 million
    of discrete tax items recorded during the Company’s third
    quarter. The discrete items include a benefit of
    $3.4 million related to the favorable resolution of certain
    tax matters and other adjustments related to prior years, which
    was partially offset by a charge of $2.3 million primarily
    related to a tax law change in Germany. The provision for taxes
    for 2006 includes net tax benefits related to a legal
    reorganization that resulted in a reduction of the estimated
    annual effective tax rate from 30% to 27% and $8.0 million
    net of discrete tax items. The discrete items include a benefit
    of $2.9 million, net, associated with the legal
    reorganization and a benefit of $5.1 million from a
    favorable tax law change. The 2005 amount includes a net tax
    charge of $5.4 million related to earnings repatriation
    associated with the American Jobs Creation Act
    ($13.1 million) offset in part by the favorable resolution
    of certain tax contingencies ($7.7 million).

Item 7.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

The following discussion and analysis of our financial
    condition and results of operations should be read together with
    our audited consolidated financial statements.

Overview

We operate a global business, with sales that are diversified by
    geographic region, product range and customer. We hold leading
    positions worldwide in many of our markets and attribute this
    leadership to several factors, including the strength of our
    brand name and reputation, our comprehensive offering of
    innovative instruments and solutions, and the breadth and
    quality of our global sales and service network.

Net sales in U.S. dollars increased by 10% and 12% in 2008
    and 2007, respectively. Excluding the effect of currency
    exchange rate fluctuations, or in local currencies, net sales
    increased 6% and 8% in 2008 and 2007, respectively. We
    experienced relatively broad-based sales growth across most
    geographies and products during 2008. Our growth was
    attributable to positive economic conditions during the first
    nine months of the year, as well as our strong leadership
    positions and the impact of our global sales and marketing
    initiatives. For example, we continue to improve our lead
    generation and nurturing processes, better penetrate our market
    segments and more effectively price our products and services.
    However, global economic conditions weakened during the fourth
    quarter of 2008, resulting in reduced sales growth in local
    currencies in most geographies during the fourth quarter of 2008
    versus the prior year comparable period. Sales growth in local
    currencies was 1% during the fourth quarter of 2008, which
    included an increase of 1% in Europe and 6% in Asia/Rest of
    World, offset in part by a 3% decline in the Americas. Our
    future sales in local currencies will continue to be adversely
    affected by the weak global economic conditions. It is currently
    difficult to predict the extent to which our results will be
    affected in this uncertain environment.

With respect to our end-user markets, we experienced improved
    results during 2008 in our laboratory-related end-user markets,
    such as pharmaceutical and biotech customers as well as the
    laboratories of chemical companies, food and beverage companies
    and universities. However, demand from these markets



decreased during the fourth quarter of 2008 related to the
    previously mentioned global economic slowdown. We expect reduced
    demand in these markets will continue during 2009.

In our industrial markets, the principal growth driver in recent
    years has been increased investment in emerging markets related
    to increasing production capacity for domestic and export
    markets. Although this provides a significant opportunity for
    our emerging market operations, this manufacturing shift has a
    negative impact on certain of our industrial end-user markets in
    the U.S. and Europe. However, despite this challenge, our
    U.S. and European industrial end-user markets experienced
    solid sales growth during 2008. Our industrial markets and our
    core-industrial products also experienced reduced demand during
    the fourth quarter of 2008, including our emerging markets. We
    expect reduced demand in these markets will continue during 2009.

In our food retail end markets, we benefited from strong project
    activity in Europe while our U.S. business faced difficult
    comparisons to the prior year. Traditionally the spending levels
    in this sector have experienced more volatility than our other
    customer sectors due to the timing of customer project activity
    or new regulation. Similar to our industrial business, emerging
    markets also provide growth as the expansion of local emerging
    market economies creates a significant number of new retail
    stores each year. While sales in our food retail end markets
    experienced solid project activity during the fourth quarter of
    2008, we could experience a sales reduction during 2009 related
    to the global economic slowdown.

In 2009, we expect to continue to pursue the overall business
    growth strategies which we have followed in recent years:

Gaining Market Share.

Our global sales and
    marketing initiative, “Spinnaker,” continues to be an
    important growth strategy. We aim to achieve above-market sales
    growth by improving the productivity and effectiveness of our
    global sales and marketing processes. While this initiative is
    broad-based, efforts to improve these processes include
    increased segment marketing and leads generation and nurturing
    activities, the implementation of more effective pricing and
    value-based selling strategies and processes, improved sales
    force training and other sales and marketing topics. Our
    comprehensive service offering also helps us further penetrate
    developed markets. We estimate that we have the largest
    installed base of weighing instruments in the world. In addition
    to traditional repair and maintenance, our service offerings
    continue to expand into value-added services for a range of
    market needs, including regulatory compliance.

Expanding Emerging Markets.

Emerging markets,
    comprising Asia (excluding Japan), Eastern Europe, Latin
    America, the Middle East and Africa, account for approximately
    27% of our total net sales. We have a two-pronged strategy in
    emerging markets: first, to capitalize on growth opportunities
    in these markets and second, to leverage our low-cost
    manufacturing operations in China. We have over a

20-year

track record in China, and our sales in Asia have grown more
    than 18% in local currency since 1999. We have broadened our
    product offering to the Asian markets and are benefiting as
    multinational customers shift production to China. We are
    pleased with our continued accomplishments in China and continue
    to expand our territory coverage with new branch offices,
    additional dealers and more service professionals. In recent
    years, India has also been a source of emerging market sales
    growth due to increased life science research activities, as
    well as our acquisition of our distribution channel for
    laboratory products in 2005. In addition, Russia has also been
    an important growth driver in recent years due in part to the
    expansion of its local economy. Local currency sales growth in
    emerging markets slowed during the fourth quarter of 2008 and we
    anticipate future sales will continue to be adversely affected
    by weak global economic conditions. To reduce costs, we are also
    shifting more of our manufacturing to China where our three
    facilities manufacture for the local markets as well as for
    export.

Extending Our Technology Lead.

We continue to
    focus on product innovation. In the last three years, we spent
    between 5.1% and 5.2% of net sales on research and development.
    We seek to drive shorter product life cycles, as well as improve
    our product offerings and their capabilities with additional
    integrated technologies and software. In addition, we aim to
    create value for our customers by having an intimate knowledge
    of their processes via our significant installed product base.
    During 2008, we also introduced Quantos, our new automated
    powder dosing solution for small sample sizes, which is
    controlled and monitored by the laboratory balance.



Maintaining Cost Leadership.

We continue to
    strive to improve our margins by reducing our cost structure. As
    previously mentioned, shifting production to China has been an
    important component of our cost savings initiatives. We have
    also implemented global procurement and supply chain management
    programs over the last several years aimed at lowering supply
    costs. Our cost leadership initiatives are also focused on
    continuously improving our invested capital efficiency, such as
    reducing our working capital levels and ensuring appropriate
    returns on our expenditures. During the fourth quarter of 2008,
    we also initiated a global cost reduction program in response to
    the global economic slowdown. Our cost reduction program is
    focused on reducing our spending levels in most cost categories
    and will also include workforce reductions (including employees
    and temporary personnel) of approximately 600 or 5% of our total
    workforce.

Pursuing Strategic Acquisitions.

While we have
    not completed a significant acquisition since 2001, acquisitions
    remain part of our growth strategy. We seek to pursue
    acquisitions that may leverage our global sales and service
    network, respected brand, extensive distribution channels and
    technological leadership. We have identified life sciences,
    product inspection and process analytics as three key areas for
    acquisitions.

Results of
    Operations — Consolidated

Net
    sales

Net sales were $1,973.3 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2008, compared to $1,793.7 million in
    2007 and $1,594.9 million in 2006. This represents
    increases in 2008 and 2007 of 10% and 12% in U.S. dollars
    and 6% and 8% in local currencies, respectively.

In 2008, our net sales by geographic destination increased in
    local currencies by 2% in the Americas, 6% in Europe and 16% in
    Asia/Rest of World. A discussion of sales by operating segment
    is included below.

As described in Note 16 to our consolidated financial
    statements, our net sales comprise product sales of precision
    instruments and related services. Service revenues are primarily
    derived from repair and other services, including regulatory
    compliance qualification, calibration, certification,
    preventative maintenance and spare parts.

Net sales of products increased in 2008 and 2007 by 10% and 13%
    in U.S. dollars and by 7% and 8% in local currencies,
    respectively. Service revenue (including spare parts) increased
    in 2008 and 2007 by 8% and 11% in U.S. dollars and by 5%
    and 6% in local currencies, respectively.

Net sales of our laboratory-related products increased by 6% in
    local currencies during 2008 principally driven by strong growth
    across most product categories, especially analytical
    instruments, pipettes and process analytics. Our
    laboratory-related product sales were also reduced by 1% during
    2008 due to product line exits.

Net sales of our industrial-related products increased by 7% in
    local currencies during 2008. We experienced strong sales growth
    in our core industrial products throughout most geographies,
    particularly China, as well as solid sales growth in our product
    inspection products. We also experienced strong sales growth in
    transportation and logistics products in the United States and
    Western Europe related to increased project activity.

In our food retailing markets, net sales increased by 4% in
    local currencies during 2008 over the previous year due to
    strong project activity in Europe and continued growth in
    Asia/Rest of World despite decreased sales in the U.S.

As discussed above, net sales growth in the fourth quarter of
    2008 decreased from the results of the first nine months in
    2008. We expect market conditions to further deteriorate from
    the levels experienced in the fourth quarter of 2008; however,
    the level of this deterioration is unknown.



Gross
    profit

Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 50.3% for 2008,
    compared to 50.0% for 2007 and 49.6% for 2006.

Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for products was 54.2%
    for 2008, compared to 53.8% for 2007 and 53.3% for 2006. Gross
    profit as a percentage of net sales for services (including
    spare parts) was 36.8% for 2008, compared to 36.9% for both 2007
    and 2006.

The increase in gross profit reflects several factors, including
    increased sales volume leveraging our fixed production costs,
    partially offset by the weakening U.S. dollar and increased
    material costs, most notably steel prices.

Research and
    development and selling, general and administrative
    expenses

Research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales
    were 5.2% for 2008, 5.1% for 2007 and 5.2% for 2006. Research
    and development expenses increased by 4% in 2008 and increased
    by 7% in 2007 in local currencies. Our research and development
    spending levels reflect increased research and development
    investments.

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of
    net sales decreased to 29.4% for 2008, compared to 29.5% for
    2007 and 30.2% for 2006. Selling, general and administrative
    expenses increased by 5% in both 2008 and 2007 in local
    currencies. This is primarily due to continued sales and
    marketing investments, especially in China and other emerging
    market countries, and expenses associated with product launches.
    We also incurred certain expenses associated with a multi-year
    information technology investment.

Other charges
    (income), net

Other charges (income), net consisted of other charges, net of
    $9.0 million in 2008, compared to other income, net of
    $0.9 million in 2007 and other income, net of
    $7.9 million in 2006. Other charges (income), net consisted
    primarily of restructuring charges, interest income, (gains)
    losses from foreign currency transactions and other items. Other
    charges (income), net in 2008 includes restructuring charges of
    $6.4 million related to our global cost reduction program
    as further described below. Other charges (income), net for 2008
    compared to the prior year was also impacted by unfavorable
    foreign currency fluctuations and reduced interest income
    associated with lower cash balances. In 2007, other charges
    (income), net reflected reduced interest income compared to the
    prior year associated with lower cash balances resulting from
    share repurchases. In 2006, other charges (income), net included
    increased interest income associated with higher cash balances
    in the U.S. as a result of our foreign earnings
    repatriation during 2005 associated with the American Jobs
    Creation Act of 2004.

During the fourth quarter of 2008, we initiated a global cost
    reduction program. Charges under the program will primarily
    comprise severance costs and are expected to be approximately
    $15 to $20 million, of which $6.4 million was recorded
    in other charges (income), net during the year ended
    December 31, 2008. Cash paid for severance during the
    fourth quarter of 2008 totaled $0.7 million. Under the
    program, our workforce (including employees and temporary
    personnel) will be reduced by approximately 600. The program is
    expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2009. As a
    result of the reduction in workforce, we anticipate personnel
    costs to be reduced by approximately $25 million on an
    annual basis.

Interest expense
    and taxes

Interest expense was $25.4 million for 2008, compared to
    $21.0 million for 2007 and $17.5 million for 2006. The
    increase in 2008 is due primarily to increased borrowings
    compared to 2007. The increase in 2007 is due to higher average
    borrowing rates offset in part by reduced average borrowings
    versus 2006.

During the first quarter of 2008, we recorded a discrete tax
    benefit of $2.5 million related to favorable withholding
    tax law changes in China. During the third quarter of 2008, we
    recorded discrete tax items resulting in a net tax benefit of
    $3.5 million primarily related to the closure of certain
    tax matters.



During the third quarter of 2007, we recorded certain discrete
    tax items which resulted in a net tax benefit of
    $1.1 million. The discrete items include a benefit of
    $3.4 million related to a favorable resolution of certain
    tax matters and other adjustments related to prior years, which
    were partially offset by a charge of $2.3 million primarily
    due to a tax law change in Germany.

During the third quarter of 2006, we implemented a legal
    reorganization that resulted in a reduction of the estimated
    annual effective tax rate before discrete items from 30% to
    27%.  In addition to the change in our annual effective tax
    rate, we recorded three discrete tax items: a charge of
    $10.5 million related to the establishment of a valuation
    allowance on foreign tax credit carryforwards, a benefit of
    $13.4 million associated with a reduction of a liability
    previously established for estimated costs to repatriate
    unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries, and a favorable tax
    law change resulting in a benefit of $5.1 million.

Our annual effective tax rate was 24%, 27% and 23% for 2008,
    2007 and 2006, respectively. The previously described discrete
    tax items had the effect of lowering our annual effective tax
    rate by 2% in 2008 and 4% in 2006.

Results of
    Operations — by Operating Segment

The following is a discussion of the financial results of our
    operating segments. We currently have five reportable segments:
    U.S. Operations, Swiss Operations, Western European
    Operations, Chinese Operations and Other. A more detailed
    description of these segments is outlined in Note 16 to our
    consolidated financial statements.

Represents U.S. dollar growth for net sales and segment
    profit.

The increase in total net sales during 2008 reflects growth
    across most product lines, particularly our laboratory-related
    and industrial-related products. Our laboratory-related and
    industrial-related products experienced especially strong growth
    in analytical instruments and product inspection, respectively.
    Net sales were reduced by 1% related to product line exits. Net
    sales to external customers declined 4% during the fourth
    quarter of 2008 which included a decrease in most product
    categories related to the global economic slowdown. We expect
    net sales will also decline during 2009.

Segment profit increased by $8.5 million in our
    U.S. Operations segment during 2008, compared to an
    increase of $15.5 million during 2007. The increase in
    segment profit in 2008 was primarily due to increased sales
    volume leveraging our fixed production costs and increased
    inter-segment income from our Chinese Operations, offset in part
    by investments in sales and marketing.

Total net sales in local currency increased by 2% in 2008 and by
    11% in 2007. Net sales to external customers in local currency
    increased by 4% in 2008 and by 9% in 2007. The increase in sales
    to external customers during 2008 relates primarily to strong
    growth in most of our laboratory-related products, particularly
    in process analytics, as well as improved project activity in
    retail products. Net sales to external customers in local
    currency declined 6% during the fourth quarter of 2008 which
    included a decrease in most product categories, especially
    laboratory- and industrial-related products, related to the
    global economic slowdown. We expect net sales in local currency
    will also decline during 2009.

Segment profit increased by $5.5 million in our Swiss
    Operations segment during 2008, compared to an increase of
    $11.1 million during 2007. The increase in segment profit
    in 2008 is primarily due to increased sales volume leveraging
    our fixed production costs, partially offset by higher research
    and development project activity and unfavorable currency.

Represents U.S. dollar growth for net sales and segment
    profit.

Total net sales in local currency increased by 6% in 2008 and
    2007. Net sales to external customers in local currency
    increased by 5% in 2008 and 2007. The 2008 increase includes
    solid sales growth in our industrial-related and
    laboratory-related products. We also experienced strong European
    retail project activity during 2008. Net sales to external
    customers increased 2% in local currency during the fourth
    quarter of 2008 which included strong project activity in our
    food retail products and transportation and logistics, as well
    as solid growth in our product inspection sales. These results
    were offset in part by reduced sales in our laboratory and
    core-industrial products related to the global economic
    slowdown. We expect net sales in local currency for our
    laboratory and core-industrial products will also decline during
    2009. Sales in our food retail products, transportation and
    logistics and product inspection may also be reduced during 2009.

Segment profit increased by $11.3 million in our Western
    European Operations segment during 2008, compared to an increase
    of $7.9 million in 2007. The increase in segment profit in
    2008 is principally a result of increased sales volume
    leveraging our fixed production costs and favorable currency
    translation fluctuations, partially offset by increased sales
    and marketing investments. We also recorded severance expense of
    $5.1 million during the first nine months of 2008.

Total net sales in local currency increased by 14% in 2008 and
    by 21% in 2007. Net sales to external customers in local
    currency increased by 24% in 2008 and 21% in 2007. These
    increases were due to continued sales growth for most product
    lines, in particular industrial-related products. Net sales to
    external customers in local currency increased 9% during the
    fourth quarter of 2008 reflecting a reduction in our



historical growth rate related to the global economic slowdown.
    We expect our net sales in local currency will be adversely
    affected during 2009 by weak global economic conditions.

Segment profit increased by $1.5 million in our Chinese
    Operations segment during 2008, compared to an increase of
    $12.3 million in 2007. The increase in segment profit in
    2008 is primarily due to increased sales volume, partially
    offset by unfavorable currency fluctuations on inter-segment
    sales, increased material costs, increased inter-segment
    expenses from our U.S. Operations and a previous year gain
    associated with an asset sale.

Represents U.S. dollar growth for net sales and segment
    profit.

Total net sales in local currency increased by 9% in 2008 and by
    15% in 2007. Net sales to external customers in local currency
    increased 9% in 2008 and 13% in 2007. This performance reflects
    increased sales in our Other Asia Pacific, Eastern European and
    Other Americas markets. Net sales to external customers in local
    currency increased 2% during the fourth quarter of 2008 and
    included sales growth in Other Asia Pacific offset in part by
    reduced sales in Canada, Eastern Europe and Japan. We expect our
    net sales in local currency will be adversely affected during
    2009 by weak global economic conditions.

Segment profit decreased by $1.1 million in our Other
    segment during 2008, compared to an increase of
    $8.5 million during 2007. The decrease in segment profit
    was primarily a result of decreased profitability in Canada and
    severance expense, partially offset by increased profitability
    in Other Asia Pacific and Other Eastern European markets.

Liquidity and
    Capital Resources

Liquidity is our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from
    operating activities to meet our obligations and commitments. In
    addition, liquidity includes the ability to obtain appropriate
    financing. Currently, our financing requirements are primarily
    driven by working capital requirements, capital expenditures,
    share repurchases and acquisitions.

Cash provided by operating activities totaled
    $223.8 million in 2008, compared to $228.2 million in
    2007 and $191.6 million in 2006. The decrease in 2008
    resulted principally from reduced accounts payable balances of
    $15.9 million from the beginning of the year versus
    increased balances of $26.4 million during the previous
    year which was largely attributable to strong December 2007
    business activity. The decrease in cash provided by operating
    activities was also attributable to higher payments of
    approximately $10.9 million related to 2007
    performance-related compensation incentives (bonus payments)
    that were paid during 2008 and the timing of tax disbursements
    of $21.9 million. These items were offset in part by higher
    net earnings of $24.3 million compared to the corresponding
    period in 2007. The increase in 2007, as compared to 2006,
    resulted principally from improved operating results and a
    reduction in tax payments which included a $6 million tax
    refund, offset in part by approximately $9 million of
    higher payments related to 2006 performance-related compensation
    incentives (bonus payments) that were paid during 2007. We also
    made a $5.0 million voluntary incremental pension
    contribution to our U.S. plan in 2008 and a
    $7.7 million contribution to our U.S. plan in 2007.

Capital expenditures are made primarily for investments in
    information systems and technology, machinery, equipment and the
    purchase and expansion of facilities. Our capital expenditures
    totaled $61.0 million in 2008, $47.5 million in 2007
    and $34.3 million in 2006. We expect capital expenditures
    to increase as our business grows and to fluctuate as currency
    exchange rates change. Our 2008 capital



expenditures included $20.0 million of investments related
    to the initial phases of our Blue Ocean multi-year program of
    information technology investment compared to $5.0 million
    in the previous year. Our capital expenditures in 2007 included
    $7.1 million of investments related to our new Chinese
    facility, compared to $6.4 million in 2006.

Cash flows used in financing activities during 2008 included
    $3.3 million of financing fees related to the closing of
    our new $950 million credit facility during the third
    quarter. As further described below, in accordance with our
    share repurchase plan, we purchased 2,232,188 shares and
    3,384,731 shares in the amount of $224.5 million and
    $324.6 million during 2008 and 2007, respectively.

We continue to explore potential acquisitions. In connection
    with any acquisition, we may incur additional indebtedness.

In addition, our ability to generate cash flow may be reduced
    due to the global economic slowdown. In light of the economic
    downturn and instability in the financial markets, we have taken
    a more conservative posture towards the utilization of our cash
    flow and capital structure. This includes suspending our share
    repurchase program during the fourth quarter of 2008. We
    presently cannot estimate what purchases may be made in 2009, if
    any.

Credit
    Agreement

On August 15, 2008, the Company entered into a
    $950 million new Credit Agreement (the “Credit
    Agreement”), which replaced its $450 million Amended
    and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Prior Credit
    Agreement”). The new Credit Agreement is provided by a
    group of financial institutions (similar to our Prior Credit
    Agreement) and has a maturity date of August 15, 2013. It
    is a revolving credit facility and is not subject to any
    scheduled principal payments prior to maturity. The obligations
    under the Credit Agreement are unsecured.

Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at current
    market rates plus a margin based on the Company’s senior
    unsecured credit ratings, which was, as of December 31,
    2008, set at LIBOR plus 0.70% (based on ratings of
    “BBB” by Standard & Poor’s and
    “Baa2” by Moody’s). The Company must also pay
    facility fees that are tied to its credit ratings. The Credit
    Agreement contains covenants, with which the Company was in
    compliance as of December 31, 2008, including maintaining a
    consolidated interest coverage ratio of more than 3.5 to 1.0 and
    a consolidated leverage ratio of less than 3.25 to 1.0. The
    Credit Agreement also places certain limitations on the Company,
    including limiting the ability to incur liens or indebtedness at
    a subsidiary level. In addition, the Credit Agreement has
    several events of default, including upon a change of control.
    The Company capitalized $3.3 million in financing fees
    associated with the Credit Agreement which are amortized to
    interest expense through 2013. As of December 31, 2008,
    approximately $666.4 million was available under the
    facility.

Senior
    Notes

In November 2003, we issued $150 million of 4.85% unsecured
    Senior Notes due November 15, 2010. The Senior Notes rank
    equally with all our unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.
    Interest is payable semi-annually in May and November. Discount
    and issuance costs approximated $1.2 million and are being
    amortized to interest expense over the seven-year term of the
    Senior Notes.

At our option, the Senior Notes may be redeemed in whole or in
    part at any time at a redemption price equal to the greater of:

•

the principal amount of the Senior Notes, or

•

the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled
    payments of principal and interest thereon discounted to the
    redemption date on a semi-annual basis at a comparable treasury
    rate plus a margin of 0.20%.

The Senior Notes contain limitations on our ability to incur
    liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions exceeding
    10% of our consolidated net worth.

Changes in exchange rates between the currencies in which we
    generate cash flow and the currencies in which our borrowings
    are denominated affect our liquidity. In addition, because we
    borrow in a variety of currencies, our debt balances fluctuate
    due to changes in exchange rates.

At December 31, 2008, we were in compliance with all
    covenants set forth in our Credit Agreement and Senior Notes. In
    addition, we do not have any downgrade triggers relating to
    ratings from rating agencies that would accelerate the maturity
    dates of our debt.

We currently believe that cash flow from operating activities,
    together with liquidity available under our Credit Agreement and
    local working capital facilities, will be sufficient to fund
    currently anticipated working capital needs and capital spending
    requirements for at least the next several years.

In addition to the above table, we also have liabilities for
    income taxes, pension and post-retirement funding. However, we
    cannot determine the timing or the amounts for periods beyond
    2008 for income taxes and beyond 2009 for pension and
    post-retirement funding.

We have purchase commitments for materials, supplies, services
    and fixed assets in the normal course of business. Due to the
    proprietary nature of many of our materials and processes,
    certain supply contracts contain penalty provisions. We do not
    expect potential payments under these provisions to materially
    affect results of operations or financial condition. This
    conclusion is based upon reasonably likely outcomes derived by
    reference to historical experience and current business plans.

Share Repurchase
    Program

We have a share repurchase program that was announced in 2004.
    Under the program, we have been authorized to buy back up to
    $1.5 billion of the Company’s common shares. As of
    December 31, 2008, there



were $416.6 million of remaining common shares authorized
    to be repurchased under the plan by December 31, 2010. The
    share repurchases are expected to be funded from cash balances,
    borrowings and cash generated from operating activities.
    Repurchases will be made through open market transactions and
    the timing will depend on the level of acquisition activity,
    business and market conditions, the stock price, trading
    restrictions and other factors. In addition, our ability to
    generate cash flow may be reduced due to the global economic
    slowdown. In light of the economic downturn and instability in
    the financial markets, we have taken a more conservative posture
    towards the utilization of our cash flow and capital structure.
    This includes suspending our share repurchase program during the
    fourth quarter of 2008. We presently cannot estimate what
    purchases may be made in 2009, if any. We have purchased
    15.2 million shares since the inception of the program
    through December 31, 2008.

During the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, we spent
    $224.5 million and $324.6 million on the repurchase of
    2,232,188 shares and 3,384,731 shares at an average
    price per share of $100.55 and $95.88, respectively. In
    addition, $5.2 million relating to the settlement of shares
    repurchased as of December 31, 2007 were cash settled
    during 2008. We reissued 139,780 shares and
    567,205 shares held in treasury for the exercise of stock
    options during 2008 and 2007, respectively.

We also reissued 16,760 shares held in treasury pursuant to
    our 2007 Share Plan, which extends certain eligible
    employees the option to receive a percentage of their annual
    bonus in shares of the Company’s stock.

Off-Balance Sheet
    Arrangements

Currently, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have
    or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on
    our financial condition, changes in financial condition,
    revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital
    expenditures or capital resources that is material.

Effect of
    Currency on Results of Operations

Because we conduct operations in many countries, our operating
    income can be significantly affected by fluctuations in currency
    exchange rates. Swiss franc-denominated expenses represent a
    much greater percentage of our operating expenses than Swiss
    franc-denominated sales represent of our net sales. In part,
    this is because most of our manufacturing costs in Switzerland
    relate to products that are sold outside Switzerland. Moreover,
    a substantial percentage of our research and development
    expenses and general and administrative expenses are incurred in
    Switzerland. Therefore, if the Swiss franc strengthens against
    all or most of our major trading currencies (e.g

.

, the
    U.S. dollar, the euro, other major European currencies, the
    Chinese yuan and the Japanese yen), our operating profit is
    reduced. We also have significantly more sales in European
    currencies (other than the Swiss franc) than we have expenses in
    those currencies. Therefore, when European currencies weaken
    against the U.S. dollar and the Swiss franc, it also
    decreases our operating profits. Accordingly, the Swiss franc
    exchange rate to the euro is an important cross-rate that we
    monitor. In recent months, we have seen substantially higher
    volatility in exchange rates generally than in the past, and the
    Swiss franc has strengthened significantly against the euro. We
    estimate that a 1% strengthening of the Swiss franc against the
    euro would result in a decrease in our earnings before tax of
    $1.0 million to $1.4 million on an annual basis. In
    addition to the Swiss franc and major European currencies, we
    also conduct business in many geographies throughout the world,
    including Asia Pacific, Eastern Europe, Latin America and
    Canada. Fluctuations in these currency exchange rates against
    the U.S. dollar can also affect our operating results. In
    addition to the effects of exchange rate movements on operating
    profits, our debt levels can fluctuate due to changes in
    exchange rates, particularly between the U.S. dollar and
    the Swiss franc. Based on our outstanding debt at
    December 31, 2008, we estimate that a 10% weakening of the
    U.S. dollar against the currencies in which our debt is
    denominated would result in an increase of approximately
    $5.0 million in the reported U.S. dollar value of the
    debt.

Taxes

We are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions throughout the
    world. Our effective tax rate and tax liability will be affected
    by a number of factors, such as the amount of taxable income in
    particular



jurisdictions, the tax rates in such jurisdictions, tax treaties
    between jurisdictions, the extent to which we transfer funds
    between jurisdictions, earnings repatriations between
    jurisdictions and changes in law. Generally, the tax liability
    for each taxpayer within the group is determined either
    (i) on a non-consolidated/non-combined basis or
    (ii) on a consolidated/combined basis only with other
    eligible entities subject to tax in the same jurisdiction, in
    either case without regard to the taxable losses of
    non-consolidated/non-combined affiliated legal entities.

Environmental
    Matters

We are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the
    jurisdictions in which we operate. We own or lease a number of
    properties and manufacturing facilities around the world. Like
    many of our competitors, we have incurred, and will continue to
    incur, capital and operating expenditures and other costs in
    complying with such laws and regulations.

We are currently involved in, or have potential liability with
    respect to, the remediation of past contamination in certain of
    our facilities in both the United States and abroad. Our former
    subsidiary, Hi-Speed, was one of two private parties ordered to
    perform certain ground water contamination monitoring under an
    administrative consent order that NJDEP signed on June 13,
    1988 with respect to certain property in Landing, New Jersey.
    GEI is the other ordered party. GEI has failed to fulfill its
    obligations under the NJDEP consent order, and NJDEP has agreed
    with Hi-Speed that the residual ground water contaminants can be
    monitored through the establishment of a Classification
    Exception Area and concurrent Well Restriction Area for the
    site. The NJDEP does not view these vehicles as remedial
    measures, but rather as “institutional controls” that
    must be adequately maintained and periodically evaluated. We
    estimate that the costs of compliance associated with monitoring
    ground water contamination levels at the site will be
    approximately $0.6 million in the coming years.

In addition, certain of our present and former facilities have
    or had been in operation for many decades and, over such time,
    some of these facilities may have used substances or generated
    and disposed of wastes which are or may be considered hazardous.
    It is possible that these sites, as well as disposal sites owned
    by third parties to which we have sent wastes, may in the future
    be identified and become the subject of remediation.
    Accordingly, although we believe that we are in substantial
    compliance with applicable environmental requirements and to
    date we have not incurred material expenditures in connection
    with environmental matters, it is possible that we could become
    subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future
    that could result in a material adverse effect on our financial
    condition or results of operations or cash flows.

Inflation

Inflation can affect the costs of goods and services that we
    use, including raw materials to manufacture our products. The
    competitive environment in which we operate limits somewhat our
    ability to recover higher costs through increased selling prices.

Moreover, there may be differences in inflation rates between
    countries in which we incur the major portion of our costs and
    other countries in which we sell products, which may limit our
    ability to recover increased costs. We remain committed to
    operations in China and Eastern Europe, which have experienced
    inflationary conditions. To date, inflationary conditions have
    not had a material effect on our operating results. However, as
    our presence in China and Eastern Europe increases, these
    inflationary conditions could have a greater impact on our
    operating results.

Quantitative and
    Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

We have only limited involvement with derivative financial
    instruments and do not use them for trading purposes.

We have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to
    economically hedge short-term intercompany balances with our
    international businesses on a monthly basis. Such contracts
    limit our exposure to both



favorable and unfavorable currency fluctuations. The net fair
    value of these contracts was inconsequential at
    December 31, 2008 and a $0.6 million gain at
    December 31, 2007. A sensitivity analysis to changes on
    these foreign currency-denominated contracts indicates that if
    the primary currency (U.S. dollar, Swiss franc and British
    pound) declined by 10%, the fair value of these instruments
    would increase by $1.1 million at December 31, 2008,
    as compared with a decrease of $1.6 million at
    December 31, 2007. Any resulting changes in fair value
    would be offset by changes in the underlying hedged balance
    sheet position. The sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel
    shift in foreign currency exchange rates. The assumption that
    exchange rates change in parallel fashion may overstate the
    impact of changing exchange rates on assets and liabilities
    denominated in a foreign currency. We also have other currency
    risks as described under “Effect of Currency on Results of
    Operations.”

We have entered into certain interest rate swap agreements.
    These contracts are more fully described in Note 4 to our
    consolidated financial statements. The fair value of these
    contracts was a net loss of $2.8 million and a net gain of
    $0.6 million at December 31, 2008 and
    December 31, 2007, respectively. Based on our agreements
    outstanding at December 31, 2008, a 100-basis-point
    increase in interest rates would result in an increase in the
    net aggregate market value of these instruments of
    $2.0 million, as compared with a decrease of
    $0.8 million at December 31, 2007. Conversely, a
    100-basis-point decrease in interest rates would result in a
    $2.0 million decrease in the net aggregate market value of
    these instruments at December 31, 2008, as compared with a
    net increase of $0.9 million at December 31, 2007. Any
    change in fair value would not affect our consolidated statement
    of operations unless such agreements and the debt they hedge
    were prematurely settled.

Critical
    Accounting Policies

Management’s discussion and analysis of our financial
    condition and results of operations is based upon our audited
    consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in
    accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these
    consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates
    and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
    liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of
    contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we
    evaluate our estimates, including those related to pensions and
    other post-retirement benefits, trade accounts receivable,
    inventories, intangible assets, income taxes, revenue and
    warranty costs. We base our estimates on historical experience
    and on various other assumptions that are believed to be
    reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form
    the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of
    assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other
    sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under
    different assumptions or conditions.

We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our
    more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation
    of our audited consolidated financial statements. For a detailed
    discussion on the application of these and other accounting
    policies, see Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial
    statements.

Employee benefit
    plans

The net periodic pension (credit) cost for 2008 and projected
    benefit obligation as of December 31, 2008 was
    $(0.9) million and $111.4 million, respectively, for
    our U.S. pension plans and $9.6 million and
    $560.4 million, respectively, for our international pension
    plans. The net periodic post-retirement cost for 2008 and
    expected post-retirement benefit obligation as of
    December 31, 2008 for our U.S. post-retirement medical
    benefit plan was $0.8 million and $18.9 million,
    respectively.

Pension and post-retirement benefit plan expense and obligations
    are developed from assumptions utilized in actuarial valuations.
    The most significant of these assumptions include the discount
    rate and expected return on plan assets. In accordance with
    U.S. GAAP, actual results that differ from the assumptions
    are accumulated and deferred over future periods. While
    management believes the assumptions used are appropriate,
    differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may
    affect our plan obligations and future expense.



The expected rates of return on the various defined benefit
    pension plans’ assets are based on the asset allocation of
    each plan and the long-term projected return of those assets,
    which represent a diversified mix of U.S. and international
    corporate equities and government and corporate debt securities.
    In April 2002, we froze our U.S. defined benefit pension
    plan and discontinued our retiree medical program for certain
    current and all future employees. Consequently, no significant
    future service costs will be incurred on these plans. For 2008,
    the weighted average return on assets assumption was 8.50% for
    the U.S. plan and 5.15% for the international plans. A
    change in the rate of return of 1% would impact annual benefit
    plan expense by approximately $4.7 million after tax.
    During 2008, our actual return on pension plan assets was a loss
    of $118.7 million or approximately 16% of pension plan
    assets due to the recent decline in global stock markets. These
    losses contributed to an increase in accumulated other
    comprehensive loss in our consolidated statement of
    shareholders’ equity of $48.5 million during 2008.

The discount rates for defined benefit and post-retirement plans
    are set by benchmarking against high-quality corporate bonds.
    For 2008, the average discount rate assumption was 6.25% for the
    U.S. plans and 3.95% for the international plans,
    representing a weighted average of local rates in countries
    where such plans exist. A decrease in the discount rate of 1%
    would impact annual benefit plan expense by approximately
    $1.6 million after tax.

In 2008 and 2007, we made voluntary incremental funding payments
    of $5.0 million and $7.7 million to reduce the
    underfunded status and increase the funded status of our
    U.S. pension plan, respectively. In the future, we may make
    additional mandatory or discretionary contributions to our plan
    or we could be required to make additional cash funding payments.

Equity
    compensation

We also have an equity incentive plan that provides for the
    grant of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units
    and other equity-based awards which, as of January 1, 2006,
    are accounted for and recognized in the consolidated statement
    of operations based on the grant-date fair value of the award
    under SFAS No. 123R, “Share-Based Payment”
    (“SFAS 123R”). Prior to January 1, 2006,
    these equity awards were accounted for under the intrinsic value
    method pursuant to Accounting Principles Board Opinion
    No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
    Employees” and related interpretations. These methodologies
    yield an estimate of fair value based in part on a number of
    management estimates, the most significant of which include
    future volatility and estimated option lives. Changes in these
    assumptions could significantly impact the estimated fair value
    of stock options.

Trade accounts
    receivable

As of December 31, 2008 trade accounts receivable were
    $348.6 million, net of a $12.0 million allowance for
    doubtful accounts.

Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount
    and do not bear interest. The allowance for doubtful accounts
    represents our best estimate of probable credit losses in our
    existing trade accounts receivable. We determine the allowance
    based upon a review of both specific accounts for collection and
    the age of the accounts receivable portfolio.

Inventory

As of December 31, 2008, inventories were
    $170.6 million.

We record our inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable
    value. Cost, which includes direct materials, labor and
    overhead, is generally determined using the first in, first out
    (FIFO) method. The estimated net realizable value is based on
    assumptions for future demand and related pricing. Adjustments
    to the cost basis of our inventory are made for excess and
    obsolete items based on usage, orders and technological
    obsolescence. If actual market conditions are less favorable
    than those projected by management, reductions in the value of
    inventory may be required.



Goodwill and
    other intangible assets

As of December 31, 2008, our consolidated balance sheet
    included goodwill of $424.4 million and other intangible
    assets of $96.3 million.

Our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other
    intangible assets, which affect the amount of future period
    amortization expense and possible impairment expense that we
    will incur. The determination of the value of such intangible
    assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions
    that affect our consolidated financial statements.

In accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and
    Other Intangible Assets” (“SFAS 142”), our
    goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not
    amortized, but are evaluated for impairment annually in the
    fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired. The
    evaluation is based on valuation models that estimate fair value
    based on expected future cash flows and profitability
    projections. In preparing the valuation models, we consider a
    number of factors, including operating results, business plans,
    economic conditions, future cash flows and transactions and
    market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to
    these factors and our judgment in applying them to the
    impairment analyses. The most significant of these estimates and
    assumptions within our fair value models include estimated cash
    flows resulting from estimates of sales growth and controllable
    cost growth, perpetual growth, effective tax rates and discount
    rates. Our assessments to date have indicated that there has
    been no impairment of these assets.

Should any of these estimates or assumptions in the preceding
    paragraphs change, or should we incur lower than expected
    operating performance or cash flows, including from a prolonged
    economic slowdown, we may experience a triggering event that
    requires a new fair value assessment for our reporting units,
    possibly prior to the required annual assessment. These types of
    events and resulting analysis could result in impairment charges
    for goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets if the
    fair value estimate declines below the carrying value.

Our amortization expense related to intangible assets with
    finite lives may materially change should our estimates of their
    useful lives change.

Income
    taxes

Income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities
    reflect management’s assessment of actual future taxes to
    be paid on items in the consolidated financial statements. We
    record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets
    to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. While
    we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and
    feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the
    valuation allowance, in the event we were to determine that we
    would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future
    in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to the
    deferred tax asset would increase income, equity or goodwill in
    the period such determination was made. Likewise, should we
    determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of
    the net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the
    deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such
    determination was made.

We plan to repatriate earnings from China, Switzerland, the
    United Kingdom and certain other countries in future years. All
    other undistributed earnings are considered to be permanently
    invested and we currently believe that there will be no
    additional cost associated with the repatriation of such foreign
    earnings other than withholding taxes.

The significant assumptions and estimates described in the
    preceding paragraphs are important contributors to our ultimate
    effective tax rate for each year in addition to our income mix
    from geographical regions. If any of our assumptions or
    estimates were to change, or should our income mix from our
    geographical regions change, our effective tax rate could be
    materially affected. Based on earnings before taxes of
    $266.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008,
    each increase of $2.6 million in tax expense would increase
    our effective tax rate by 1%.



Revenue
    recognition

Revenue is recognized when title to a product has transferred
    and any significant customer obligations have been fulfilled.
    Standard shipping terms are generally FOB shipping point in most
    countries and, accordingly, title transfers upon shipment. In
    countries where title cannot legally transfer before delivery,
    we defer revenue recognition until delivery has occurred. Other
    than a few small software applications, we do not sell software
    products without the related hardware instrument as the software
    is embedded in the instrument. The Company’s products
    typically require no significant production, modification or
    customization of the hardware or software that is essential to
    the functionality of the products. To the extent our solutions
    have a post-shipment obligation, such as customer acceptance,
    revenue is deferred until the obligation has been completed. In
    addition, we also defer revenue where installation is required,
    unless such installation is deemed perfunctory. We generally
    maintain the right to accept or reject a product return in our
    terms and conditions and we also maintain appropriate accruals
    for outstanding credits. Further, certain products are also sold
    through indirect distribution channels whereby the distributor
    assumes any further obligations to the customer upon title
    transfer. Revenue is recognized on these products upon title
    transfer and risk of loss to its distributors. Distributor
    discounts are offset against revenue at the time such revenue is
    recognized. Shipping and handling costs charged to customers are
    included in total net sales and the associated expense is
    recorded in cost of sales for all periods presented.

Service revenue not under contract is recognized upon the
    completion of the service performed. Spare parts sold on a
    stand-alone basis are recognized upon title transfer which is
    generally at the time of shipment. Revenues from service
    contracts are recognized ratably over the contract period. These
    contracts represent an obligation to perform repair and other
    services including regulatory compliance qualification,
    calibration, certification and preventative maintenance on a
    customer’s pre-defined equipment over the contract period.
    Service contracts are separately priced and payment is typically
    received from the customer at the beginning of the contract
    period.

Warranty

We generally offer one-year warranties on most of our products.
    Product warranties are recorded at the time revenue is
    recognized for certain product shipments. While we engage in
    extensive product quality programs and processes, our warranty
    obligation is affected by product failure rates, material usage
    and service costs incurred in correcting a product failure. If
    we experience claims or significant cost changes in material,
    freight and vendor charges, our cost of goods sold could be
    affected.

Conclusions
    Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and
    Procedures and Changes in Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting

Under the supervision and with the participation of our
    management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief
    Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our
    disclosure controls and procedures as required by Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15(b)

as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon
    that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief
    Financial Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls
    and procedures are effective. There were no changes in our
    internal control over financial reporting during the quarter
    ended December 31, 2008 that have materially affected, or
    are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
    over financial reporting.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal
    control over financial reporting is a process designed to
    provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
    financial reporting and the preparation of the Company’s
    financial statements for external reporting purposes in
    accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2008. In making this assessment, we used the
    criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
    of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework. Based on our
    assessment, we concluded that, as of December 31, 2008, the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting is
    effective.

PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP, an independent registered public
    accounting firm that audited the financial statements included
    in this Report on

Form 10-K,

has issued an attestation in their report on our internal
    control over financial reporting which appears on

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders

of Mettler-Toledo International Inc.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
    the index appearing on

page F-1

present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
    of Mettler-Toledo International Inc. at December 31, 2008
    and 2007, and the results of their operations and their cash
    flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2008 in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition,
    in our opinion, the financial statement schedules listed in the
    index appearing on

page S-1

present fairly, in all material respects, the information set
    forth therein when read in conjunction with the related
    consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the
    Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
    control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008,
    based on criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The
    Company’s management is responsible for these financial
    statements and financial statement schedules, for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on
    Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under
    Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these
    financial statements, on the financial statement schedules, and
    on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
    based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in
    accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
    Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
    plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about
    whether the financial statements are free of material
    misstatement and whether effective internal control over
    financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our
    audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test
    basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
    financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used
    and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
    overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal
    control over financial reporting included obtaining an
    understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
    assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
    and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
    internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also
    included performing such other procedures as we considered
    necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits
    provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

As described in Note 13 effective January 1, 2007 the
    Company changed the manner in which it accounts for uncertain
    tax positions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
    transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
    financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
    company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTES TO
    THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(In thousands,
    except share data, unless otherwise stated)

1.

BUSINESS
    DESCRIPTION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

Mettler-Toledo International Inc. (“Mettler-Toledo” or
    the “Company”) is a leading global supplier of
    precision instruments and services. The Company manufactures
    weighing instruments for use in laboratory, industrial,
    packaging, logistics and food retailing applications. The
    Company also manufactures several related analytical instruments
    and provides automated chemistry solutions used in drug and
    chemical compound discovery and development. In addition, the
    Company manufactures metal detection and other end-of-line
    inspection systems used in production and packaging and provides
    solutions for use in certain process analytics applications. The
    Company’s primary manufacturing facilities are located in
    China, Germany, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United
    States. The Company’s principal executive offices are
    located in Greifensee, Switzerland and Columbus, Ohio.

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
    accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and
    include all entities in which the Company has control, which are
    its majority-owned subsidiaries.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and
    assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
    liabilities, as well as disclosure of contingent assets and
    liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the
    reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
    periods. Actual results may differ from those estimates.

All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.

Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts
    to conform to the current year presentation, primarily a
    $16.1 million reclassification of capitalized software, net
    from other non-current assets to property, plant and equipment,
    net as of December 31, 2007.

SUMMARY OF
    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Cash and Cash
    Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with
    original maturity dates of three months or less. The carrying
    value of these cash equivalents approximates fair value.

Trade Accounts
    Receivable

Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount
    and do not bear interest. The allowance for doubtful accounts
    represents the Company’s best estimate of probable credit
    losses in its existing trade accounts receivable. The Company
    determines the allowance based upon a review of both specific
    accounts for collection and the age of the accounts receivable
    portfolio.

Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable
    value. Cost, which includes direct materials, labor and
    overhead, is generally determined using the first in, first out
    (FIFO) method. The estimated net realizable value is based on
    assumptions for future demand and related pricing. Adjustments
    to the cost basis of our inventory are made for excess and
    obsolete items based on usage, orders and technological
    obsolescence. If actual market conditions are less favorable
    than those projected by management, reductions in the value of
    inventory may be required.

NOTES TO THE
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands,
    except share data, unless otherwise stated)

Long-Lived
    Assets

a)  Property,
    Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less
    accumulated depreciation. Repair and maintenance costs are
    charged to expense as incurred. In accordance with Statement of
    Position

98-1,

“Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or
    Obtained for Internal Use”

(“SOP 98-1”),

the Company expenses all internal-use software costs incurred in
    the preliminary project stage and capitalizes certain direct
    costs associated with the development and purchase of
    internal-use software within property, plant and equipment.
    Capitalized costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over
    the estimated useful lives of the software, generally not
    exceeding 10 years. Depreciation and amortization are
    charged on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives
    of the assets as follows:

Buildings and improvements

15 to 50 years

Machinery and equipment

3 to 12 years

Computer software

3 to 10 years

Leasehold improvements

Shorter of useful life or lease term

b)  Goodwill
    and Other Intangible Assets

In accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and
    Other Intangible Assets” (“SFAS 142”),
    goodwill, representing the excess of purchase price over the net
    asset value of companies acquired, and indefinite-lived
    intangible assets are not amortized, but are reviewed for
    impairment annually in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if
    events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might
    be impaired. The annual evaluation is based on valuation models
    that estimate fair value based on expected future cash flows and
    profitability projections.

Other intangible assets also include definite-lived assets which
    are subject to amortization. Where applicable, amortization is
    charged on a straight-line basis over the expected period to be
    benefited. The straight-line method of amortization reflects an
    appropriate allocation of the cost of the intangible assets to
    earnings in proportion to the amount of economic benefits
    obtained by the Company in each reporting period. The Company
    assesses the recoverability of other intangible assets subject
    to amortization in accordance with SFAS No. 144,
    “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
    Assets” (“SFAS 144”).

Accounting for
    Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

In accordance with SFAS 144, the Company assesses the need
    to record impairment losses on long-lived assets with finite
    lives when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
    carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. An impairment
    loss would be recognized when future estimated undiscounted cash
    flows expected to result from use of the asset are less than the
    asset’s carrying value, with the loss measured at fair
    value based on discounted expected cash flows.

Taxation

The Company files tax returns in each jurisdiction in which it
    operates. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for
    the future tax consequences attributable to differences between
    the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
    liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss
    and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and
    liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in the
    respective jurisdictions in which the Company operates. In
    assessing the ability to realize deferred tax assets,

F-8


METTLER-TOLEDO
    INTERNATIONAL INC.

NOTES TO THE
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands,
    except share data, unless otherwise stated)

management considers whether it is more likely than not that
    some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be
    realized.

Deferred taxes are not provided on the unremitted earnings of
    subsidiaries outside of the United States when it is expected
    that these earnings are permanently reinvested. Such earnings
    may become taxable upon the sale or liquidation of these
    subsidiaries or upon the remittance of dividends. Deferred taxes
    are provided when the Company no longer considers subsidiary
    earnings to be permanently invested, such as in situations where
    the Company’s subsidiaries plan to make future dividend
    distributions.

The Company recognizes accrued amounts of interest and penalties
    related to its uncertain tax positions as part of income tax
    expense within its consolidated statement of operations.

Currency
    Translation and Transactions

The reporting currency for the consolidated financial statements
    of the Company is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency
    for the Company’s operations is generally the applicable
    local currency. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of
    companies whose functional currency is other than the
    U.S. dollar are included in the consolidated financial
    statements by translating the assets and liabilities into the
    reporting currency at the exchange rates applicable at the end
    of the reporting period. The statements of operations and cash
    flows of such

non-U.S. dollar

functional currency operations are translated at the monthly
    average exchange rates during the year. Translation gains or
    losses are accumulated in other comprehensive (loss) income in
    the consolidated statements of shareholders’ equity.
    Transaction gains and losses are included as a component of net
    earnings.

Revenue
    Recognition

Revenue is recognized when title to a product has transferred
    and any significant customer obligations have been fulfilled.
    Standard shipping terms are generally FOB shipping point in most
    countries and, accordingly, title transfers upon shipment. In
    countries where title cannot legally transfer before delivery,
    the Company defers revenue recognition until delivery has
    occurred. Other than a few small software applications, the
    Company does not sell software products without the related
    hardware instrument as the software is embedded in the
    instrument. The Company’s products typically require no
    significant production, modification or customization of the
    hardware or software that is essential to the functionality of
    the products. To the extent the Company’s solutions have a
    post-shipment obligation, such as customer acceptance, revenue
    is deferred until the obligation has been completed. In
    addition, the Company defers revenue where installation is
    required, unless such installation is deemed perfunctory. The
    Company generally maintains the right to accept or reject a
    product return in its terms and conditions and also maintains
    appropriate accruals for outstanding credits. Further, certain
    products are also sold through indirect distribution channels
    whereby the distributor assumes any further obligations to the
    customer upon title transfer. Revenue is recognized on these
    products upon title transfer and risk of loss to its
    distributors. Distributor discounts are offset against revenue
    at the time such revenue is recognized. Shipping and handling
    costs charged to customers are included in total net sales and
    the associated expense is recorded in cost of sales for all
    periods presented.

Service revenue not under contract is recognized upon the
    completion of the service performed. Spare parts sold on a
    stand-alone basis are recognized upon title transfer which is
    generally at the time of shipment. Revenues from service
    contracts are recognized ratably over the contract period. These
    contracts represent an obligation to perform repair and other
    services including regulatory compliance qualification,
    calibration, certification and preventative maintenance on a
    customer’s pre-defined equipment over the contract period.
    Service contracts are separately priced and payment is typically
    received from the customer at the beginning of the contract
    period.

    INTERNATIONAL INC.

NOTES TO THE
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands,
    except share data, unless otherwise stated)

Research and
    Development

Research and development costs primarily consist of salaries,
    consulting and other costs. The Company expenses these costs as
    incurred.

Warranty

The Company generally offers one-year warranties on most of its
    products. Product warranties are recorded at the time revenue is
    recognized for certain product shipments. While the Company
    engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, its
    warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates,
    material usage and service costs incurred in correcting a
    product failure.

Employee
    Termination Benefits

In situations where contractual termination benefits exist, the
    Company records accruals for employee termination benefits when
    it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount
    of the liability is reasonably estimable. All other employee
    termination arrangements are recognized and measured at their
    fair value at the communication date unless the employee is
    required to render additional service beyond the legal
    notification period, in which case the liability is recognized
    ratably over the future service period.

Earnings per
    Common Share

In accordance with the treasury stock method, the Company has
    included 798,549, 927,714 and 719,757 equivalent shares in the
    calculation of diluted weighted average number of common shares
    for the years ending December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively, relating to outstanding stock options and
    restricted stock units.

Outstanding options to purchase 564,487, 146,125 and
    416,375 shares of common stock for the years ending
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, have been
    excluded from the calculation of diluted weighted average number
    of common and common equivalent shares as such options would be
    anti-dilutive.

Equity-Based
    Compensation

The Company applies the fair value methodology under
    SFAS No. 123R, “Share-Based Compensation”
    (“SFAS 123R”), and related interpretations in
    accounting for its equity-based compensation plan.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

The Company has only limited involvement with derivative
    financial instruments and does not use them for trading
    purposes. As described more fully in Note 4, the Company
    enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to
    economically hedge certain short-term intercompany balances
    involving its international businesses. Such contracts limit the
    Company’s exposure to currency fluctuations on the items
    they hedge. These contracts are adjusted to fair market value as
    of each balance sheet date, with the resulting changes in fair
    value being recognized in the appropriate financial statement
    caption in the income statement consistent with the underlying
    hedged item.

The Company also enters into certain interest rate swap
    agreements in order to manage its exposure to changes in
    interest rates. The differential paid or received on interest
    rate swap agreements is recognized in interest expense over the
    life of the agreements as incurred. The Company’s fixed to
    floating interest rate swap agreements are accounted for as fair
    value hedges. The change in fair value of outstanding interest
    rate swap agreements that are effective as fair value hedges is
    recognized in earnings as incurred and is offset by the change
    in fair value of the hedged item. The Company’s floating to
    fixed interest rate swap agreements are

F-10


METTLER-TOLEDO
    INTERNATIONAL INC.

NOTES TO THE
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands,
    except share data, unless otherwise stated)

accounted for as cash flow hedges. The change in fair value of
    the outstanding interest rate swap agreements that are effective
    as cash flow hedges is recognized in other comprehensive (loss)
    income as incurred.

Fair Value
    Measurements

The Company measures or monitors certain assets and liabilities
    on a fair value basis. Fair value is used on a recurring basis
    for assets and liabilities in which fair value is the primary
    basis of accounting, mainly derivative instruments. Fair value
    is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset
    or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
    between market participants at the measurement date. When
    determining the fair value measurements for assets and
    liabilities required to be recorded at fair value, the Company
    considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it
    would transact and considers assumptions that market
    participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. The
    Company applies the fair value hierarchy in accordance with
    SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements”
    (“SFAS 157”), and when possible looks to active
    and observable markets to price identical assets and
    liabilities. If identical assets and liabilities are not traded
    in active markets, the Company looks to market observable data
    for similar assets and liabilities.

New Accounting
    Pronouncements

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R,
    “Business Combinations” (“SFAS 141R”),
    which revises SFAS No. 141 and changes multiple
    aspects of the accounting for business combinations. Under the
    guidance in SFAS No. 141R, the acquisition method must
    be used, which requires the acquirer to recognize most
    identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and
    noncontrolling interests in the acquiree at their full fair
    value on the acquisition date. Goodwill is to be recognized as
    the excess of the consideration transferred plus the fair value
    of the noncontrolling interest over the fair values of the
    identifiable net assets acquired. Subsequent changes in the fair
    value of contingent consideration classified as a liability are
    to be recognized in earnings, while contingent consideration
    classified as equity is not to be remeasured. Costs such as
    transaction costs are to be excluded from acquisition accounting
    and restructuring costs that do not meet certain criteria at
    acquisition date are to be subsequently recognized as
    post-acquisition costs. SFAS No. 141R will be
    effective for the Company beginning after January 1, 2009
    and will impact business combination transactions that close
    subsequent to that date.

In January 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position

FAS 157-2,

“Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157”

(“FSP 157-2”).

FSP 157-2

delays the effective date of SFAS 157 for all nonfinancial
    assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are
    recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial
    statements on a recurring basis (at least annually) until fiscal
    years beginning after November 15, 2008 and interim periods
    within those fiscal years. The Company does not believe that the
    adoption of

FSP 157-2

on January 1, 2009 will have a material impact on its
    consolidated results of operations or financial position. In
    October 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position

FAS 157-3,

“Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the
    Market for that Asset is not Active”

(FSP 157-3).

FSP 157-3

clarifies the application of SFAS 157 in a market that is
    not active and provides key considerations to be used in
    determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market
    for that financial asset is not active.

FSP 157-3

became effective upon issuance, including prior periods for
    which financial statements have been issued. Accordingly, the
    Company adopted

FSP 157-3

is consistent with our adoption of SFAS 157; therefore, the
    issuance of the standard did not impact the Company’s
    consolidated results of operations or financial position for the
    year ended December 31, 2008.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161,
    “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities,” which amends SFAS No. 133,
    “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities,” and expands the derivative-related disclosure
    requirements. SFAS No. 161 requires qualitative
    disclosures about

objectives and strategies for using derivatives, quantitative
    disclosures in tabular format of the fair values of derivative
    instruments and their gains and losses, and disclosures about
    credit-risk-related contingent features in derivative
    agreements. The standard also amended SFAS No. 107,
    “Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial
    Instruments,” to clarify the disclosure requirements with
    respect to derivative counterparty credit risk. SFAS 161
    will be effective for the financial statements issued by the
    Company beginning January 1, 2009. The adoption of
    SFAS 161 will not impact the Company’s consolidated
    results of operations or financial position.

In April 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position

FAS 142-3,

“Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible
    Assets”

(“FSP 142-3”).

FSP 142-3

amends the factors that should be considered in developing
    renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful
    life of a recognized intangible asset under
    SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
    Assets.”

FSP 142-3

requires an entity to consider its own historical experience in
    renewing or extending similar arrangements as well as
    entity-specific factors in determining the useful life of a
    recognized intangible asset.

FSP 142-3

will be effective for the Company beginning January 1,
    2009. The Company does not believe that the adoption of

FSP 142-3

will have a material impact on its consolidated results of
    operations or financial position.

In January 2009, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position
    FAS 132(R)-1, “Employers’ Disclosures about

Post-retirement

Benefit Plan Assets” (“FSP 132(R)-1”).
    FSP 132(R)-1 requires additional disclosures about plan
    assets for defined benefit pension and other post-retirement
    benefit plans including major categories of plan assets, inputs
    and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan
    assets, the effect of fair value measurements using significant
    unobservable inputs on changes in plan assets for the period,
    significant concentrations of risk within plan assets and a
    description of how investment allocation decisions are made.
    FSP 132(R)-1 will be effective for the Company for the
    period ending December 31, 2009. The adoption of
    FSP 132(R)-1 will not impact the Company’s
    consolidated results of operations or financial position.

FINANCIAL
    INSTRUMENTS

In October 2008, the Company entered into an interest rate swap
    agreement, designated as a cash flow hedge, which changed the
    floating rate interest payments associated with
    $150 million outstanding under the Company’s credit
    facility to a fixed obligation. This agreement has a maturity
    date of October 24, 2010. Under the swap, the Company will
    receive a floating interest rate based on LIBOR and pay a fixed
    interest rate of 2.70%. At December 31, 2008, the fair
    value of the swap was a loss of $4.3 million
    ($2.6 million net of tax).

In November 2003, the Company issued $150 million of
    seven-year Senior Notes (the “Senior Notes”). In
    connection with this issuance, the Company entered into an
    interest rate swap agreement, designated as a fair value hedge,
    which changes the fixed interest obligation associated with
    $30 million of the Senior Notes into a floating rate. This
    agreement has a maturity date of November 15, 2010. Under
    the swap, the Company will receive a fixed interest rate of
    4.85% (i.e., the same rate as the Senior Notes) and pay interest
    at a rate of LIBOR

    except share data, unless otherwise stated)

plus 0.22%. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the fair value
    of the swap was a gain of $1.5 million and a gain of
    $0.6 million, respectively.

At December 31, 2008, the Company had outstanding foreign
    currency forward contracts with notional amounts of
    $113.3 million, in order to economically hedge short-term
    intercompany balances largely denominated in Swiss franc and
    other major European currencies with its foreign businesses. The
    net fair value of these contracts was inconsequential as of
    December 31, 2008 and a $0.6 million gain as of
    December 31, 2007.

The Company may be exposed to credit losses in the event of
    nonperformance by the counterparties to its derivative financial
    instrument contracts. Counterparties are established banks and
    financial institutions with high credit ratings. The Company
    believes that such counterparties will be able to fully satisfy
    their obligations under these contracts. The determination of
    fair value of these derivative instruments is described in
    Note 5, Fair Value Measurements.

5.

FAIR VALUE
    MEASUREMENTS

On January 1, 2008, the Company adopted the provisions of
    SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements”,
    except as it relates to nonfinancial assets pursuant to

FSP 157-2

as described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies. SFAS 157 clarifies how companies are required to
    use a fair value measure for recognition and disclosure by
    establishing a common definition of fair value, a framework for
    measuring fair value and expanding disclosures about fair value
    measurements. The adoption of SFAS 157 did not have a
    material impact on the Company’s consolidated results of
    operations or financial position.

As of December 31, 2008, the Company has derivative assets
    totaling $3.4 million and derivative liabilities totaling
    $6.2 million. These derivative assets and liabilities
    consist of foreign currency forward exchange contracts and
    interest rate swap agreements. The forward exchange contracts
    economically hedge short-term intercompany balances with the
    Company’s foreign businesses. One of the interest rate swap
    agreements changes the Company’s fixed interest obligation
    associated with $30 million of Senior Notes into a floating
    rate and is accounted for as a fair value hedge. A second
    interest rate swap agreement changes the floating rate interest
    payments associated with $150 million outstanding under the
    Company’s credit facility to a fixed obligation. This swap
    agreement is accounted for as a cash flow hedge.

The fair values of these instruments are estimated based upon
    inputs from current valuation information obtained from dealer
    quotes and priced with observable market assumptions and
    appropriate valuation adjustments for credit risk. The Company
    has evaluated the valuation methodologies used to develop the
    fair values by dealers in order to determine whether such
    valuations are representative of an exit price in the
    Company’s principal market. The Company has also considered
    both its own credit risk and counterparty credit risk in
    determining fair value and determined these adjustments were
    insignificant for the three- and twelve-month periods ended
    December 31, 2008.

    $4.1 million for 2012 and $2.7 million for 2013. The
    non-indefinite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a
    straight-line basis over periods ranging from 7 to
    45 years. The straight-line method of amortization reflects
    an appropriate allocation of the cost of the intangible assets
    to earnings in proportion to the amount of economic benefits
    obtained by the Company in each reporting period. The weighted
    average amortization period of the non-indefinite-lived
    intangible assets acquired during 2008 is 11 years.
    Further, the weighted average amortization periods of the
    customer relationships, tradenames and proven technology and
    patents acquired during 2008 are 10 years, 10 years
    and 15 years, respectively.

Credit
    Agreement

On August 15, 2008, the Company entered into a
    $950 million new Credit Agreement (the “Credit
    Agreement”), which replaced its $450 million Amended
    and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Prior Credit
    Agreement”). The new Credit Agreement is provided by a
    group of financial institutions (similar to our Prior Credit
    Agreement) and has a maturity date of August 15, 2013. It
    is a revolving credit facility and is not subject to any
    scheduled principal payments prior to maturity. The obligations
    under the Credit Agreement are unsecured.

Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at current
    market rates plus a margin based on the Company’s senior
    unsecured credit ratings, which was, as of December 31,
    2008, set at LIBOR plus 0.70% (based on ratings of
    “BBB” by Standard & Poor’s and
    “Baa2” by Moody’s). The Company must also pay
    facility fees that are tied to its credit ratings. The Credit
    Agreement contains covenants, with which the Company was in
    compliance as of December 31, 2008, including maintaining a
    consolidated interest coverage ratio of more

than 3.5 to 1.0 and a consolidated leverage ratio of less than
    3.25 to 1.0. The Credit Agreement also places certain
    limitations on the Company, including limiting the ability to
    incur liens or indebtedness at a subsidiary level. In addition,
    the Credit Agreement has several events of default, including
    upon a change of control. The Company capitalized
    $3.3 million in financing fees associated with the Credit
    Agreement which are amortized to interest expense through 2013.
    As of December 31, 2008, approximately $666.4 million
    was available under the facility.

Senior
    Notes

In November 2003, the Company issued $150 million of 4.85%
    unsecured Senior Notes due November 15, 2010. The Senior
    Notes rank equally with all our unsecured and unsubordinated
    indebtedness. Interest is payable semi-annually in May and
    November. Discount and issuance costs approximated
    $1.2 million and are being amortized to interest expense
    over the seven-year term of the Senior Notes. At the
    Company’s option, the Senior Notes may be redeemed in whole
    or in part at any time at a redemption price equal to the
    greater of:

•

the principal amount of the Senior Notes, or

•

the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled
    payments of principal and interest thereon discounted to the
    redemption date on a semi-annual basis at a comparable treasury
    rate plus a margin of 0.20%.

The Senior Notes contain limitations on the ability to incur
    liens and enter into sale and leaseback transactions exceeding
    10% of the Company’s consolidated net worth.

Other Local
    Arrangements

During 2006, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company issued and
    sold $10 million of redeemable equity instruments to one of
    the Company’s

non-U.S. sponsored

defined benefit plans. These instruments are redeemable
    beginning in July 2011 and, as such, are classified as long-term
    debt on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet.

The Company’s weighted average interest rate for the years
    ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 was approximately 5% and
    6%, respectively. The carrying value of the Company’s debt
    obligations approximates fair value.

SHAREHOLDERS’
    EQUITY

Common
    Stock

The number of authorized shares of the Company’s common
    stock is 125,000,000 shares with a par value of $0.01 per
    share. Holders of the Company’s common stock are entitled
    to one vote per share. At December 31, 2008,
    4,905,172 shares of the Company’s common stock were
    reserved for issuance pursuant to the Company’s stock
    option plans.

Preferred
    Stock

The Board of Directors, without further shareholder
    authorization, is authorized to issue up to
    10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per
    share in one or more series and to determine and fix the rights,
    preferences and privileges of each series, including dividend
    rights and preferences over dividends on the common stock and
    one or more series of the preferred stock, conversion rights,
    voting rights (in addition to those provided by law), redemption
    rights and the terms of any sinking fund therefore, and rights
    upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, including
    preferences over the common stock and one or

more series of the preferred stock. The issuance of shares of
    preferred stock, or the issuance of rights to purchase such
    shares, may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing
    a change in control of the Company or an unsolicited acquisition
    proposal.

Restricted Stock
    Units

In 2008 and 2007, the Company granted 70,440 and 43,885
    restricted stock units, respectively, to certain employees and
    directors. The weighted average grant-date fair value of the
    restricted stock units granted in 2008 and 2007 was $74.34 and
    $105.11 per unit, respectively, and the restricted units vest
    ratably over a five-year period. The total fair value of the
    restricted stock units on the date of grant for 2008 and 2007 of
    $5.2 million and $4.6 million, respectively, will be
    recorded as compensation expense ratably over the vesting
    period. Approximately $2.5 million and $1.7 million of
    compensation expense was recognized during the years ended
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Shareholder
    Rights Plan

On August 26, 2002, the Board of Directors adopted a
    Shareholder Rights Plan under which the Company declared a
    non-cash dividend of one right for each outstanding share of
    common stock. The Rights, which expire on September 5,
    2012, entitle stockholders to buy one one-thousandth of a share
    of preferred stock at an exercise price of $150. The Rights were
    distributed to those stockholders of record as of close of
    business on September 5, 2002 and are attached to all
    certificates representing those shares of common stock.

The Rights Plan provides that should any person or group
    acquire, or announce a tender or exchange offer for 15% or more
    of the Company’s common stock, each Right, other than
    Rights held by the acquiring person or group, would entitle its
    holder to purchase a number of shares of the Company’s
    common stock for 50% of its then-current market value. Unless a
    15% acquisition has occurred, the Rights may be redeemed by the
    Board of Directors of the Company at any time. The Rights Plan
    will not be triggered by a tender or exchange offer for all
    outstanding shares of the Company at a price and on terms that
    the Company’s Board of Directors determines to be adequate
    and in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders.

The Rights Plan exempts any stockholder that beneficially owned
    15% or more of the Company’s common stock as of
    August 26, 2002. However, the Rights will become
    exercisable if, at any time after August 26, 2002, any of
    these stockholders acquire additional shares of the
    Company’s common stock in an amount which is greater than
    2% of the Company’s outstanding common stock.

Share Repurchase
    Program

The Company has a share repurchase program that was announced in
    2004. Under the program, the Company has been authorized to buy
    back up to $1.5 billion of common shares. As of
    December 31, 2008, there were $416.6 million of
    remaining common shares authorized to be repurchased under the
    plan by December 31, 2010. The share repurchases are
    expected to be funded from cash balances, borrowings and cash
    generated from operating activities. Repurchases will be made
    through open market transactions, and the timing will depend on
    the level of acquisition activity, business and market
    conditions, the stock price, trading restrictions and other
    factors. The Company has purchased 15.2 million shares
    since the inception of the program through December 31,
    2008.

During the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, the
    Company spent $224.5 million and $324.6 million on the
    repurchase of 2,232,188 shares and 3,384,731 shares at
    an average price per share of $100.55 and $95.88, respectively.
    In addition, $5.2 million relating to the settlement of
    shares repurchased as of December 31, 2007 were cash
    settled during 2008. The Company reissued 139,780 shares
    and 567,205 shares held in treasury for the exercise of
    stock options during 2008 and 2007, respectively. In connection
    with prior reissuances during 2006,

the Company has reclassified amounts within stockholders’
    equity to reflect the differential between treasury stock cost
    and option proceeds as part of retained earnings rather than
    additional paid-in capital.

The Company also reissued 16,760 shares held in treasury
    pursuant to its 2007 Share Plan, which extends certain
    eligible employees the option to receive a percentage of their
    annual bonus in shares of the Company’s stock.

EQUITY INCENTIVE
    PLAN

The Company’s equity incentive plan provides employees and
    directors of the Company additional incentive to join

and/or

remain in the service of the Company as well as to maintain and
    enhance the long-term performance and profitability of the
    Company. The Company’s 2004 equity incentive plan was
    approved by shareholders on May 6, 2004 and provides that
    3.5 million shares of common stock, plus any options
    outstanding under the Company’s prior option plan that
    terminate without being exercised, may be the subject of awards.
    Of the 3.5 million shares of common stock available for
    awards, up to 2.1 million shares may be issued in the form
    of restricted stock or restricted stock units. The plan provides
    for the grant of options, restricted stock, restricted stock
    units and other equity-based awards. The exercise price of
    options granted shall not be less than the fair market value of
    the common stock on the date of the award. Options generally
    vest equally over a five-year period from the date of grant and
    have a maximum term of up to 10 years and six months.
    Restricted units vest equally over a five-year period from the
    date of grant. During 2005, the compensation committee of the
    Board of Directors determined to grant restricted share units to
    participating managers and non-qualified stock options to
    executive officers.

On January 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS 123R and
    Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 107,
    “Share-Based Payments,” applying the modified
    prospective method. SFAS 123R requires all share-based
    compensation arrangements granted to employees, including stock
    option grants, to be recognized in the consolidated statement of
    operations based on the grant-date fair value of the award over
    the period during which an employee is required to provide
    service in exchange for the award. Under the modified
    prospective method, the Company is required to record
    share-based compensation expense for all awards granted after
    the date of adoption and for the unvested portion of previously
    granted awards outstanding as of the date of adoption.
    Share-based compensation expense is recorded within selling,
    general and administrative in the consolidated statement of
    operations with a corresponding offset to additional paid-in
    capital in the consolidated balance sheet.

During the first quarter of 2008, the Company granted 213,850
    performance-based options, with a grant-date fair value of
    $32.20. Compensation expense will be recognized over the
    five-year vesting provisions based upon the probability of the
    performance condition being met.

BENEFIT
    PLANS

Mettler-Toledo maintains a number of retirement and other
    post-retirement employee benefit plans.

Certain subsidiaries sponsor defined contribution plans.
    Benefits are determined and funded annually based upon the terms
    of the plans. Amounts recognized as cost under these plans
    amounted to $12.4 million, $13.8 million and
    $11.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2008,
    2007 and 2006, respectively.

Certain subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit plans. Benefits are
    provided to employees primarily based upon years of service and
    employees’ compensation for certain periods during the last
    years of employment. Prior to 2002, the Company’s
    U.S. operations also provided post-retirement medical
    benefits to their employees. Contributions for medical benefits
    are related to employee years of service.

Effective December 31, 2008, the Company adopted the
    measurement provisions of SFAS No. 158,
    “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Post-retirement Plans, an amendment of
    SFAS No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R),” which require
    the Company to measure its defined benefit plan assets and
    obligations as of December 31. Prior to the adoption of the
    SFAS 158 measurement date provision, the Company used a
    measurement date of September 30 and December 31. In
    order to record the effects of the change to a December 31
    measurement date, the Company chose to use the measurements
    determined as of September 30, 2007 and estimate the net
    periodic benefit cost for the

15-month

period ending December 31, 2008, exclusive of any
    curtailment or settlement gains or losses. Costs allocated
    proportionately to the three-month period ended
    December 31, 2007 were recorded as an adjustment to
    retained earnings, effective December 31, 2008. The
    remaining costs were recognized as net periodic benefit cost
    during the year ended December 31, 2008. The following
    table sets forth the adjustments to retained earnings and
    accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”)

The projected post-retirement benefit obligation was principally
    determined using discount rates of 6.25% in 2008, 6.25% in 2007
    and 5.75% in 2006. Net periodic post-retirement benefit cost was
    principally determined using discount rates of 6.25% in 2008,
    5.75% in 2007 and 5.50% in 2006 and health care cost trend rates
    ranging from 7.5% to 11% in 2008, 8.0% to 11.0% in 2007 and 8.5%
    to 12% in 2006, decreasing to 5.0% in 2012.

The health care cost trend rate assumption has a significant
    effect on the accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation and

Investment policies and strategies for each of the
    Company’s pension plans are determined periodically by
    pension trustees for each plan, having regard for the potential
    risks and returns offered by investment in the various assets
    available. Target asset allocation and investment return
    criteria are established by the trustees with the overriding
    objective of stable earnings growth. Actual results are
    monitored against those targets and the trustees are required to
    report to the members of each plan, including an analysis of
    investment performance on an annual basis at a minimum.
    Day-to-day asset management is typically performed by a
    third-party asset management company, reporting to the pension
    trustees. The long-term rate of return on plan asset assumptions
    used to determine pension expense under U.S. GAAP is
    generally based on historical investment performance and the
    target investment return criteria for the future determined by
    the trustees.

    service as appropriate, are expected to be paid:

    reduce the underfunded status and increase the funded status of
    our U.S. pension plan, respectively. The Company does not
    expect to receive any refunds from its benefit plans during 2009.

In 2009, the Company expects to make employer pension
    contributions of approximately $18.0 million to its

non-U.S. pension

plans and normal employer contributions of approximately
    $2.0 million to its U.S. post-retirement medical plan.

On January 1, 2007, the Company adopted FASB Interpretation
    No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
    Taxes — an interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109” (“FIN 48”). FIN 48
    prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for
    recording in the financial statements uncertain tax positions
    taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Additionally,
    FIN 48 provides guidance regarding uncertain tax positions
    relating to derecognition, classification, interest and
    penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and
    transition. As of the date of adoption, the Company recognized a
    $4.1 million increase in the liability for unrecognized tax
    benefits with a corresponding reduction in retained earnings.
    The Company’s total balance of unrecognized tax benefits as
    of January 1, 2007 was $24.4 million.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of
    unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(In thousands,
    except share data, unless otherwise stated)

Included in the unrecognized tax benefits balance at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007 were $22.7 million and
    $23.2 million, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits
    that if recognized would reduce the Company’s tax rate. The
    Company recognizes accrued amounts of interest and penalties
    related to its uncertain tax positions as part of its income tax
    expense within its consolidated statement of operations. The
    amount of accrued interest and penalties included within other
    non-current liabilities within the Company’s consolidated
    balance sheet as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 was
    $2.8 million and $2.3 million, respectively.

The Company believes that it is reasonably possible that the
    unrecognized tax benefit balance could change over the next
    12 months, primarily related to potential disputes raised
    by the taxing authorities over income and expense recognition.
    An estimate of the range of these increases cannot currently be
    made. However, the Company does not expect a change would have a
    material impact on its financial position, results of operations
    or cash flows.

The Company has recorded valuation allowances related to certain
    of its deferred income tax assets due to the uncertainty of the
    ultimate realization of future benefits from such assets. The
    potential decrease or increase of the valuation allowance in the
    near term is dependent on the future ability of the Company to
    realize the deferred tax assets that are affected by the future
    profitability of operations in various worldwide jurisdictions.
    The $2.0 million increase in the total valuation allowance
    during 2008 is primarily attributable to an increase in the
    foreign tax credit carryforward. The $8.1 million decrease
    in the total valuation allowance during 2007 is primarily
    attributable to $4.8 million related to the expiration or
    utilization of tax loss carryforwards and $3.3 million
    related to the adoption of FIN 48. During 2006, the Company
    incurred a $10.5 million charge related to the
    establishment of a valuation allowance for foreign tax credit
    carryforwards described below. $1.8 million of the
    Company’s total valuation allowance will be credited to
    shareholders’ equity if and when realized.

At December 31, 2008, the Company has various
    U.S. state net operating losses and various foreign net
    operating losses that have various expiration periods.

The Company plans to repatriate earnings from China,
    Switzerland, the United Kingdom and certain other countries in
    future years. All other undistributed earnings are considered to
    be permanently reinvested. The Company currently believes that
    there will be no additional cost associated with the
    repatriation of such foreign earnings other than withholding
    taxes.

During the first quarter of 2008, the Company recorded a
    discrete tax benefit of $2.5 million related to favorable
    withholding tax law changes in China. During the third quarter
    of 2008, the Company recorded discrete tax items resulting in a
    net tax benefit of $3.5 million primarily related to the
    closure of certain tax matters.

During the third quarter of 2007, the Company recorded certain
    discrete tax items which resulted in a net tax benefit of
    $1.1 million. The discrete items include a benefit of
    $3.4 million related to a favorable resolution of certain
    tax matters and other adjustments related to prior years, which
    were partially offset by a charge of $2.3 million primarily
    due to a tax law change in Germany.

During 2006, the Company implemented a legal reorganization that
    resulted in a reduction of the estimated annual effective tax
    rate before discrete items from 30% to 27%. In addition to the
    change in the Company’s annual effective tax rate, the
    Company recorded three discrete tax items: a charge of
    $10.5 million related to the establishment of a valuation
    allowance on foreign tax credit carryforwards, a benefit of
    $13.4 million associated with a reduction of a liability
    previously established for estimated costs to repatriate
    unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries and a favorable tax
    law change resulting in a benefit of $5.1 million.

As of December 31, 2008, the major jurisdictions for which
    the Company is subject to examinations are Germany for years
    after 2002, the United States after 2004, France after 2005,
    Switzerland and the United Kingdom after 2006 and China
    after 2007. Additionally, the Company is currently under
    examination in various taxing jurisdictions in which it conducts
    business operations. While the Company has not yet received any
    material assessments from these taxing authorities, the Company
    believes that adequate amounts of taxes and related interest and
    penalties have been provided for any adverse adjustments as a
    result of these examinations and that the ultimate outcome of
    these examinations will not result in a material impact on the
    Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial
    position.

14.

OTHER CHARGES
    (INCOME), NET

Other charges (income), net consists primarily of restructuring
    charges, interest income, (gains) losses from foreign currency
    transactions and other items.

During the fourth quarter 2008, the Company initiated a global
    cost reduction program. Charges under the program primarily
    comprise severance costs and are expected to be approximately
    $15 to $20 million, of which $6.4 million was recorded
    in other charges (income), net during the year ended
    December 31, 2008. Cash paid for severance during the
    fourth quarter of 2008 totaled $0.7 million. Under the
    program, the Company’s workforce (including employees and
    temporary personnel) will be reduced by approximately 600. The
    program is expected to be substantially completed by the end of
    2009. As a result of the reduction in workforce, the Company
    anticipates personnel costs to be reduced by approximately
    $25 million on an annual basis.

and producing organizations located in the United States.
    Western European Operations include the Company’s marketing
    and producing organizations in Western Europe, excluding
    operations located in Switzerland. Swiss Operations include
    marketing and producing organizations located in Switzerland as
    well as extensive R&D operations that are responsible for
    the development, production and marketing of precision
    instruments, including weighing, analytical and measurement
    technologies for use in a variety of industrial and laboratory
    applications. Chinese Operations represent the Company’s
    marketing and producing organizations located in China. The
    Company’s market organizations are geographically focused
    and are responsible for all aspects of the Company’s sales
    and service. Operating segments that exist outside these
    reportable segments are included in Other.

The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same
    as those described in the summary of significant accounting
    policies. The Company evaluates performance based on segment
    profit for segment reporting (gross profit less research and
    development, selling, general and administrative expenses,
    before amortization, interest expense and other charges (income)
    and taxes). Inter-segment sales and transfers are priced to
    reflect consideration of market conditions and the regulations
    of the countries in which the transferring entities are located.
