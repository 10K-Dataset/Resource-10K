FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION

This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that are subject to assumptions, risks and uncertainties, many of which are
discussed throughout this Annual Report, under Item 1A,”Risk Factors,” and elsewhere. Actual results may vary from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Although we believe the expectations reflected in the
forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. If our assumptions about the future do not materialize or prove to be incorrect, the results could differ materially from
those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. A forward-looking statement is
any statement that looks to future events, including any statements regarding the markets for our products or the success of our products in these markets, as well as any statements of expectation, plans, strategies and objectives of management for
the future and any statement of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. In some cases, you can identify a forward looking statement by such terms as “may,” “believe,” “could,” “anticipate,”
“would,” “might,” “plan,” “expect,” and similar expressions or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. We assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect events
that occur or circumstances that exist after the date on which they were made.

EXPLANATORY NOTE

In this Form 10-K, Autodesk, Inc. (“Autodesk”) is restating its consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2006, the related
consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the fiscal years ended January 31, 2006 and 2005, and each of the quarters in fiscal 2006 as a result of a voluntary review of Autodesk’s historical
stock option granting practices and related accounting issues. This restatement is more fully described in “Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements,” in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and in Item 7,
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

This Form 10-K also reflects the
restatement of “Selected Consolidated Financial Data” in Item 6 for the four consecutive fiscal years in the period ended January 31, 2006, and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations” in Item 7 for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2006 and 2005.

Previously filed annual reports on Form 10-K
and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q prior to fiscal 2007 have been affected by the restatements, have not been amended and should not be relied on.

In connection with the restatement of our consolidated financial statements, we applied judgment in choosing whether to revise measurement dates for prior option grants. In addition, if we determined that a measurement date needed to be
revised, judgment was applied in determining the appropriate measurement date.

During the period of the voluntary stock option review, we
determined that we incorrectly recorded certain credits to resellers. As a result, adjustments were made to increase net revenues and decrease deferred revenue in non-material amounts for fiscal years 2006 and 2005.



The increase in net revenues and stock-based compensation expense resulting from the restatement is as
follows (in millions):

(1)

Includes $2.5 million of payroll tax expenses.

The net
of tax impact of the stock-based compensation adjustments in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 was insignificant. However, we restated our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 31, 2006 to properly reflect Retained Earnings, Common Stock and
Deferred Compensation balances as a result of previous period adjustments. Please refer to Note 2 “Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, we have restated the pro
forma expense under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (“SFAS 123”) in Part II, Item 8, Note 1, “Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements to include these adjustments for the years ended January 31, 2006 and January 31, 2005.



PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

GENERAL

Autodesk is one of the world’s leading design software and services companies. We offer solutions to customers in the architectural, engineering,
construction, manufacturing, infrastructure and digital media markets. Our state of the art 2D and 3D software products enable our customers to experience their ideas before they are real by allowing them to create and document their designs and to
visualize, simulate and analyze real-world performance early in the design process by creating digital prototypes. These capabilities give our customers the flexibility to optimize and improve their designs before they actually begin to build
anything, helping save time and money, improve quality and foster innovation. Our horizontal design solutions, AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT, are two of the most widely used general design software tools in the world. In addition, we offer a range of
discipline-specific design and documentation tools including our AutoCAD-based solutions and our 3D design solutions.

We believe that our
ability to make technology available to mainstream markets is one of our competitive advantages. By innovating in existing technology categories, we bring powerful design products to volume markets. Our products are designed to be easy to learn and
use, and to provide customers low cost of deployment, low total cost of ownership and a rapid return on investment. Our product and software architectures allow for extensibility and integration and most of our solutions are PC-based.

We have created a large global community of resellers, third-party developers and customers, which provides us with a broad reach into volume markets.
Our reseller network is extensive and provides our customers with global resources for the purchase and support of our products as well as resources for effective and cost-efficient training services. We have a significant number of registered
third-party developers who create products that run on top of our products, and thereby further extend our reach into volume markets. Our installed base of millions of users has made Autodesk’s products a worldwide design software standard.
Users trained on Autodesk products are broadly available both from universities and the existing workforce, reducing the cost of training for our customers.

Our strategy is to deliver advanced solutions to create and leverage digital design data, in order to improve our customers’ productivity throughout the design, build, manufacture and management of the
customers’ projects. To execute against this strategy we are focused on delivering strong products annually, migrating our customers to more advanced technologies, expanding our desktop offerings in adjacent markets and to adjacent users, as
well as growing our business in emerging economies such as China, India, Eastern Europe and Latin America. We attempt to release new product versions on a regular basis and synchronize our major product retirements with those releases. Our most
recent major product releases occurred in March 2007.

We are organized into two reportable operating segments: the Design Solutions
Segment, which accounted for 87% of net revenue in fiscal 2007, and the Media and Entertainment Segment, which accounted for 13% of net revenue in fiscal 2007. A summary of our condensed net revenues and results of operations for our business
segments is found in Note 13, “Segments,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The

Design Solutions Segment

derives revenues from the sale of software products and services for professionals and consumers who design, build, manage and own building projects; who design, manufacture and manage manufactured goods; and who design, build, manage and own
infrastructure projects for both public and private users. The principal products sold by the Design Solutions Segment include AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT (2D design products), which accounted for 40% of our net revenues in fiscal 2007, and our
discipline-specific AutoCAD-based products and 3D model-based design and documentation products (Autodesk Inventor Family of Products, Autodesk Revit Family of Products and Autodesk Civil 3D), which accounted for 22% of our net revenues in fiscal
2007. In addition to software products, the Design Solutions Segment offers a range of services including consulting, support and training.



During fiscal 2007, the Design Solutions Segment consisted of a general design platform division and
industry-specific business divisions. These were:

•

Platform Technology Division and Other, which includes revenue from Autodesk Collaboration Services and Autodesk Consulting

•

Manufacturing Solutions Division

•

Building Solutions Division

•

Infrastructure Solutions Division

Beginning in fiscal 2008, we reorganized our Design Solutions Segment business divisions to be better aligned with our customers. The newly formed divisions are:

•

Platform Solutions and Emerging Business Division and Other, which includes AutoCAD, AutoCAD LT, Geospatial and other emerging businesses

•

Architecture, Engineering and Construction Division, which includes the old Building Solutions Division, our civil design solutions, as well as our collaborative
project management tools Buzzsaw and Constructware, and

•

Manufacturing Solutions Division, which was not impacted by the reorganization.

Because the reorganization was not effective until the beginning of fiscal 2008, we will present divisional information in this Form 10-K as it was
organized during fiscal 2007.

The

Media and Entertainment Segment

derives revenues from the sale of products to post-production
facilities, broadcasters and creative professionals for a variety of applications, including feature films, television programs, commercials, music and corporate videos, interactive game production, design visualization, web design and interactive
web streaming. The Media and Entertainment Segment is comprised of two business lines: Animation, including visualization, and Advanced Systems. Our animation products provide advanced tools for 3D modeling, animation, rendering solutions, and
design visualization and visual effects production. Our Advanced Systems products provide color grading, editing, finishing and visual effects, compositing, media mastering and encoding technology, and increase the productivity of creative
professionals. Key markets served by the Media and Entertainment Segment include PC animation, advertising, film, television and console game development, and design visualization.

throughout the building lifecycle, Autodesk building industry solutions enable customers to eliminate inefficiencies in building design, construction and management. The division’s solutions range from the most advanced technology for building
information modeling (“BIM”) —a new paradigm for building design, documentation and construction—to the most widely adopted discipline-specific drawing solutions. BIM also enables users to create sustainable or “green”
building designs through analysis of materials, quantities, energy use, and lighting in a virtual BIM. The division’s principal product offerings include:

Autodesk Architectural Desktop

Designed for architects and built on the AutoCAD platform, Autodesk
Architectural Desktop software supports existing 2D design practices while enabling users to gradually introduce increasingly powerful industry-specific features to save time and improve coordination. It offers flexibility in implementation, the
efficiency of real-world building objects and AutoCAD-based design and documentation productivity for architects.

Autodesk Revit Family
of Products

Purpose-built for BIM, the Autodesk Revit Family of Products collects information about the building project and
coordinates this information across all other representations of the project so that every drawing sheet, 2D and 3D view and schedule is based on internally consistent and complete information from the same underlying building database. The Autodesk
Revit Family of Products provides architects, design-build teams and other building industry professionals a state-of-the-art architectural model-based design and documentation system that works the way they think.

Infrastructure Solutions Division

The Infrastructure
Solutions Division accounted for 13% of the Design Solutions Segment revenues in fiscal 2007. The division’s family of Civil Engineering and Geospatial Solutions and services enable utilities, governments and civil engineering firms to design,
build and manage their critical infrastructure assets more effectively. Autodesk Infrastructure Solutions help customers to streamline processes, ensure service continuity, enhance security, create accountability, and decrease risk by enabling

production cues as either dedicated suites or as networked production environments.

Autodesk Smoke and Autodesk Fire

Autodesk Smoke and Autodesk Fire systems are our scalable line of interactive real-time non-linear editing and finishing systems that enable editors to
edit, conform and finish television commercials, broadcast programming, film trailers and feature films as well as other high value media content.



Autodesk Subscription Program and Autodesk Upgrade Program

In addition to sales of new software licenses, we offer our customers two ways to migrate to the most recent version of our products: the Autodesk
Subscription Program and the Autodesk Upgrade Program. These programs are available for a majority of our products.

Autodesk
Subscription Program (Maintenance Services)

Under the Autodesk Subscription Program, customers who own a perpetual use license for the
most recent version of the underlying product are able to purchase a subscription that provides them with unspecified upgrades when-and-if-available, download e-Learning courses and obtain optional on-line support over a one year or multi-year
subscription period. Revenues from our Subscription Program are reported separately on our Consolidated Statements of Income and are referred to throughout this document as maintenance revenue.

Autodesk Upgrade Program

The
Autodesk Upgrade Program allows customers to purchase upgrades, but only to the extent that they are still on a supported version of the product. Typically, the cost to upgrade is based on a multiple of the number of versions the customer is
upgrading. An existing customer also has the option to upgrade to a different, more recent discipline-specific or 3D product, which generally has a higher price, for a premium fee; we refer to this as a crossgrade. The cost of a crossgrade is
substantially less than the cost of purchasing a new seat and is available to subscription customers as well. Revenues from our upgrade and crossgrade programs are reported on our Consolidated Statements of Income in License and other.

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND INTRODUCTION

We continue
to enhance our product offerings and develop new products to meet changing customer demands. Research and development expenditures were $406.3 million or 22% of fiscal 2007 net revenues, $303.2 million or 20% of fiscal 2006 net revenues and $241.5
million or 19% of fiscal 2005 net revenues. Our software is primarily developed internally; however, we do contract services from software development firms, consultants and independent contractors to supplement our development efforts.
Additionally, we acquire products or technology developed by others by purchasing some or all of the assets or stock of the entity that owns rights to the technology.

For example, in April 2006, we acquired a 28% ownership in Hanna Strategies Holdings, Inc. (“Hanna Strategies”), a privately-held software development firm with operations in the U.S. and China. Hanna
Strategies has been one of our software developers since fiscal 2003. Our relationship with Hanna Strategies is intended to provide more efficient resources for the development of new products and the maintenance and enhancement of existing product
offerings, among other things. As of January 31, 2007, Hanna Strategies employed approximately 1,100 software developers primarily in China. Expenditures attributable to development work contracted from Hanna Strategies represented 8%, 9% and
6% of our total research and development expenses for fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

The majority of our basic research
and product development is performed in the U.S. and Canada, and to a growing extent in China. Our China Application Development Center develops products for the worldwide market as well as products to specifically address the Chinese market.
Translation and localization of foreign-market versions, as well as some product development, is performed by development teams or contractors in other local markets, particularly in our Singapore and Switzerland offices. We generally translate and
localize our products into French, Italian, German, Spanish, Japanese and various Chinese dialects. We plan to increase our product development operations internationally over the next several years. We believe that our ability to conduct research
and development at various locations throughout the world allows us to optimize product development and lower costs. However, international development, whether conducted by us or independent



developers on our behalf, involves significant costs and challenges, including whether we can adequately protect our intellectual property and derive
significant revenue in areas such as emerging economies where software piracy is a substantial problem.

The technology industry is
characterized by rapid technological change in computer hardware, operating systems and software, as well as changes in customer requirements and preferences. To keep pace with these changes, we maintain an aggressive program of new product
development to address demands in the marketplace for our products. We dedicate considerable technical and financial resources to research and development to further enhance our existing products and to create new products and technologies. However,
these investments may not result in sufficient revenue generation to justify their costs or our competitors may introduce new products and services that achieve acceptance among our current customers, either of which would likely adversely affect
our competitive position.

Our software products are complex and, despite extensive testing and quality control, may contain errors or
defects. These defects or errors could result in corrective releases to our software products, damage to our reputation, loss of revenues, an increase in product returns or lack of market acceptance of our products, any of which would likely harm
our business.

We actively recruit and hire experienced software developers and license and acquire complementary software technologies and
businesses. In addition, we actively collaborate with and support third-party software developers who offer products that enhance and complement our products.

Independent firms and contractors perform some of our product development activities. Because talented development personnel are in high demand, these independent firms and contractors may not be able to provide
development support to us in the future. In addition, we license some technology from third parties. Use of this licensed technology may be restricted in ways that negatively affect our business in the future. We may not be able to obtain and renew
existing license agreements on favorable terms, if at all, and any failure to do so would likely harm our business.

In addition, our
business strategy has historically depended in part on our relationships with a network of third-party developers who develop their own products that expand the functionality of our software. Some third-party developers may elect to support other
products or may experience disruption in product development and delivery cycles or financial pressure during periods of economic downturn. These disruptions could negatively impact these third-party developers and, in turn, end users, which could
harm our business.

MARKETING AND SALES

We sell our products and services in over 160 countries primarily through an indirect channel consisting of distributors and resellers. To a lesser extent we also sell directly to customers who are primarily large corporations. Our
indirect channel model includes both a two-tiered distribution structure where distributors sell to resellers and a one-tiered structure where Autodesk sells directly to resellers. We have a network of approximately 1,700 resellers and
distributors worldwide. In addition, over 2,900 developers in the Autodesk Developer Network create interoperable products that further enhance the range of integrated solutions available to our customers. For fiscal 2007, approximately 85% of
our revenues were derived from indirect channel sales through distributors and resellers and we expect that the majority of our revenues will continue to be derived from indirect channel sales in the future. One distributor, Tech Data Corporation
and its affiliates, accounted for 12%, 11% and 12% of our net revenues for fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Our customer-related
operations are divided into three geographic regions, the Americas, Europe/Middle East/Africa (EMEA) and Asia/Pacific, and are supported by global marketing and sales organizations. These organizations develop and manage overall marketing and sales
programs and work closely with a network of domestic and international sales offices.



We also work directly with reseller and distributor sales organizations, computer manufacturers, other
software developers and peripheral manufacturers in cooperative advertising, promotions and trade-show presentations. We employ mass-marketing techniques such as web casts, seminars, telemarketing, direct mailings and advertising in business and
trade journals. We have a worldwide user group organization and we have created on-line user communities dedicated to the exchange of information related to the use of our products.

Our ability to effectively distribute our products depends in part upon the financial and business condition of our distributor and reseller networks.
Computer software resellers and distributors are typically not highly capitalized and have previously experienced difficulties during times of economic contraction and may do so in the future. While we have processes to ensure that we assess the
creditworthiness of dealers and distributors prior to selling to them, if their financial condition were to deteriorate they might not be able to make repeat purchases. The loss of, or a significant reduction in, business with any one of our major
international distributors or large resellers could harm our business. Our reliance on distributors and resellers subjects us to other risks; see Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” for further discussion.

We intend to continue to make our products available in foreign languages. We believe that international sales will continue to comprise a significant
portion of our net revenues. Economic weakness in any of the countries where we generate a significant portion of our net revenues could have an adverse effect on our business in those countries. A summary of our financial information by geographic
location is found in Note 13, “Segments” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

CUSTOMER AND RESELLER SUPPORT

We provide technical support and training to customers through a leveraged support model, augmented by programs designed to address certain specific needs
directly. End users rely primarily on their resellers and distributors for technical support; however, we do provide certain direct support for our high-end Media and Entertainment Segment hardware systems. We support the resellers and distributors
through technical product training, sales training classes, the Internet and direct telephone support. We also provide optional online support directly to end users through our Subscription Program and support content is also available on the
Product Support portion of our Internet site. There are also a number of user group forums in which customers are able to share information.

EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS

We offer education programs and specially priced software purchasing options tailored for educational
institutions, students, and faculty to train the next generation of users. We also offer classroom support, including standardized curricula developed by educators, instructor development, and a rich assortment of online learning resources. Users
trained on Autodesk products are broadly available both from universities and the existing workforce, reducing the cost of training for our customers.

DEVELOPER PROGRAMS

One of our key strategies is to maintain an open-architecture design of our software products to
facilitate third-party development of complementary products and industry-specific software solutions. This approach enables customers and third parties to customize our products for a wide variety of highly specific uses. We offer several programs
that provide marketing, sales, technical support and programming tools to developers who develop add-on applications for our products.

BACKLOG

We typically ship products shortly after receipt of an order, which is common in the software industry. Our aggregate backlog is
primarily comprised of deferred revenue. Deferred revenue consists primarily of deferred



maintenance revenue from our Subscription Program. To a lesser extent, deferred revenue consists of deferred license and other revenue derived from Autodesk
Buzzsaw services, consulting services and deferred license sales. Backlog also includes current software license product orders which have not yet shipped. The category of current software license product orders which we have not yet shipped
consists of orders from customers with approved credit status for currently available license software products and may include both orders with current ship dates and orders with ship dates beyond the current fiscal period. Aggregate backlog was
$395.8 million at January 31, 2007, of which $378.8 million was deferred revenue and $17.0 million related to current software license product orders which had not yet shipped at the end of the fiscal year. Aggregate backlog was $283.5 million
at January 31, 2006, of which $266.5 million was deferred revenue and $17.0 million related to current software license product orders which had not yet shipped. Deferred revenue increased over the prior year primarily due to an increase in
deferred maintenance revenue resulting from the success of our Subscription Program, and we expect the increase in deferred maintenance revenue to continue to increase in the future. We do not believe that aggregate backlog as of any particular date
is necessarily indicative of future results.

COMPETITION

The markets for our products are highly competitive and subject to rapid change. In addition, in each of our markets, we compete with numerous regional and specialized software and services companies.

Our Design Solutions Segment competes with vendors that specialize primarily in one of the three industry segments in which we compete. Our competitors
range from large, global, publicly traded software companies to small, geographically focused firms. Our primary global competitors in this segment include Adobe Systems Inc., Dassault Systemes and its subsidiary SolidWorks Corporation, Google Inc.,
Environmental Systems Research Institute, Inc. (ESRI), Intergraph Corporation, Nemetschek AG, Parametric Technology Corporation, and UGS PLM Software, a global division of the Siemens AG, and Bentley Systems, Inc.

Our Media and Entertainment Segment competes with a wide range of different companies from large publicly-traded corporations to small private entities.
Large organizations that produce products that compete in some or all of our markets include Avid Technology, Adobe Systems Inc., Apple Computer Inc., SONY and Thomson. The media and entertainment market is highly fragmented with complex
interdependencies between many of the larger corporations. As a result, some of our competitors also own subsidiaries that are our clients or our partners in developing or bringing to market some of our solutions.

The software industry has limited barriers to entry, and the availability of desktop computers with continually expanding performance capacity at
progressively lower prices contributes to the ease of market entry. The design software market is characterized by vigorous competition in each of the vertical markets in which we compete, both by entry of competitors with innovative technologies
and by consolidation of companies with complementary products and technologies.

Because of these and other factors, competitive conditions
in these industries are likely to continue to intensify in the future. Increased competition could result in price reductions, reduced net revenues and profit margins and loss of market share, any of which could harm our business. Furthermore, in
certain markets, some of our competitors have greater financial, technical, sales and marketing and other resources.

We believe that our
future results depend largely upon our ability to offer new products and to continue to provide existing product offerings that compete favorably with respect to ease of use, reliability, performance, range of useful features, continuing product
enhancements, reputation, price and training.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND LICENSES

We protect our intellectual property through a combination of patents, copyright and trademark laws, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures and
contractual provisions. Nonetheless, our intellectual property rights may



not be successfully asserted in the future or may be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. In addition, the laws of various foreign countries where our
products are distributed do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as U.S. laws. Enforcement of intellectual property rights against alleged infringers can sometimes lead to costly litigation and counterclaims. Our inability
to protect our proprietary information could harm our business.

From time to time, we receive claims alleging infringement of a third
party’s intellectual property rights, including patents. Disputes involving our intellectual property rights or those of another party have in the past and may in the future lead to, among other things, costly litigation or product shipment
delays, which could harm our business.

We retain ownership of software we develop. All software is licensed to users and provided in
object code pursuant to either shrink-wrap, embedded or on-line licenses, or signed license agreements. These agreements contain restrictions on duplication, disclosure and transfer.

We believe that because of the limitations of laws protecting our intellectual property and the rapid, ongoing technological changes in both the computer
hardware and software industries, we must rely principally upon software engineering and marketing skills to maintain and enhance our competitive market position.

While we have recovered some revenues resulting from the unauthorized use of our software products, we are unable to measure the full extent to which piracy of our software products exists. We believe, however, that
software piracy is and can be expected to be a persistent problem.

PRODUCTION AND SUPPLIERS

Production of our Design Solutions Segment and certain Media and Entertainment Segment software products involves duplication of the software media and
the printing of user manuals. The purchase of media and the transfer of the software programs onto media for distribution to customers are performed by us and by licensed subcontractors. Media for our products include CD-ROMs which are available
from multiple sources. User manuals for our products and packaging materials are produced to our specifications by outside sources. Production is either performed in leased facilities operated by us or by independent third-party contractors. To
date, we have not experienced any material difficulties or delays in the production of our software and documentation.

In addition, the
Advanced Systems business line has historically relied on third-party vendors for the supply of hardware components used in its systems. In the past, many of the Advanced Systems software products ran on workstations manufactured by Silicon
Graphics, Inc. (“SGI”). During fiscal 2007, the majority of our Advanced Systems product revenues migrated to standard, open, PC-based Linux platforms and away from the SGI platform. We still generate some revenues from SGI hardware
platforms and there is a risk that we may not be able to migrate all customer orders to Linux based systems. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” for further discussion of this risk.

EMPLOYEES

As of January 31, 2007, we employed
5,169 people. None of our employees in the United States are represented by a labor union; however, in certain foreign countries, our employees are represented by work councils. We have never experienced any work stoppages and believe our employee
relations are good. Reliance upon employees in other countries entails various risks that possible government instability or regulation unfavorable to foreign-owned businesses could negatively impact our business in the future.

Competition in recruiting personnel in the software industry, especially highly skilled engineers, is intense. We believe our continued growth and future
success is highly dependent on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled employees.



BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

Over the past three years, we acquired new technology or supplemented our technology by purchasing businesses focused in specific markets or industries. During this time period, we acquired the following businesses:



For additional information on certain of the acquired businesses described above, see Note 15,
“Business Combinations” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

We operate in a rapidly changing
environment that involves a number of risks, many of which are beyond our control. The following discussion highlights some of these risks and the possible impact of these factors on future results of operations. If any of the following risks
actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted, causing the trading price of our common stock to decline.

As a result of our voluntary review of stock option practices and related restatements, the SEC has initiated an informal investigation. This investigation may not be resolved favorably and has required and may
continue to require a significant amount of management time and attention and accounting and legal resources, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and cash flows.

We are currently being investigated by the SEC in connection with our historical stock option practices and related accounting. The period of time
necessary to resolve the informal SEC investigation is uncertain, and this matter could require significant management and financial resources which could otherwise be devoted to the operation of our business. In addition, considerable legal, tax
and accounting expenses related to this matter have been incurred to date and significant expenditures may continue to be incurred in the future. We cannot predict the outcome of the SEC investigation. If we or any of our current or former officers
or directors is subject to an adverse finding resulting from the SEC investigation, we could be required to pay damages or penalties or have other remedies imposed upon us which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial
position, cash flows and the trading price of our securities. In addition, if the informal investigation continues for a prolonged period of time, this could have the same effects, regardless of the outcome of the investigation.

We have been named as a party in lawsuits related to our historical stock option practices and related accounting, and we may be named in additional
litigation in the future, all of which could result in an unfavorable outcome and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price for our securities.

At least three lawsuits have been filed against us and our current directors and officers and certain of our former directors and officers relating to our
historical stock option practices and related accounting. See Item 3, “Legal Proceedings” for a more detailed description of these proceedings. These actions are in the preliminary stages, and the ultimate outcomes could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price for our securities. We may become the subject of additional private or government actions regarding these matters in the future,
including shareholder or employee litigation. Litigation may be time-consuming, expensive and disruptive to normal business operations, and the outcome of litigation is difficult to predict. The defense of these lawsuits will result in significant
expenditures and the continued diversion of our management’s time and attention from the operation of our business, which could impede our business. All or a portion of any amount we may be required to pay to satisfy a judgment or settlement of
any or all of these claims may not be covered by insurance.

If we do not maintain compliance with the listing requirements of the
NASDAQ Global Select Market, our common stock could be delisted, which could, among other things, reduce the price of our common stock and the levels of liquidity available to our stockholders.

In connection with the voluntary review and the restatement of our financial statements, we were delinquent in filing certain of our periodic filings with
the SEC, and consequently we were not in compliance with the listing requirements under the NASDAQ Global Select Market’s Marketplace Rules. As a result, we underwent an extensive review and hearing process with the NASDAQ Global Select Market
to determine our listing status. The NASDAQ Global Select Market ultimately permitted our securities to remain listed; however, our securities could be delisted in the future if we do not maintain compliance with applicable listing requirements. If
our securities are delisted from the NASDAQ Global Select Market, they would subsequently be transferred to the National Quotation Service Bureau, or “Pink Sheets.” The trading of our common stock on the Pink Sheets may



reduce the price of our common stock and the levels of liquidity available to our stockholders. In addition, the trading of our common stock on the Pink
Sheets would materially adversely affect our access to the capital markets and our ability to raise capital through alternative financing sources on terms acceptable to us or at all. Securities that trade on the Pink Sheets are no longer eligible
for margin loans, and a company trading on the Pink Sheets cannot avail itself of Federal preemption of state securities or “blue sky” laws, which adds substantial compliance costs to securities issuances, including pursuant to employee
option plans, stock purchase plans and private or public offerings of securities. If we are delisted in the future from the NASDAQ Global Select Market and transferred to the Pink Sheets, there may also be other negative implications, including the
potential loss of confidence by suppliers, customers and employees and the loss of institutional investor interest in our company.

Because we derive a substantial portion of our net revenues from AutoCAD-based software products, if these products are not successful, our net revenues will be adversely affected.

We derive a substantial portion of our net revenues from sales of AutoCAD software, including products based on AutoCAD that serve specific vertical
markets, upgrades to those products and products that are interoperable with AutoCAD. As such, any factor adversely affecting sales of these products, including the product release cycle, market acceptance, product competition, performance and
reliability, reputation, price competition, economic and market conditions and the availability of third-party applications, would likely harm our operating results.

Changes in existing financial accounting standards or practices, or taxation rules or practices may adversely affect our results of operations.

Changes in existing accounting or taxation rules or practices, new accounting pronouncements or taxation rules, or varying interpretations of current
accounting pronouncements or taxation practice could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations or the manner in which we conduct our business. Further, such changes could potentially affect our reporting of transactions
completed before such changes are effective. In particular, for fiscal 2007, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R (“SFAS 123R”) which requires us to record stock-based compensation charges to earnings for
employee stock option grants using a fair-value-based method for determining such charges. We believe that the adoption of SFAS 123R will continue to materially adversely impact our earnings and may impact the manner in which we conduct our
business.

Our international operations expose us to significant regulatory, intellectual property, collections, exchange fluctuations,
taxation and other risks, which could adversely impact our future net revenues and increase our net expenses.

We anticipate that
international operations will continue to account for a significant portion of our net revenues and will provide significant support to our overall development efforts. Risks inherent in our international operations include the following: the impact
of fluctuating exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies in markets where we do business, unexpected changes in regulatory practices and tariffs, difficulties in staffing and managing foreign sales and development operations,
longer collection cycles for accounts receivable, potential changes in tax laws, tax arrangements with foreign governments and laws regarding the management of data, possible future limitations upon foreign owned businesses, and greater difficulty
in protecting intellectual property.

Our international results will also continue to be impacted by economic and political conditions in
foreign markets generally and in specific large foreign markets, especially by changes in foreign exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies. These factors may adversely impact our future international operations and consequently
our business as a whole.

Our risk management strategy uses derivative financial instruments, in the form of foreign currency forward and
option contracts, for the purpose of hedging foreign currency market exposures during each quarter which



exist as a part of our ongoing business operations. These instruments provide us some protection against currency exposures for only the current quarter.
Significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currency markets may adversely impact our future net revenues.

While we believe we currently have adequate internal control over financial reporting, we are required to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and any adverse
results from such evaluation could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price.

Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Section 404”), we are required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting. The report contains,
among other matters, an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year, including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective. This
assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management. The report must also contain a statement that our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an
attestation report on management’s assessment of such internal controls.

While we have determined in our Management Report on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 31, 2007, we must continue to monitor and assess our internal control over
financial reporting. If our management identifies one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and such weakness remains uncorrected at fiscal year end, we will be unable to assert such internal control is
effective at fiscal year end. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective at fiscal year end (or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to attest that our management’s
report is fairly stated or they are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls), we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which would likely have an adverse effect
on our business and stock price.

As a result of the voluntary review of Autodesk’s historical stock option grant practices, our
management identified a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting in periods ending prior to March 2005. For the period between July 2000 and February 2005, Autodesk generally followed an administrative process for monthly
broad based employee grants that resulted in the selection of effective grant dates that were prior in time to the final preparation of action by written consent for such grants. Since March 2005, we have implemented a number of changes that will
resolve past measurement date errors and deter them from happening in the future.

We may face intellectual property infringement claims
that could be costly to defend and result in our loss of significant rights.

As more and more software patents are granted worldwide,
as the number of products and competitors in our industry segments grows and as the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps, we expect that software product developers will be increasingly subject to infringement claims.
Infringement or misappropriation claims have in the past been, and may in the future be, asserted against us, and any such assertions could harm our business. Additionally, certain patent holders without products, like z4 Technologies, have become
more aggressive in threatening and pursuing litigation in attempts to obtain fees for licensing the right to use patents. Any such claims or threats, whether with or without merit, have been and could in the future be time-consuming to defend,
result in costly litigation and diversion of resources, or could cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. In addition, such royalty or license agreements, if required, may not be available on
acceptable terms, if at all, which would likely harm our business.



Our business could suffer as a result of risks associated with strategic acquisitions and investments
such as the acquisitions of Alias and Constructware and investment in Hanna Strategies.

We periodically acquire or invest in
businesses, software products and technologies that are complementary to our business through strategic alliances, equity investments or acquisitions. For example, we recently completed the acquisitions of Alias Systems Holdings, Inc. and
Constructware and acquired a 28% ownership in Hanna Strategies. The risks associated with such acquisitions include, among others, the difficulty of assimilating the products, operations and personnel of the companies, the failure to realize
anticipated revenue and cost projections, the requirement to test and assimilate the internal control processes of the acquired business in accordance with the requirements of Section 404, and the diversion of management’s time and
attention. In addition, such investments and acquisitions may involve significant transaction or integration-related costs. We may not be successful in overcoming such risks, and such investments and acquisitions may negatively impact our business.
In addition, such investments and acquisitions have in the past and may in the future contribute to potential fluctuations in quarterly results of operations. The fluctuations could arise from transaction-related costs and charges associated with
eliminating redundant expenses or write-offs of impaired assets recorded in connection with acquisitions and investments. These costs or charges, including those relating to the Alias or Constructware acquisitions or investment in Hanna Strategies,
could negatively impact results of operations for a given period or cause quarter to quarter variability in our operating results.

If
Silicon Graphics, Inc. (SGI), which recently emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, fails to deliver products, provide product upgrades or provide product support, the business relating to our Advanced Systems products of our Media and
Entertainment Segment will be adversely affected.

In the Media and Entertainment Segment, our customers’ buying patterns are
heavily influenced by advertising and entertainment industry cycles, which have resulted in and could have a negative impact on our operating results. In addition, a reducing but significant percentage of the Media and Entertainment Segment’s
Advanced Systems products rely primarily on workstations manufactured by SGI. On May 8, 2006, SGI announced that it has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in U.S. Bankruptcy Court, and on October 17, 2006 SGI emerged from Chapter
11 bankruptcy protection. In addition, SGI has changed its management team and is refocusing its business. Significantly, SGI has recently announced its intention to cease development of new products for the media and entertainment industry.
Although we have reduced our dependence on SGI workstations for the Advanced Systems products and will continue to do so in the future, the near term failure of SGI to deliver products, product upgrades or product support in a timely manner would
likely result in an adverse effect upon our financial results for a given period.

Although we offer a range of Media and Entertainment
Segment products for use on standard, open, PC-based Linux platforms, our customers may not choose to adopt our products using these alternative platforms, or may delay purchases while evaluating the new platforms, which could have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations in a given period.

Our operating results fluctuate within each quarter and from quarter to
quarter making our future revenues and operating results difficult to predict.

Our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the
past and may do so in the future. These fluctuations could cause our stock price to change significantly or experience declines. Some of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include the timing of the introduction of new
products by us or our competitors, slowing of momentum in upgrade or maintenance revenue, the adoption of SFAS 123R, which required us to record compensation expense for shares issued under our stock plans beginning in the first quarter of fiscal
2007 with a negative impact on our results of operations, continued fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates, failure to achieve anticipated levels of customer acceptance of key new applications, unexpected costs or changes in marketing or
other operating expenses, changes in product pricing or product mix, platform changes, failure to convert our 2D customer base to 3D products, delays in product releases, timing of product releases and retirements, failure to continue momentum of
annual release cycles or to move a significant number of customers



from prior product versions in connection with our programs to retire major products, unexpected outcomes of matters relating to litigation, failure to
achieve continued cost reductions and productivity increases, unanticipated changes in tax rates and tax laws, distribution channel management, changes in sales compensation practices, the timing of large systems sales, failure to effectively
implement our copyright legalization programs, especially in developing countries, failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies, failure to achieve sufficient sell-through in our channels for new or existing products, the
financial and business condition of our reseller and distribution channels, renegotiation or termination of royalty or intellectual property arrangements, interruptions or terminations in the business of our consultants or third party developers,
failure to grow lifecycle management or collaboration products, unanticipated impact of accounting for technology acquisitions and general economic conditions, particularly in countries where we derive a significant portion of our net revenues.

We have also experienced fluctuations in operating results in interim periods in certain geographic regions due to seasonality or regional
economic conditions. In particular, our operating results in Europe during the third quarter are usually affected by a slow summer period, and the Asia/Pacific operations typically experience seasonal slowing in the third and fourth quarters.

Our operating expenses are based in part on our expectations for future revenues and are relatively fixed in the short term. Accordingly,
any revenue shortfall below expectations could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on our profitability. Failure to maintain rigorous cost controls would negatively affect future profitability. Further, gross margins may be adversely
affected if our sales of AutoCAD LT, upgrades and advanced systems products, which historically have had lower margins, grow at a faster rate than sales of our higher-margin products.

Existing and increased competition may reduce our net revenues and profits.

The software industry has limited barriers to entry, and the availability of desktop computers with continually expanding performance at progressively
lower prices contributes to the ease of market entry. The markets in which we compete are characterized by vigorous competition, both by entry of competitors with innovative technologies and by consolidation of companies with complementary products
and technologies. In addition, some of our competitors in certain markets have greater financial, technical, sales and marketing and other resources. Furthermore, a reduction in the number and availability of compatible third-party applications may
adversely affect the sale of our products. Because of these and other factors, competitive conditions in the industry are likely to intensify in the future. Increased competition could result in continued price reductions, reduced net revenues and
profit margins and loss of market share, any of which would likely harm our business.

We believe that our future results depend largely
upon our ability to offer products that compete favorably with respect to reliability, performance, ease of use, range of useful features, continuing product enhancements, reputation and price.

Net revenues or earnings shortfalls or the volatility of the market generally may cause the market price of our stock to decline.

The market price for our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations and may continue to fluctuate significantly. The market price for our
common stock may be affected by a number of factors, including the following: net revenues or earnings shortfalls, unexpected deviations in results of key performance metrics, and changes in estimates or recommendations by securities analysts; the
announcement of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors; quarterly variations in our or our competitors’ results of operations; developments in our industry; unusual events such as significant acquisitions, divestitures
and litigation; and general market conditions and other factors, including factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors.



Historically, after periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities, a company
becomes more susceptible to securities class action litigation. This type of litigation is often expensive and diverts management’s attention and resources.

Our efforts to develop and introduce new products and service offerings expose us to risks such as limited customer acceptance, costs related to product defects and large expenditures that may not result in
additional net revenues.

Rapid technological changes, as well as changes in customer requirements and preferences, characterize the
software industry. We are devoting significant resources to the development of technologies, like our lifecycle management initiatives, and service offerings to address demands in the marketplace for increased connectivity and use of digital data
created by computer-aided design software. As a result, we are introducing new business models, requiring a considerable investment of technical and financial resources. Such investments may not result in sufficient revenue generation to justify
their costs, or competitors may introduce new products and services that achieve acceptance among our current customers, adversely affecting our competitive position. In particular, a critical component of our growth strategy is to convert our 2D
customer base, including customers of AutoCAD, AutoCAD LT, and related vertical industry products, to our 3D products such as Autodesk Inventor Family of Products or Autodesk Revit Family of Products. Should sales of AutoCAD, AutoCAD upgrades and
AutoCAD LT products decrease without a corresponding conversion of customer seats to 3D products, our results of operations will be adversely affected.

Product development may also be outsourced to third parties or developed externally and transferred to us through business or technology acquisitions. Such externally developed technologies have certain additional
risks, including potential difficulties with effective integration into existing products, adequate transfer of technology know-how and ownership and protection of transferred intellectual property. For example, in April 2006, we acquired a 28%
ownership in Hanna Strategies, a privately-held software development firm that has been one of our software developers since 2003. Expenditures attributable to development work contracted from Hanna Strategies represented 8%, 9% and 6% of our total
research and development expenses for fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Additionally, the software products we offer are
complex, and despite extensive testing and quality control, may contain errors or defects. These defects or errors could result in the need for corrective releases to our software products, damage to our reputation, loss of revenues, an increase in
product returns or lack of market acceptance of our products, any of which would likely harm our business.

We rely on third party
technologies and if we are unable to use or integrate these technologies, our product and service development may be delayed.

We rely
on certain software that we license from third parties, including software that is integrated with internally developed software and used in our products to perform key functions. These third-party software licenses may not continue to be available
on commercially reasonable terms, and the software may not be appropriately supported, maintained or enhanced by the licensors. The loss of licenses to, or inability to support, maintain and enhance any such software could result in increased costs,
or in delays or reductions in product shipments until equivalent software could be developed, identified, licensed and integrated, which would likely harm our business.

We are investing resources in updating and improving our internal information technology systems. Should our investments not succeed, or if delays or other issues with a new internal technology system disrupt our
operations, our business would be harmed.

We rely on our network infrastructure, internal technology systems and our websites for our
development, marketing, operational, support and sales activities. We are continually investing resources to update and



improve these systems in order to meet the growing requirements of our business and customers. Unsuccessful implementation of hardware or software updates
and improvements could result in disruption in our business operations, loss of revenues or damage to our reputation.

Disruptions with
licensing relationships and third party developers could adversely impact our business.

We license certain key technologies from third
parties. Licenses may be restricted in the term or the use of such technology in ways that negatively affect our business. Similarly, we may not be able to obtain or renew license agreements for key technology on favorable terms, if at all, and any
failure to do so could harm our business.

Our business strategy has historically depended in part on our relationships with third-party
developers who provide products that expand the functionality of our design software. Some developers may elect to support other products or may experience disruption in product development and delivery cycles or financial pressure during periods of
economic downturn. In particular markets, this disruption would likely negatively impact these third-party developers and end users, which could harm our business.

As a result of our strategy of partnering with other companies for product development, our product delivery schedules could be adversely affected if we experience difficulties with our product development
partners.

We partner with certain independent firms and contractors to perform some of our product development activities. We believe
our partnering strategy allows us to, among other things, achieve efficiencies in developing new products and maintaining and enhancing existing product offerings. In addition, we have acquired an investment interest in one developer, Hanna
Strategies. We have historically and plan to continue to contract with Hanna Strategies in order to provide more efficient resources for the development of new products and features in existing products.

However, our partnering strategy creates a dependency on such independent developers. Independent developers, including those who currently develop
products for us in the United States and throughout the world, may not be able or willing to provide development support to us in the future. In addition, use of development resources through consulting relationships, particularly in non-US
jurisdictions with developing legal systems, may be adversely impacted by, and expose us to risks relating to, evolving employment, export and intellectual property laws. These risks could, among other things, expose our intellectual property to
misappropriation and result in disruptions to product delivery schedules.

General economic conditions may affect our net revenues and
harm our business.

As our business has grown, we have become increasingly subject to the risks arising from adverse changes in domestic
and global economic and political conditions. If economic growth in the United States and other countries’ economies is slowed, many customers may delay or reduce technology purchases. This could result in reductions in sales of our products,
longer sales cycles, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition. In addition, weakness in the end-user market could negatively affect the cash flow of our distributors and resellers who could, in turn, delay paying their
obligations to us, which would increase our credit risk exposure and cause delays in our recognition of revenues on future sales to these customers. Any of these events would likely harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.

If we do not maintain our relationships with the members of our distribution channel, or achieve anticipated levels of sell-through,
our ability to generate net revenues will be adversely affected.

We sell our software products both directly to customers and through a
network of distributors and resellers. Our ability to effectively distribute our products depends in part upon the financial and business condition of our reseller network. Computer software dealers and distributors are typically not highly
capitalized and have



previously experienced difficulties during times of economic contraction and may do so in the future. While we have processes to ensure that we assess the
creditworthiness of dealers and distributors prior to our sales to them, if their financial condition were to deteriorate, they might not be able to make repeat purchases. We rely significantly upon major distributors and resellers in both the U.S.
and international regions, including Tech Data Corporation and their affiliates, who accounted for 12% of fiscal 2007 net revenues and 11% of fiscal 2006 net revenues. The loss of or a significant reduction in business with those distributors or
resellers or the failure to achieve anticipated levels of sell-through with any one of our major international distributors or large resellers could harm our business. In particular, if one or more of such resellers were unable to meet their
obligations with respect to accounts payable to us, we could be forced to write off such accounts and may be required to delay the recognition of revenues on future sales to these customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our results
of operations in a given period.

Product returns could exceed our estimates and harm our net revenues.

We permit our distributors and resellers to return 2% to 20% of prior quarter purchases and to return a product when new product releases supersede older
versions. Consistent with our experience in fiscal 2007, we anticipate that product returns will continue to be driven by product update cycles, new product releases and software quality.

We establish reserves for stock balancing and product rotation. These reserves are based on historical experience, estimated channel inventory levels and
the timing of new product introductions and other factors. While we maintain strict measures to monitor these reserves, actual product returns may exceed our reserve estimates, and such differences could harm our business.

If we are not able to adequately protect our proprietary rights, our business could be harmed.

We rely on a combination of patents, copyright and trademark laws, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our
proprietary rights. Despite such efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties from time to time have copied aspects of our software products or have obtained and used information that we regard as proprietary. Policing
unauthorized use of our software products is time-consuming and costly. While we have recovered some revenues resulting from the unauthorized use of our software products, we are unable to measure the extent to which piracy of our software products
exists, and software piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem. Furthermore, our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate, and our competitors may independently develop similar technology.

ITEM 1B.

UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

We have received no
written comments regarding our periodic or current reports from the staff of the SEC that were issued 180 days or more preceding the end of our 2007 fiscal year that remain unresolved.

ITEM 2.

PROPERTIES

We lease 1,625,000 square feet of
office space in 97 locations in the United States and internationally through our foreign subsidiaries. Our executive offices and corporate headquarters are located in leased office space in San Rafael, California. Our San Rafael facilities consist
of 304,000 square feet under leases that have expiration dates ranging from October 2007 to February 2012. We and our foreign subsidiaries lease additional space in various locations throughout the world for local sales, product development and
technical support personnel.

All facilities are in good condition and are operating at capacities averaging 79% occupancy worldwide. We
believe that our existing facilities and offices are adequate to meet our requirements for the foreseeable future. See Note 8, “Commitments and Contingencies,” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information
about our lease commitments.



ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

On December 27, 2001,
Spatial Corp. (“Spatial”) filed suit in Marin County Superior Court against Autodesk and one of our consultants, D-Cubed Ltd., seeking among other things, termination of a development and license agreement between Spatial and Autodesk and
an injunction preventing Autodesk from working with contractors under the agreement. On October 2, 2003, a jury found that Autodesk did not breach the agreement. As the prevailing party in the action, the court awarded Autodesk approximately
$2.4 million for reimbursement of attorneys’ fees and the costs of trial, which was paid during the second quarter of fiscal 2005. Spatial filed a notice of appeal on December 2, 2003 appealing the decision of the jury. Spatial claims that
certain testimony of a witness should not have been considered by the jury and as a result, Spatial asserts that it is entitled to a new trial. On March 23, 2006, the Court of Appeal denied Spatial’s appeal. The trial court awarded
Autodesk approximately $0.2 million on April 1, 2006. As a result, the ultimate resolution of this matter did not have a material effect on Autodesk’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

On September 22, 2004, z4 Technologies, Inc. (“z4”) filed suit against Autodesk and Microsoft Corporation in the United States District
Court, Eastern District of Texas, alleging infringement of U.S. Patent No. 6,044,471 (“471 patent”), entitled “Method and Apparatus for Securing Software to Reduce Unauthorized Use,” and U.S. Patent No. 6,785,825
(“825 patent”), entitled “Method for Securing Software to Decrease Software Piracy.” z4’s complaint alleged that Autodesk infringed both patents by making, using, selling, and offering for sale the claimed matter of these
patents without the plaintiff’s authority. In its complaint, z4 sought compensatory damages amounting to a 1.5% royalty, injunctive relief and fees and costs. On April 19, 2006, a jury returned a verdict finding that certain Autodesk
products infringed both patents, awarding z4 $18 million in damages. In light of the jury’s verdict, we accrued the full amount of this verdict, which represented our best estimate of the probable loss, of which $16.8 million was expensed
during the first quarter of fiscal 2007. The court entered judgment against Autodesk on August 18, 2006, awarding z4 $18 million in damages, pre-judgment interest and attorneys’ fees. Autodesk filed our notice of appeal of the judgment on
September 8, 2006. On December 20, 2006, Autodesk and z4 entered into a settlement agreement which resolved all of the issues between the parties. The final resolution of the z4 litigation did not have a material effect on Autodesk’s
financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Following the guidance set forth in Statement on Auditing Standards No. 1 “Codification of Auditing Standards and Procedures” AU Section 560 “Subsequent Events,”
we reversed $13.0 million of previously accrued reserves during the second quarter of fiscal 2007.

On August 26, 2005, Telstra
Corporation Limited (“Telstra”) filed suit in the Federal Court of Australia, Victoria District Registry against Autodesk Australia Pty Ltd. (“AAPL”) seeking partial indemnification for claims filed against Telstra by SpatialInfo
Pty Limited relating to Telstra’s use of certain software in the management of its computer-based cable plant records system. On December 12, 2005, SpatialInfo added AAPL as a defendant to its lawsuit against Telstra. Autodesk is currently
investigating the allegations and intends to vigorously defend the case. Although this case is in the early stages and Autodesk cannot determine the final financial impact of this matter, based on the facts known at this time, we believe the
ultimate resolution of this matter will not have a material effect on Autodesk’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of this matter could occur and materially affect
our future results of operations, cash flows or financial position in a particular period.

On July 12, 2006 New York University
(“NYU”) filed suit against Autodesk in the United States District Court, Southern District of New York, alleging infringement of U.S. Patent No. 6,115,053 (“053 patent”), entitled “Computer Animation Method and System
for Synthesizing Human-Like Gestures and Actions,” and U.S. Patent No. 6,317,132 (“132 patent”), entitled “Computer Animation Method for Creating Computer Generated Animated Characters.” NYU’s complaint alleged
that Autodesk infringed both patents by making, using, selling, and offering for sale the claimed matter of these patents without the plaintiff’s authority. In its complaint, NYU seeks compensatory damages, injunctive relief and fees and costs.
Autodesk cannot determine the final financial impact of this matter, based on the facts known at this time, we believe the ultimate resolution of this matter will not have a material effect on Autodesk’s financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.



However, it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of this matter could occur and materially affect our future results of operations, cash flows or
financial position in a particular period.

In connection with our anti-piracy program, designed to enforce copyright protection of our
software and conducted both internally and through the Business Software Alliance (“BSA”), from time to time we undertake litigation against alleged copyright infringers or provide information to criminal justice authorities to conduct
actions against alleged copyright infringers. Such lawsuits have led to counter claims alleging improper use of litigation or violation of other local law and have recently increased in frequency, especially in Latin America. On March 1, 2002,
Consultores en Computación y Contabilidad, S.C., a Mexican hardware/software reseller and its principals (collectively, “CCC”) filed a lawsuit in the Mexico Court in the First Civil Court of the Federal District against Autodesk,
Adobe Systems, Microsoft and Symantec (all members of the BSA and collectively the “Defendants”). Ultimately, a court of appeals held that the Defendants were liable to CCC for “moral” damages, and the court remanded the case to
the First Civil Court for a determination of the amount. On December 13, 2005, the First Civil Court awarded CCC $90 million in damages. Both the Defendants and the plaintiffs appealed the verdict. In September 2006, the parties entered into a
settlement agreement which did not have a material effect on Autodesk’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, three shareholder derivative lawsuits were filed against us and our current directors and officers (as well as certain of our former directors and officers) relating to our historical stock option
practices and related accounting. On November 20, 2006, Autodesk and current members of our Board were sued in United States Federal District Court for the Northern District of California in a shareholder derivative action, entitled “Giles
v. Bartz, et al.”, Case No. C06-8175. On December 29, 2006, Autodesk, current members of our Board, and certain current and past executive officers were sued in United States Federal District Court for the Northern District of California
in a shareholder derivative action, entitled “Campion v. Sutton, et al.”, Case No. C06-07967. This lawsuit was consolidated into the previously mentioned Giles case and later voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiff on January 31, 2007.
On January 9, 2007, Autodesk, current members of our Board, and current and former executive officers were sued in the Superior Court for the State of California, County of Marin in a shareholder derivative action, entitled “Koerner v.
Bartz, et al.”, Case No. CV-070112. These actions are in the preliminary stages and we cannot determine the final financial impact of these matters based on the facts known at this time. However, it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of
the matters could occur and have a material effect on our future results of operations, cash flows or financial position in a particular period.

In addition, we are involved in legal proceedings from time to time arising from the normal course of business activities including claims of alleged infringement of intellectual property rights, commercial, employment, piracy prosecution
and other matters. In our opinion, resolution of pending matters is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or our financial position. However, it is possible that an unfavorable
resolution of one or more such proceedings could in the future materially affect our future results of operations, cash flows or financial position in a particular period.

PART II

ITEM 5.

MARKET FOR THE REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

Our common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol ADSK. The following table lists the high and low sales prices for each
quarter in the last two fiscal years.

Dividends

Adjusted for the stock split in December 2004, we paid quarterly dividends of $0.015 per share in fiscal 2005 to Autodesk stockholders. Effective after the dividend for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 (paid in April
2006) we discontinued our quarterly cash dividend.

Stockholders

As of January 31, 2007 the number of common stockholders of record was 673. Because many of our shares of common stock are held by brokers or other institutions on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to
estimate the total number of stockholders represented by the record holders.

Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

The purpose of Autodesk’s stock repurchase program is to help offset the dilution to net income per share caused by the issuance of stock under our
employee stock plans as well as to more effectively utilize excess cash generated from our business. The number of shares acquired and the timing of the purchases are based on several factors, including the level of our cash balances, general
business and market conditions, and other investment opportunities. At January 31, 2007, 16.3 million shares remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization. See Note 9, “Stockholders’ Equity,”
in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Autodesk was not current with its reporting obligations under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2007 and, as a result,
there were no repurchases of Autodesk common stock during those quarters.



ITEM 6.    SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

The consolidated balance sheet as of
January 31, 2006 and the consolidated statements of income for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2006 and January 31, 2005 have been restated as set forth in this Form 10-K. The data for the consolidated balance sheets as of

Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Results

Introduction

On August 17, 2006, Autodesk, Inc. (“Autodesk” or the
“Company”) announced that the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors was conducting a voluntary review of Autodesk’s historical stock option granting practices and related accounting issues. On February 27, 2007, Autodesk
announced the key results of the voluntary review, which were set forth in the Form 8-K filed on that date.

The Audit Committee
engaged independent outside legal counsel, Hogan & Hartson LLP, who, with the assistance of forensic accounting experts, PricewaterhouseCoopers, reviewed the facts and circumstances surrounding approximately 230 separate stock option grant
approvals made between January 1988 and August 2006, or the “relevant period.” During the course of the voluntary review, more than 700,000 documents were reviewed and interviews with over 40 current and former employees, directors and
advisors were conducted. In February 2007, the Audit Committee completed its review and presented its final report to Autodesk’s Board of Directors.

The following is a summary of the key findings of the Audit Committee:

•

Throughout the relevant period, numerous administrative errors were made in the processing of option grants resulting in options being accounted for incorrectly;

•

Between July 2000 and February 2005, the Company made monthly broad-based employee grants pursuant to authority delegated by the Board to the CEO, where the grant
dates for most of these broad based grants were selected by an administrative process to coincide with low trading prices during the month of the applicable grant;

•

During the calendar year 1992:

•

a broad-based employee grant that included a grant to the Company’s then-CFO and then-General Counsel were measured on an incorrect date; and

•

the new hire grant to the then-incoming CEO was measured on an incorrect date;

•

There was no evidence that any officer or director backdated any stock option granted to himself or herself;

•

Based on the evidence developed during the review, the Audit Committee concluded that it was unlikely that those involved in the decisions and actions that resulted
in measurement date errors understood the accounting impact of their actions or that they intended to misstate our financial statements; and



•

There was no evidence of any measurement date error involving any stock option grant made to a person serving as a director.

The Company had progressively, substantially and voluntarily improved its employee stock-based compensation grant process prior to 2006, before the
intense regulatory and media focus on stock option grant practices began, and no Company employees or officers who may have made discretionary determinations that resulted in measurement date errors in the past has any continuing role
relating to the distribution, administration or accounting for stock-based compensation.

As a result of the findings of the voluntary
review, the Board of Directors has concluded, upon the recommendation of management and the Audit Committee, that the consolidated balance sheets as of January 31, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006, and the related consolidated statements of
income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the fiscal years ended January 31, 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006, should no longer be relied upon. As a result, we are restating our previously-issued financial statements for fiscal
years 2003 through 2006, inclusive, to correct errors related to accounting for total stock-based compensation expense.

The pre-tax,
non-cash charges to be restated are an aggregate $34.8 million for stock-based compensation expense over the 18-year period of the review through fiscal 2006. Approximately $21.7 million of the restated amounts apply to the income statements for
fiscal years 2003 through 2006, inclusive, and the remainder, which is applicable to prior fiscal years, has been recorded as a charge to retained earnings as of January 31, 2002. Such charges have the effect of decreasing net income and,
correspondingly, retained earnings as reported in our historical financial statements. The net of tax impact of the stock-based compensation adjustments in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 were insignificant. However, we restated our Consolidated
Balance Sheet as of January 31, 2006 to properly reflect Retained Earnings, Common Stock and Deferred Compensation balances as a result of previous period adjustments.

During the period of the voluntary stock option review, we determined that we incorrectly recorded certain credits to resellers. As a result, adjustments
were made to increase net revenues and decrease deferred revenue by $14.0 million in fiscal 2006 and $5.1 million in fiscal 2005. These adjustments, which have the effect of increasing net income and, correspondingly, retained earnings, are
described in more detail below.

This Form 10-K reflects the restatement of our consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2006, the
related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the fiscal years ended January 31, 2006 and 2005, and each of the quarters in fiscal 2006.

This Form 10-K also reflects the restatement of “Selected Consolidated Financial Data” in Item 6 for the fiscal years ended
January 31, 2006, 2005, 2004 and 2003, and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2006 and 2005.

Previously filed annual reports on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q prior to fiscal 2007 have been affected by the restatements, have not
been amended, and should not be relied on.

In connection with the restatement of our consolidated financial statements, we applied
judgment in determining whether to revise measurement dates for prior option grants. In addition, if we determined that a measurement date needed to be revised, judgment was applied in determining the appropriate measurement date.

In addition, we have restated the pro forma expense under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (“SFAS 123”) in Part II,
Item 8, Note 1, “Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements to include these adjustments for the years ended January 31, 2006 and 2005.

All references to the number of option shares, option exercise prices, and share prices in this section have been adjusted for any subsequent stock
splits.



Stock Option Grant Process

Pursuant to our non-director stock plans, our Board of Directors has the authority to grant options or delegate this authority to a committee. For
portions of the relevant period, the right to grant options under our stock plans to all employees other than non-employee directors was delegated to the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors or to the chief executive officer, or CEO, as
a committee of one. Executive officer option grants were generally approved by the Compensation Committee during regularly scheduled Compensation Committee meetings, although a small number were approved by unanimous written consent. Option grants
by the CEO to all other employees were generally done on a monthly basis by written consent during the period between December 1995 and August 2006.

Accounting Adjustments

Consistent with the applicable accounting literature and recent guidance from
the SEC staff, we organized the 230 separate stock option grant approvals, totaling approximately 46,300 individual grants, made during the relevant period into categories based on grant type and the processes by which the grant approval was
finalized. We analyzed the evidence from the Audit Committee’s review related to each category including, but not limited to, physical documents, electronic documents, underlying electronic data about documents, and witness interviews. Based on
the relevant facts and circumstances, we applied the then appropriate accounting standards to determine, for every grant within each category, the proper measurement date. If the measurement date was not the originally assigned grant date,
accounting adjustments were made as required, resulting in stock-based compensation expense and related tax effects. After accounting for forfeitures, we recognized stock-based compensation expense of $34.8 million on a pre-tax basis over the
vesting terms for the affected grants. No adjustments were required for the remaining grants. The adjustments were determined by category as follows:

Monthly Date Selection Process Grants—For the period between July 2000 and February 2005, we generally followed an administrative process for monthly broad based employee grants that resulted in the selection of
effective grant dates that were prior in time to the final preparation of action by written consent for such grants (the “Monthly Date Selection Process Grants”). Usually, the grant dates selected by this process were chosen later in the
same calendar month in which the applicable actions by written consent were signed and were dates prior in time to the final preparation of such written consents to coincide with low trading prices during the month of the applicable grant. Based on
the voluntary review, the Company determined that the measurement dates for approximately 12,000 individual grants of the approximate total 18,500 individual grants made to broad based employees pursuant to delegated authority must be revised
because the grant dates selected by the administrative process were prior in time to the final approval of such grants. For these grants, based upon the available evidence we chose as the measurement date the date upon which the terms of the
specific monthly broad based employee grant was determined to be fixed and unchangeable. Accordingly, we recognized a pre-tax stock-based compensation expense of $23.1 million for such grant approvals using the intrinsic value method of accounting
under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 (“APB 25”).

1992 New-Hire Grant to Incoming CEO—In May 1992, the
Compensation Committee approved a grant to the Company’s then-incoming CEO that was measured on an incorrect date. The measurement date used was April 7, 1992, the date the Company and the incoming CEO had reached a business agreement on
most of the terms of her employment agreement, including the number of stock options to be granted. However, discussions thereafter continued regarding other important matters, including the structure of, and exercise price for, her stock option
grant. The essential terms of the option grant, the grant price, number of options and date of grant, were presented to the Board on April 27, 1992, and approved by the Compensation Committee on May 4, 1992. In connection with the grant to
the then-incoming CEO, both parties were represented by counsel. We recognized pre-tax stock-based compensation expense of $3.3 million from this grant based on a revised measurement date of May 4, 1992 using the intrinsic value method of
accounting under APB 25.

Anomalous Add Grants—Based on the voluntary review, the Audit Committee found that in certain instances,
additions or error corrections were made to the details of grants that had already been approved by the



CEO without obtaining additional approval (the “Anomalous Add Grants”). For the period between December 1995 through August 2006 when the CEO had
delegated authority to grant options, 420 of approximately 37,100 individual option grants were considered to be Anomalous Add Grants, for a total error rate of 1.1%, with 98% of Anomalous Add Grants occurring prior to fiscal 2003. Based on the
voluntary review, management determined that the measurement dates for the related individual option grants must be revised. Accordingly, we recognized pre-tax stock-based compensation expense of $3.1 million from such grants using the intrinsic
value method of accounting under APB 25.

Termination Issues—During the relevant period, two former executives and 34 employees were
permitted to vest in (and subsequently exercise) stock options to purchase an aggregate of approximately 1.4 million shares of common stock for a period of time beyond what they were otherwise entitled to exercise under their original stock
option agreement. In most cases, vesting was extended for a period of time after the termination date and, thus, should have resulted in accounting consequences. For the 34 employees, it appears that these cases were most likely due to
administrative error. Based on the voluntary review, management determined that the accounting for the related option grants must be revised and we recognized pre-tax stock-based compensation expense of $2.3 million from such grants using the
intrinsic value method of accounting under APB 25.

Board-Authorized Grant—In 1992, the Board approved a broad-based employee grant,
which included a grant to the Company’s then-CFO and then General Counsel, that involved a measurement date error. The error was caused by the Company’s use of the date on which the Board approved the general scope and nature of a special
one-time grant to certain employees as the measurement date, rather than the date on which the specific grantees and grant amounts were finalized and approved by the Board. In addition, in 1991, the Board approved a broad-based employee grant with
an exercise price less than the fair market value on the date of grant. Accordingly, we recognized pre-tax stock-based compensation expense of $2.4 million from these grants.

Compensation Committee Grants—From 1997 through 2000: (i) two individual option grants do not appear to have any evidence of Compensation
Committee approval or authorization; (ii) four additional individual option grants appear to have been ratified at a date subsequent to the original grant date; and (iii) the original measurement date of one additional option grant
approved by a Unanimous Written Consent of the Compensation Committee appears to have been made more than a reasonable period of time prior to final approval of the grant for accounting purposes. Based on the voluntary review, management determined
that the measurement dates for the related option grants must be revised. Accordingly, we recognized pre-tax stock-based compensation expense of $0.6 million from seven grants.

Judgment

In light of the judgment
used in establishing revised measurement dates, alternate approaches to those used by us could have resulted in different compensation expense charges than those recorded by us in the restatement. We considered various alternative
approaches.

For Monthly Date Selection Process Grants, where for certain of the grants, there was no evidence to suggest a particular
single date was the appropriate measurement date, Company management narrowed the possible measurement date to a range of dates or a grant window. The grant window was approximately four days on average and ranged from one day to sixteen days. The
Company’s management considered which date to use in this range and chose to use the last day of the grant window since the grants appeared to be fixed and unchangeable. We believe the grant was fixed and unchangeable on the last day in the
grant window because this was the day the award was communicated. Changing the measurement dates from the last day of the grant window to the highest price during the grant window would cause the pre-tax compensation charges discussed above to
increase by approximately $2.0 million. Changing the measurement dates from the last day of the grant window to the lowest price during the grant window would cause the pre-tax compensation charges discussed above to decrease by approximately $11.9
million.



For the Anomalous Add Grants, Company management determined that the measurement date was the date the
individual grant was fixed and unchangeable. This was the date by which the award was likely communicated to the employee. Alternatively, we considered the date on which the employee and relevant grant information were added to the grant list.
However, because that date did not necessarily represent a date that the award was either approved or communicated to the employee, we rejected that alternative. We believe the grant was fixed and unchangeable on the last day in the grant window
because this was the day the award was communicated. Changing the measurement dates for the Anomalous Add Grants from the date upon which the terms of the grant were likely communicated to the employee to the date when the grant information was
likely added to the grant list would cause the pre-tax compensation charges discussed above to decrease by approximately $1.3 million. Changing the measurement dates for the Anomalous Add Grants from the date upon which the terms of the award were
likely communicated to the employee to the highest price in the grant window would cause the pre-tax compensation charges to increase by approximately $2.3 million.

We believe that the approaches we used for each of the categories were the most appropriate under the circumstances.

Financial Impact of the Restatement

The increase in net revenues and stock-based compensation
expense resulting from the restatement is as follows (in millions):

(1)

Includes $2.5 million of payroll tax expenses.

The net
of tax impact of the stock-based compensation adjustments in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 was insignificant. However, we restated our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 31, 2006 to properly reflect Retained Earnings, Common Stock and
Deferred Compensation balances as a result of previous period adjustments. Please refer to Note 2, “Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We also restated the pro forma
expense under SFAS 123 in Note 1 “Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K to reflect the impact of these adjustments for the years ended January 31,
2006 and 2005.



As mentioned above, while performing the voluntary stock option review, we identified that we incorrectly
recorded certain credits to resellers. Certain credits to resellers for sales of new and renewal maintenance were recognized as a reduction of license and other revenues and maintenance revenues in the period the transaction was billed. These
credits should have been recorded as a reduction of deferred maintenance revenue when the transaction was billed which would have resulted in a reduction to maintenance revenues over the maintenance period. The impact of this restatement resulted in
adjustments to increase net revenues and decrease deferred revenues of $14.0 million in fiscal 2006 and $5.1 million in fiscal 2005.

For
more information regarding our restated financial statements, see “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in Item 8 and “Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements” in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements, as well as “Selected Consolidated Financial Data” in Item 6 and “Quarterly Financial Information (Unaudited)” in Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Strategy

Our goal
is to be the world’s leading design software and services company for the building, manufacturing, infrastructure, and media and entertainment industries. Our focus is to offer our customers the ability to create and manage great designs and
simulate reality through our software and to help them experience their ideas before they become real.

We believe that our ability to make
technology available to mainstream markets is one of our competitive advantages. By innovating in existing technology categories, we bring powerful design products to volume markets. Our products are designed to be easy to learn and use, and to
provide customers low cost of deployment, low total cost of ownership and a rapid return on investment. Our architecture allows for extensibility and integration.

We have created a large global community of resellers, third-party developers and customers, which provides us with a broad reach into volume markets. Our reseller network is extensive and provides our customers with
global resources for the purchase and support of our products as well as resources for effective and cost-efficient training services. We have a significant number of registered third-party developers, creating products that run on top of our
products, further extending our reach into volume markets. Our installed base of millions of users has made Autodesk’s products a worldwide design software standard.

Users trained on Autodesk products are broadly available both from universities and the existing workforce, reducing the cost of training for our customers. We offer education programs and specially priced
software-purchasing options tailored for educational institutions, students, and faculty to train the next generation of users. We also offer classroom support, including standardized curricula developed by educators, instructor development, and a
rich assortment of online learning resources.

Our growth strategy derives from these core strengths. We continue to increase the business
value of our desktop design tools for our customers in a number of ways. We improve the performance and functionality of existing products with each new release, and we have increased the frequency of most of our releases. Our most recent major
product releases occurred in March 2007. Beyond our horizontal design products, we develop products addressing specific vertical market needs. In addition, we believe that migration of our customers from our 2D products to our 3D model-based
products, which generally have higher prices, presents a significant growth opportunity. While the rate of migration to 3D varies from industry to industry, adoption of 3D design software should increase the productivity of our customers in all
industries and result in richer design data. However, this migration also poses various risks to us. In particular, if we do not successfully convert our 2D customer base to our 3D model-based products as expected, and sales of our 2D products
decrease without a corresponding increase in customer seats of our 3D model-based products, we would not realize the growth we expect and our business would be adversely affected.



Expanding our geographic coverage is a key element of our growth strategy. We believe that rapidly
growing economies, including those of China, India, Eastern Europe and Latin America, present significant growth opportunities for us. However, conducting business in these rapidly growing economies presents significant challenges, including
intellectual property protection and software piracy which remains a substantial problem.

Another significant part of our growth strategy
is to improve upon our installed base business model. A key element of this strategy is our ability to release major products on an annual basis. Strong annual release cycles have a number of benefits. In particular, they permit us to deliver key
performance and functionality improvements to customers on a regular and timely basis. Annual releases also help us to increase product maintenance revenues and significantly reduce our reliance on product upgrade revenues, thereby reducing the
volatility of revenues.

We are continually focused on improving productivity and efficiency in all areas of Autodesk in order to allow us
to increase our investment in growth initiatives and improve our profitability. However, our operating margin declined to 19% during fiscal 2007 compared with 25% during fiscal 2006. This decline in our operating margin was driven primarily by our
adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123—revised 2004, “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS 123R”) in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. As a result of this new accounting pronouncement, we recorded
stock-based compensation expense in fiscal 2007 of $94.3 million which decreased operating margins by 5%. In addition, we experienced increased amortization expense during fiscal 2007 primarily from our acquisition of Alias in the fourth fiscal
quarter of 2006. Amortization expense of acquisition-related intangibles, primarily related to our acquisition of Alias, of $14.4 million in fiscal 2007 compared to $0.7 million in fiscal 2006, decreased our operating margin by 1%. Finally, costs
incurred as a result of our stock option review, including a bonus payment to participants of our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”), reduced our operating margin by 1%. See further discussion of this ESPP bonus payment at “Stock
Compensation” within this Item. These decreases in operating margin were offset by productivity initiatives across our organization. We continue to invest in growth initiatives and, over the longer term, we intend to continue to balance
investments in revenue growth opportunities with our goal of increasing our operating margins.

We generate significant cash flows. Our
uses of cash include share repurchases to offset the dilutive effect of our employee stock plans as well as investments in acquisitions and investments in growth initiatives, such as our recent acquisition of Constructware, and our equity investment
in Hanna Strategies during the first quarter of fiscal 2007. See Note 15, “Business Combinations”and Note 16, “Related Parties,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. We evaluate merger and
acquisition and divestiture opportunities to the extent they support our strategy. Our typical acquisitions, which are an integral part of our growth initiatives, are intended to provide specific technology or expertise, adjacency to our current
products and services and rapid product integration. Additionally, we continue to invest in other growth initiatives including product development and sales, market and channel development.

Design Solutions Segment

During fiscal 2007, the
Design Solutions Segment consisted of the following divisions: Platform Technology Division and Other, which included our horizontal design products, AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT, and Autodesk Consulting and Autodesk Collaboration Services; Manufacturing
Solutions Division; Building Solutions Division; and Infrastructure Solutions Division.

For the Platform Technology Division , our focus
during fiscal 2007 was on providing CAD design tools and technologies that allow our customers in multiple markets to create, manage, and share design data. Our primary product offerings were AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT software and our Autodesk Buzzsaw
service. AutoCAD software is a customizable and extendable computer aided design (CAD) application for 2D drafting, detailing, functional design documentation and basic 3D model-based design. AutoCAD LT software is used for



2D drafting and detailing by design professionals who require full DWG file format compatibility and document sharing capability without the need for
software customization or 3D functionality. Autodesk Buzzsaw is an on-demand collaboration service that allows users to store, manage and share project information from any internet connection.

For the Manufacturing Solutions Division, our focus during fiscal 2007 was to provide comprehensive design and data management solutions that enable our
manufacturing customers to rapidly adopt 3D design, create designs in a simple 2D/3D environment and manage design data. Our primary solution offering was the Autodesk Inventor Family of Products, which delivers Autodesk Mechanical Desktop, based on
AutoCAD software, and Autodesk Inventor in one solution, and Autodesk AutoCAD Mechanical, which offers 2D mechanical design and engineering tools that are compatible with all AutoCAD-based products.

For the Building Solutions Division, our focus during fiscal 2007 was to enable our customers to create high quality building designs and documentation,
accurately estimate project costs and manage project workflows, and provide comprehensive solutions that enable them to rapidly adopt 3D designs. Our primary product offerings were: Autodesk Architectural Desktop for architects and Autodesk Building
Systems for Mechanical, Electrical, Planning (“MEP”) engineering firms, both based on AutoCAD software; and a complete suite of design software built on the Autodesk Revit platform for building information modeling (“BIM”). These
include Autodesk Revit Building for architects, Autodesk Revit Structure for structural engineers, and Autodesk Revit Systems for the engineering of building mechanical and electrical systems.

For the Infrastructure Solutions Division, our focus during fiscal 2007 was to enable our customers to compile, analyze and maintain digital design
information, design and manage physical infrastructure projects, distribute geospatial information on the web, and provide them with comprehensive solutions that enable them to rapidly adopt 3D designs. Our primary product offerings were Autodesk
Map 3D for precision mapping and geographic information system analysis in the AutoCAD environment, Autodesk Civil 3D and Autodesk Land Desktop. We believe customers in the web mapping market are demanding more frequent software releases, faster
support for new standards, faster access to new data sources, and lower cost of ownership for their web mapping solutions.

Media and Entertainment
Segment

The Media and Entertainment Segment serves the digital media sector and during fiscal 2007 was divided into two business lines:
(1) Animation and (2) Advanced Systems. Principal product offerings in our Animation business line were: Autodesk 3ds Max and Autodesk Maya. Autodesk 3ds Max is modeling, animation, and rendering software that enables game developers,
design visualization professionals, and visual effects artists to communicate abstract or complex mechanical, architectural, engineering, and construction concepts. Autodesk Maya is a 3D modeling, animation, effects, and rendering solution that
enables film and video artists, game developers, and design visualization professionals to create engaging, lifelike digital images, realistic animation, and extraordinary visual effects. A key component of our strategy is the realization of a
complete and comprehensive 3D animation portfolio and workflow. Principal product offerings in our Advanced Systems business line include Autodesk Flame, Autodesk Inferno and Autodesk Flint, our scalable line of interactive real-time visual effects
and graphics design solutions; and Autodesk Smoke and Autodesk Fire, our scalable line of interactive real-time non-linear editing and finishing systems. In the film, commercial, and broadcast markets, our focus remains on visual effects design,
editing and finishing tools, where we plan to continue to expand our software feature sets and improve data interoperability, while continuing to transition these products to lower cost standard, open, PC-based Linux platforms.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our
consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates



that can have a significant impact on amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on
historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We regularly reevaluate our assumptions,
judgments and estimates. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 1, “Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the following
policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations.

Revenue Recognition.

Our accounting policies and practices are in compliance with Statement of Position 97-2,
“Software Revenue Recognition,” as amended, and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, “Revenue Recognition.”

We
recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable. However, determining whether and when some of these criteria
have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report.

For multiple element arrangements that include software products, we allocate the sales price among each of the deliverables using the residual method, under which revenue is allocated to undelivered elements based on their vendor-specific
objective evidence (“VSOE”) of fair value. VSOE is the price charged when an element is sold separately or a price set by management with the relevant authority. If we do not have VSOE of the undelivered element, we defer revenue
recognition on the entire sales arrangement until all elements are delivered. We are required to exercise judgment in determining whether VSOE exists for each undelivered element based on whether our pricing for these elements is sufficiently
consistent.

Our assessment of likelihood of collection is also a critical element in determining the timing of revenue recognition. If we
do not believe that collection is probable, the revenue will be deferred until the earlier of when collection is deemed probable or cash is received.

Our product license revenues from distributors and resellers are generally recognized at the time title to our product passes to the distributor or reseller provided all other criteria for revenue recognition are met.
This policy is predicated on our ability to estimate sales returns among other criteria. We are also required to evaluate whether our distributors and resellers have the ability to honor their commitment to make fixed or determinable payments,
regardless of whether they collect cash from their customers. Our policy also presumes that we have no significant performance obligations in connection with the sale of our product licenses by our distributors and resellers to their customers. If
we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments, it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period.

Product Returns Reserves.

We permit our distributors and resellers to return products up to a percentage of prior quarter purchases and to return product when new product releases
supersede older versions. The product returns reserve is based on historical experience of actual product returns, estimated channel inventory levels, the timing of new product introductions and promotions, channel sell-in for applicable markets and
other factors.

Our product returns reserves were $18.2 million at January 31, 2007 and $14.2 million at January 31, 2006.
Product returns as a percentage of applicable revenues were 3.9% in fiscal 2007, 3.7% in fiscal 2006 and 4.1% in fiscal 2005. During fiscal year 2007, we recorded additions to our product returns reserves of $57.1 million, which reduced our revenue.

While we believe our accounting practice for establishing and monitoring product returns reserves is adequate and appropriate, any adverse
activity or unusual circumstances could result in an increase in reserve levels in the period in which such determinations are made.



Realizability of Long-Lived Assets.

We assess the realizability of our
long-lived assets and related intangible assets, other than goodwill, annually during the fourth fiscal quarter, or sooner should events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable. We consider the
following factors important in determining when to perform an impairment review: significant under-performance of a business or product line relative to budget; shifts in business strategies which affect the continued uses of the assets; significant
negative industry or economic trends; and the results of past impairment reviews.

In assessing the recoverability of these long-lived
assets, we first determine their fair values, which are based on assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows that could reasonably be generated by these assets. When assessing long-lived assets, we use undiscounted cash flow models which
include assumptions regarding projected cash flows. Because expected lives are relatively short, discounting the projected cash flows would not lead to a significantly different result. Variances in these assumptions could have a significant impact
on our conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired or the amount of the impairment charge. Impairment charges, if any, result in situations where the fair values of these assets are less than their carrying values.

In addition to our recoverability assessments, we routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of our long-lived assets. Any reduction in the
useful life assumption will result in increased depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter when such determinations are made, as well as in subsequent quarters.

We will continue to evaluate the values of our long-lived assets in accordance with applicable accounting rules. As changes in business conditions and our assumptions occur, we may be required to record impairment
charges.

Goodwill.

As required under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142,
“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” we no longer amortize goodwill, but test goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or sooner should events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment. When assessing
goodwill for impairment, we use discounted cash flow models which include assumptions regarding projected cash flows. Variances in these assumptions could have a significant impact on our conclusion as to whether goodwill assets are impaired or the
amount of the impairment charge. Impairment charges, if any, result from instances where the fair values of net assets associated with goodwill are less than their carrying values. As changes in business conditions and our assumptions occur, we may
be required to record impairment charges.

Deferred Tax Assets.

We currently have $137.9 million of net
deferred tax assets, mostly arising from net operating losses, including stock option deductions taken in fiscal years prior to fiscal 2007, as well as tax credits and reserves offset by the establishment of U.S. deferred tax liabilities on
unremitted earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries and taxable temporary differences for purchased technologies and capitalized software. We perform a quarterly assessment of the recoverability of these net deferred tax assets, which is
principally dependent upon our achievement of projected future taxable income of approximately $519 million across a specific mix of geographies. Our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions and other
factors. These changes, if any, may require possible material adjustments to these net deferred tax assets, resulting in a reduction in net income in the period when such determinations are made.

Autodesk is a U.S. based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate is based on expected
geographic mix of earnings, statutory rates, transfer pricing, and enacted tax rules. Significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions on a worldwide basis. We believe our tax positions,
including intercompany transfer pricing policies, are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. It is possible that these positions may be challenged which may have a significant impact on our effective tax
rate.

Stock Option Accounting

.    In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 123—revised 2004, “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS 123R”), which replaces Statement of



Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (“SFAS 123”) and supersedes APB 25. SFAS 123R requires the measurement of all share-based payments to
employees, including grants of employee stock options, using a fair-value based method and the recording of such expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income. In March 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, “Share-Based
Payment” (“SAB 107”), which provides interpretive guidance related to the interaction between SFAS 123R and certain SEC rules and regulations, as well as provides the SEC staff’s views regarding the valuation of share-based
payment arrangements.

We adopted SFAS 123R using the modified prospective transition method, which requires the application of the
accounting standard as of February 1, 2006, the first day of our fiscal year 2007. Our consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2007 reflect our adoption of SFAS 123R. In accordance with the modified prospective transition method, our
consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated for, and do not include the impact of, compensation expense calculated under SFAS 123R.

SFAS 123R requires companies to estimate the fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is
recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, we accounted for stock-based awards to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method in accordance with
APB 25, as permitted by SFAS 123. Under the intrinsic value method, compensation expense resulted primarily from stock option grants to non-executive employees at exercise prices below fair market value on the option measurement date. The majority
of these grants were made between August 2000 and February 2005.

We use the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model as the most
appropriate method for determining the estimated fair value for employee stock awards. This is the same option-pricing model used in prior years to calculate the pro forma compensation expense under our SFAS 123 footnote disclosures. This model
requires the input of assumptions, including expected stock price volatility, expected life, expected dividend yield and risk-free interest rate of each award. The parameters used in the model are reviewed on a quarterly basis and adjusted, as
needed. Compensation expense for employee stock awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the award. The adoption of SFAS 123R also requires certain changes to the accounting for income taxes, the method used in
determining diluted shares, the application of a pre-vesting forfeiture rate against both pre- and post-adoption grants, as well as additional disclosure related to the cash flow effects resulting from share-based compensation. The relevant
interpretive guidance of SAB 107 was applied in connection with the implementation and adoption of SFAS 123R. See Note 3, “Employee and Director Benefit Plans,” for more information on this new standard.

We are restating our consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2006, the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity, and
cash flows for each of the fiscal years ended January 31, 2006 and January 31, 2005, and each of the quarters in fiscal 2006 to include net revenues and stock-based compensation adjustments. Previously filed annual reports on Form 10-K and quarterly
reports on Form 10-Q affected by the restatements have not been amended and should not be relied on.

In connection with the restatement of
our consolidated financial statements, we applied judgment and sensitivity analysis in choosing whether to revise measurement dates for prior option grants. In addition, if we determined that a measurement date needed to be revised, judgment and
sensitivity analysis was applied in determining the appropriate measurement date.



The increase in net revenues and stock-based compensation expense resulting from the restatement is as
follows (in millions):

(1)

Includes $2.5 million of payroll tax expenses.

In
addition, we have restated the pro forma expense under SFAS 123 in Part II, Item 8, Note 1, “Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements to include these adjustments for the
years ended January 31, 2006 and January 31, 2005.

equity at the end of each fiscal year (in millions):



The following table presents the effects of the net revenue, stock-based compensation and related tax

Legal Contingencies

.    As described in Part I, Item 3, “Legal
Proceedings” and Part II, Item 8, Note 8, “Commitments and Contingencies,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we are periodically involved in various legal claims and proceedings. We routinely review the status of
each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any matter is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we record a liability for the estimated loss. Because of inherent
uncertainties related to these legal matters, we base our loss accruals on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess our potential liability and may revise our estimates. Such revisions
could have a material impact on future quarterly or annual results of operations.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In September 2006, the SEC staff released Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, “Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements When
Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements” (“SAB 108”) which provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current
year misstatement. We applied the provisions of SAB 108 using the cumulative effect transition method in connection with the preparation of our annual financial statements for the year ended January 31, 2007. The adoption of SAB 108 did not
have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In September 2006, the FASB issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans—an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R)” (“SFAS 158”).
This Statement requires recognition of the funded status of a benefit plan in the statement of financial position. The Standard also requires recognition in other comprehensive income of certain gains and losses that arise during the period but are
deferred under pension accounting rules, as well as modifies the timing of reporting and adds certain disclosures. SFAS 158 provides recognition and disclosure elements to be effective as of the end of the fiscal year after December 15, 2006
and measurement elements to be effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008. We have adopted the recognition and disclosure elements of the Statement which have not had a material effect on our consolidated financial position,
results of operations or cash flows. In addition, we adopted the measurement elements of the Standard as of February 1, 2007, the beginning of our fiscal year 2008. The adoption of the measurement elements of SFAS 158 did not have a material
effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In September 2006, the FASB also
issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS 157”), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value
measurements. SFAS 157 does not require any new fair value measurements but instead is intended to eliminate inconsistencies with respect to this topic found in various other accounting pronouncements. This Statement is effective for our 2009 fiscal
year, including interim periods within our 2009 fiscal year. We do not believe the adoption of SFAS 157 will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In July 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109,” which
clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions. Under FIN 48, companies are required to recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is “more likely than not” that the tax position would be sustained upon audit based
solely on the technical merits of the tax position. FIN 48 clarified how a company would measure the income tax benefits from the tax positions that are recognized, provides guidance as to the derecognition of previously recognized tax benefits and
describes the methods for classifying and disclosing the liabilities within the financial statements for any unrecognized tax benefits. The provisions of FIN 48 are effective as of the beginning of our 2008 fiscal year, with the cumulative effect of
the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings. Based on our assessment, we recorded an increase to opening retained earnings during the first quarter of fiscal 2008 for tax benefits not previously
recognized of approximately $26 million as a result of adopting FIN 48.



In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155, “Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial
Instruments” (“SFAS 155”). This Statement amends Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (“SFAS 133”) and Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 140, “Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities” (“SFAS 140”). SFAS 155 simplifies the accounting for certain derivatives embedded in other
financial instruments by allowing them to be accounted for as a whole if the holder elects to account for the whole instrument on a fair value basis. SFAS 155 also clarifies and amends certain other provisions of SFAS 133 and SFAS 140. The adoption
of SFAS 155 did not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Overview of Fiscal 2007 Results of Operations

(1)

See the “Explanatory Note” immediately preceding Part I, Item 1 and Note 2, “Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements,” in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements of this Form 10-K.

The primary goals for fiscal 2007 were to continue our delivery of market-leading
products and solutions to our customers in order to drive revenue growth, market share gains and increases in operating cash flow. We achieved these goals as demonstrated by our 20% net revenue increase and our 38% increase in cash from operations
from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007. The strength of our products and their market acceptance and our acquisition of Alias and Constructware led to strong growth in net revenue and increased market share.

During fiscal 2007 we released our 2007 family of products, grew maintenance revenues by 54%, our maintenance-installed base to over 1.2 million
users, 3D revenues by 41%, AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT revenues by 11%, revenues from emerging economies by 39% and Animation revenues by 97%. The growth numbers include acquisition related revenue, primarily from our acquisition of Alias in January
2006. During the second quarter of fiscal 2007, we successfully completed the integration of Alias.

Our net revenues were higher in fiscal
2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 due primarily to growth in sales of new seats and maintenance revenues, partially offset by a decrease in revenues from upgrades. Increase in revenues of 19% from the sales of new seats was driven by volume growth and
higher average sales prices in AutoCAD, AutoCAD LT, and our 3D products, as well as revenues from our Maya, StudioTools, and other animation products resulting from our January 2006 acquisition of Alias. Maintenance revenues from our Subscription
Program increased 54%, reflecting strength in subscription attachment and renewal rates during fiscal 2007. Revenues from upgrades decreased by 7% driven primarily by the relatively smaller size of the upgradeable base of the AutoCAD-based products
as of the beginning of fiscal 2007 compared to the upgradeable base of the AutoCAD-based products in fiscal 2006 and the success of our Subscription Program. In addition, our aggregate backlog, primarily comprised of deferred revenue and current
software license product orders which we have not yet shipped, increased from $283.5 million at January 31, 2006 to $395.8 million at January 31, 2007.

We generate a significant amount of our revenue in the United States, Japan, Germany, United Kingdom, Italy, France, Canada, China, South Korea and Australia. Foreign currencies had a minimal effect on financial
results for fiscal 2007. The weaker value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies had a negative effect of



$0.6 million on operating results in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006. If exchange rates from fiscal 2006 would have been in effect during fiscal 2007,
translated international revenue billed in local currencies would have been $1.0 million lower and operating expenses would have been $1.6 million lower. Changes in the value of the U.S. dollar may have a significant effect on net revenues in future
periods. We use foreign currency option collar contracts to reduce the current quarter exchange rate effect on the net revenue of certain anticipated transactions.

The percentage of total costs and expenses increased to 81% of net revenues in fiscal 2007 from 75% of net revenues in fiscal 2006. This increase is primarily due to our adoption of SFAS 123R commencing from the first
quarter of fiscal 2007. Total stock-based compensation expense of $94.3 million was recorded in fiscal 2007, resulting in a 5% increase in total costs and expenses as a percent of net revenues. In addition, we experienced increased operating costs
due to the acquisition and integration of Alias. Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, primarily from the Alias acquisition, of $14.4 million in fiscal 2007, compared to $0.7 million in fiscal 2006, increased total costs and expenses as a
percent of net revenues by 1%. Finally, costs of $15.0 million incurred as a result of our stock option review, including a bonus payment to participants in our ESPP, increased our total costs and expenses as a percent of net revenues by 1%. These
increases in total costs and expenses were offset by productivity initiatives across our organization. Our operating margins are very sensitive to changes in revenues, given the relatively fixed nature of most of our expenses, which consist
primarily of employee-related expenditures, facilities costs, and depreciation and amortization expense. During fiscal 2008, we expect total costs and expenses to increase in absolute dollars but decline as a percentage of net revenues as we balance
investments in revenue growth opportunities with our focus on increasing profitability.

Throughout fiscal 2007, we maintained a strong
balance sheet and generated $576.6 million of cash from operating activities as compared to $415.2 million in the previous year. We finished the year with $777.9 million in cash and marketable securities, up from $377.5 million at January 31,
2006. This increase resulted primarily from the temporary cessation of share repurchases during the second half of fiscal 2007. Our voluntary stock option review and our inability to meet our filing requirements with the SEC prohibited share
repurchases during the second half of fiscal 2007. We increased our cash and marketable securities while continuing to invest in our business through the acquisition of Constructware, investment in Hanna Strategies and repurchase of 4.2 million
shares of our common stock during the first half of fiscal 2007. We completed fiscal 2007 with a higher deferred revenue balance as compared to the previous year. Our deferred revenue balance at January 31, 2007 included $328.2 million of
customer subscription contracts which will be recognized as maintenance revenue ratably over the life of the contracts, which is predominantly one year.



Results of Operations

Net Revenues

(1)

See the “Explanatory Note” immediately preceding Part I, Item 1 and Note 2, “Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements,” in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements of this Form 10-K.

Fiscal 2007 Net Revenues Compared to Fiscal 2006 Net Revenues

License and other revenues are comprised of two components: all forms of product license revenues and other revenues. Product license revenues include
revenues from the sale of new seats, revenues from the Autodesk Upgrade Program and revenues from the Autodesk Crossgrade Program. Other revenues consist of revenue from consulting and training services as well as revenue from the Autodesk
Developers Network. Maintenance revenues consist of revenue from our Subscription Program.

The increase in net revenues during fiscal
2007, as compared to fiscal 2006, was due to an increase in sales of new seats, an increase in the sales of subscription contracts which are recognized as maintenance revenues and an increase in crossgrade revenues. Revenue from the sale of new
seats increased due to volume growth and higher average sales prices in our AutoCAD, AutoCAD LT, and our 3D products. In addition, the introduction of our Maya and StudioTools products resulting from the January 2006 acquisition of Alias contributed
to the growth in revenues during fiscal 2007. We experienced strong growth in all three of our geographic regions and strong growth rates in the emerging economies of Asia/Pacific, Eastern Europe and the Middle East, and Latin



America from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007. These increases were partially offset by a decline in revenue from upgrades resulting primarily from the relatively
smaller size of the upgradeable base of our AutoCAD-based products during fiscal 2007 compared to the upgradeable base of our AutoCAD-based products as of the same period in the prior fiscal year.

Growth in license and other revenues during fiscal 2007, as compared to fiscal 2006, was primarily due to an increase in the sale of commercial new seats
for most major products driven by our new product releases during fiscal 2007. Increases in revenue from the sale of new seats were driven by volume growth in AutoCAD, AutoCAD LT and most major products, as well as growing sales of our 3D products.
These increases were partially offset by a 7% decrease in revenues from upgrades driven by the relatively smaller size of the upgradeable base of our AutoCAD-based products in fiscal 2007 compared to the size of our AutoCAD-based products and the
success of our Subscription Program in fiscal 2006. Revenue from the sales of services, training and support are immaterial for all periods presented.

We attempt to release new product versions on a regular basis and synchronize our major product retirements with those releases. Our AutoCAD 2004-based products were retired in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. The
upgradeable installed base of the AutoCAD-based products not on subscription during fiscal 2007 was smaller than the upgradeable installed base of AutoCAD-based products not on subscription during fiscal 2006. As a result, overall maintenance
revenue from subscriptions exceeded revenue from upgrades in fiscal 2007. We expect revenue from upgrades to continue to decline in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007.

Maintenance revenues consist of revenues derived from the Subscription Program. As a percentage of total net revenues, maintenance revenues were 23% for fiscal 2007, 18% for fiscal 2006, and 14% for fiscal 2005. Our
Subscription Program, available to most customers worldwide, continues to attract new and renewal customers by providing them with a cost effective and predictable budgetary option to obtain the productivity benefits of our periodic product release
cycle and enhancements. We expect maintenance revenues to continue to increase both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total net revenues as a result of increased Subscription Program enrollment.

Deferred revenue consists primarily of deferred maintenance revenue from our Subscription Program. To a lesser extent, deferred revenue consists of
deferred license and other revenue derived from Autodesk Buzzsaw services, consulting services and deferred license sales. Backlog from current software license product orders which we have not yet shipped consists of orders for currently available
license software products from customers with approved credit status and may include orders with current ship dates and orders with ship dates beyond the current fiscal period. Aggregate backlog at January 31, 2007 and January 31, 2006 was
$395.8 million and $283.5 million, respectively, of which $17.0 million for both fiscal years related to current software license product orders which have not yet shipped at the end of each respective fiscal year.

We rely significantly upon major distributors and resellers in both the U.S. and international regions, including Tech Data Corporation and their
affiliates, who accounted for 12% of fiscal 2007 net revenues and 11% of fiscal 2006 net revenues.

Net Revenues by Geographic Area

Net revenues in the Americas region increased during fiscal 2007, as compared to fiscal 2006, primarily due to strong maintenance
revenues, as well as revenues from products acquired in our acquisition of Alias in January 2006 and from growth in revenues from sales of new seats driven by new product releases during fiscal 2007. Revenue from upgrades in the Americas declined by
4% during fiscal 2007 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. Had exchange rates during fiscal 2006 been in effect during the same period of fiscal 2007, translated net revenues would have been lower by $0.3 million in fiscal 2007.



Net revenues in the Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) region increased during fiscal
2007, as compared to fiscal 2006, primarily due to an increase in the sale of new seats resulting from new product releases, combined with a strong increase in maintenance revenues and revenue from new products acquired from Alias. Revenues from
upgrades in EMEA experienced a 2% decline from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007. EMEA’s strong growth during fiscal 2007 was primarily due to growth in Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and the local emerging economies. Had exchange rates
during fiscal 2006 been in effect during the same period of fiscal 2007, translated net revenues would have been lower by $10.3 million in fiscal 2007.

Net revenues in the Asia/Pacific (“APAC”) region increased during fiscal 2007, as compared to fiscal 2006, primarily due to strong growth in revenues from sales of new seats resulting from new product
releases, followed by strong growth in maintenance revenues. Revenue from upgrades in APAC declined by 29% during fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006. Net revenue growth in APAC during fiscal 2007 primarily occurred in China, South Korea, Australia
and India. The increase in APAC net revenue during fiscal 2007 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year was also due to revenues from new products acquired from Alias. This revenue growth was offset by significant declines in the net
revenue growth in Japan for 2D and 3D products. Had exchange rates for fiscal 2006 been in effect during the same period of fiscal 2007, translated net revenues in the APAC region would have been higher by $9.7 million in fiscal 2007.

We believe that international net revenues will continue to comprise a significant portion of our total net revenues. Economic weakness in any of the
countries that contribute a significant portion of our net revenues could have an adverse effect on our business in those countries. Strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies could significantly and adversely impact our future
financial results for a given period. International net revenues represented 66% of our net revenues in both fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006. Net revenues in emerging economies of China, India, Eastern Europe and Latin America grew by 39% from fiscal
2006 to fiscal 2007. This growth was a significant factor in our international sales growth during fiscal 2007. Had exchange rates during fiscal 2006 been in effect during the same period of fiscal 2007, translated international revenues would have
been $1.0 million lower in fiscal 2007.

Net Revenues by Operating Segment

Design Solutions Segment net revenues increased during fiscal 2007, as compared to fiscal 2006, primarily due to both strong sales of new seats and
maintenance revenues. These increases were partially offset by a 6% decline in revenues from upgrades in fiscal 2007. Maintenance revenues increased to 24% of Design Solutions Segment revenue during fiscal 2007 compared to 20% in fiscal 2006. Sales
of AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT continue to comprise a significant portion of our net revenues. Such sales, reflected in the net revenues for the Platform Technology Division and Other, represented 40% of net revenues in fiscal 2007 and 43% of
consolidated net revenues in the same period of the prior fiscal year, increasing 11% in absolute dollars between the periods. Net revenues for our 3D model-based design products (Autodesk Inventor Family of Products, Autodesk Revit Family of
Products and Autodesk Civil 3D) increased 41% during fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006. Total sales of 3D design products represented 22% of consolidated net revenues in fiscal 2007 compared to 18% in fiscal 2006. A critical component of our
growth strategy is to continue to add new 2D users while migrating our customers, including customers of AutoCAD and related vertical industry products, to our 3D products, which generally have higher prices, particularly for annual subscription
contracts. However, should sales of 2D products decrease without a corresponding increase in sales of our 3D model-based products, our results of operations could be adversely affected.

Net revenues for the Media and Entertainment Segment (“M&E”) increased during fiscal 2007, as compared to fiscal 2006, primarily from
revenue increases in our Animation business line and from both our January 2006 acquisition of Alias and the introduction of new versions of 3ds Max and Maya products during the second quarter of fiscal 2007. Although net revenues from Advanced
Systems sales did not increase significantly during fiscal 2007 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year, such sales progressively improved during each quarter of fiscal 2007 as a result of substantial progress made in the transition of
our Advanced Systems product



portfolio from SGI platforms to Linux platforms. We do not expect the transition of our Advanced Systems customers from proprietary SGI platforms to open
PC-based platforms to continue to adversely impact Advanced Systems revenue in fiscal 2008.

Fiscal 2006 Net Revenues Compared to Fiscal
2005 Net Revenues

The increase in net revenues during fiscal 2006 was due primarily to strong increase in maintenance revenues and an
increase in the sale of new seats, continued growth in AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT revenues, along with a favorable product mix shift towards 3D products which generally have higher sales prices. In addition, we experienced strong growth in all three of
our geographic regions and we experienced especially strong growth rates in the emerging economies of China, Eastern Europe, Latin America and India.

Growth in license and other revenues during fiscal 2006, as compared to fiscal 2005, was primarily due to an increase in the sale of new seats for most major products and, to a lesser extent, to a modest increase in
revenues from upgrades. The increases in revenues from new seats were driven by volume growth in AutoCAD, AutoCAD LT, and most major products, and growing sales of our 3D products which generally have higher sales prices. Revenues from upgrades
increased in fiscal 2006, but at a lower rate than in fiscal 2005 as customers increasingly migrated to our Subscription Program and as we moved the retirement date of the AutoCAD 2002-based products to the first quarter of fiscal 2007. Revenue from
the sales of our services, training and support are immaterial for all periods presented.

Maintenance revenues consist of revenues derived
from the Subscription Program. As a percentage of total net revenues, maintenance revenues were 18% and 14% for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, respectively.

Net Revenues by Geographic Area

Net revenues in the Americas region increased during fiscal 2006, as
compared to fiscal 2005, primarily due to strong maintenance revenues and new seat revenues, offset in part by lower revenues from upgrades. Had exchange rates during fiscal 2005 been in effect during the same period of 2006, translated net revenues
would have been lower by $1.7 million in fiscal 2006.

Net revenues in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region increased during fiscal
2006 as compared to fiscal 2005, primarily due to strong maintenance revenues, increased sales of new seats, increased revenues from upgrades and growth in the EMEA emerging markets of Russia, Poland, Czech Republic and the Middle East. Had exchange
rates during fiscal 2005 been in effect during the same period of 2006, translated net revenues would have been higher by $7.4 million in fiscal 2006.

Net revenues in the Asia/Pacific region increased during fiscal 2006, as compared to fiscal 2005, primarily due to an increase in the sale of commercial new seats, and to a lesser extent from maintenance revenues and
revenues from upgrades as our Subscription Program was introduced in the APAC region after successful introductions first in the Americas and then in EMEA. We experienced strong growth during fiscal 2006 in Japan, China, Australia and South Korea.
Had exchange rates during fiscal 2005 been in effect during the same period of 2006, translated net revenues would have been higher by $3.4 million in fiscal 2006. International sales accounted for 66% of our net revenues in fiscal 2006 as compared
to 65% in the prior fiscal year. Had exchange rates from fiscal 2005 been in effect during fiscal 2006, translated international revenues would have been $9.1 million higher for fiscal 2006. Net revenues in the emerging economies of China,
India, Eastern Europe and Latin America grew by 61% between fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2006. This growth was a significant factor in our international sales growth during fiscal 2006.

Net Revenues by Operating Segment

Design Solutions Segment net revenues increased during fiscal 2006, as compared to fiscal 2005, primarily due to strong growth in new seat sales and in maintenance revenues as well as a more modest increase in net



revenues from upgrades. Maintenance revenues from our Subscription Program increased to 20% of Design Solutions Segment revenue in fiscal 2006, as compared
to 16% in fiscal 2005. During fiscal 2006 and 2005, sales of AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT continue to comprise a significant portion of our net revenues. Such sales, which are reflected in the net revenues for the Platform Technology Division and Other,
accounted for 43% of our consolidated net revenues in fiscal 2006 and and 44% in fiscal 2005, growing 23% in absolute dollars between the periods. Net revenues for our 3D model-based design products (Autodesk Inventor Family of Products, Autodesk
Revit Family of Products and Autodesk Civil 3D) increased 60% during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. Total sales of 3D model-based design products accounted for 18% of consolidated net revenues in fiscal 2006 compared to 14% in fiscal 2005.

Net revenues for the Media and Entertainment Segment increased during fiscal 2006, as compared to fiscal 2005, primarily from revenue
increases in our Animation business line due to new seats and maintenance revenues derived from 3ds Max. Net revenues from our Advanced Systems business line increased from $110.4 million during fiscal 2005 to $112.3 million during fiscal 2006. This
increase resulted from growth in the sales of our Linux-based Advanced Systems Products, which were offset in part by recent declines in Advanced Systems sales on the SGI platform.

Cost of Revenues

(1)

See the “Explanatory Note” immediately preceding Part I, Item 1 and Note 2, “Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements,” in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements of this Form 10-K.

Cost of license and other revenues includes direct material and overhead charges,
royalties, amortization of purchased technology, hosting costs, labor costs of fulfilling service contracts and order processing and, beginning at the start of fiscal 2007, stock-based compensation expense under SFAS 123R. Direct material and
overhead charges include the cost of hardware sold (mainly workstations manufactured by IBM and SGI for the Media and Entertainment Segment), costs associated with transferring our software to electronic media, printing of user manuals and packaging
materials and shipping and handling costs.

Cost of license and other revenues increased during fiscal 2007, as compared to fiscal 2006,
due to higher amortization of purchased technology resulting from recent acquisitions, stock-based compensation expense under SFAS 123R, and an increase in our allowance for excess and obsolete inventory, which together represented 1% of revenues.
The increase in cost of license and other revenues during fiscal 2006, as compared to fiscal 2005, was primarily due to higher direct material, overhead and royalty expenses for licensed technology embedded in our products, all of which resulted
from increased volumes, partially offset by a reduction in amortization of purchased technology and capitalized software.

Cost of
maintenance revenues includes direct costs of fulfilling our subscription contracts as well as indirect overhead charges. The decrease in cost of maintenance revenues during fiscal 2007, as compared to fiscal 2006, was due primarily to the cessation
of amortization for an information technology system supporting our



Subscription Program, which became fully amortized during the second quarter of fiscal 2006. The amortization reduction was partially offset by incremental
direct program costs incurred as part of the growth of our Subscription Program. The decrease in cost of maintenance revenues during fiscal 2006, as compared to fiscal 2005, was due primarily to the cessation of amortization for our information
technology system supporting our Subscription Program. The amortization reduction was partially offset by incremental direct program costs incurred as part of the growth of the Subscription Program.

Cost of revenues, at least over the near term, are affected by the volume and mix of product sales, changing consulting and hosted service costs,
software amortization costs, royalty rates for licensed technology embedded in our products, new customer support offerings and the impact of expensing employee stock-based compensation as required under SFAS 123R. Absent stock-based compensation
expense, we expect cost of revenues as a percentage of net revenues to remain relatively consistent with fiscal 2007.

Marketing and
Sales

(1)

See the “Explanatory Note” immediately preceding Part I, Item 1 and Note 2, “Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements,” in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements of this Form 10-K.

Marketing and sales expenses include salaries, dealer and sales commissions, bonus,
travel and facility costs for our marketing, sales, dealer training and support personnel and overhead charges. These expenses also include costs of programs aimed at increasing revenues, such as advertising, trade shows and expositions, and various
sales and promotional programs designed for specific sales channels and end users. Marketing and sales expense from the beginning of fiscal 2007 also includes stock-based compensation expense for stock awards granted to marketing and sales
employees.

The increase of marketing and sales expenses during fiscal 2007, as compared to fiscal 2006, was due primarily to a $55.8
million increase in employee-related costs driven by increased marketing and sales headcount, $41.9 million of stock-based compensation expense under SFAS 123R, and $29.6 million of increased marketing and promotion costs related to product
launches, trade shows, branding, and demand generation. Marketing and sales expense for fiscal 2007 also included $3.8 million in one-time ESPP bonus payments incurred in connection with our voluntary stock option review. Marketing and sales
headcount increased as a result of organic growth as well as the acquisition of Alias.

The increase of marketing and sales expenses during
fiscal 2006, as compared to fiscal 2005, was due primarily to $56.5 million of increased marketing and promotion costs related to product launches, trade shows and branding and $14.3 million of higher employee-related costs reflecting increased
headcount, which were partially offset by a reduction in commissions and bonus accruals, and an increase in information technology costs.

We expect to continue to invest in marketing and sales of our products to develop market opportunities, to promote our competitive position and to strengthen our channel support. As a result, we expect marketing and sales expenses to
continue to be significant, both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues.



Research and Development

(1)

See the “Explanatory Note” immediately preceding Part I, Item 1 and Note 2, “Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements,” in the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements of this Form 10-K.

Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits, and
bonuses for software engineers, fees paid to software development firms and independent contractors, purchased in-process technology, depreciation of computer equipment used in software development and overhead charges. Research and development
expense from the beginning of fiscal 2007 also includes stock-based compensation expense under SFAS 123R for stock awards granted to research and development employees.

The increase in research and development expenses during fiscal 2007, as compared to fiscal 2006, resulted primarily from an increase in wages and salaries driven by an increase in headcount of $55.4 million, the
recognition of $30.1 million of stock-based compensation expense under SFAS 123R and a $7.3 million increase in consulting services and in-process technology purchases from Hanna Strategies. During fiscal 2007, we incurred a total of approximately
$34.3 for consulting services and in-process technology purchases from Hanna Strategies compared to $27.0 million in the prior year. The cost of the in-process technology acquired from Hanna Strategies was immediately recognized as an expense
because the technology had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. During the first quarter of fiscal 2007, we also acquired a 28% ownership interest in Hanna Strategies for cash consideration of $12.5 million.
See Note 16, “Related Parties,” in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of this investment. Research and development expenses for fiscal 2007 also included $3.5 million in one-time ESPP bonus payments incurred
in connection with our voluntary stock option review.

The increase in research and development expenses during fiscal 2006, as compared to
fiscal 2005, resulted primarily from efforts to invest additional resources in certain research and development-related growth initiatives. Employee-related costs increased approximately $19.4 million, reflecting increased headcount, and
professional fees increased approximately $18.3 million in fiscal 2006 as compared to the prior fiscal year. During fiscal 2006, we incurred approximately $27.0 million for consulting services and purchased in-process technology from Hanna
Strategies for our Design Solutions Segment compared to $13.5 million in the prior year. In addition, we recognized $7.9 million of in-process research and development costs in connection with our acquisition of Alias and $1.2 million related to our
acquisition of Colorfront Ltd.

We expect research and development spending will continue to increase in absolute dollars in future periods
as we continue to invest in product development and continue to acquire new technology.

General and Administrative



(1)

See the “Explanatory Note” immediately preceding Part I, Item 1 and Note 2, “Restatement of
Consolidated Financial Statements,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K

.

General and administrative expenses include salaries, benefits, and bonuses for our finance, human resources and legal
personnel as well as amortization expense of customer relationships and trademarks acquired from Alias and Constructware, professional fees for legal and accounting services, litigation costs, and overhead costs. General and administrative expense
from the beginning of fiscal 2007 also includes stock-based compensation expense under SFAS 123R for stock awards granted to general and administrative employees.

The increase in general and administrative expenses from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 was primarily due to the recognition of $16.9 million of stock-based compensation expense and an increase of $7.9 million in
employee-related costs, due primarily to an increase in general and administrative headcount. General and administrative headcount increased as a result of organic growth.

The increase in general and administrative expenses from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 was primarily due to an increase of $12.6 million in information
technology project costs, $8.1 million in employee-related costs, largely resulting from increased headcount, and $2.9 million increase in litigation expenses.

During fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, we incurred significant incremental costs related to our assessment of internal control over financial reporting as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“SOX”). We
estimate that we incurred approximately $2.1 million during 2007, $2.3 million during fiscal 2006, and $6.4 million during fiscal 2005, which included significant project start-up costs. These cost estimates include external consulting and auditing
fees and internal employee costs.

We expect that general and administrative expenses will modestly decline as a percentage of net revenues
in the future yet increase in absolute dollars due to salary increases and continued information technology projects.

Restructuring

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we implemented a restructuring plan involving the
elimination of employee positions and the closure of a number of offices worldwide at a total cost of $27.5 million (“Fiscal 2004 Plan”). This plan was designed to improve efficiencies across the organization, reduce operating expense
levels to help achieve our targeted operating margins and redirect resources to product development, sales development and other critical areas. The actions approved under the Fiscal 2004 Plan were completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005.

During the second quarter of fiscal 2002, the Board of Directors approved a formal restructuring plan that included employee terminations
and the closure of certain facilities worldwide (“Fiscal 2002 Plan”). The remaining outstanding liabilities under this plan relate to ongoing lease termination costs for outstanding operating lease agreements which began expiring in fiscal
2007 and will continue to expire through fiscal 2015.

During fiscal 2005, we recorded net restructuring charges of $26.7 million, of which
$23.7 million related to the Fiscal 2004 Plan. Of this amount, $19.8 million related to employee termination costs for 316 employees worldwide (186 in the United States and 130 outside the United States) and $3.9 million related to the closure of



facilities. Also, we recorded net restructuring charges of approximately $3.0 million for additional office closure costs originally established under the
fiscal 2002 restructuring plan. Since the office closures in fiscal 2002, there has been a significant downturn in the commercial real estate market, particularly in areas of the United Kingdom where some of the offices are located. As such,
Autodesk is unable to either buy out the remaining lease obligations at favorable amounts or sub-lease the space at amounts previously estimated.

For additional information regarding restructuring reserves, see Note 6, “Restructuring Reserves,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Interest and Other Income, Net

The following table sets forth the components of interest and other
income, net (in millions):

Investment income fluctuates based on average cash and marketable securities balances, average
maturities and interest rates. The increase in interest and investment income, net, during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 reflects proportionately higher interest rate yields and cash balances during the current fiscal year. The increase in
interest and investment income, net, during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 reflects proportionately higher interest rate yields during 2006 when compared with 2005.

During fiscal 2007 we also received a $2.1 million recovery of funds from an escrow account established for a prior acquisition. In addition, our 28%
ownership interest in Hanna Strategies is accounted for under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18, “The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock,” and FASB Interpretation No. 35, “Criteria for
Applying the Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock.” Accordingly, the loss from unconsolidated subsidiary represents our 28% ownership interest in Hanna’s results of operations.

During the second quarter of fiscal 2005, we determined that certain money market fund investments were subject to $2.8 million of Swiss transfer stamp
taxes from the third quarter of fiscal 2001 through the second quarter of fiscal 2005. We determined that this adjustment was not material to previously reported periods.

During the second quarter of 2005, we received a legal proceeding settlement of $2.4 million as part of a court settlement related to legal proceedings with Spatial Corp. During October 2003, Spatial was ordered to
reimburse Autodesk for attorneys’ fees and trial costs.

Provision for income taxes

Autodesk accounts for income taxes and the related accounts under the liability method in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes” (“SFAS 109”). Deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of



assets and liabilities, using enacted rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the basis differences reverse.

Our effective tax rate increased by six percentage points from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007. The increase was primarily the result of non-deductible SFAS
123R expense and a reduction in tax benefits, as a percentage of pre-tax earnings, from the repatriation of certain foreign dividends at a rate lower than the 35% Federal statutory rate under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (“DRD
Legislation”). The DRD Legislation was not available during fiscal 2007.

Our effective tax rate increased by six percentage points
from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006. The increase was primarily the result of a reduction in tax benefits, as a percentage of pre-tax earnings, from (1) the lapse of the statute of limitations, which resulted in the release of tax reserves with
respect to prior tax years, and (2) the repatriation of certain foreign dividends at a rate lower than the 35% Federal statutory rate under the DRD Legislation. The increase to the effective tax rate was also partially offset by an increase in
tax benefits from international profits taxed at rates less than the U.S. Federal statutory rate.

In July 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48,
“Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes – an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109,” which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions. Under FIN 48, companies are required to recognize the benefit from a tax
position only if it is “more likely than not” that the tax position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. FIN 48 clarified how a company would measure the income tax benefits from the tax
positions that are recognized, provides guidance as to the timing of the derecognition of previously recognized tax benefits, and describes the methods for classifying and disclosing the liabilities within the financial statements for any
unrecognized tax benefits. The provisions of FIN 48 are effective as of the beginning of our 2008 fiscal year, with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings. Based on our
assessment, we recorded an increase to opening retained earnings during the first quarter of fiscal 2008 for tax benefits not previously recognized of approximately $26 million as a result of adopting FIN 48.

Our future effective tax rate may be materially impacted by the amount of benefits associated with our foreign earnings which are taxed at rates
different from the Federal statutory rate, research credits, phase out of extraterritorial income exclusion, SFAS 123R, FIN 48, closure of statute of limitations or settlement of tax audits, and changes in tax law.

At January 31, 2007, we had net deferred tax assets of $137.9 million. Realization of these assets is dependent on our ability to generate
approximately $519 million of future taxable income in appropriate tax jurisdictions. We believe that sufficient income will be earned in the future to realize these assets.

For additional information regarding our income tax provision, see Note 4, “Income Taxes,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

See Note 2, “Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements.”



The net of tax impact of the stock-based compensation adjustments in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 was
insignificant. However, we restated our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 31, 2006 to properly reflect Retained Earnings, Common Stock and Deferred Compensation balances as a result of previous period adjustments. Please refer to Note 2.
“Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, we have restated the pro forma expense under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (“SFAS 123”)
in Part II, Item 8, Note 1, “Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements to include these adjustments for the years ended January 31, 2006 and January 31, 2005.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our
primary source of cash is from the sale of our products. Our primary use of cash is payment of our operating costs which consist primarily of employee-related expenses, such as compensation and benefits, as well as general operating expenses for
marketing, facilities and overhead costs. In addition to operating expenses, we also use cash to fund our stock repurchase program and to invest in our growth initiatives through business acquisitions. See further discussion of these items below.

At January 31, 2007, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $777.9 million
and net accounts receivable of $301.3 million. In addition, we also have a U.S. line of credit facility which was established during fiscal 2006. This line of credit permits unsecured short-term borrowings of up to $100 million, which is available
for working capital or other business needs. The credit agreement contains customary covenants which could restrict liens, certain types of additional debt and dispositions of assets if Autodesk fails to maintain its financial covenants. Because the
Company was not current with its reporting obligations under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 during the second half of fiscal 2007, the company was in violation of its financial reporting covenant. Autodesk received a waiver from the
borrowing institution for the period that it was not in compliance with the covenant. Autodesk pays a quarterly commitment fee, ranging between $25,000 and $62,500, to maintain this facility. This facility, which matures in August 2007, had no
borrowings outstanding at January 31, 2007.

Long-term cash requirements for items other than normal operating expenses are
anticipated for the following: development of new software products and incremental product offerings resulting from the enhancement of existing products; financing anticipated growth; the share repurchase program; the acquisition of businesses,
software products, or technologies complementary to our business; and capital expenditures, including the purchase and implementation of internal-use software applications. In addition, $27.2 million of our marketable securities are held in a rabbi
trust under non-qualified deferred compensation plans as of January 31, 2007. See Note 5, “Deferred Compensation,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

Our international operations are subject to currency fluctuations. To minimize the impact of these fluctuations, we use foreign currency option contracts
to hedge our exposure on anticipated transactions and forward contracts to reduce our exposure on firm commitments, primarily certain receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies. Our foreign currency instruments, by policy, have
maturities of less than three months and settle before the end of each quarterly period. The principal currencies hedged during fiscal 2007 were the euro, Swiss franc, Canadian dollar, British pound and Japanese yen. We monitor our foreign exchange
exposures to ensure the overall effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions.



Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes our significant financial contractual obligations at January 31, 2007 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods. This
table excludes amounts already recorded on our balance sheet as current liabilities at January 31, 2007.

(1)

Total does not include contractual obligations recorded on the balance sheet or certain purchase obligations as discussed below.

For the purposes of this table, contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally
binding on Autodesk and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction.

Purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of supplies, services and other goods and services are not included in the table above. We are not able to
determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations, as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. Our purchase orders are based on our current procurement or
development needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons. We do not have significant agreements for the purchase of supplies, services or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected
requirements for three months. We also enter into contracts for outsourced services; however, in most instances, the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts contain clauses allowing for cancellation without
significant penalty. In addition, we have certain software royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products. Royalty expense is generally based on the number of units shipped or a percentage of the underlying
revenue. Royalty expense, included in cost of license and other revenues, was $16.8 million, $12.1 million and $9.2 million in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Principal commitments at January 31, 2007 shown above consist of obligations under operating leases for facilities and computer equipment, IT infrastructure costs, marketing costs and contractual development
costs. Purchase commitments also include $28.8 million related to a termination fee for an outsource application hosting services agreement entered into during fiscal 2006. This fee is reduced as time elapses during the five-year contract period.

The expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual
amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations.

We provide indemnifications of varying scopes and certain guarantees, including limited product warranties. Historically, costs related to these warranties and indemnifications have not been significant, but because potential future costs
are highly variable, we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these guarantees on our future results of operations.

Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangements

Other than operating leases, we do not engage in off-balance sheet financing arrangements or have any variable-interest
entities. As of January 31, 2007 we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.



Stock Compensation

As of January 31, 2007, we maintained two active stock option plans for the purpose of granting stock options to employees and members of Autodesk’s Board of Directors (“Board”): the 2006 Employee
Stock Plan (available only to employees) and the 2000 Directors’ Option Plan (available only to non-employee directors). Additionally, there are eight expired or terminated plans with options outstanding, including the 1996 Stock Plan which was
replaced by the 2006 Employee Stock Plan in March 2006. In connection with our past acquisitions, we have sometimes issued replacement options to employees of the acquired companies. The 2006 Employee Stock Plan reserves 9.65 million shares of
Autodesk common stock, plus the shares that remained available for issuance under the 1996 Stock Plan upon its expiration, for issuance under the plan. The 2006 Employee Stock Plan, which will expire in fiscal year 2009, is limited to grants of
stock options to employees. At January 31, 2007, 8.0 million shares were available for future issuance under this plan.

Our
stock option program is broad-based and designed to promote long-term retention. Essentially all of our employees participate. Approximately 84% of the options we granted during fiscal 2007 were awarded to employees other than our CEO, CFO and the
three other most highly compensated officers for fiscal 2006, which we refer to as our Named Executive Officers. Options granted under our equity plans during fiscal 2007 vest over periods ranging from one to five years and expire within six to ten
years of the date of grant. Options granted prior to fiscal 2006 expire within ten years of the date of grant. Since March 2005, the exercise price of stock options granted was equal to the closing price of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global
Select Market on the grant date. See the “Explanatory Note” immediately preceding Part I, Item 1 and Note 2, “Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form
10-K for further discussion.

All stock option grants to executive officers are made by the Compensation and Human Resources Committee of
the Board of Directors. All members of the Compensation and Human Resources Committee are independent directors, as defined by the listing standards of the NASDAQ Global Select Market. Grants to our non-employee directors are non-discretionary and
are pre-determined by the terms of the 2000 Directors’ Option Plan.

For further information concerning Autodesk’s policies and
procedures regarding the use of stock options, see (a) “Explanatory Note” immediately preceding Part I, Item 1 and Note 2, “Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements of this Form 10-K, (b) “Equity Compensation Plan Information,” and (c) “Compensation Discussion and Analysis” in Part III, Item 11, “Executive Compensation.”

On September 18, 2006, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to certain stock option agreements issued pursuant to any of our stock option
plans where the optionee has terminated or may terminate his or her employment or service with us and whose outstanding options to purchase our common stock would otherwise expire before, or within 30 days after, we become current in our reporting
obligations under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. On November 30, 2006, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to extend the expiration dates of certain stock option agreements which were scheduled to expire on December 12,
2006 and which could not be exercised while we were not current in our reporting obligations with the SEC. Stock-based compensation expense of $10.4 million was recognized in fiscal 2007 as a result of these modifications.

In addition to our stock option plans, our employees are also eligible to participate in Autodesk’s 1998 Employee Qualified Stock Purchase Plan
(“Employee Stock Purchase Plan”, “ESP Plan” or “ESPP”). Eligible employees may purchase shares of Autodesk’s common stock at their discretion using up to 15% of their compensation subject to certain limitations, at
not less than 85% of fair market value as defined in the plan agreement. At January 31, 2007, 18.1 million shares were available for future issuance. This amount will automatically be increased on the first trading day of each fiscal year
by an amount equal to the lesser of 10.0 million shares or 2.0% of the total outstanding shares plus any shares repurchased by Autodesk during the



prior fiscal year. We typically issue shares on March 31 and September 30 of each fiscal year. The provisions of this plan expire during fiscal
2018.

Due to the Company’s voluntary stock option review during fiscal 2007, we were not current with our reporting obligations under
the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 during the second half of fiscal 2007. As a result, we were unable to issue shares under the ESPP during the second half of fiscal 2007. Stock-based compensation expense as a result of the cancellation of the
September 30 purchase of $6.1 million that would have been recognized over future periods was recognized during the third quarter of fiscal 2007. Autodesk issued 0.8 million shares at an average price of $22.46 per share in fiscal 2007,
1.9 million shares at an average price of $17.99 per share in fiscal 2006, and 4.6 million shares at an average price of $5.73 per share in fiscal 2005. On September 18, 2006, Autodesk’s Board of Directors approved an amendment
to the Company’s ESP Plan in response to the Company’s temporary suspension of all contributions to and exercises and purchases under the ESPP while the Company was not current in its reporting obligations under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934. In general, this amendment provided for active participant employees at the time of the suspension to become automatically enrolled in the next offering period, unless they elected not to participate. The Board of Directors also approved a
cash bonus of $8.8 million on September 18, 2006 to non-executive employees currently enrolled in the ESPP at that date. This bonus was designed to approximate the profits employee participants would have made on the scheduled
September 30, 2006 exercise date, had the purchases been made and the shares been sold on the next trading day at close of market.



ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Foreign currency exchange
risk

Our revenues, earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Our risk
management strategy utilizes foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage our foreign currency exposures that exist as part of our ongoing business operations, but such contracts do not extend beyond the current quarter. Contracts are
primarily denominated in euros, Swiss francs, Canadian dollars, British pounds and Japanese yen. We do not enter into any foreign exchange derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

Autodesk utilizes foreign currency option collar contracts to reduce the exchange rate impact on the net revenue of certain anticipated transactions. A
sensitivity analysis performed on our hedging portfolio as of January 31, 2007 indicated that a hypothetical 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar from its value at January 31, 2007 would increase the fair value of our forward exchange and
option contracts by $0.4 million. A hypothetical 10% depreciation of the dollar from its value at January 31, 2007 would increase the fair value of our forward exchange and option contracts by $0.9 million. The results of the sensitivity
analysis performed on our hedging portfolio as of January 31, 2006 indicated that a hypothetical 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar from its value at January 31, 2006 would have increased the fair value of our forward exchange and option
contracts by $5.5 million and a hypothetical 10% depreciation of the dollar from its value at January 31, 2006 would have decreased the fair value of our forward exchange and option contracts by $2.2 million. We do not anticipate any
material adverse impact to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows as a result of these foreign currency forward and option contracts.

Interest rate sensitivity

At January 31, 2007, we had an investment portfolio of fixed income
securities and short term mutual fund balances of $112.0 million. These securities were not subject to interest rate fluctuations. At January 31, 2006, we had an investment portfolio of $90.3 million consisting of fixed income securities and
short term mutual fund balances which were not subject to interest rate fluctuations. The short-term mutual fund balances included $27.2 million at January 31, 2007 and $22.4 million at January 31, 2006 of amounts held in a rabbi
trust under deferred compensation arrangements. See Note 5, “Deferred Compensation,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

We do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio to manage interest rate risk. We place our investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards, as specified in our investment
policy guidelines, which limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue, issuer or type of instrument.

Note 1.

Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Business

Autodesk, Inc. (“Autodesk” or the “Company”) is one of the world’s leading design
software and services companies, offering customers progressive business solutions through powerful technology products and services. The Company helps customers in the building, manufacturing, infrastructure and digital media markets by offering
them solutions that enable them to design and visualize their ideas, and use simulation to experience how they will work in the real world, increasing innovation and competitive advantage. Autodesk software products are sold in over 160 countries,
both directly to customers and through a network of resellers and distributors.

Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Autodesk and its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the amounts reported in Autodesk’s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. On a regular basis, management evaluates these estimates and assumptions. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates.

Examples of significant estimates and assumptions made by management involve the determination of the fair value of stock awards to employees and
directors (See “Employee Stock-Based Compensation” within this Note 1 and Note 3, “Employee and Director Benefit Plans,” for further discussion), the establishment of provisions for bad debts, product returns, the realizability
of deferred tax assets and long-lived assets, goodwill valuation, legal settlement reserves and the adequacy of lease termination and employee termination-related restructuring accruals.

Foreign Currency Translation

The
assets and liabilities of Autodesk’s foreign subsidiaries are translated from their respective functional currencies into U.S. dollars at the rates in effect at the balance sheet date, and revenue and expense amounts are translated at weighted
average rates during the period. Foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded as other comprehensive income.

Gains and losses
realized from foreign currency transactions, those transactions denominated in currencies other than the foreign subsidiary’s functional currency, are included in interest and other income, net.

Forward Foreign Exchange Contracts (“Forwards”) and Option Contracts (“Options”)

Autodesk hedges a portion of its European, Asian and Canadian currency exposures in certain receivables and payables as well as certain anticipated cash
flows denominated in foreign currencies using forwards and options. These foreign currency instruments by policy have maturities of less than three months.



AUTODESK, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

In accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities” (“SFAS 133”), Autodesk recognizes all derivative instruments on the balance sheet at fair value. The accounting for gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value of derivative instruments will depend upon the use
of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting under SFAS 133.

The costs of forwards are amortized on a
straight-line basis over the life of the contract to interest and other income, net, while option premiums are expensed within the quarter due to the short-term life of the options.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Autodesk
considers all highly liquid investments with insignificant interest rate risk and original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value.

Marketable Securities

Marketable
securities are stated at fair value. Marketable securities maturing within one year that are not restricted are classified as current assets.

Autodesk determines the appropriate classification of its marketable securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates such classification as of each balance sheet date. Autodesk classifies all of its marketable securities as
available-for-sale and carries such securities at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported in stockholders’ equity until disposition or maturity. For additional information, see Note 14, “Financial
Instruments.”

Accounts Receivable, Net

Accounts receivable, net consisted of the following as of January 31:

Allowances for uncollectible trade receivables are based upon historical loss patterns, the number
of days that billings are past due and an evaluation of the potential risk of loss associated with problem accounts.

The product returns
and other reserves are based on historical experience of actual product returns, estimated channel inventory levels, the timing of new product introductions, channel sell-in for applicable markets and other factors.

Concentration of Credit Risk

Autodesk places its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities with and in the custody of financial institutions with high credit standing and, by policy, limits the amounts invested with any one institution, type of security and
issuer. Approximately 26% and 40% of Autodesk’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and



AUTODESK, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

marketable securities were held with financial institutions in the United States at January 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Cash held in the Other
Americas; Europe, Middle East and Africa; and Asia/Pacific regions accounted for 2%, 48% and 24% of total consolidated cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, respectively, at January 31, 2007. Cash held in the Other Americas; Europe,
Middle East and Africa; and Asia/Pacific regions accounted for 4%, 35% and 21% of total consolidated cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, respectively, at January 31, 2006.

Autodesk’s accounts receivable are derived from sales to a large number of resellers, distributors and direct customers in the Americas; Europe,
Middle East and Africa; and Asia/Pacific regions. Autodesk performs ongoing evaluations of its customers’ financial condition and limits the amount of credit extended when deemed necessary, but generally requires no collateral. Tech Data
Corporation, including its affiliates, accounted for 16% and 13% of gross accounts receivable at January 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. In fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, total sales to Tech Data Corporation, including its affiliates, accounted
for 12%, 11% and 12% of Autodesk’s consolidated net revenues, respectively. The majority of the net revenue from sales to Tech Data relates to Autodesk’s Design Solutions Segment.

Inventories

Inventories consisted of
the following as of January 31:



Raw materials and finished goods, net

Inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost (determined on the first-in, first-out
method) or market. Autodesk evaluates quantities on hand and estimates excess and obsolete inventory for purposes of establishing necessary reserves.

Computer Equipment, Software, Furniture and Leasehold Improvements, Net

Computer equipment, software
and furniture are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from two to five years. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful
life or the lease term. Depreciation expense was $31.0 million in fiscal 2007, $33.8 million in fiscal 2006 and $36.2 million in fiscal 2005.

Computer equipment, software, furniture, leasehold improvements and the related accumulated depreciation at January 31 were as follows:



AUTODESK, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Costs incurred for computer software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized for application development activities, if material, and
immediately expensed for preliminary project activities and post-implementation activities. These capitalized costs are amortized over the expected useful life of the software, which is generally three years.

Software Development Costs

Software
development costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility are included in research and development expenses. Autodesk defines establishment of technological feasibility as the completion of a working model. Software
development costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility through the period of general market availability of the products are capitalized and generally amortized over a one year period, if material. Autodesk had no
capitalized software development costs at January 31, 2007 and January 31, 2006.

Purchased Technologies, Net

Purchased technologies are amortized over the estimated economic life of the product, which ranges from one to seven years. Amortization expense, which
is included as a component of cost of revenues, was $12.9 million in fiscal 2007, $8.2 million in fiscal 2006 and $15.7 million in fiscal 2005.

Purchased technologies and related accumulated amortization at January 31 were as follows:

The weighted average amortization period for purchased technologies acquired during fiscal 2007

Expected future amortization expense for purchased technologies for each of the fiscal years ended thereafter is as
follows:

Goodwill

Goodwill consists of the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations accounted for as purchases. Autodesk assigns goodwill to the segment associated with each business
combination. As required under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 “Goodwill and Other



AUTODESK, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Intangible Assets,” Autodesk no longer amortizes goodwill but instead tests it for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more often if and when
circumstances indicate potential impairment. When assessing goodwill for impairment, Autodesk uses discounted cash flow models which include assumptions regarding projected cash flows. Variances in these assumptions could have a significant impact
on the conclusion as to whether goodwill assets are impaired or the amount of the impairment charge. Impairment charges, if any, result from instances where the fair value of net assets associated with goodwill are less than their carrying values.
There was no impairment of goodwill during the year ended January 31, 2007.

The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill during the
years ended January 31, 2007 and 2006 are as follows:

Purchase accounting adjustments reflect revisions made to the Company’s preliminary purchase
price allocation during fiscal 2007.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

At least annually or more frequently as circumstances dictate, Autodesk assesses the recoverability of its long-lived assets by comparing the undiscounted
net cash flows associated with such assets against their respective carrying values. Impairment, if any, is based on the excess of the carrying value over the fair value. There was no impairment of long-lived assets during the year ended
January 31, 2007.

In addition to the recoverability assessments, Autodesk routinely reviews the remaining estimated useful lives of
its long-lived assets. Any reduction in the useful life assumption will result in increased depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter when such determinations are made, as well as in subsequent quarters.

Deferred Tax Assets

Deferred tax
assets arise primarily from net operating losses including stock option deductions taken in fiscal years prior to fiscal 2007, as well as tax credits, reserves and deductible temporary differences offset by the establishment of U.S. deferred tax
liabilities on unremitted earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries and taxable temporary differences for purchased technologies and capitalized software. They are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in
which those temporary differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce gross deferred tax assets to the amount “more likely than not” expected to be realized in accordance with SFAS 109.



AUTODESK, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Employee Stock-Based Compensation

In
December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, “Share-Based Payment,” (“SFAS 123R”), which replaced Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (“SFAS 123”) and
superseded Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 (“APB 25”). SFAS 123R requires the measurement of all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, using a fair-value based method and the
recording of such expense in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income. In March 2005, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, “Share-Based Payment” (“SAB 107”), which provides interpretive guidance
related to the interaction between SFAS 123R and certain SEC rules and regulations, as well as provides the SEC staff’s views regarding the valuation of share-based payment arrangements.

Autodesk adopted SFAS 123R using the modified prospective transition method, which requires the application of the accounting standard as of
February 1, 2006, the first day of the Company’s fiscal 2007 year. The Company’s consolidated financial statements for fiscal year 2007 reflect our adoption of SFAS 123R. In accordance with the modified prospective transition method,
the Company’s consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been revised for, and do not include, compensation expense calculated under SFAS 123R.

SFAS 123R requires companies to estimate the fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is
recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, the Company accounted for stock-based awards to employees and directors using the intrinsic value
method in accordance with APB 25, as permitted by SFAS 123. Under the intrinsic value method, compensation expense has been recognized in Autodesk’s consolidated financial statements primarily as a result of the Company’s Monthly Date
Selection Process that was applied to stock option grants to non-executive employees during the period July 2000 through February 2005. This process resulted in the granting of stock option awards with exercise prices below the fair market value on
the option measurement date. As of March 2005, the Company no longer follows the Monthly Date Selection Process. See Note 2, “Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements” for further discussion of this matter.

Autodesk uses the Black-Scholes-Merton (“Black-Scholes”) option-pricing model as a method for determining the estimated fair value for employee
stock awards. This is the same option-pricing model used in prior years to calculate pro forma compensation expense under SFAS 123 footnote disclosures. Compensation expense for employee stock awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the
vesting period of the award. The adoption of SFAS 123R also requires certain changes to the accounting for income taxes, the method used in determining diluted shares, the application of a pre-vesting forfeiture rate against both pre- and
post-adoption grants, and additional disclosure related to the cash flow effects resulting from share-based compensation. The relevant interpretive guidance of SAB 107 was applied in connection with the Company’s implementation and adoption of
SFAS 123R.

The following table summarizes the impact of adopting SFAS 123R on stock-based compensation
expense related to employee stock options and employee stock purchases for fiscal 2007, which was recorded as follows:

The weighted average grant date fair value of stock options granted during fiscal 2007 was $13.25
per share. As of January 31, 2007, $87.5 million of total compensation cost related to non-vested stock option awards not yet recognized is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.65 years. The weighted average estimated
fair value of shares granted under the ESP Plan was $12.21 per share for fiscal 2007.

Autodesk uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model
to estimate the fair value of stock option awards and the fair value of awards under the ESP Plan based on the following assumptions:

Autodesk estimates expected volatility for options granted under the Company’s stock option
plans and ESP Plan awards based on two measures. One is a measure of historical volatility in the trading market for the Company’s common stock, and the second is the implied volatility of traded forward call options to purchase shares of the
Company’s common stock. Autodesk uses a third-party valuation services firm to assist in estimating the expected life of options granted under the Company’s stock option plans. In estimating the expected term, both exercise behavior and
post-vesting termination behavior were included in the analysis, as well as consideration of outstanding options. The Company estimates the expected term of share purchases under the ESP Plan based upon each future scheduled purchase date. Effective
after the dividend on the Company’s common stock for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, which was paid in April 2006, Autodesk discontinued



AUTODESK, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

payment of cash dividends. Autodesk does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, an expected dividend yield of zero
is used in the Black-Scholes option valuation model. The risk- free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes option valuation model for options granted under the Company’s stock option plans and ESP Plan awards is the historical yield on U.S.
Treasury securities with equivalent remaining terms. In addition to the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes pricing model, SFAS 123R requires that the Company recognize expense only for the awards that are ultimately expected to vest. Therefore
Autodesk is required to develop an estimate of the number of awards expected to cancel prior to vesting (“forfeiture rate”). The forfeiture rate is estimated based on historical pre-vest cancellation experience, and is applied to all
share-based awards. Autodesk estimates forfeitures at the time of grant and revises those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Prior to fiscal year 2007, Autodesk accounted for forfeitures as they
occurred.

During the third quarter of fiscal 2006, Autodesk revised its approach to estimating expected volatility on its stock awards
granted during the quarter. Expected volatility is one of several assumptions in the Black-Scholes model used by Autodesk to make an estimate of the fair value of options granted under the Company’s stock plans and the rights to purchase shares
under the employee stock purchase plan. Prior to the third quarter of fiscal 2006, Autodesk estimated expected volatility solely based on historical stock volatility. Under its current method of estimating expected volatility, Autodesk has
considered both the historical volatility in the trading market for its common stock as well as the implied volatility of tradable forward call options to purchase shares of its common stock. The Company believes this approach results in a better
estimate of expected volatility.

The following table illustrates the pro forma effect on net income and net income per share if Autodesk
had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R to stock-based employee compensation in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005:

The weighted average estimated fair value of stock options granted was $13.45 per share for fiscal

The weighted average estimated fair values were derived from use of the Black–Scholes model with the following assumptions:

See Note 3, “Employee and Director Benefit Plans,” for further discussion of
Autodesk’s stock-based compensation plans.

Revenue Recognition

Autodesk recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the price is fixed or
determinable, and collection is probable. Autodesk’s revenue recognition policies are in compliance with the provisions of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants’ Statement of Position 97-2, “Software Revenue
Recognition” (“SOP 97-2”) as amended, and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, “Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements.”

For multiple element arrangements that include software products, Autodesk allocates the sales price among each of the deliverables using the residual method, under which revenue is allocated to undelivered elements
based on their vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) of fair value. VSOE is the price charged when an element is sold separately or a price set by management with the relevant authority. If Autodesk does not have VSOE of the
undelivered element, revenue recognition is deferred on the entire sales arrangement until all elements are delivered. Revenue recognition for significant lines of business are discussed further below

Autodesk’s assessment of likelihood of collection is also a critical element in determining the timing of revenue recognition. If collection is not
probable, the revenue will be deferred until the earlier of when collection is deemed probable or cash is received.

License and other
revenues are comprised of two components: (1) all forms of product license revenue and (2) other revenue:

All
Forms of Product License Revenue

Product license revenue includes: software license revenue from the sale of new seats and
upgrades, product revenue for Advanced Systems sales wherein software is bundled with hardware components, and revenue from Autodesk Buzzsaw on-demand collaboration software and service. Revenues from upgrades are generated under the Autodesk
Upgrade Program. Autodesk’s existing customers who are using a currently supported version of a product can upgrade to the latest release of the product by paying a separate fee at the time of upgrade that is based on the number of versions
being upgraded. An existing customer also has the option to upgrade to a discipline-specific or 3D product, which generally has a higher price, for a premium fee; we refer to this as a crossgrade.



AUTODESK, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Autodesk’s product license revenues from distributors and resellers are generally recognized at the time title to Autodesk’s
product passes to the distributor or reseller, provided all other criteria for revenue recognition are met. Autodesk establishes reserves for product returns based on historical experience of actual product returns, estimated channel inventory
levels, the timing of new product introductions, channel sell-in for applicable markets and other factors. These reserves are recorded as a direct reduction of revenue and accounts receivable at the time the related revenue is recognized.

Other Revenue

Other revenues include revenues from consulting, training, Autodesk Developers Network and Advanced Systems customer support Customer consulting and training revenues are recognized over time, as the services are
performed.

Maintenance Revenue

Maintenance revenues consist of revenues from the Company’s Subscription Program. Under this program, customers are eligible to
receive unspecified upgrades when-and-if-available, downloadable training courses and optional on-line support. Autodesk recognizes revenues from its Subscription Program ratably over the subscription contract periods.

Shipping and Handling Costs

Shipping
and handling costs are included in cost of revenues for all periods presented.

Advertising Expenses

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Total advertising expenses incurred were $21.8 million in fiscal 2007, $26.2 million in fiscal 2006 and $14.8
million in fiscal 2005.

Net Income Per Share

Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed using the combination of the dilutive effect of stock
options and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Autodesk has no potentially dilutive securities other than stock options.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In September 2006, the SEC staff released Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108,
“Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements When Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements” (“SAB 108”) which provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior
year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement. We applied the provisions of SAB 108 using the cumulative effect transition method in connection with the preparation of our annual financial statements for the year
ended January 31, 2007. The adoption of SAB 108 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans — an amendment of FASB
Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R)” (“SFAS 158”). This Statement requires recognition of the funded status of a benefit plan in the statement of financial position. The Standard also requires recognition in other comprehensive
income of certain gains and losses that arise during the period but are deferred under pension accounting rules, as well as



AUTODESK, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

modifies the timing of reporting and adds certain disclosures. SFAS 158 provides recognition and disclosure elements to be effective as of the end of the
fiscal year after December 15, 2006 and measurement elements to be effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008. Autodesk adopted the recognition and disclosure elements of the Statement which did not have a material effect on
the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, Autodesk adopted the measurement elements of SFAS 158 as of February 1, 2007, the beginning of its fiscal year 2008. The adoption of the
measurement elements of SFAS 158 did not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In September 2006, the FASB also issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS 157”), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for
measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 does not require any new fair value measurements but instead is intended to eliminate inconsistencies with respect to this topic found in various other accounting
pronouncements. This Statement is effective for Autodesk’s 2009 fiscal year, including interim periods within our 2009 fiscal year. Autodesk does not believe the adoption of SFAS 157 will have a material effect on its consolidated financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.

In July 2006, the FASB issued FIN 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes—an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109,” which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions. Under FIN 48, companies are required to recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is “more likely
than not” that the tax position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. FIN 48 clarified how a company would measure the income tax benefits from the tax positions that are recognized, provides
guidance as to the derecognition of previously recognized tax benefits and describes the methods for classifying and disclosing the liabilities within the financial statements for any unrecognized tax benefits. The provisions of FIN 48 are effective
as of the beginning of the Company’s 2008 fiscal year, with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings. Based on the Company’s assessment, Autodesk recorded an
increase to opening retained earnings during the first quarter of fiscal 2008 for tax benefits not previously recognized of approximately $26 million as a result of adopting FIN 48.

In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155, “Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments” (“SFAS 155”). This
Statement amends Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (“SFAS 133”) and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 140, “Accounting
for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities” (“SFAS 140”). SFAS 155 simplifies the accounting for certain derivatives embedded in other financial instruments by allowing them to be accounted for
as a whole if the holder elects to account for the whole instrument on a fair value basis. SFAS 155 also clarifies and amends certain other provisions of SFAS 133 and SFAS 140. The provisions of SFAS 155 are effective as of the beginning of
Autodesk’s 2008 fiscal year. The adoption of SFAS 155 did not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Reclassifications

Certain
reclassifications have been made to fiscal 2006 amounts to conform to the fiscal 2007 presentation

.

Autodesk reclassified $8.1 million in marketable securities on its Consolidated Balance Sheet at January 31, 2006. This amount was
originally classified as a non-current asset, included in “Other assets,” but was subsequently reclassified as a current asset and included in “Marketable securities.” The reclassification resulted from Autodesk’s
determination that amounts originally classified as non-current marketable securities were current, available-for-sale marketable securities.

Note 2.     Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements

In this Form 10-K,
Autodesk is restating its consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2006, the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the fiscal years ended January 31, 2006 and January 31,
2005 and each of the quarters in fiscal 2006 as a result of a voluntary review of Autodesk’s historical stock option granting practices and related accounting issues.

Previously filed annual reports on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q prior to fiscal 2007 have been affected by the restatements, have not
been amended and should not be relied on.

Introduction

On August 17, 2006, Autodesk announced that the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors was conducting a voluntary review of Autodesk’s
historical stock option granting practices and related accounting issues. On February 27, 2007, Autodesk announced the key results of the voluntary review, which were set forth in the Form 8-K filed on that date.

The Audit Committee engaged independent outside legal counsel, Hogan & Hartson LLP, who, with the assistance of forensic accounting experts,
PricewaterhouseCoopers, reviewed the facts and circumstances surrounding approximately 230 separate stock option grant approvals made between January 1988 and August 2006, or the “relevant period.” During the course of the voluntary
review, more than 700,000 documents were reviewed and interviews with over 40 current and former employees, directors and advisors were conducted. In February 2007, the Audit Committee completed its review and presented its final report to
Autodesk’s Board of Directors.

The following is a summary of the key findings of the Audit Committee:

•

Throughout the relevant period, numerous administrative errors were made in the processing of option grants resulting in options being accounted for incorrectly;

•

Between July 2000 and February 2005, the Company made monthly broad-based employee grants pursuant to authority delegated by the Board to the CEO, where the grant
dates for most of these broad based grants were selected by an administrative process to coincide with low trading prices during the month of the applicable grant;

•

During the calendar year 1992:

•

a broad-based employee grant that included a grant to the Company’s then-CFO and then-General Counsel were measured on an incorrect date; and

•

the new hire grant to the then-incoming CEO was measured on an incorrect date;

•

There was no evidence that any officer or director backdated any stock option granted to himself or herself;

•

Based on the evidence developed during the review, the Audit Committee concluded that it was unlikely that those involved in the decisions and actions that resulted
in measurement date errors understood the accounting impact of their actions or that they intended to misstate our financial statements; and

•

There was no evidence of any measurement date error involving any stock option grant made to a person serving as a director.



AUTODESK, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The Company had progressively, substantially and voluntarily improved its employee stock-based
compensation grant process prior to 2006, before the intense regulatory and media focus on stock option grant practices began, and no Company employees or officers who may have made discretionary determinations that resulted in measurement date
errors in the past has any continuing role relating to the distribution, administration or accounting for stock-based compensation.

As a result of the findings of the voluntary review, the Board of Directors has concluded, upon the recommendation of management and the Audit Committee, that the consolidated balance sheets as of January 31, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005 and
2006, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the fiscal years ended January 31, 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006, should no longer be relied upon. As a result, we are restating our
previously-issued financial statements for fiscal years 2003 through 2006, inclusive, to correct errors related to accounting for total stock-based compensation expense.

The pre-tax, non-cash charges to be restated are an aggregate $34.8 million for stock-based compensation expense over the 18-year period of the review through fiscal 2006. Approximately $21.7 million of the restated
amounts apply to the income statements for fiscal years 2003 through 2006, inclusive, and the remainder, which is applicable to prior fiscal years, has been recorded as a charge to retained earnings as of January 31, 2002. Such charges have the
effect of decreasing net income and, correspondingly, retained earnings as reported in our historical financial statements. The net of tax impact of the stock-based compensation adjustments in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 were insignificant.
However, Autodesk restated its Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 31, 2006 to properly reflect Retained Earnings, Common Stock and Deferred Compensation balances as a result of previous period adjustments.

During the period of the voluntary stock option review, Autodesk also identified that it had incorrectly recorded certain credits to resellers. As a
result, adjustments were made to increase net revenues and decrease deferred revenue by $14.0 million in fiscal 2006 and $5.1 million in fiscal 2005. These adjustments, which have the effect of increasing net income and, correspondingly, retained
earnings, are described in more detail below.

This Form 10-K reflects the restatement of our consolidated balance sheet as of
January 31, 2006, the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the fiscal years ended January 31, 2006 and 2005, and each of the quarters in fiscal 2006.

This Form 10-K also reflects the restatement of “Selected Consolidated Financial Data” in Item 6 for the fiscal years ended
January 31, 2006, 2005, 2004 and 2003, and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2006 and 2005.

Previously filed annual reports on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q prior to fiscal 2007 have been affected by the restatements, have not
been amended, and should not be relied on.

In connection with the restatement of our consolidated financial statements, we applied
judgment in determining whether to revise measurement dates for prior option grants. In addition, if we determined that a measurement date needed to be revised, judgment was applied in determining the appropriate measurement date.

In addition, we have restated the pro forma expense under SFAS 123 in Part II, Item 8, Note 1, “Business and Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements to include these adjustments for the years ended January 31, 2006 and 2005.

All references to the number of option shares, option exercise prices, and share prices in this section have been adjusted for any subsequent stock splits.

Stock Option Grant Process

Pursuant
to our non-director stock plans, our Board of Directors has the authority to grant options or delegate this authority to a committee. For portions of the relevant period, the right to grant options under our stock plans to all employees other than
non-employee directors was delegated to the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors or to the chief executive officer, or CEO, as a committee of one. Executive officer option grants were generally approved by the Compensation Committee
during regularly scheduled Compensation Committee meetings, although a small number were approved by unanimous written consent. Option grants by the CEO to all other employees were generally done on a monthly basis by written consent during the
period between December 1995 and August 2006.

Accounting Adjustments

Consistent with the applicable accounting literature and recent guidance from the SEC staff, we organized the 230 separate stock option grant approvals,
totaling approximately 46,300 individual grants, made during the relevant period into categories based on grant type and the processes by which the grant approval was finalized. We analyzed the evidence from the Audit Committee’s review related
to each category including, but not limited to, physical documents, electronic documents, underlying electronic data about documents, and witness interviews. Based on the relevant facts and circumstances, we applied the then appropriate accounting
standards to determine, for every grant within each category, the proper measurement date. If the measurement date was not the originally assigned grant date, accounting adjustments were made as required, resulting in stock-based compensation
expense and related tax effects. After accounting for forfeitures, Autodesk has recognized stock-based compensation expense of $34.8 million on a pre-tax basis over the vesting terms for the affected grants. No adjustments were required for the
remaining grants. The adjustments were determined by category as follows:

Monthly Date Selection Process Grants—For the period
between July 2000 and February 2005, Autodesk generally followed an administrative process for monthly broad based employee grants that resulted in the selection of effective grant dates that were prior in time to the final preparation of action by
written consent for such grants (the “Monthly Date Selection Process Grants”). Usually, the grant dates selected by this process were chosen later in the same calendar month in which the applicable actions by written consent were signed
and were dates prior in time to the final preparation of such written consents to coincide with low trading prices during the month of the applicable grant. Based on the voluntary review, the Company determined that the measurement dates for
approximately 12,000 individual grants of the approximate total 18,500 individual grants made to broad based employees pursuant to delegated authority must be revised because the grant dates selected by the administrative process were prior in time
to the final approval of such grants. For these grants, based upon the available evidence the Company chose as the measurement date the date upon which the terms of the specific monthly broad based employee grant was determined to be fixed and
unchangeable. Accordingly, Autodesk has recognized a pre-tax stock-based compensation expense of $23.1 million for such grant approvals using the intrinsic value method of accounting under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 (“APB
25”).

1992 New-Hire Grant to Incoming CEO—In May 1992, the Compensation Committee approved a grant to the Company’s
then-incoming CEO that was measured on an incorrect date. The measurement date used was April 7, 1992, the date the Company and the incoming CEO had reached a business agreement on most of the terms of her employment agreement, including the
number of stock options to be granted. However, discussions thereafter continued regarding other important matters, including the structure of, and exercise price for, her stock option grant. The essential terms of the option grant, the grant price,
number of options and date of grant, were presented to the Board on April 27, 1992, and approved by the Compensation Committee on May 4, 1992. In connection with the grant to the then-incoming CEO, both parties were represented by counsel.
Autodesk has recognized pre-tax stock-based compensation expense of $3.3 million from this grant based on a revised measurement date of May 4, 1992 using the intrinsic value method of accounting under APB 25.



AUTODESK, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Anomalous Add Grants—Based on the voluntary review, the Audit Committee found that in certain
instances, additions or error corrections were made to the details of grants that had already been approved by the CEO without obtaining additional approval (the “Anomalous Add Grants”). For the period between December 1995 and August 2006
when the CEO delegated authority to grant options, 420 of approximately 37,100 individual option grants were considered to be Anomalous Add Grants, for a total error rate of 1.1%, with 98% of Anomalous Add Grants occurring prior to fiscal 2003.
Based on the voluntary review, management determined that the measurement dates for the related individual option grants must be revised. Accordingly, Autodesk has recognized pre-tax stock-based compensation expense of $3.1 million from such grants
using the intrinsic value method of accounting under APB 25.

Termination Issues—During the relevant period, two former executives and
34 employees were permitted to vest in (and subsequently exercise) stock options to purchase an aggregate of approximately 1.4 million shares of common stock for a period of time beyond what they were otherwise entitled to exercise under their
original stock option agreement. In most cases, vesting was extended for a period of time after the termination date and, thus, should have resulted in accounting consequences. For the 34 employees, it appears that these cases were most likely due
to administrative error. Based on the voluntary review, management determined that the accounting for the related option grants must be revised and Autodesk has recognized pre-tax stock-based compensation expense of $2.3 million from such grants
using the intrinsic value method of accounting under APB 25.

Board-Authorized Grant—In 1992, the Board approved a broad-based
employee grant, which included a grant to the Company’s then-CFO and then General Counsel, that involved a measurement date error. The error was caused by the Company’s use of the date on which the Board approved the general scope and
nature of a special one-time grant to certain employees as the measurement date, rather than the date on which the specific grantees and grant amounts were finalized and approved by the Board. In addition, in 1991, the Board approved a broad-based
employee grant with an exercise price less than the fair market value on the date of grant. Accordingly, Autodesk has recognized pre-tax stock-based compensation expense of $2.4 million from these grants.

Compensation Committee Grants—From 1997 through 2000: (i) two individual option grants do not appear to have any evidence of Compensation
Committee approval or authorization; (ii) four additional individual option grants appear to have been ratified at a date subsequent to the original grant date; and (iii) the original measurement date of one additional option grant
approved by a Unanimous Written Consent of the Compensation Committee appears to have been made more than a reasonable period of time prior to final approval of the grant for accounting purposes. Based on the voluntary review, management determined
that the measurement dates for the related option grants must be revised. Accordingly, Autodesk has recognized pre-tax stock-based compensation expense of $0.6 million from these seven grants.

Judgment

In light of the judgment
used in establishing revised measurement dates, alternate approaches to those used by the Company’s management could have resulted in different compensation expense charges than those recorded in the restatement. The Company’s management
considered various alternative approaches.

For Monthly Date Selection Process Grants, where for certain of the grants there was no evidence
to suggest a particular single date was the appropriate measurement date, Company management narrowed the possible measurement date to a range of dates or a grant window. The grant window was approximately four days on average and ranged from one
day to sixteen days. The Company’s management considered which date to use in this range and chose to use the last day of the grant window since the grants appeared to be fixed and unchangeable. We believe the grant date was fixed and
unchangeable on the last day in the grant window because



AUTODESK, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

this was the day the award was communicated. Changing the measurement dates from the last day of the grant window to the highest price during the grant
window would cause the pre-tax compensation charges discussed above to increase by approximately $2.0 million. Changing the measurement dates from the last day of the grant window to the lowest price during the grant window would cause the pre-tax
compensation charges discussed above to decrease by approximately $11.9 million.

For the Anomalous Add Grants, Company management
determined that the measurement date was the date the individual grant was fixed and unchangeable. This was the date by which the award was likely communicated to the employee. Alternatively, we considered the date on which the employee and relevant
grant information were added to the grant list. However, because that date did not necessarily represent a date that the award was either approved or communicated to the employee, the Company’s management rejected that alternative. We
Company’s management believes the grant was fixed and unchangeable on the last day in the grant window because this was the day the award was communicated. Changing the measurement dates for the Anomalous Add Grants from the date upon which the
terms of the grant were likely communicated to the employee to the date when the grant information was likely added to the grant list would cause the pre-tax compensation charges discussed above to decrease by approximately $1.3 million. Changing
the measurement dates for the Anomalous Add Grants from the date upon which the terms of the award were likely communicated to the employee to the highest price in the grant window would cause the pre-tax compensation charges to increase by
approximately $2.3 million.

The Company’s management believes that the approaches used for each of the categories were the most
appropriate under the circumstances.

Financial Impact of the Restatement

The increase in net revenues and stock-based compensation expense resulting from the restatement is as follows (in millions):

(1)

Includes $2.5 million of payroll tax expenses.



AUTODESK, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The net of tax impact of the stock-based compensation adjustments in the first quarter of fiscal 2007
was insignificant. However, we restated our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 31, 2006 to properly reflect Retained Earnings, Common Stock and Deferred Compensation balances as a result of previous period adjustments. Autodesk has also
restated the pro forma expense under SFAS 123 in Note 1 “Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K to reflect the impact of these adjustments for the years
ended January 31, 2006 and 2005.

As mentioned above, while performing the voluntary stock option review, Autodesk identified that it
had incorrectly recorded certain credits to resellers. Certain credits to resellers for sales of new and renewal maintenance were recognized as a reduction of license and other revenues and maintenance revenues in the period the transaction was
billed. These credits should have been recorded as a reduction of deferred maintenance revenue when the transaction was billed which would have resulted in a reduction to maintenance revenues over the maintenance period. The impact of this
restatement resulted in adjustments to increase net revenues and decrease deferred revenues of $14.0 million in fiscal 2006 and $5.1 million in fiscal 2005.

The adjustments to stock-based compensation, net of related tax effects, as originally reported for annual periods prior to fiscal 2007 are as follows (in millions):

Note 3.     Employee and Director Benefit Plans

Stock Option Plans

As of January 31, 2006, Autodesk maintained two active stock option plans
for the purpose of granting stock options to employees and members of Autodesk’s Board of Directors (the “Board”): the 2006 Employee Stock Plan (available only to employees) and the 2000 Directors’ Option Plan (available only to
non-employee directors). Additionally, there are eight expired or terminated plans with options outstanding, including the 1996 Stock Plan which was replaced by the 2006 Employee Stock Plan in March 2006. In connection with the acquisitions of
various companies, Autodesk has also issued replacement options.

On November 10, 2005, the Company’s stockholders approved a new
stock plan, the 2006 Employee Stock Plan (the “2006 Plan”) as well as amendments to the 2000 Directors’ Option Plan. The 2006 Plan reserves 9.65 million shares of Autodesk common stock, plus 0.22 million shares that remained
available for issuance under the 1996 Stock Plan upon its expiration, for issuance under the plan. At January 31, 2007, 8.0 million shares were available for future issuance. The 2006 Plan will expire in March of fiscal 2009.

The 2000 Directors’ Option Plan, which was approved by the stockholders, allows for an automatic annual grant of options to non-employee members
of Autodesk’s Board of Directors. At January 31, 2007, 0.64 million shares were available for future issuance, all of which were approved by the stockholders on November 10, 2005. The 2000 Directors’ Option Plan will expire
in March of fiscal 2010.

Options granted under the above mentioned plans vest over periods ranging from one to four years and generally
expire within six to ten years from the date of grant. Under the 2006 Plan and the 2000 Directors’ Option Plan, as amended, the option term is limited to no more than six years. From March 2005 through the end of fiscal 2007 the exercise price
of the stock options is equal to the fair market value of the stock on the grant date.

A summary of stock option activity is as follows:

The total pre-tax intrinsic value of options exercised, as of their exercise date, was $127.2
million in fiscal 2007, $341.1 million in fiscal 2006, and $297.0 million in fiscal 2005.



AUTODESK, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The following table summarizes information about options outstanding and exercisable at
January 31, 2007:

(1)

Represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value, based on Autodesk’s closing stock price of $43.75 per share as of January 31, 2007, which would have been received by the
option holders had all option holders exercised their options as of that date.

These options will expire if not exercised at
specific dates ranging through 2016. At January 31, 2007, a total of 26.8 million shares of Autodesk’s common stock have been reserved for future issuance under existing stock option and stock purchase programs.

On September 18, 2006, Autodesk’s Board of Directors approved an amendment to certain stock option agreements issued pursuant to any of the
Company’s stock option plans where the optionee has terminated or may terminate his or her employment or service with the Company and whose outstanding options to purchase Company common stock would otherwise expire before, or within 30 days
after, the Company becomes current in its reporting obligations under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. On November 30, 2006, Autodesk’s Board of Directors approved an amendment to extend the expiration dates of certain stock option
agreements which were scheduled to expire on December 12, 2006 and which could not be exercised while the Company was not current in its reporting obligations with the SEC. Stock-based compensation expense of $10.4 million was recognized in
fiscal 2007 as a result of these modifications.

1998 Employee Qualified Stock Purchase Plan

Under Autodesk’s ESP Plan, which was approved by stockholders in 1998, eligible employees may purchase shares of Autodesk’s common stock at
their discretion using up to 15% of their compensation subject to certain limitations, at not less than 85% of fair market value as defined in the plan agreement. At January 31, 2007, a total of 18.1 million shares were available for
future issuance. This amount will automatically be increased on the first trading day of each fiscal year by an amount equal to the lesser of 10.0 million shares or 2.0% of the total of (1) outstanding shares plus (2) any shares
repurchased by Autodesk during the prior fiscal year. Under the ESPP, the Company issues shares on March 31 and September 30 of each fiscal year. The provisions of this plan expire during fiscal 2018.

Due to the Company’s voluntary stock option review during fiscal 2007, Autodesk was not current with its reporting obligations under the Securities
and Exchange Act of 1934 during the second half of fiscal 2007. As a result, the Company was unable to issue shares under the ESPP during the second half of fiscal 2007. Stock-based compensation expense as a result of the cancellation of the
September 30 purchase of $6.1 million that would have been recognized over future periods was recognized during the third quarter of fiscal 2007. Autodesk issued 0.8 million shares at an average price of $22.46 per share in fiscal 2007,
1.9 million shares at an average



AUTODESK, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

price of $17.99 per share in fiscal 2006, and 4.6 million shares at an average price of $5.73 per share in fiscal 2005. On September 18, 2006,
Autodesk’s Board of Directors approved an amendment to the Company’s ESP Plan in response to the Company’s temporary suspension of all contributions to and exercises and purchases under the ESPP while the Company was not current in
its reporting obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In general, this amendment provided for active participant employees at the time of the suspension to become automatically enrolled in the next offering period, unless they elected
not to participate. The Board of Directors also approved a cash bonus of $8.8 million on September 18, 2006 to non-executive employees currently enrolled in the ESPP at that date. This bonus approximated the profits employee participants would
have made on the scheduled September 30, 2006 exercise date, had the purchases been made and the shares been sold on the next trading day at close of market, and was expensed as $8.8 million of additional compensation expense at the time it was
paid. In addition, previously unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to the ESPP of $6.1 was also recognized at the time bonus was paid.

Equity Compensation Plan Information

The following table summarizes the number of outstanding
options granted to employees and directors, as well as the number of securities remaining available for future issuance under these plans as of January 31, 2006 (number of securities in thousands).

(1)

Included in these amounts are 0.2 million securities available to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options
with a weighted-average

exercise price of $4.04 related to equity compensation plans assumed in connection with
previous business mergers and acquisitions.

(2)

Included in this amount are 18.1 million securities available for future issuance under Autodesk’s ESP Plan.

(3)

Amounts correspond to Autodesk’s Nonstatutory Stock Option Plan, which was terminated by the Board of Directors in December 2004.

Pretax Savings Plan

Autodesk has a
401(k) plan that covers nearly all U.S. employees. Eligible employees may contribute up to 50% of their pretax salary, subject to limitations mandated by the Internal Revenue Service. Autodesk makes voluntary cash contributions and matches a portion
of employee contributions in cash. Autodesk’s contributions were $7.5 million in fiscal 2007, $6.6 million in fiscal 2006 and $6.0 million in fiscal 2005. Autodesk does not allow participants to invest in Autodesk common stock through the
401(k) plan.

Other Plans

Autodesk provides defined contribution plans in certain foreign countries where required by statute. Autodesk’s funding policy for foreign defined contribution plans is consistent with the local requirements in each



AUTODESK, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

country. Autodesk’s contributions to these plans were $7.9 million in fiscal 2007, $5.5 million in fiscal 2006 and $4.7 million in fiscal 2005. Autodesk
also has defined benefit plans in certain foreign countries where required by statute. These plans were not material for disclosure in accordance with the standards of SFAS 158.

In addition, Autodesk offers a non—qualified deferred compensation plan to certain key employees whereby they may defer a portion (or all) of their
annual compensation until retirement or a different date specified by the employee in accordance with terms of the plan. See Note 5, “Deferred Compensation,” for further discussion.

Note 4.    Income Taxes

The
provision for income taxes consists of the following:

(1)

See Note 2, “Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements,” in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Pursuant to SFAS 123R, footnote 82, the Company has not recorded fiscal year 2007 excess stock option tax benefits of $42.3 million to additional paid-in
capital. The amount will be recorded into equity when it reduces cash taxes payable. The tax benefit recognized as a credit to additional paid-in capital associated with dispositions from employee stock plans was $124.6 million in fiscal 2006 and
$112.5 million in fiscal 2005. Foreign pretax income was $354.1 million in fiscal 2007, $276.2 million in fiscal 2006 and $183.5 million in fiscal 2005.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The valuation allowance increased by $5.2 million in fiscal 2007 and decreased by $0.2 million in
fiscal 2006 and $21.4 million in fiscal 2005. During fiscal 2005, Autodesk re-assessed the realizability of certain deferred tax assets related to stock option deductions that had not been previously recognized. As a result of U.S. operating
results, as well as U.S. jurisdictional forecasts of pretax operating results, Autodesk believes these deferred tax assets are realizable based on the “more likely than not” standard required for recognition in accordance with
SFAS 109. Accordingly, during fiscal 2005, the Company reduced the valuation allowance relating to tax benefits of stock option deductions by $18.7 million and credited additional paid in capital by an equal and offsetting amount. As of
January 31, 2005, Autodesk no longer recorded a valuation allowance relating to tax benefits of stock option deductions.

No provision
has been made for Federal income taxes on unremitted earnings of certain of Autodesk’s foreign subsidiaries (cumulatively $319.4 million at January 31, 2007) because Autodesk plans to reinvest such earnings for the foreseeable future. At
January 31, 2007, the unrecognized deferred tax liability for these earnings was approximately $102.3 million.

Realization of the
Company’s net deferred tax assets of $137.9 million is dependent upon the Company generating approximately $519 million of future taxable income in appropriate tax jurisdictions to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences, net
operating loss carryforwards and tax credits. The amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods if estimates of future taxable income are reduced.

Cash payments (refunds) for income taxes were approximately $14.7 million in fiscal 2007, $44.2 million in fiscal 2006 and $16.5 million in fiscal 2005.

As of January 31, 2007, Autodesk had $472.0 million of cumulative Federal tax loss carryforwards and $208.4 million of cumulative
state tax loss carryforwards, which may be available to reduce future income tax liabilities in certain jurisdictions. A portion of these Federal and state carryforwards was acquired through the Company’s previous acquisitions, the utilization
of which is subject to certain limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state tax provisions. These Federal and state tax loss carryforwards will expire beginning fiscal 2008 through fiscal 2028 and fiscal 2009 through fiscal
2024, respectively.

As of January 31, 2007, Autodesk had $41.3 million of cumulative Federal research tax credit carryforwards and
$25.3 million of cumulative California state research tax credit carryforwards, which may be available to reduce future income tax liabilities in the U.S. The Federal credit carryforwards will expire beginning fiscal 2009 through fiscal 2028, and
the state credit carryforwards may reduce future California income tax liabilities indefinitely. Autodesk also has $46.6 million of cumulative foreign tax credit carryforwards, which may be available to reduce future U.S. tax liabilities. The
foreign tax credit will expire beginning fiscal 2015 through fiscal 2018.

Utilization of net operating losses and tax credits may be
subject to an annual limitation due to ownership change limitations provided in the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. This annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization.

As a result of certain business and employment actions and capital investments undertaken by Autodesk, income earned in certain countries
is subject to reduced tax rates through fiscal 2016. The income tax benefits attributable to the tax status of these business arrangements are estimated to be $15.0 million ($0.06 basic net income per share) in fiscal 2007, $31.0 million ($0.14
basic net income per share) in fiscal 2006 and $23.0 million ($0.10 per basic net income per share) in fiscal 2005. The amounts for fiscal years 2006 and 2005 include consideration of incremental tax benefits received from the American Jobs Creation
Act of 2004 (“DRD Legislation”).



AUTODESK, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

During fiscal 2007, Autodesk recognized the following income tax benefits:

•

In December 2006, Congress passed the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 which resulted in the reinstatement of the Federal research and development credit to
the beginning of Autodesk’s fiscal 2007 year. Autodesk recorded an income tax benefit of $5.6 million from this Act during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007.

•

Autodesk also recognized an income tax benefit of $12.5 million related to the lapse of the statute of limitations with respect to certain Federal and foreign tax
years and the release of tax reserves with respect to fiscal 2003, offset by one-time income tax expense of $3.0 million primarily associated with the expiration of a capital loss carryforward.

During fiscal 2006, Autodesk recognized the following income tax items:

•

Autodesk repatriated approximately $512 million of foreign earnings under the DRD Legislation, which resulted in the reclassification of $12.6 million of Federal
deferred taxes to current taxes payable relating to the repatriation of prior year foreign earnings and the accrual of $11.6 million of current Federal taxes relating to the repatriation of current year foreign earnings.

•

Autodesk recognized an income tax benefit of $12.5 million relating to the DRD Legislation. Of this amount, $10.6 million related to foreign withholding taxes
previously accrued which were no longer due as part of the repatriation of foreign earnings under the DRD Legislation, and $1.9 million related to an Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) technical correction of the DRD Legislation.

•

As a result of the Company’s resolution and closure of its Franchise Tax Board (“FTB”) audits for fiscal 2000 and 2001, as well as the closure and
lapse of the statute of limitations with respect to certain Federal and foreign tax years, Autodesk recognized income tax benefits of approximately $10.0 million.

During fiscal 2005, Autodesk recognized the following tax items:

•

Autodesk recognized an income tax benefit of $15.5 million relating to the DRD Legislation. This DRD Legislation, which was signed into law during the third quarter
of fiscal 2005 as part of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, allowed for the repatriation of certain foreign dividends at a rate lower than the 35% Federal statutory rate. Because Autodesk believed that it would be able to repatriate foreign
earnings under this DRD Legislation, the deferred tax liability which was previously accrued on prior year foreign earnings was reduced, which resulted in a $15.5 million income tax benefit. This income tax benefit related to the difference between
the taxes previously accrued on the earnings of a foreign subsidiary at the Federal statutory tax rate and the lower rate afforded under the new DRD Legislation.

•

As a result of the Company’s resolution and closure of its IRS audit for fiscal 2001 as well as the closure of certain state and foreign tax years, and the
lapse of the statute of limitations with respect to certain Federal, state, and foreign tax years, Autodesk recognized an income tax benefit of approximately $8.9 million during fiscal 2005.

•

Also during fiscal 2005, following certain business changes, Autodesk completed an internal reorganization of the ownership of Autodesk Canada. As a result of the
reorganization, Autodesk believed that it would be able to claim U.S. tax deductions for the remaining unamortized portion of the purchase price from the March 1999 acquisition of Discreet (now Autodesk Canada). The amount of the potential deferred
tax asset arising from this reorganization was approximately $96 million, reflecting future U.S. tax amortization deductions of goodwill and other intangible assets. Autodesk determined that, at the present time, it is not probable that these tax
benefits will be realized and



AUTODESK, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

accordingly has not yet recognized these benefits. Instead, the tax benefits arising from this reorganization will be recognized if and when the tax
treatment is verified with tax authorities or such other factors occur that would permit recognition. However, the Company has determined that a portion of these unrecognized tax benefits will be recognized in connection with the Company’s
analysis of the effect of FIN 48 as of the beginning of fiscal 2008. As a result of the adoption of FIN 48, Autodesk will record $19.5 million of unrecognized tax benefits related to the aforementioned reorganization, with a corresponding increase
in the beginning balance of retained earnings as of February 1, 2008. See Note 1, “Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” for further discussion of FIN 48.

Note 5.    Deferred Compensation

At January 31, 2007, Autodesk had marketable securities totaling $112.0 million, of which $27.2 million related to investments in debt and equity securities that are held in a rabbi trust under non-qualified deferred compensation
plans. The value of debt and equity securities held in the rabbi trust at January 31, 2006 was $22.4 million. The total related deferred compensation liability was $27.2 million at January 31, 2007, of which $12.5 million was
classified as current and $14.7 million was classified as non-current liabilities. The total related deferred compensation liability at January 31, 2006 was $22.4 million of which $14.3 million was classified as current and $8.1 million was
classified as non-current liabilities. The current and non-current portions of the liability are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets under “Accrued compensation” and “Other liabilities,” respectively.

Note 6.    Restructuring Reserves

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, management approved a restructuring plan directly resulting from the Alias acquisition that involved the elimination of employee positions, facilities and fixed assets of Alias (“Alias
Restructuring Plan”). Total estimated cost of the Alias Restructuring Plan was $11.1 million. The total restructuring reserve established for this plan was reflected as an adjustment to the total purchase price consideration of the Alias
acquisition. The Alias Restructuring Plan was established in accordance with EITF 95-3. Therefore, the utilization from this reserve will not be reflected as a restructuring expense but instead reflected as a reduction of this reserve.
Substantially all actions required of this plan were completed by the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007. During the third quarter of fiscal 2007, Autodesk recorded an adjustment to decrease the restructuring reserve related to the Alias Restructuring
Plan by $1.7 million because actual costs incurred related to lease and employee terminations were less than what was originally estimated. Autodesk recorded the adjustment as a reduction to the Alias Restructuring Plan reserve and as a
corresponding decrease to goodwill.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, the Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan that
resulted in a reduction of the workforce and the closure of a number of offices worldwide with a total cost of $27.5 million (“Fiscal 2004 Plan”). The remaining outstanding lease termination costs under this plan relate to operating lease
agreements which expire between fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2012.

During the second quarter of fiscal 2002, the Board of Directors approved a
formal restructuring plan that included employee terminations and the closure of certain facilities worldwide (“Fiscal 2002 Plan”). This plan was designed to reduce the Company’s overall operating expense levels. The remaining
outstanding liabilities relate to ongoing lease termination costs for outstanding operating lease agreements expiring between fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2015.

respectively.

An analysis of the Alias Restructuring Plan, Fiscal 2004 Plan and Fiscal 2002 Plan during fiscal 2007 and
fiscal 2006, by reportable segment, is included in Note 13, “Segments.”

Note 7.    Borrowing Arrangements

Autodesk entered into a U.S. credit facility in August 2005. This facility permits unsecured short-term borrowings of up to $100.0 million, which is
available for working capital or other business needs. The credit agreement contains customary covenants which could restrict liens, certain types of additional debt and



AUTODESK, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

dispositions of assets if Autodesk fails to maintain its financial covenants. Because the Company was not current with its reporting obligations under the
Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 during the second half of fiscal 2007, the company was in violation of its financial reporting covenant. Autodesk received a waiver from the borrowing institution for the period that it was not in compliance with
the covenant. Autodesk pays a quarterly commitment fee, ranging between $25,000 and $62,500, to maintain this facility. This facility, which matures in August 2007, had no borrowings outstanding at January 31, 2007.

Note 8.    Commitments and Contingencies

Leases

Autodesk leases office space and computer equipment under noncancellable operating lease agreements. The leases
generally provide that Autodesk pay taxes, insurance and maintenance expenses related to the leased assets. Future minimum lease payments for fiscal years ended January 31 are as follows:

Of these amounts, approximately $6.0 million has been included in Autodesk’s restructuring
accruals at January 31, 2007. Rent expense was $40.6 million in fiscal 2007, $38.0 million in fiscal 2006 and $34.2 million in fiscal 2005.

Purchase commitments

Autodesk, in the normal course of business, enters into various purchase commitments for goods or
services. Total noncancellable purchase commitments as of January 31, 2007 were approximately $37.0 million for periods through fiscal 2008. These purchase commitments primarily result from contracts for the acquisition of IT infrastructure,
marketing and software development services. Of the total purchase commitments, $28.8 million related to a termination fee for an outsource application hosting services agreement entered into during fiscal 2006. This fee is reduced as time
lapses during the five-year contract period.

Autodesk has certain royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of
certain products. Royalty expense is generally based on a dollar amount per unit shipped or a percentage of the underlying revenue. Royalty expense, which was recorded under cost of license and other revenues on Autodesk’s Consolidated
Statements of Income, was $16.8 million, $12.1 million and $9.2 million in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Indemnifications

In the normal course of business, Autodesk provides indemnifications of varying scopes, including limited product warranties and
indemnification of customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of its products or services. Autodesk accrues for known indemnification



AUTODESK, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. Historically, costs related to these indemnifications have not been significant, but because
potential future costs are highly variable, Autodesk is unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnifications on its future results of operations.

In connection with the purchase, sale or license of assets or businesses with third parties, Autodesk has entered into or assumed customary indemnification agreements related to the assets or businesses purchased,
sold or licensed. Historically, costs related to these indemnifications have not been significant, but because potential future costs are highly variable, Autodesk is unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnifications on its
future results of operations.

As permitted under Delaware law, Autodesk has agreements whereby it indemnifies its officers and directors
for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was, serving at Autodesk’s request in such capacity. The maximum potential amount of future payments Autodesk could be required to make under these indemnification
agreements is unlimited; however, Autodesk has Directors’ and Officers’ Liability insurance coverage that is intended to reduce its financial exposure and may enable Autodesk to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. Autodesk
believes the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal.

Legal
Proceedings

On December 27, 2001, Spatial Corp. (“Spatial”) filed suit in Marin County Superior Court against Autodesk
and one of its consultants, D-Cubed Ltd., seeking among other things termination of a development and license agreement between Spatial and Autodesk and an injunction preventing Autodesk from working with contractors under the agreement. On
October 2, 2003, a jury found that Autodesk did not breach the agreement. As the prevailing party in the action, the court awarded Autodesk approximately $2.4 million for reimbursement of attorneys’ fees and the costs of trial, which was
paid during the second quarter of fiscal 2005. Spatial filed a notice of appeal on December 2, 2003 appealing the decision of the jury. Spatial claims that certain testimony of a witness should not have been considered by the jury and as a
result, Spatial asserts that it is entitled to a new trial. On March 23, 2006, the Court of Appeal denied Spatial’s appeal. The trial court awarded Autodesk approximately $0.2 million on April 1, 2006. As a result, the ultimate
resolution of this matter did not have a material effect on Autodesk’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

On
September 22, 2004, z4 Technologies, Inc. (“z4”) filed suit against Autodesk and Microsoft Corporation in the United States District Court, Eastern District of Texas, alleging infringement of U.S. Patent No. 6,044,471 (“471
patent”), entitled “Method and Apparatus for Securing Software to Reduce Unauthorized Use,” and U.S. Patent No. 6,785,825 (“825 patent”), entitled “Method for Securing Software to Decrease Software
Piracy.” z4’s complaint alleged that Autodesk infringed both patents by making, using, selling, and offering for sale the claimed matter of these patents without the plaintiff’s authority. In its complaint, z4 sought compensatory
damages amounting to a 1.5% royalty, injunctive relief and fees and costs. On April 19, 2006, a jury returned a verdict finding that certain Autodesk products infringed both patents, awarding z4 $18 million in damages. In light of the
jury’s verdict, Autodesk accrued the full amount of this verdict, which represented the best estimate of the probable loss, of which $16.8 million was expensed during the first quarter of fiscal 2007. The court entered judgment against Autodesk
on August 18, 2006, awarding z4 $18 million in damages, pre-judgment interest and attorneys’ fees. Autodesk filed its notice of appeal of the judgment on September 8, 2006. On December 20, 2006, Autodesk and z4 entered into a
settlement agreement which resolved all of the issues between the parties. The final resolution of the z4 litigation did not have a material effect on Autodesk’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Following the guidance
set forth in Statement on Auditing Standards No. 1 “Codification of Auditing Standards and Procedures” AU Section 560 “Subsequent Events,” we reversed $13.0 million of previously accrued reserves during the second
quarter of fiscal 2007.

On August 26, 2005, Telstra Corporation Limited (“Telstra”) filed suit in the Federal
Court of Australia, Victoria District Registry against Autodesk Australia Pty Ltd. (“AAPL”) seeking partial indemnification for claims filed against Telstra by SpatialInfo Pty Limited relating to Telstra’s use of certain software in
the management of its computer based cable plant records system. On December 12, 2005, SpatialInfo added AAPL as a defendant to its lawsuit against Telstra. Autodesk is currently investigating the allegations and intends to vigorously defend
the case. Although this case is in the early stages and Autodesk cannot determine the final financial impact of this matter, based on the facts known at this time, the Company believes the ultimate resolution of this matter will not have a material
effect on Autodesk’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of this matter could occur and materially affect Autodesk’s future results of operations, cash flows or
financial position in a particular period.

On July 12, 2006 New York University (“NYU”) filed suit against Autodesk in the
United States District Court, Southern District of New York, alleging infringement of U.S. Patent No. 6,115,053 (“053 patent”), entitled “Computer Animation Method and System for Synthesizing Human-Like Gestures and
Actions,” and U.S. Patent No. 6,317,132 (“132 patent”), entitled “Computer Animation Method for Creating Computer Generated Animated Characters.” NYU’s complaint alleged that Autodesk infringed both patents by
making, using, selling, and offering for sale the claimed matter of these patents without the plaintiff’s authority. In its complaint, NYU seeks compensatory damages, injunctive relief and fees and costs. Autodesk cannot determine the final
financial impact of this matter; based on the facts known at this time, the Company believes the ultimate resolution of this matter will not have a material effect on Autodesk’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However,
it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of this matter could occur and materially affect Autodesk’s future results of operations, cash flows or financial position in a particular period.

In connection with Autodesk’s anti-piracy program, designed to enforce copyright protection of its software and conducted both internally and
through the Business Software Alliance (“BSA”), from time to time the Company undertakes litigation against alleged copyright infringers or provide information to criminal justice authorities to conduct actions against alleged copyright
infringers. Such lawsuits have led to counter claims alleging improper use of litigation or violation of other local law and have recently increased in frequency, especially in Latin America. On March 1, 2002, Consultores en Computación
y Contabilidad, S.C., a Mexican hardware/software reseller and its principals (collectively, “CCC”) filed a lawsuit in the Mexico Court in the First Civil Court of the Federal District, against, Autodesk, Adobe Systems, Microsoft and
Symantec (all members of the BSA and collectively the “Defendants”). Ultimately, a court of appeals held that the Defendants were liable to CCC for “moral” damages, and the court remanded the case to the First Civil Court for a
determination of the amount. On December 13, 2005, the First Civil Court awarded CCC $90 million in damages. Both the defendants and the plaintiffs appealed the verdict. In September 2006, the parties entered into a settlement agreement which
did not have a material effect on Autodesk’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

During the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2007, three shareholder derivative lawsuits were filed against Autodesk and the Company’s current directors and officers (as well as certain of the Company’s former directors and officers) relating to its historical stock option
practices and related accounting. On November 20, 2006, the Company and its current members of the Board were sued in United States Federal District Court for the Northern District of California in a shareholder derivative action, entitled
“Giles v. Bartz, et al.”, Case No. C06-8175. On December 29, 2006, the Company, its current members of the Board, and certain current and past executive officers were sued in United States Federal District Court for the
Northern District of California in a shareholder derivative action, entitled “Campion v. Sutton, et al.”, Case No. C06-07967. This lawsuit was consolidated into the previously mentioned Giles case and later voluntarily dismissed by the
plaintiff on January 31, 2007. On January 9, 2007, the Company, its current members of the Board, and current and



AUTODESK, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

former executive officers were sued in the Superior Court for the State of California, County of Marin in a shareholder derivative action, entitled
“Koerner v. Bartz, et al.”, Case No. CV-070112. These actions are in the preliminary stages and Autodesk cannot determine the final financial impact of these matters based on the facts known at this time. However, it is possible that an
unfavorable resolution of the matters could occur and materially affect its future results of operations, cash flows or financial position in a particular period.

In addition, Autodesk is involved in legal proceedings from time to time arising from the normal course of business activities including claims of alleged infringement of intellectual property rights, commercial,
employment, piracy prosecution and other matters. In the Company’s opinion, resolution of pending matters is not expected to have a material adverse impact on its consolidated results of operations, cash flows or its financial position.
However, it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of one or more such proceedings could in the future materially affect its future results of operations, cash flows or financial position in a particular period.

Note 9.    Stockholders’ Equity

Preferred Stock

Under Autodesk’s Certificate of Incorporation, 2.0 million shares of preferred stock are
authorized. At January 31, 2007, there were no preferred shares issued or outstanding. The Board of Directors has the authority to issue the preferred stock in one or more series and to fix rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions,
including dividends, and the number of shares constituting any series or the designation of such series, without any further vote or action by the stockholders.

Autodesk entered into a Preferred Shares Rights Agreement dated December 14, 1995, as amended (the “Rights Agreement”). At the close of business on December 14, 2005, pursuant to the terms of the
Rights Agreement, the Rights expired, effectively terminating the Rights Agreement.

Common Stock Repurchase Programs

Autodesk repurchased and retired 4.2 million shares in fiscal 2007 at an average repurchase price of $36.79 per share, 11.7 million shares
in fiscal 2006 at an average repurchase price of $38.10 per share and 25.9 million shares in fiscal 2005 at an average repurchase price of $21.08 per share. The purpose of the stock repurchase program is to help offset the dilution to net
income per share caused by the issuance of stock under Autodesk’s employee stock plans and to more effectively utilize excess cash generated from its business. Because the Company was not current with its reporting obligations under the
Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, there were no repurchases of Autodesk common stock during the second half of fiscal 2007.

Between
November 1999 and December 2004, the Board of Directors approved several plans to repurchase up to a total of 144.0 million shares of Autodesk common stock. Of the total 144.0 million shares approved for repurchase, 127.7 million
shares had been repurchased and retired as of January 31, 2007. Autodesk repurchases its own shares to offset dilution from stock issued by its employee stock plans. The number of shares acquired and the timing of the purchases are based on
several factors, including general market conditions and the trading price of Autodesk common stock. In fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, Autodesk repurchased its common stock through open market purchases.

Dividends

During fiscal 2006 and 2005, Autodesk paid annual cash dividends of $0.06 per share at a rate of $0.015 each quarter, reducing retained earnings by $3.4 million and $13.5 million, respectively. Autodesk
discontinued the payment of cash dividends after the dividend payable for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, which was paid in April 2006.

The following table sets forth the computation
of the numerators and denominators used in the basic and diluted net income per share amounts:

The computation of diluted net income per share does not include 8.3 million options for fiscal 2007, 0.2 million options for fiscal 2006, and 0.3 million options for
fiscal 2005. These options were excluded in the computation of basic and diluted net income per share because they had exercise prices greater than the average market prices of common stock during the respective periods and therefore were not
dilutive. See Note 2, “Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements.”

Note 13.    Segments

Autodesk’s operating results are aggregated into two reportable segments: the Design Solutions Segment and the Media and
Entertainment Segment. The Location Services Division, which is not included in either reportable segment, is reflected as Other.

The
Design Solutions Segment derives revenues from the sale of software products and services for professionals and consumers, who design, build, manage and own building projects; who design, manufacture and manage manufactured goods; and who design,
build, manage and own infrastructure projects for both public and private users. The Design Solutions Segment consists of a general design platform division and industry-specific business divisions. These are: Platform Technology Division and Other,
which includes revenue from Autodesk Collaboration Services and Autodesk Consulting; Manufacturing Solutions Division; Infrastructure Solutions Division; and Business Solutions Division. Total sales of AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT (2D design products)
accounted for 40% of consolidated net revenues in fiscal 2007 and 43% of consolidated net revenues in both fiscal 2006 and 2005. Total sales of 3D model-based design products (Autodesk Inventor Family of Products, Autodesk Revit Family of Products
and Autodesk Civil 3D) accounted for 22%, 18% and 14% of consolidated net revenues in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

The Media
and Entertainment Segment derives revenues from the sale of products to post-production facilities, broadcasters and creative professionals for a variety of applications, including feature films, television programs, commercials, music and corporate
videos, interactive game production, design visualization, Web design and interactive Web streaming.

Both reportable segments distribute
their respective products primarily through authorized dealers and distributors and, to a lesser extent, through direct sales to end-users.

The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in Note 1, “Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.” Autodesk evaluates each segment’s performance on the basis of



AUTODESK, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

income from operations before income taxes. All intercompany transactions or transfers between segments were eliminated for the periods presented. Autodesk
currently does not separately accumulate and report asset information by segment, except for goodwill, which is disclosed in Note 1, “Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Polices.” Information concerning the operations of
Autodesk’s reportable segments is as follows:

(1)

See Note 2, “Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

(2)

Unallocated amounts primarily relate to corporate expenses and other costs and expenses that are managed outside the reportable segments, including expense from stock-based
compensation recorded under SFAS 123R of $94.3 million and expense from stock-based compensation recorded under SFAS 123 of $5.0 million and $10.3 million for fiscal years 2006 and 2005, respectively. Unallocated amounts in fiscal 2005 also include
$26.7 million resulting from restructuring activity.

Net revenues attributable to the major divisions within the Design
Solutions Segment are as follows:

Since the inception of the Fiscal 2004 Plan, the Design Solutions Segment and the Media and
Entertainment Segment have recorded restructuring charges totaling $12.0 million and $7.0 million, respectively.

All restructuring reserve
balances remaining for the Fiscal 2002 Plan at January 31, 2007 relate to the Design Solutions Segment.

Note 14.

Financial Instruments

Fair Values of Financial
Instruments

Estimated fair values of financial instruments are based on quoted market prices. The carrying amounts and fair value of
Autodesk’s financial instruments are as follows:

Autodesk uses derivative instruments to manage its earnings and cash flow exposures to
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Under its risk management strategy, Autodesk uses foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage its exposures of underlying assets, liabilities and other obligations, which exist as part of
the ongoing business operations. These foreign currency instruments have maturities of less than three months. Autodesk’s general practice is to hedge a majority of its short-term foreign exchange transaction exposures. Contracts are primarily
denominated in euros, Swiss francs, Canadian dollars, British pounds and Japanese yen. Autodesk does not enter into any foreign exchange derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

Forwards

Autodesk’s forward
contracts, which are not designated as hedging instruments under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” (“SFAS 133”), have average maturities of
less than three months. The forwards are used to reduce the exchange rate risk associated primarily with receivables and payables. Forward contracts are marked-to-market at the end of each reporting period, with gains and losses recognized as other
income or expense to offset the gains or losses resulting from the settlement of the underlying foreign currency denominated receivables and payables.

The notional amounts of foreign currency contracts were $65.5 million at January 31, 2007 and $10.4 million at January 31, 2006. While the contract or notional amount is often used to express the volume
of foreign exchange contracts, the amounts potentially subject to credit risk are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which the counterparties’ obligations under the agreements exceed the obligations of Autodesk to the counterparties.

Options

In addition
to the forward contracts, Autodesk utilizes foreign currency option collar contracts to reduce the exchange rate impact on the net revenue of certain anticipated transactions. These option contracts, which are designated and documented as cash flow
hedges and qualify for hedge accounting treatment under SFAS 133, have maturities of less than three months. For cash flow hedges, derivative gains and losses included in comprehensive income are reclassified into earnings at the time the forecasted
revenue is recognized or the option expires. The cost of these foreign currency option collars are recorded as other current assets and other accrued liabilities on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The notional amounts of foreign currency option contracts were $97.3 million at January 31, 2007 and $77.1 million at January 31, 2006,
and the critical terms were generally the same as those of the underlying exposure. Gains, if any, from the effective portion of the option contracts, as determinable under SFAS 133, are



AUTODESK, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

recognized as net revenues, while the ineffective portion of the option contract is recorded in interest and other income, net. There were $0.2 million net
settlement gains recorded as net revenues during fiscal 2007 and $2.8 million net settlement gains recorded as net revenues during fiscal 2006. Amounts associated with the cost of the options, which were recorded in interest and other income, net,
totaled $0.6 million during fiscal 2007 and $0.8 million during fiscal 2006.

Marketable Securities

Marketable securities include the following available-for-sale securities at January 31, 2007 and 2006:

The sales of available-for-sale securities in fiscal 2007 and 2006 resulted in no gross gains or
losses. Gross gains realized on the sale of available-for-sale securities were $1.4 million in fiscal 2005. Gross losses realized on the sale of available-for-sale securities was $0.9 million in fiscal 2005. The cost of securities sold is based on
the specific identification method. Proceeds from the sale of marketable securities were $547.1 million in fiscal 2007, $204.0 million in fiscal 2006 and $301.6 million in fiscal 2005.

Note 15.    Business Combinations

The following acquisitions were accounted for
under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, “Business Combinations (“SFAS 141”). Accordingly, the results of operations of each acquisition are included in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income since
the acquisition dates, and the related assets and liabilities were recorded based upon their relative fair values at their respective acquisition dates. Pro forma financial information has been presented for the Alias acquisition. Pro forma
financial information for the other acquired entities has not been presented, as their historical operations were not material to Autodesk’s consolidated financial statements either individually or in the aggregate.

Emerging Solutions, Inc. (“Constructware”)

In March 2006, Autodesk acquired Constructware, a privately-held company, for cash consideration of approximately $45.7 million. Autodesk incorporated Constructware’s collaborative technology solutions into the



AUTODESK, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Platform Technology Division of the Design Solutions Segment. This acquisition provides on-demand communication and collaboration solutions and is intended
to enable Autodesk to rapidly expand its Buzzsaw collaborative project management solution with Constructware’s cost, bid and risk management capabilities.

Management’s allocation of the purchase price, which was based on a valuation of acquired assets and liabilities performed in-part by a third-party appraiser, is as follows:

Customer relationships and customer contracts represent the underlying relationships and
agreements with Constructware’s existing customers. Trade name represents the estimated fair value of the Constructware trade name and trademarks. The $35.9 million of goodwill, which represents the premium paid for Constructware’s
established products, is not deductible for tax purposes. Deferred revenue represents the estimated fair value of the support and maintenance obligations assumed from Constructware in connection with this acquisition. Autodesk estimates that these
support and maintenance obligations will be substantially fulfilled by fiscal 2010.

Autodesk has not identified any material
pre-acquisition contingencies where a liability is probable and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated. If information becomes available prior to the end of the purchase price allocation period that would indicate that such a
liability is probable and that the amounts can be reasonably estimated, such liability would be included as an adjustment to the purchase price allocation.

Alias Systems Holdings, Inc. (“Alias”)

In January 2006, Autodesk acquired Alias
Systems Holdings, Inc., a privately held developer of 3D graphics technology for total cash consideration of $196.8 million. A portion of the total cash consideration, $36.4 million, has been set aside in an escrow account for two years following
the acquisition date. The escrow is to be held as partial security for certain losses incurred by Autodesk in the event of certain breaches of the representations and warranties covered in the agreement.

In addition, Autodesk also assumed all outstanding unvested options to purchase shares of Alias common stock, which converted into options to purchase
198,405 shares of Autodesk common stock. The fair value of these stock options of $8.1 million increased the total purchase price consideration. The intrinsic value of these options, which relates to future services, was $8.2 million and was
recorded as deferred compensation within stockholders’ equity.

Autodesk incurred approximately $1.8 million in costs directly related
to the consummation of this transaction. These costs were reflected in the total purchase price consideration.

The acquisition was
integrated into the Manufacturing Solutions Divisions of the Design Solutions Segment and into the Media and Entertainment Segment.



AUTODESK, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Management’s allocation of the purchase price, which was based on valuations of acquired assets
and liabilities performed in-part by a third-party appraiser, is as follows:

In-process research and development (“IPR&D”) represents incomplete Alias research
and development projects that had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use as of the acquisition date. Technological feasibility is established when an enterprise has completed all planning, designing, coding, and
testing activities that are necessary to establish that a product can be produced to meet its design specifications including functions, features and technical performance requirements. The total IPR&D amount was recorded during fiscal 2006 in
research and development on the Consolidated Statement of Income.

Customer relationships represent the underlying relationships and
agreements with Alias’s existing customers. Trade name represents the estimated fair value of the Alias trade name and trademarks. The $132.5 million of goodwill, the majority of which is not deductible for tax purposes, was assigned to the
Media and Entertainment Segment ($79.5 million) and to the Manufacturing Solutions Division of the Design Solutions Segment ($53.0 million). During the second quarter of fiscal year 2007, Autodesk recorded an increase to goodwill of $11.5 million
primarily related to an increase in deferred tax liabilities for book/tax intangible asset basis differences. As a result of this adjustment, the goodwill balance related to the Alias acquisition is $132.5 million. During the third quarter of fiscal
2007, Autodesk recorded a reduction to goodwill of $1.7 million because actual costs incurred under the Alias Restructuring Plan was less than what the Company originally estimated at the time the acquisition was recorded. The goodwill
represents the premium paid for Alias’ established products.

The deferred revenue amount of $5.1 million represents the estimated
fair value of the support obligations assumed from Alias in connection with this acquisition. As a result of the fair value determination in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, “Business Combinations,”
Autodesk recorded an adjustment to reduce the carrying value of Alias’ deferred revenue balance at the acquisition date by $12.0 million to $5.1 million. Autodesk estimates that the support obligations assumed from Alias will be fulfilled by
the middle of fiscal 2008.

Autodesk management approved a restructuring plan directly resulting from the Alias acquisition and involving
the elimination of employee positions, facilities and fixed assets of Alias (“Alias Restructuring Plan”). The total restructuring reserve established for this plan was reflected as an allocation item in the total purchase price
consideration of the Alias acquisition. The Alias Restructuring Plan was established in accordance with EITF 95-3, “

Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination

.” Total estimated cost of the Alias
Restructuring Plan was originally $11.1 million. This plan involved termination of approximately 130 positions worldwide at an estimated cost for severance and outplacement of approximately $8.8 million. In addition, this plan also involves costs
associated with exiting leased facilities and abandonment of certain assets of approximately $2.3 million. Autodesk completed the integration of Alias during the second quarter of fiscal 2007.



AUTODESK, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Autodesk currently has not identified any material pre-acquisition contingencies where a liability is probable and the amount of the liability can be
reasonably estimated. If information becomes available prior to the end of the purchase price allocation period, which would indicate that it is probable that such events had occurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated, such items would be
included in the purchase price allocation. Furthermore, the purchase price allocation is also dependent upon the final determination of costs under the Alias Restructuring Plan.

The following unaudited pro forma financial information summarizes the combined results of operations of Autodesk and Alias, on a pro forma basis, as
though the companies had been combined as of the beginning of each of the periods presented. The pro forma financial information is presented for informational purposes only and is not indicative of the results of operations that would have been
achieved if the acquisition had taken place at the beginning of each of the periods presented. The unaudited pro forma financial information in fiscal 2006 combines the historical financial results of Autodesk for the year ended January 31,
2006 and the historical financial results of Alias for the period from February 1, 2005 to January 9, 2006. Autodesk’s Consolidated Statements of Income for fiscal year 2006 include Alias’ financial results for the period from
the acquisition date, January 10, 2006, through January 31, 2006. The unaudited pro forma financial information in fiscal 2005 combines the historical financial results for Autodesk, with the historical financial results of Alias for the
twelve months ended January 31, 2005. The pro forma financial information presented includes the business combination accounting effects of amortization charges from acquired intangible assets, stock-based compensation charges for unvested
options assumed, an adjustment to reduce the carrying value of Alias’ deferred balance, adjustments to depreciation on acquired property and related tax effects.

c-plan AG (“c-plan”)

In June 2005, Autodesk acquired c-plan, a privately-held Swiss company, for cash consideration of $24.1 million. Of this amount, $2.2 million is payable over two years and is contingent on the continued employment of certain key employees.
This amount is being recorded as compensation expense over the two year period from the acquisition date and is, therefore, excluded from the total purchase price consideration. Autodesk incorporates c-plan’s family of geospatial applications
and data management solutions into its Infrastructure Lifecycle Management solution offerings.

This acquisition expands Autodesk’s
geospatial technology product portfolio and strengthens its market position throughout central Europe.



AUTODESK, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Management’s allocation of the purchase consideration, based on a valuation of the acquired
assets and liabilities performed in part by a third-party appraiser, is as follows:

The goodwill balance of $7.0 million was assigned to the Infrastructure Solutions Division of
Autodesk’s Design Solutions Segment and is not deductible for tax purposes. This asset is attributed to the premium paid for the established data management products.

The deferred revenue balance of $0.3 million reflects the estimated fair value of the support obligation assumed from c-plan in connection with the
acquisition.

Colorfront Ltd. (“Colorfront”)

In June 2005, Autodesk acquired certain assets of Colorfront Ltd., a developer of color correction technology for film studios and digital film
laboratories, for cash consideration of $15.2 million. Of this amount, $0.7 million was payable over the next year and was contingent upon the continued employment of a key employee. This amount was allocated to compensation expense in the
subsequent period in which it was incurred and is, therefore, excluded from the total purchase price consideration. In addition, $0.5 million was recorded as royalty expense during fiscal 2006 related to the settlement of a pre-existing royalty
agreement with Colorfront.

This acquisition provides Autodesk with comprehensive new expertise in film laboratory processes, digital
post-production, color science, image processing and hardware platform optimization.

Management’s allocation of the purchase
consideration, which is based on valuations of acquired assets performed by a third-party appraiser, is as follows:

The value assigned to IPR&D, which was expensed during fiscal 2006, was determined by
identifying projects in areas where technological feasibility had not been achieved and alternative future uses did not exist.

The
goodwill balance of $9.4 million, which is deductible for tax purposes, was assigned to the Media and Entertainment Segment. This acquired asset relates to the premium paid for Colorfront’s color correction technology, which provides Autodesk
with further long-term growth opportunities in the digital film industry.

Compass Systems GmbH (“Compass”)

In March 2005, Autodesk acquired certain assets of Compass Systems GmbH, the European-based developer of the Compass family of data management solutions, for cash consideration of $16.5 million. The acquisition
expands Autodesk’s data management solution for small and medium manufacturers. Immediately prior to the acquisition, Compass was owned 50.1% by one of Autodesk’s largest resellers.

Management’s allocation of the purchase consideration, based on a valuation of acquired assets and liabilities performed in-part by a third-party
appraiser, is as follows:

The goodwill balance of $5.8 million was assigned to the Manufacturing Solutions Division of
Autodesk’s Design Solutions Segment and is deductible for tax purposes. This asset is attributed to the premium paid for Compass’ electronic and product data management along with their channel expertise which provided an opportunity for
Autodesk to enhance its growth in these markets.

Related Parties

In April 2006, Autodesk acquired a
28% ownership in Hanna Strategies Holdings, Inc. (“Hanna Strategies”), a privately-held software development firm with operations in the U.S. and China, for cash consideration of $12.5 million. Autodesk also acquired an option to purchase
the remaining 72% of Hanna Strategies at a price that approximates fair value. The relationship with Hanna Strategies is intended to provide more efficient resources for the development of new products and the maintenance and enhancement of existing
product offerings. Autodesk is currently the only customer of Hanna Strategies. The investment is accounted for under APB Opinion No. 18, “The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock” and FASB Interpretation
No. 35, “Criteria for Applying the Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock.” Accordingly, the carrying value of the investment is included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets under “Other assets” and is
adjusted by Autodesk’s ownership percentage of Hanna Strategies’ results of operations and after the elimination of intercompany profit or loss. The carrying value of Autodesk’s investment in Hanna Strategies of $13.2 million at
January 31, 2007 was included in “Other assets” and is not assigned to Autodesk segments.

Beginning from the date of
Autodesk’s investment, the Consolidated Statements of Income include 28% of Hanna Strategies’ operating expenses in “Interest and other income, net;” see Note 10, “Interest and Other Income, net.” Autodesk incurred
approximately $34.3 million during fiscal 2007, approximately $27.0 million during fiscal 2006, and approximately $13.5 million during 2005 for consulting services and purchased in-process technology from Hanna Strategies, which were included in
“Research and Development.” The in-process technologies purchased were recorded as expense as of the date the technologies were delivered as they have not yet reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future use as a
stand-alone product. In addition, approximately $4.3 million of amounts owed to Hanna Strategies for consulting services and purchased in-process technologies were included in “Other accrued liabilities” at January 31, 2007.

Results for the first quarter of fiscal 2007 includes expense of $16.8 million resulting from an increase in a reserve for a potential loss contingency
under SFAS No. 5 related to a patent infringement lawsuit. During the second quarter, Autodesk reversed $13.0 million of reserves previously accrued, as better information was obtained related to the loss contingency. See discussion of the z4
litigation in Note 8, “Commitments and Contingencies.” In addition, results for the first, second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2007 also include amortization of acquisition-related intangibles of $3.2 million, $3.5 million, $3.5
million and $4.1 million, respectively. Autodesk reversed previously accrued income tax reserves and recognized a non-recurring income tax benefit of $8.9 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2007 as a result of the conclusion of a review by
the Internal Revenue Service. Autodesk also recognized a non-recurring income tax benefit of $5.6 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 from the reinstatement of the Federal research and development credit through the passage of the Tax
Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 by Congress, which resulted in retroactive application of this credit to January 1, 2006.

Results
for the second and third quarters of fiscal 2006 include non-recurring tax benefits of $1.9 million and $10.6 million, respectively, related to the impact of the DRD Legislation on prior fiscal years’ earnings. In addition, results for the

Subsequent Event

In May 2007, Autodesk entered
into an agreement to acquire NavisWorks Limited (“NavisWorks”) for approximately $25 million cash, which is subject to a working capital adjustment. NavisWorks provides 3D coordination, collaboration and sequencing in design and
construction. This acquisition, expected to close in the second or third quarter of fiscal 2008, is intended to increase the interoperability of Autodesk’s 3D model-based and 2D design software by coordinating design information from multiple
sources. This acquisition will be integrated into the Architecture, Engineering and Construction Segment. The acquisition will be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and the purchase price allocation will be determined upon
consummation of the acquisition.

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Autodesk, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Autodesk, Inc., as of January 31, 2007 and 2006 (as restated) and the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows and stockholders’
equity for each of the years ended January 31, 2007, 2006 (as restated) and 2005 (as restated). Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2). These financial statements and schedule are the
responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Autodesk,
Inc. at January 31, 2007 and 2006 (as restated), and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended January 31, 2007, 2006 (as restated) and 2005 (as restated), in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 2, “Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements” the Company has restated previously issued financial
statements as of January 31, 2006 and for each of the years in the two year period ended January 31, 2006.

As discussed in Note
1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, effective February 1, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment”.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of Autodesk,
Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our
report dated June 4, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Autodesk, Inc.

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, that Autodesk, Inc. maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of January 31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Autodesk, Inc.’s
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s
assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Autodesk Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 31,
2007, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, Autodesk Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2007, based on the
COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
the consolidated balance sheets of Autodesk, Inc. as of January 31, 2007 and 2006 (as restated), and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years ended January 31, 2007,
2006 (as restated) and 2005 (as restated) of Autodesk, Inc. and our report dated June 4, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

ITEM 9A.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Audit Committee Voluntary Stock Option
Review

As discussed in the Explanatory Note preceding Part I, in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 and in Note 2 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K, on August 17, 2006, Autodesk announced that the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, with the
assistance of independent outside legal counsel and forensic accounting experts, was conducting a voluntary review of Autodesk’s historical stock option granting practices and related accounting issues. As a result of the voluntary review,
management concluded, and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors agreed, that incorrect measurement dates were used for financial accounting purposes for certain stock option grants made in prior periods. Therefore, Autodesk has recorded
additional non-cash stock-based compensation expense and related tax effects with regard to past stock option grants, and we are restating previously filed financial statements in this Form 10-K.

As a result of the voluntary review of Autodesk’s historical stock option grant practices, the Company identified a material weakness in its
internal controls over financial reporting in periods ending prior to March 2005. For the period between July 2000 and February 2005, Autodesk generally followed an administrative process for monthly broad based employee grants that resulted in the
selection of effective grant dates that were prior in time to the final preparation of action by written consent for such grants.

Since
March 2005, the Company has implemented a number of changes that will resolve past measurement date errors and deter them from happening in the future.

In March 2005, the Board of Directors modified the delegated authority of the CEO to grant option grants to require that broad-based employee option grants be made on a fixed date each month, thereby remediating an
internal control deficiency related to monthly option grant processes. Following this modification, no additional instances of retroactive date selection occurred. In coming to the conclusion, disclosed in this Item 9A, that our disclosure
controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting were effective as of January 31, 2007, management considered, among other things, the impact of the restatement to the financial statements and the effectiveness of the
internal controls in this area as of the fiscal year ended 2007. Management has concluded that previous control deficiencies resulting in the restatement of previously issued financial statements did not constitute a material weakness in disclosure
controls and procedures, or internal controls and procedures over financial reporting, as of January 31, 2006 and as of January 31, 2007.

In addition to the significant improvements implemented in March 2005 discussed above, the Company discontinued “committee of one” grants in September 2006. Further, the Board of Directors modified the delegated authority to grant
stock options under the Company’s 2006 Stock Option Plan to provide that only the Compensation Committee or the Board of Directors may grant stock options under the Plan. In addition to other changes in the first quarter of fiscal 2007, the
Company implemented a series of remedial measures including personnel and process changes, restructuring of the human resources functions supporting stock compensation, implementing cross functional controls involving finance, human
resources, treasury and legal, as well as related process improvements recommended by the Audit Committee and approved by the Board designed to improve the Company’s controls with respect to stock-based compensation.
Finally, no Company employees or officers who may have made discretionary determinations that resulted in measurement date errors in the past has any continuing role relating to the distribution, administration or accounting for stock
based compensation.



Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management evaluated, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are
effective at the reasonable assurance level to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to Autodesk’s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management. Our disclosure controls and procedures
include components of our internal control over financial reporting. Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting is expressed at the level of reasonable assurance because a control system, no
matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met.

Changes in Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting (as such term is defined in
Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) during the quarter ended January 31, 2007 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial
reporting.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2007. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Our management has concluded that, as of January 31, 2007, our internal control over financial reporting is effective
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principals. Our independent registered public
accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, have issued an audit report on our assessment of our internal control over financial reporting, which is included herein.

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will necessarily prevent
all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the
fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control
issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Autodesk have been detected.

ITEM 11.    EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

Compensation Discussion and Analysis

Compensation Philosophy

Our
compensation philosophy provides the guiding principles for decisions made by the Compensation and Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Committee”) for our executive officers. Autodesk operates in the competitive and
rapidly changing software and technology industry. In the area of executive compensation, Autodesk strives to link pay to performance and to the long-term interests of shareholders by

•

Ensuring that the executive team has clear goals and accountability with respect to financial and nonfinancial corporate performance

•

Establishing pay opportunities that are competitive based on prevailing practices for the industry, the stage of growth of Autodesk, and the dynamic and challenging
technology labor markets in which Autodesk operates

•

Assessing performance against individual goals within the context of the Company’s overall operating results

•

Aligning pay incentives with the long-term interests of our shareholders.

Throughout Part III of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer during fiscal 2007, as
well as the other individuals included in the Summary Compensation Table on page 146, are referred to as the “Named Executive Officers.”



Compensation and Human Resources Committee

The Committee is responsible for ensuring that the executive compensation programs are effectively designed, implemented, and administered with sound
corporate governance practices. The Committee has authority to approve the philosophy and structure of the compensation programs for executives and, as deemed appropriate for other Company employees.

The Committee consists of three independent, nonemployee directors as defined by the listing standards of the NASDAQ stock market: Crawford W. Beveridge
(Chairman), J. Hallam Dawson, and Michael J. Fister. The charter as well as more details about the Committee are available at www.autodesk.com (About Us—Investors—Corporate Governance). The Committee reassesses this charter annually and
recommends any proposed changes to the Board for approval.

The Committee annually reviews and approves compensation for the CEO and the
executive officers of the Company. This includes base salaries, incentive awards, stock option grants, employment agreements, severance arrangements, change in control provisions, as well as any other benefits or compensation arrangements.

In addition, the Autodesk Board of Directors has delegated to the Committee exclusive authority to grant stock options to Autodesk’s
executive officers and other employees.

Role of Executives in Compensation Decisions

The Committee sets compensation for the CEO and the executive officers of the Company. In determining the CEO’s compensation, the Committee solicits
input from the full Board of Directors before making final decisions.

Certain executives such as the CEO, the Senior Vice President of
Human Resources, the Vice President of Compensation and Benefits, and others from Autodesk’s Finance, Legal, and Investor Relations organizations (hereafter referred to as Management) may assist and support the Committee. They may develop
compensation proposals for Committee consideration, analyze competitive compensation information, and provide analyses of the status of compensation programs such as levels of stock ownership, the holding value or the hypothetical gain from the
unvested shares if exercised at various prices,—and so forth. However, they do not have decision-making authority in regards to executive officer compensation.

The CEO annually reviews the performance of the Named Executive Officers, other than the Executive Chairman whose performance, along with that of the CEO, is reviewed by the Committee. The CEO recommends salary
adjustments, incentive awards, promotions, and stock option grants. The Committee reviews these recommendations and modifies them as necessary.

Use of Outside Consultants

While the Company may use consultants to assist in the evaluation of CEO or executive
officer compensation, the Committee has the sole authority to retain and terminate its own compensation consultant, as it sees fit. The Committee also has authority to obtain advice and assistance from internal or external legal, accounting, or
other advisers.

The Company contracted with several compensation consulting firms during the 2007 fiscal year that provided education and
information to the Committee:

•

Management used information from

Aon’s Radford Executive Survey

to provide benchmark data and overall practices reports to inform the Committee’s
decisions on fiscal 2007 base salaries, incentive awards and stock grants for executive officers.



•

VenturePay Group’s Executive Compensation Dashboard Report

provided benchmark compensation information based on a detailed analysis of recently filed
proxies from companies in Autodesk’s Peer Group (see Benchmarking of Compensation below). This was an additional source of information used to inform the Committee’s decisions on fiscal 2007 base salaries, incentive awards and stock grants
for executive officers.

•

Mercer Consulting

presented information to the Committee in June 2006 regarding statutory, accounting, and tax issues related to executive post-retirement
medical plans. This information was used to inform the Committee’s position in considering potential provisions in certain executive employment agreements.

•

Compensia

provided education material to the Committee in December 2006 on regulatory trends affecting executive compensation and has provided on-going
support and guidance on SEC compensation disclosure requirements.

Benchmarking of Compensation

To ensure that Autodesk’s base salaries, target incentive awards, and stock grants for executive officers are competitive, the Committee uses the
independent third-party executive compensation surveys mentioned earlier that report on the compensation practices of a group of companies in our industry as well as competitors for executive talent (collectively, the “peer group”). For
fiscal 2007, the companies in this peer group were Adobe, BEA Systems, BMC Software, Cadence Design Systems, eBay Electronic Arts, Google, Intuit, Network Appliance, Siebel Systems, Symantec, Synopsys and Yahoo.

The peer group is reviewed and updated each year to ensure that the comparisons are meaningful. Several factors are considered in selecting the peer
group, including product or industry, revenue level, geographic location, and competitors for executive talent in our labor markets.

Pay Mix

The total cash compensation and the ratio of fixed base salary and target incentive pay components are
established for executives based on competitive market practices determined from the benchmark surveys. For fiscal 2007, the base pay and cash incentive components for the CEO were each approximately 50 percent of targeted total direct cash
compensation. For the other executive officers, the base pay component was roughly 60 percent, and the targeted cash incentive component was approximately 40 percent of targeted total direct cash compensation. This mix between fixed base salary and
cash incentives is comparable to that for similar positions reviewed in the peer group.

Carol Bartz, who effective on May 1, 2006,
moved out of her role as Chief Executive Officer to the part-time position of Executive Chairman, is paid a fixed base salary but no longer has a target incentive component in her cash compensation.

Target Pay Positioning

The
Committee believes that Autodesk’s executive compensation program targets fall within the typical range of compensation programs offered by the peer group. Autodesk strives to position the midpoints of its salary ranges, target cash incentives,
and stock grant guidelines near the 50th percentile of the peer group, resulting in targeted total compensation that is competitive within our labor market. An individual’s actual salary, incentive award, and stock grant may fall below or above
the target position based on the individual’s experience, seniority, skills, knowledge, performance, and contributions.



Elements of Compensation

Autodesk’s executive compensation program has three major components: fixed base salary, short-term cash incentives, and long-term incentives. The
company also provides a comprehensive benefits program and termination protection. These programs are designed to attract, retain, and motivate highly effective executives to achieve the company’s business goals and improve shareholder value.

•

Base Salary

Autodesk’s base salary program provides fixed annual cash compensation set at a competitive level that recognizes the scope, responsibility, and skills required of the position. Salary ranges are developed for each executive officer
based on competitive salary information for the peer group. The midpoint of each range approximates the competitive labor market 50th percentile for the peer group.

Base salaries for executive officers are set annually by the Committee with consideration of the benchmark analysis of the peer group.
Each executive officer’s base salary is based on salary levels of comparable jobs in the peer group as well as experience, skills, and performance level.

Adjustments to base salaries generally are approved annually at the March quarterly Committee meeting. Promotion or equity adjustments may
be approved at other quarterly meetings.

•

Cash Incentive Compensation—Executive Incentive Plan (EIP)

The EIP is an annual cash incentive plan available to those executives designated annually by the Committee. Its purpose is to motivate
participants to ensure Autodesk achieves its annual business goals. Elements of the performance criteria may differ depending on participants’ areas of responsibility and may include corporate, business, or functional unit and individual
management goals.

Under the EIP, target awards are established for each eligible participant. Each year, a corporate
financial performance matrix is developed at the beginning of the award period. This matrix provides a guide to determining appropriate award levels based on varying levels of achievement of operating margin and revenue growth. A participant may
receive an actual bonus that is larger or smaller than the target incentive payout, or may receive no bonus whatsoever. The actual award reflects a combination of the target award, the Company’s revenue and operating margin performance, and an
assessment of the individual’s performance during the year.

•

Participants

Five employees were originally designated to participate for fiscal 2007, all of whom are Named Executive Officers. When Carol Bartz entered into a new employment agreement in January 2007, she voluntarily agreed to receive no EIP award for
fiscal 2007 and will not participate in the future. The remaining participants in the EIP for fiscal 2007 were the current Chief Executive Officer Carl Bass, Chief Financial Officer Al Castino, Sales Executive George Bado, and Human Resources
Executive Jan Becker.

•

Target Awards

For each participant, the Committee established an EIP target award equal to a percentage of base salary as follows: Carl Bass 100 percent, Al Castino 75 percent, Jan Becker 75 percent, and George Bado 16.7 percent. As leader of the sales
organization, George Bado has additional cash incentive compensation tied to sales commissions. His sales commission target is 50 percent of his base salary.



•

Corporate Income Tax Considerations

The EIP is intended to qualify as deductible “performance-based” compensation within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code and has been structured accordingly. The structure of the
plan separates the funding of the awards from the determination of the actual awards, as described below.

•

Maximum Funding of Pool for Awards

At the beginning of the award period, the Committee determines a payout funding formula that provides for a maximum funding amount based on a minimum threshold of revenue growth and a non-GAAP operating margin
attainment. The non-GAAP operating margin for fiscal 2007 excluded certain costs, expenses, gains and losses, including stock based compensation expense, amortization of purchased intangibles and litigation expenses. Below this threshold, there is
no EIP funding. The Committee sets these thresholds on a year-to-year basis. The minimum threshold for fiscal 2007 revenue growth was 6 percent and the minimum threshold for non-GAAP operating margin was 19.5 percent. If these two thresholds are
achieved or exceeded, the maximum funding pool for payouts is set at 190 percent of the sum of participants’ target awards.

•

Actual Awards to Individuals

The Committee is not obligated to fully allocate the maximum funding amount. The Committee determines the actual awards based on the Company’s financial results as compared to the financial performance matrix and
on an evaluation of an individual’s contributions relative to the Company’s results. This matrix provides a guide to determining appropriate award levels based on varying levels of achievement of revenue growth and non-GAAP operating
margin, where a 100 percent award generally equates to the Company’s achievement of its annual operating plan. For fiscal 2007, a 100 percent award was associated with revenue growth of 21 percent and non-GAAP operating margin attainment of
26.5 percent. A similar performance matrix is also used across the Company for determining award funding under the Autodesk Incentive Plan (AIP) as noted in the following section, thus providing alignment between the incentives for Named Executive
Officers and those for the broader employee population. For fiscal 2007, the Company’s financial performance exceeded the minimum funding threshold and equated to an award on the performance matrix of 98 percent of the target award amounts.

Awards are typically paid in cash within three months after the end of the fiscal year. For fiscal 2007, the Committee reviewed the
Company’s results and the performance of the NEOs in March 2007. The Committee determined that Mr. Bado, Ms. Becker and Mr. Castino had fully met performance expectations for the year and approved EIP payouts for them at 100% of
target. The Committee reviewed the performance of Mr. Bass with the full Board and determined that the CEO had significantly exceeded performance expectations during his first year as CEO of the Company. The Committee approved an EIP payout of
$1,000,000 for Mr. Bass, which is 143% of his target EIP award. Approved awards are listed below:

•

Cash Incentive Compensation—Autodesk Incentive Plan (AIP)

An executive not designated to participate in the company’s EIP is eligible to participate in the Autodesk Incentive Plan (AIP),
which is generally available to all non-sales employees. The AIP consists of



an overall corporate plan and several individual group plans covering Autodesk divisions, functional groups, and business units. Participants are assigned to
the appropriate AIP group plan based on organization and role. For example, the AIP awards for most divisional staff are based 70 percent on the performance of the specific division and 30 percent on corporate performance.

•

Target Awards and Target Funding

Each participant is assigned a target incentive payout, which is a percentage of the participant’s base salary. Target AIP incentive payout levels are set for each pay grade based on market competitive data and
internal consistency. The target AIP funding pool is the sum of all participants’ target incentive payout.

•

Actual Awards to Participants

Actual awards are based on (1) the performance of the Company and the participant’s group, as applicable, as compared to the financial performance matrix and (2) the evaluation of the participant’s
individual performance for the fiscal year by the participant’s manager.

•

Performance of the Company and the Participant’s Group

If the revenue goals and non-GAAP operating margin or group contribution margin goals are met exactly, actual total AIP funding is 100
percent of the sum of the participants’ target awards. For the Company overall and for each group, a financial performance matrix defines award levels as a percentage of target awards for various other combinations of achieved operating margin
and revenue growth as described above for the EIP. In addition, the CEO can adjust the AIP funding amount derived from the financial results up or down by a maximum of 10 percent, based on the CEO’s assessment of the achievement of nonfinancial
goals for the Company or for a particular group.

•

Performance of the Participant

The actual award reflects a combination of the target award, AIP funding based on the performance of the Company and the individual’s group, and manager assessment of the individual’s performance during the
year. As a result, an individual may receive an actual AIP payout that is larger or smaller than the AIP amount based on the performance matrix and his or her target award or may receive no AIP payout whatsoever.

•

Cash Incentive Compensation—Autodesk Sales Compensation Plan

As the top sales executive, George Bado has a portion of his targeted cash compensation tied to sales commissions based on achievement of
specific revenue and contribution margin objectives. Bado’s On-Target-Earnings (OTE) is the amount that he will receive if he achieves his annual financial performance objectives, such as his annual quota. His OTE consists of two components:
base salary and target incentive. His commission-based cash incentive target is set at 50 percent of his base salary. As described earlier, he has an additional cash incentive target of 16.7 percent of his base salary as a participant in
Autodesk’s EIP.

•

Equity-Based Compensation

Equity awards provide employees and executives the perspective of an owner with a stake in the success of Autodesk, thus increasing alignment with shareholder interests. Stock options are currently the equity-based
component of Autodesk’s compensation program. This component is intended to direct executive attention to the importance of sustained, long-term revenue growth and profitability. In addition, stock options are required to compete effectively
for talent in the software and technology industry. Vesting periods encourage employees and executives to remain with Autodesk and to focus on longer-term results.



•

Perquisites and Other Benefits

•

Benefits Program

Autodesk offers a variety of benefits programs to executives and regular employees alike. For example in the United States, benefits include medical (with prescription coverage), vision, dental, employee and dependent
life insurance, employee and dependent accidental death and dismemberment insurance, short-term disability, long-term disability, and financial programs such as a 401(k) plan and flexible spending accounts. Autodesk also provides a variety of
relocation benefits to eligible participants.

•

Nonqualified Deferred Compensation

US-based executives are eligible to participate in Autodesk’s Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan. The plan is designed to allow eligible employees to make pretax contributions through compensation deferrals
to the plan and receive tax-deferred investment returns on the contributions similar to the 401(k) plan. This benefit is incremental to the 401(k) plan and is available to a limited group of Autodesk U.S.–based senior management employees.
Similar to the 401(k) plan, earnings are not guaranteed.

Investment options are a subset of those available in the Autodesk
401(k) plan and include 22 funds. See the chart in the Summary Compensation Tables section on page 146.

•

Perquisites

Carol Bartz is provided a personal driver for her business transportation needs. George Bado has been provided a local apartment on an extended basis as part of his relocation assistance. Otherwise, the Company does not as a general
practice provide benefits or special considerations to its executives that it does not provide to other employees.

Stock Plans and
Stock Grant Policies/Practices

Autodesk maintains the 2006 Employee Stock Plan for stock option grants exclusively for Autodesk
employees, including executive officers. In addition, the Company’s employees are eligible to participate in Autodesk’s 1998 Employee Qualified Stock Purchase Plan.

Our broad-based employee stock option program is designed to promote long-term retention and recognize individual performance. Generally, all employees
are eligible to participate. Approximately 80 percent of the options granted during fiscal 2007 were awarded to employees other than Named Executive Officers.

Guidelines are based on competitive market practice for grants for new hires, promotions, and ongoing performance-related grants. Typically, an employee is eligible for a stock option grant upon beginning employment
with the Company (if the stock option program is available in that country location) and is eligible to be considered for periodic grants thereafter. The size of grants is influenced by the prevailing guidelines and the individual’s performance
or particular requirements at the time of hire.

•

Voluntary Stock Option Review

During fiscal 2007, the Audit Committee of Autodesk’s Board of Directors conducted a voluntary review of Autodesk’s historical stock option granting practices and related issues. For a full discussion of our
voluntary stock option review, please refer to the “Explanatory Note,” “Note 2. Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements” and “Item 9A. Controls and Procedures” in our fiscal year 2007 Annual Report on Form
10-K.



•

Stock Grant Process

All stock option grants to executive officers are made by the Committee. In March 2005, the Board of Directors modified the delegation of authority to the Company’s chief executive officer to grant stock awards
and approve monthly performance, promotion, new hire, and patent award grants for employees other than the Company’s executive officers on a predetermined date. The specified date was the second Thursday of each month, or the next business day
in case of a holiday, or as close to such date as was reasonably possible.

In September 2006, the Committee discontinued
the delegation of authority to the chief executive officer and began approving all employee grants at its regularly scheduled quarterly meetings. The Committee approves stock option grants to newly hired executive officers at the quarterly meeting
following the executive’s hire date. It also approves promotion and performance grants. For executive promotions, the Committee approves promotion grants at the Committee meeting at which the promotion is approved, or at the next quarterly
Committee meeting following the promotion. Approval of performance grants is scheduled to occur at the quarterly Committee meetings.

The Committee typically reviews and approves performance grants for executives once or twice a year. The Committee considers several factors, including the unvested option position of each executive, the value of those options compared to
other Autodesk senior executives, competitive pay practices within the peer group of companies, and the individual performance of the executive.

The Committee uses “new hire” and “ongoing” stock grant guidelines in determining the appropriate size of these grants. The stock grant guidelines reflect the range of typical competitive practices
of our peer group. The Committee has authority to exceed these guidelines, within the limits prescribed under the stock plan approved by shareholders. The current plan limits any individual grant to 1,000,000 stock options. For fiscal 2007, the
maximum grant awarded was 750,000 to Carl Bass to recognize his promotion to chief executive officer.

•

Stock Grant Policies

The Autodesk Board of Directors has established the following policies to govern the granting of stock options:

•

Limitation on Number of Options Granted

It is the policy of the Board that the aggregate number of shares underlying equity awards granted under the 2006 Employee Stock Plan will not exceed 2.5 percent per year of the Company’s outstanding common stock
during any given fiscal year. The 2.5 percent is based on gross awards and is not net of cancellations. In calculating whether the 2.5 percent limitation has been reached, no equity awards issued in connection with a merger, acquisition, or similar
business combination or the appointment of new senior executive officers of the Company, such as a chief executive officer, chief financial officer, or chief operating officer, will be counted toward the total.

For fiscal 2007, excluding the grant to Carl Bass to recognize his promotion to chief executive officer, the aggregate number of option
grants represented 2.1 percent of common shares outstanding as of January 31, 2007. Net of cancellations, the number was 1.6 percent.

•

Shareholder Dilution Mitigation

We maintain a stock repurchase program to mitigate the dilutive effect of our stock plans. We generate significant cash flow, and current and planned uses of cash include share repurchases. In fiscal 2007, we
repurchased about 4.2 million shares. As of January 31, 2007, about 16.3 million shares of common stock remain available for repurchase.



•

Prohibition Against Stock Option Repricing

Our Board of Directors has prohibited repricing of stock options in the 2006 Employee Stock Plan and the 2000 Directors’ Option Plan.
A similar policy was in place for our prior employee stock plan.

•

Nonqualified Stock and Incentive Stock Options

In general, we issue only nonqualified stock options to employees and executives, with the exception of grants to those executive officers
subject to the stock ownership guidelines described below. The 2006 Employee Stock Plan limits the use of incentive stock options (ISOs) because of the heavier financial burden they place on the company. However, because ISOs provide special tax
advantages to the recipient if the stock is held for a significant length of time following exercise, we provide ISOs to certain executive officers to facilitate their meeting the stock ownership guidelines. ISOs are granted to these few individuals
only to the extent allowable by applicable Internal Revenue Code limits. Any excess options are nonqualified stock options.

•

Stock Option Grant Exercise Price

For fiscal 2007, the exercise price for stock option grants equals the fair market value of the company’s common stock on the date of grant. This is defined as the closing price quoted on the NASDAQ Global Select
Market on the grant date.

•

Option Grant Vesting and Expiration

All stock options granted in fiscal 2007 vest according to the nature of the grant and the level of the recipient:

•

Executive Officer and all other vice president grants

(new hire, promotion, performance grants) have four-year vesting, with one-fourth of the total grant
vesting on each grant anniversary date for four years.

•

Other non-vice president grants

(key new hire, promotion, performance grants) have three-year vesting, with one-third of the total grant vesting on each
grant anniversary date for three years.

•

Standard new hire grants (50 to 100 shares, depending on country)

vest in full on the one-year anniversary of the grant date.

All stock options granted in fiscal 2007 expire six years from the date of grant.

•

Stock Ownership Guidelines for Executive Officers and Directors

Stock ownership by executive officers and directors is important to tie management to the risks and rewards inherent in stock ownership of
the Company. The guidelines for stock ownership adopted by the Board in December 2004 provide that, within a four-year period, executive officers should attain an investment position in Autodesk stock equal to a multiple of their base salary and
that directors should attain an investment position in Autodesk stock of at least 5,000 shares. Converting a portion of management’s stock options into shares encourages long-term ownership in the Company and helps align the interests of
executive officers and shareholders.



Stock ownership guidelines are as follows:

The stock ownership guidelines are applicable only to those executive officers who
are also subject to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The guidelines apply so that the executive has four years from adoption of the guidelines in December 2004 or assumption of a new, higher-level position to achieve the
recommended levels of stock ownership, whichever is later. The executive can achieve the recommended levels through converting vested stock options or by purchasing stock either in the open market or through the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Only
stock that is owned outright is applied toward meeting the guidelines.

The Committee monitors progress toward achievement
of these guidelines on at least an annual basis. At their last review in December 2006, all outside members of the Board of Directors and Carol Bartz, George Bado and Al Castino had met the ownership guidelines.

Compensation and Human Resources Committee Operations and Decision Making

The Committee held eight meetings during fiscal 2007. Compensation decisions on base salaries, incentive targets, and stock option grants for executive
officers were made at the March 2006 Committee meeting, which was the first Committee meeting following the close of the fiscal year and public disclosure of our fiscal 2006 financial results. The Committee also met in March 2007, at which time
decisions on the actual incentive awards for fiscal 2007 were made. These decisions are described below.

•

Market Compensation Analysis

Management presented for Committee review competitive compensation data for key executives at peer group companies (described in “Benchmarking of Compensation” on page 134). The Committee reviewed
Company performance relative to our peer group, as well as base salary, bonus, and stock grant information, which then informed their decisions regarding executive officer compensation. Compensation for executives is targeted at the median or 50th
percentile of the peer group. The fiscal 2007 analysis indicated that our executive officer pay was generally below that of the peer group. Following fiscal 2008 salary adjustments for our executive officer salaries are in line with our target for
executive officer compensation within the 50th percentile of our peer group.

•

Base Salaries for Fiscal 2007

Management presented to the Committee the proposed fiscal 2007 executive base salary ranges and base salary adjustments for certain Company officers, excluding Carol Bartz and Carl Bass, to be effective April 1,
2006. The Committee discussed both the proposed fiscal 2007 salary ranges and individual executive officer’s current salary levels relative to the competitive benchmark salary information. They reviewed proposed salary adjustments based on
skill and experience level, as well as the individual’s fiscal 2006 performance and position in the salary range. As appropriate, the Committee also reviewed longer-term strategies for monitoring and adjusting individuals’ pay over time
relative to market. The Committee approved individual salary adjustments in the range of 4 percent to 6 percent for each executive officer other than Carol Bartz and Carl Bass.



Based on discussion of experience and benchmark compensation information, as well as
input from the full Board, the Committee also determined the salary levels for Carol Bartz and Carl Bass in their new roles. These salary changes were effective on May 1, 2006, the date they assumed their new roles.

•

Stock Options Grants for Fiscal 2007

The Committee reviewed levels of annual stock grants for peer group executives in comparable positions. They reviewed the number of options awarded to each executive officer over the last four years, as well as the
holding value of each executive’s unvested options. Based on this information, the Committee awarded stock option grants to each executive officer (except Bartz and Bass) that approximated the midpoint for the appropriate stock grant
guidelines.

Given her change in role, no grant was made to Carol Bartz. The Committee, following consultation with the full
Board, awarded Carl Bass options to purchase 750,000 shares of Autodesk common stock in light of his promotion to CEO.

•

Incentive Awards for Fiscal 2007

In March 2007, the Committee reviewed the Company’s revenue and operating margin performance for fiscal 2007 and the EIP funding requirements previously approved by the Committee at the beginning of the fiscal
year. They also discussed with the CEO the individual performance during fiscal 2007 of each Named Executive Officer, with the exception of the CEO and the Executive Chairman.

On this basis, the Committee discussed appropriate EIP bonus awards for fiscal 2007 to the participating Named Executive Officers, except
Carl Bass, and determined to award each such executive approximately 100 percent of his or her target EIP award.

The
Committee also reviewed recommendations of the full Board regarding CEO compensation and incorporated those recommendations into the approved compensation proposals. As a result, the Committee determined that Mr. Bass had significantly exceeded
performance expectations during his first year as CEO. The Committee in conjunction with the full Board approved an EIP award of $1,000,000 for Mr. Bass, which is 143% of his target EIP award.

Tax and Accounting Considerations

In designing its compensation programs, the Company has considered tax and accounting implications, including the following:

•

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

—The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with the requirements of FASB Statement 123(R).
The company also takes into consideration FASB Statement 123(R) and other generally accepted accounting principles in determining changes to policies and practices for its stock-based compensation programs.

•

Change in Control Program

—The Company has structured its Change in Control program so that in the event payment of benefits constitutes a
“parachute” payment under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code, the Company will revise and limit the payment so that the Company does not incur additional tax burden on behalf of the participant. For more information, refer to
the “Executive Change in Control” section on page 150.

•

Executive Incentive Plan

—The EIP is structured to comply with the requirements of Section 162(m) of Internal Revenue Code, which allow certain
payments under the plan to be deductible for federal income tax purposes.



Post-Employment Obligations

•

Employment Agreements

The
Company currently has employment agreements with two of its Named Executive Officers. These agreements are summarized in the following table. Details of these agreements can be found in the Form 8-K filings as noted below.





•

Executive Change in Control Program

In March 2006, the Board of Directors approved an amended Executive Change in Control Program, in an effort to ensure the continued service of Autodesk’s key executives in the event of a future change in control
of the company. Each of Autodesk’s current Named Executive Officers, among other employees, participates in the Change in Control Program. Under the terms of this program, if, within 12 months of a change in control (as defined below) an
executive officer who participates in the Program is terminated without cause, or voluntarily terminates his or her employment for good reason, he or she will receive the following:

•

An amount equal to the executive officer’s annual base compensation and average annual bonus, payable bimonthly over a 12-month period

•

Acceleration of the executive officer’s stock options that would have vested within the 12 months following the date of the executive officer’s
termination

•

Continued coverage of medical, dental, and vision insurance until the earlier of 12 months from the date of termination or when he or she becomes covered under
another employer’s benefits plan

If the executive officer is terminated for any other reason, he or
she will receive severance or other benefits only to the extent he or she would be entitled to receive those benefits under Autodesk’s then-existing benefit plans and policies. If the benefits provided under the Change in Control Program
constitute parachute payments under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code and are subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, then such benefits will be (1) delivered in full, or
(2) delivered to such lesser extent that would result in no portion of the benefits being subject to the excise tax, whichever results in the receipt of the greatest amount of benefits.

As defined in the Change in Control Program, a “Change in Control” happens if the company is sold or merges with another
corporation, if an individual acquires 50 percent or more of the total voting power represented by voting securities, or if the composition of the Board of Directors changes substantially.

Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation

No member of our Compensation and Human Resources Committee is or was formerly an officer or employee of Autodesk or any of its subsidiaries. No interlocking relationship exists between any member of our Compensation and Human Resources
Committee and the compensation committee of any other company, nor has any such interlocking relationship existed in the past.

Compensation Committee
Report

The Compensation and Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion
and Analysis required by Item 402(b) of Regulation S-K with management and, based on such review and discussions, the Compensation and Human Resources Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis
be included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.



Fiscal 2007 Summary Compensation Table

The table below presents information concerning the total compensation of Autodesk’s Named Executive Officers for the fiscal year ended
January 31, 2007.

Based on the fair value of equity awards granted to Named Executive Officers in fiscal 2007 and the base salary of
the Named Executive Officers, equity-based compensation accounted for 70% of total compensation of the Named Executive Officers, salary accounted for approximately 13% of the total compensation, incentive compensation accounted for approximately 10%
of the total compensation and benefits accounted for approximately 7% of the total compensation. Consistent with our philosophy, we believe equity-based compensation closely aligns management’s compensation with the long-term interests of our
shareholders. Because the table below shows the value of certain equity awards based on the FAS 123(R) value rather than the fair value, these percentages cannot be derived using the amounts reflected in this table.

(a)

Ms. Bartz resigned as Chief Executive Officer and President and became Executive Chairman effective April 30, 2006. Mr. Bass became Chief Executive Officer and
President on May 1, 2006. Prior to such time, Mr. Bass was Chief Operating Officer.

(b)

The dollar value of base salary earned by each Named Executive Officer during fiscal 2007. Autodesk did not provide any additional stock or other non-cash items to its Named
Executive Officers as salary compensation during fiscal 2007.

(c)

Reflects the dollar amount recognized for financial statement reporting purposes (disregarding an estimate of forfeitures related to service-based vesting conditions) for fiscal
2007, in accordance with FAS 123(R), and thus may include amounts for awards granted in and prior to fiscal 2007. The assumptions used in the valuation of these awards are set forth in Note 1, “Business and Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These amounts do not correspond to the actual value that will be recognized by the Named Executive Officers.

(d)

Reflects (1) amounts earned for services performed during the fiscal year pursuant to Autodesk’s Executive Incentive Plan for all executives shown, except for
Mr. Bado, and (2) amounts earned for services performed by Mr. Bado pursuant to Autodesk’s Executive Incentive Plan and for sales commissions and sales bonuses earned, as shown below:



Executive Incentive Plan

$

60,000

Sales commissions

155,296

Sales bonus

30,000

Total:

$

245,296

Amounts earned under the Executive Incentive Plan are payable by their terms in the following fiscal year, and sales bonuses and commissions are paid quarterly for the previous
quarter’s bonuses and commissions earned.

(e)

Amounts in this column include personal gifts and related tax gross ups, reimbursement for certain travel expenses, transportation expenses, temporary housing expenses, resort
travel and lodging, matching contributions by Autodesk to one of Autodesk’s pre-tax savings plans, and organization dues. Ms. Bartz’s other compensation includes post-employment health and dental benefits for previous year’s
service with an actuarially determined present value of $631,986 plus a $421,324 tax gross-up, and a Company gift for appreciation of years of service as CEO costing $67,500 plus a associated $33,889 tax gross-up.

All other compensation items included in this category do not exceed the greater of $25,000 or 10% of the total amount of perquisites received by such Named Executive Officer.

Grants of Plan-Based Awards in Fiscal 2007

The following table presents information concerning grants of plan-based awards to each of the Named Executive Officers during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2007.

(a)

Reflects threshold, target and maximum dollar amounts payable under the Executive Incentive Plan for performance during fiscal 2007, as described in “Compensation Discussion
and Analysis— Elements of Compensation.” The “threshold” refers to the minimum amount payable for a certain level of performance; “target” refers to the amount payable if specified performance targets are reached; and
“maximum” refers to the maximum payout possible. The actual amounts paid to each executive under the Executive Incentive Plan for fiscal 2007 were determined by the Compensation Committee in March 2007 and are reflected in the
“Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation” column of the “Fiscal 2007 Summary Compensation Table.” Mr. Bado’s amounts in “Target and “Maximum” columns both include fiscal 2007 commissions earned of
$155,296; commissions do not have a preset maximum limit. When Ms. Bartz entered into a new employment agreement in January 2007, she voluntarily agreed to receive no Executive Incentive Plan award for fiscal 2007 and will not participate in
the future.

(b)

Reflects options granted under the 2006 Employee Stock Plan during fiscal 2007 that are not performance based. All options granted to Named Executive Officers vest over a four year
period at a rate of 25% per year. See “Employment Agreements and Change of Control Arrangements” below for a further description of certain terms relating to these awards. Stock-based compensation expense from these options are also
included in the Summary Compensation Table and do not constitute additional compensation.



(c)

Reflects the grant date fair value of each equity award computed in accordance with FAS 123(R). The assumptions used in the valuation of these awards are set forth in Note 1,
“Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These amounts do not correspond to the actual value that will be recognized by the Named
Executive Officers.

Outstanding Equity Awards at 2007 Fiscal Year-End

The following table presents information concerning unexercised options for each Named Executive Officer outstanding as of January 31, 2007.

(a)

Reflects options granted under the 2006 Employee Stock Plan and the 1996 Stock Plan. Unless otherwise indicated below, all options granted to Named Executive Officers vest at the
rate of 25% per year over the first four years of the option term. These options are also included in the Fiscal 2007 Summary Compensation Table and do not constitute additional compensation.

(b)

Options vest at a rate of 33% per year over the first three years of the option term.



Option Exercises and Stock Vested at 2007 Fiscal Year End

The following table presents certain information concerning the exercise of options by each of the Named Executive Officers during the fiscal year ended
January 31, 2007. Autodesk has not granted stock to Named Executive Officers, and accordingly no shares were acquired upon vesting of stock awards for any of the Named Executive Officers during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2007.

(a)

Reflects the difference between (i) the market price of Autodesk common stock at the time of exercise on the exercise date and (ii) the exercise price of the option.

Nonqualified Deferred Compensation for Fiscal Year 2007

The following table presents information regarding the non-qualified deferred compensation activity for each listed officer during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2007.

(a)

Contributions in this column include the following amounts which are also reported as salary and non-equity incentive plan compensation to the Named Executive Officer in the Fiscal
2007 Summary Compensation Table: Ms. Bartz, $575,277; Mr. Bado, $39,811; and Ms. Becker, $56,333. Contributions also include Executive Incentive Plan awards earned in the previous fiscal year but paid in fiscal 2007.

(b)

None of the earnings in this column is included in the Fiscal 2007 Summary Compensation Table because they were not preferential or above market.

(c)

Reflects a voluntary distribution during fiscal 2007 of salary and non-equity incentive plan compensation contributed to the non-qualified deferred compensation plan in previous
years.

Under Autodesk’s Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan, certain executives (including Named Executive
Officers) may defer compensation earned as salary, commissions or awards under the Executive Incentive Plan. Deferral elections are made by eligible executives each year during the “open enrollment” period (November or December) for
amounts to be earned in the following year. An executive may defer all or a portion of his or her annual salary, commissions and Executive Incentive Plan awards under this plan.



The investment options available to participants in the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation plan during
fiscal 2007 are shown below, as well as the annual rate of return for each investment option for the calendar year ended December 31, 2006, as reported by the administrator of this plan:

Employment Agreements and Change in Control Arrangements

Executive Change in Control Program

In March 2006, the Board of Directors approved an amended and restated Executive Change in Control Program (the “Program”), in an effort to ensure the continued service of Autodesk’s key executives in the event of a future
change in control event. Each of Autodesk’s current executive officers, among other employees, participates in the Program. Under the terms of the Program, if, within 12 months of a “change in control,” an executive officer who
participates in the Program is terminated without “cause”, or voluntarily terminates his or her employment on account of “good reason,” as each such term is defined in the Program, he or she will receive (provided the participant
executes a release and non competition agreement):

•

An amount equal to the executive officer’s annual base compensation and average annual bonus, payable bimonthly over a 12 month period;

•

The acceleration of such executive officer’s stock options with respect to the number of shares that would have vested within the 12 months following the date
of the executive officer’s termination; and

•

Continued coverage of medical, dental and vision insurance until the earlier of 12 months from the date of termination or when he or she becomes covered under
another employer’s employee benefit plans.

If the executive officer is terminated for any other reason, he or she
will receive severance or other benefits only to the extent he or she would be entitled to receive those benefits under Autodesk’s then-existing benefit plans and policies.

If the benefits provided under the Program constitute parachute payments under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code and are subject to the
excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, then such benefits will be (1) delivered in full, or (2) delivered to such lesser extent that would result in no portion of the benefits being subject to the excise tax,
whichever amount results in the receipt of the greatest amount of benefits.



Employment Agreement with Carol A. Bartz

In January 2007, the Company entered into an employment agreement with Carol A. Bartz that provides for, among other things, certain payments and benefits
to be provided to Ms. Bartz upon a “change of control” of the Company or in the event her employment is terminated without “cause” or she resigns for “good reason,” as each such term is defined in
Ms. Bartz’s employment agreement. In addition, at the end of Ms. Bartz’s employment with the Company, Ms. Bartz and her eligible dependents will receive continued health care coverage as follows: (i) if Ms. Bartz
validly elects to continue coverage under COBRA, the Company will reimburse Ms. Bartz for premiums paid for a period of 12 months; (ii) after Ms. Bartz’s coverage under COBRA ends and prior to Ms. Bartz reaching the age of
65, the Company will pay premiums for insurance that provides health and dental benefits substantially comparable to those provided under the Company’s health plans, and in addition will pay for a primary physician under a concierge plan and a
medical advocacy service to assist in processing claims; and (iii) after Ms. Bartz reaches the age of 65, Medicare shall become the primary health care provider, provided that the Company shall pay the cost of a supplemental insurance to
maintain the same level of health coverage specified in (ii) above and will continue to pay the cost of a primary physician under a concierge plan and a medical advocacy service to assist in processing claims. Such coverage will end upon
Ms. Bartz’s death or Ms. Bartz becoming eligible under another employer’s health plan, provided that, if there has been no termination of coverage at the time of Ms. Bartz’s death, coverage will continue to be provided
to Ms. Bartz’s spouse to the extent reasonably possible. The continued health care coverage will be subject to Ms. Bartz signing and not revoking a separation and release of claims and abiding by the terms of a non-competition and
non-solicitation agreement for 12 months.

In the event Ms. Bartz’s employment is terminated by the Company without cause or if
Ms. Bartz resigns for good reason, Ms. Bartz will receive (i) the continued health care coverage discussed above, and (ii) immediate vesting of all outstanding, unvested stock options. Upon a change of control of the Company,
Ms. Bartz will receive (i) immediate vesting of all outstanding, unvested stock options, and (ii) any additional benefits described in the Company’s Executive Change in Control Program. Such severance benefits will be subject to
Ms. Bartz signing and not revoking a separation and release of claims and abiding by the terms of a non-solicitation agreement for 12 months.

In addition, in the event of Ms. Bartz’s employment terminates due to death or disability, then Ms. Bartz will receive immediate vesting of all outstanding, unvested stock options.

Employment Agreement with Carl Bass

In December 2006, the Company entered into an employment agreement with Carl Bass that provides for, among other things, certain payments and benefits to be provided to Mr. Bass in the event his employment is terminated without
“cause” or he resigns for “good reason,” including in connection with a “change of control” of the Company, as each such term is defined in Mr. Bass’s employment agreement.

In the event Mr. Bass’s employment is terminated by the Company without cause or if Mr. Bass resigns for good reason, and such termination
is not in connection with a change of control, Mr. Bass will receive (i) continued payment of his then current base salary plus his target annual incentive compensation under the Executive Incentive Plan for the year in which the
termination occurs, for 12 months, (ii) accelerated vesting for 12 months of his then outstanding, unvested equity awards (other than awards that vest based on performance), (iii) a period of not less than 6 months to exercise any vested
stock options that were granted to Mr. Bass on or after the date he entered into his employment agreement, and (iv) reimbursement for premiums paid for continued health benefits for Mr. Bass and his eligible dependents until the
earlier of 12 months following termination or the date Mr. Bass becomes covered under similar health plans. In addition, Mr. Bass is subject to nonsolicitation and noncompetition covenants for 12 months following a termination that gives
rise to the severance benefits discussed above.



If, in connection with a change of control, Mr. Bass’s employment is terminated by the Company
without cause or if Mr. Bass resigns for good reason, Mr. Bass will receive (i) a lump sum payment in an amount equal to 100% of his then current annual base salary plus his target annual incentive compensation under the Executive
Incentive Plan for the year in which the termination occurs, (ii) accelerated vesting for 24 months of his then outstanding, unvested equity awards (other than awards that vest based on performance), (iii) a period of not less than 6
months to exercise any vested stock options that were granted to Mr. Bass on or after the date of the Bass Agreement, and (iv) reimbursement for premiums paid for continued health benefits for Mr. Bass and his eligible dependents
until the earlier of 12 months following termination or the date Mr. Bass becomes covered under similar health plans.

Potential Payments Upon
Termination or Change of Control

The tables below estimate the amount of compensation to each of the Named Executive Officers in the
event of termination of such executive’s employment. The amount of compensation payable to each Named Executive Officer upon voluntary termination, involuntary not-for-cause termination, for cause termination, termination following a change in
control and in the event of disability or death of the executive is estimated below. The amounts shown assume that such termination was effective as of January 31, 2007, and thus includes amounts earned through such time and are estimates of
the amounts which would be paid out to the executives on their termination. The price per share of Autodesk’s common stock is the closing price on the NASDAQ Global Select Market as of January 31, 2007 ($43.72). The actual amounts to be
paid out can only be determined at the time of such executive’s separation from the Company.

(2)

Executive Incentive Plan (EIP)

: For Mr. Bass, amounts reflect payments in accordance with his employment agreement. Ms. Bartz does not participate in the Executive
Incentive Plan. For Mr. Castino, Mr. Bado and Ms. Becker, amounts in the Voluntary Termination, Involuntary Not for Cause or Voluntary for Good Reason (Except in Change in Control) and For Cause Termination columns reflect the sum of
the fiscal 2007 bonus already earned under the Executive Incentive Plan, and the amounts in the Involuntary Not for Cause or Voluntary for Good Reason (Change in Control) column are the sum of the fiscal 2007 bonus already earned under the Executive
Incentive Plan and a severance bonus equal to the average of the last three years’ bonuses under the Autodesk Change in Control Program.



(3)

Stock Options

:    For Mr. Castino, Mr. Bado and Ms. Becker, amounts shown in the Involuntary Not for Cause or Voluntary For Good Reason
columns reflect the value of their outstanding stock options that would normally have vested in the twelve months following their separation but are accelerated (i.e., vest immediately on the date of separation) in accordance with the Autodesk
Change in Control Program agreement. For Mr. Bass, in accordance with his employment agreement, the amount shown in the Involuntary Not for Cause or Voluntary for Good Reason (Except Change in Control) column reflects the value realized upon
immediate vesting of his options normally vesting in the twelve months following his separation; in the Involuntary Not for Cause or Voluntary for Good Reason (Change in Control) column, the amount shown reflects the value realized upon immediate
vesting of his options normally vesting in the twenty-four months following his separation. For Ms. Bartz, in accordance with her employment agreement, the amounts shown in the Involuntary Not For Cause (Except Change in Control), Involuntary
Not for Cause (Change in Control), Disability and Death columns all reflect immediate vesting of all of her outstanding stock options.

(4)

Health and Welfare Benefits

:    For Mr. Bass, in accordance with his employment agreement, these amounts represent the cost of continuing coverage
for Mr. Bass and his dependents for twelve months. For Ms. Bartz, in accordance with her employment agreement, these amounts reflect the present value (including tax gross-up) of postemployment health coverage as shown on the Summary
Compensation Table in column (i) and described in the corresponding footnote (i) to that table; the amount shown in the Death column represents continuing spousal coverage. For all other executives, these amounts represent the cost of
continuing coverage for each executive and their dependents for twelve months in accordance with the Autodesk Change in Control Program.

executive under the Company’s disability program, which represent 100% of salary for the first 90 days, and then 66-


/


% of salary thereafter until the age of 65. These payments would be made by the insurance provider, not by Autodesk.

(6)

Accidental Death or Disability

provider in the event of each executive’s accidental disability or death.

year.

(a)

Reflects the dollar amount recognized for financial statement reporting purposes (excluding an estimate of forfeitures related to service-based vesting conditions) for fiscal 2007,
in accordance with FAS 123(R), and thus includes amounts for awards granted in and prior to fiscal 2007. The assumptions used in the valuation of these awards are set forth in Note 1, “Business and Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These amounts do not correspond to the actual value that will be recognized by the directors.

Amounts correspond to Autodesk’s Nonstatutory Stock Option Plan, which was terminated by the Board of Directors in December 2004.

The 1996 Stock Plan was adopted by the stockholders in 1996. Employees, including executive officers and the members of the Board of Directors, are
eligible to participate in the 1996 Stock Plan. The 1996 Stock Plan is intended to help the Company attract and retain outstanding individuals in order to promote the Company’s success. Incentive stock options (that is, options that entitle the
optionee to special U.S. income tax treatment) and nonstatutory stock options may be granted under the 1996 Stock Plan. Options granted under the 1996 Stock Plan generally vest over periods ranging from one to five years and expire within ten years
of date of grant. The



exercise price of the stock options granted under the 1996 Stock Plan is equal to the closing price of our Common Stock on The NASDAQ Stock Market on the
grant date. The 1996 Stock Plan expired in March 2006.

Our Nonstatutory Stock Option Plan, which is not subject to stockholder approval,
was adopted in 1996 and terminated by the Board of Directors in December 2004. The Nonstatutory Stock Option Plan permitted the grant to eligible employees of options to purchase up to 16.9 million shares, all of which have been previously
granted. Executive officers and members of the Board of Directors were not eligible to participate in this plan. The Nonstatutory Stock Option Plan was intended to help the Company attract and retain outstanding individuals in order to promote the
Company’s success. Only nonstatutory stock options were granted under the Nonstatutory Stock Option Plan.

Our 1998 Employee Qualified
Stock Purchase Plan was adopted by the stockholders in 1998. The 1998 Employee Qualified Stock Purchase Plan is intended to help the Company attract and retain outstanding individuals in order to promote the Company’s success. The 1998 Employee
Qualified Stock Purchase Plan provides employees of the Company with an opportunity to purchase Common Stock through accumulated payroll deductions. Under the 1998 Employee Qualified Stock Purchase Plan, eligible employees may purchase shares of
Common Stock at their discretion using up to 15% of their compensation subject to certain limitations, at not less than 85% of fair market value as defined in the plan agreement.

Our 2000 Directors’ Option Plan was adopted by the stockholders in 2000. The 2000 Directors’ Option Plan provides for the automatic grant of
nonstatutory options to non-employee directors of the Company. The 2000 Directors’ Option Plan is intended to help the Company attract and retain highly skilled individuals as directors of the Company, to provide additional incentive to the
non-employee directors of the Company to serve as directors and encourage their continued service on the Board of Directors, and to encourage equity ownership by directors in order to align their interests with those of the stockholders. The
exercise price of the stock options granted under the 2000 Directors’ Option Plan is equal to the closing price of our Common Stock on The NASDAQ Stock Market on the grant date.

The 2006 Employee Stock Plan was adopted by the stockholders in November 2005 and became effective in March 2006. Employees, including executive

ITEM 13.

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE

Certain Relationships And Related Party Transactions

Review, Approval or Ratification of Related Person Transactions

Autodesk’s Related Party Transactions Policy states that all transactions between or among the Company and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries and any Related Party, as defined, requires the prior written approval of the Chief Financial Officer. Non-routine Transactions with vendors and suppliers to the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries require the prior written
approval of the Corporate Controller. In addition, in accordance with our Code of Business Conduct and the charter for the Audit Committee, our Audit Committee reviews and approves in advance any proposed “related person” transactions. Any
related person transaction will be disclosed in the applicable SEC filing as required by the rules of the SEC. For purposes of these procedures, “related person” and “transaction” have the meanings contained in Item 404 of
Regulation S-K.

Related Party Transactions

During fiscal 2007, the law firm of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, Professional Corporation, acted as principal outside counsel to Autodesk. Mark A. Bertelsen, a director of Autodesk, is a member of Wilson
Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, Professional Corporation. Payments by Autodesk to Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati were less than one percent of such firm’s revenues in the last fiscal year. We believe that the services performed
by Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati were provided on terms no more or less favorable than those with unrelated parties.

Independence of the
Board of Directors

The Board of Directors has determined that, with the exception of Carol A. Bartz, our Executive Chairman, and Carl
Bass, our Chief Executive Officer and President, all of its members are “independent directors” as that term is defined in the listing standards of The NASDAQ Stock Market. Such independence definition includes a series of objective tests,
including that the director is not an employee of the company and has not engaged in various types of business dealings with the company. In addition, as further required by the NASDAQ listing standards, the Board of Directors has made a subjective
determination as to each independent director that no relationships exist which, in the opinion of the Board of Directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. The independent
directors meet regularly in executive session, without members of management present, as part of the quarterly meeting procedure.

ITEM 14.

PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING FEES AND SERVICES

The
following table presents fees billed for professional audit services and other services rendered to the Company by Ernst & Young LLP for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2007 and 2006.

(1)

Audit Fees consisted of fees billed for professional services rendered for the integrated audit of the Company’s annual financial statements and
management’s report on internal control included in the Company’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K and for the review of the financial statements included in the Company’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, as well as services that generally
only the Company’s independent registered public accountants can reasonably provide, including statutory audits and services



rendered in connection with SEC filings. The fiscal 2007 fees include approximately $1.4 million for audit services related to the Company’s voluntary
stock option review.

(2)

Tax Fees consisted of fees billed for tax compliance, consultation and planning services.

Pre-Approval of Audit and Non-Audit Services

All audit and non-audit services provided by
Ernst & Young LLP to the Company must be pre-approved by the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee utilizes the following procedures in pre-approving all audit and non-audit services provided by Ernst & Young LLP. The Audit
Committee is presented with a detailed listing of the individual audit and non-audit services and fees (separately describing audit-related services, tax services and other services) expected to be provided by Ernst & Young LLP during the
year. Quarterly, the Audit Committee is presented with an update of all pre-approved audit and non-audit services conducted and any new audit and non-audit services to be provided by Ernst & Young LLP are updated, if necessary. The Audit
Committee reviews the Company’s update and approves the services outlined therein if such services are acceptable to the Audit Committee.

To ensure prompt handling of unexpected matters, the Audit Committee delegates to the Chairman of the Audit Committee the authority to amend or modify the list of audit and non-audit services and fees; provided, however, that such
additional or amended services may not affect Ernst & Young LLP’s independence under applicable SEC rules. The Chairman reports any such action taken to the Audit Committee at the next Audit Committee meeting.
