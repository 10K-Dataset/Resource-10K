PART 1

Item 1. Business.

General

West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc.
(“West” or “the Company”) was incorporated in 1923 under the laws of the State of
Pennsylvania. The executive offices of the Company are located at 101 Gordon Drive, PO Box
645, Lionville, Pennsylvania 19341-0645, approximately 35 miles from Philadelphia. The
telephone number at the Company’s executive offices is 610-594-2900. As used in this
Item, the term “Company” includes West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc. and its
consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise indicates.

Description of Business

West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc.
develops, manufactures and sells components and systems used for injectable
drug delivery. These components include elastomeric stoppers and aluminum seals for vials,
multi-piece tamper-resistant plastic and aluminum closures and components used in syringe,
intravenous and blood collection systems. West also provides plastic systems and
components for use in over the counter (“OTC”) drugs, personal care and food and
beverage applications.

West’s primary pharmaceutical
packaging components (stoppers and plungers) are available with advanced coatings and
barrier films such as FluroTec®, Teflon® and B2-Coating. (Teflon® is a
registered trademark of E.I. DuPont de Nemours and Company.) FluroTec® is a
fluoropolymer film applied to rubber stoppers and plungers to prevent the migration of
rubber constituents into the formulation and to prevent the absorption of drug
constituents into the rubber stopper resulting in additional protection of the shelf life
of packaged drugs. B2-Coating technology applies a coating to the surface of rubber
stoppers and plungers to improve surface lubricity and reduce the need for conventional
silicon oil. The improved lubricity of these advanced technologies reduces friction on the
packaging components as they pass through drug manufacturers’ filling lines, leading
to significant improvements to the manufacturers’ production process without the use
of silicon oil.

In addition to the coating
technologies, the Company offers a post-manufacturing process, Westar® RS. Westar®
RS (ready to sterilize) is a documented, fully validated procedure for washing and
cleaning stoppers and syringe components to remove biological materials and endotoxins
prior to sterilization. The Westar® process eliminates steps otherwise required in
customers’ manufacturing processes. Westar® RU (ready to use), currently in
development, will provide components pre-sterilized and ready for direct introduction into
our customers’ aseptic filling suites.

The Company also manufactures
secondary closures for pharmaceutical vials, called Flip-Off® aluminum seals. These
secondary closures consist of an aluminum seal and removable plastic button, and in some
applications, just an aluminum seal. These components are sold in various sizes and colors
and provide customers with product identification, differentiation and tamper evidency.
For secondary closures, the Company is working with customers to provide
anti-counterfeiting features such as in-mold decorating, radio frequency identification
(RFID) tags and infrared printing.

The Company’s quality control,
regulatory and laboratory testing capabilities are used to ensure compliance within
applicable manufacturing and regulatory standards for primary and secondary pharmaceutical
packaging components.

Additional product offerings include
components and systems for OTC drug and consumer markets. These products, manufactured
from plastics, include child-resistant and tamper-evident closures; dispensers for
personal care products, such as unique toothpaste dispensers; and Spout-Pak®
components used to seal beverage containers. (Spout-Pak® is a registered
trademark of International Paper.)

In addition to revenues from product
sales, the Company offers contract analytical laboratory services for testing and
evaluating primary drug packaging components and their compatability with the contained
drug formulation and contract engineering design and development services to assist
customers with new product development.

The Company operates in a single
reportable segment referred to as the Pharmaceutical Systems segment. This reportable
segment consists of three operating segments: the Americas, Europe/Asia and the Device
Group. The Americas and Europe/Asia business units manufacture and sell products into the
pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical markets in their respective regions. The Device Group
focuses on development and sale of products sold into the diagnostic, OTC drug and
consumer markets. Manufacturing and distribution within the Pharmaceutical Systems segment
is integrated as needed to satisfy global market demand.

Please see Note 7 “Segment
Information” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included within
Item 8 of this report.

As of December 31, 2004, the Company
and its subsidiaries had 4,350 employees.

Product Development

The Company maintains its own
laboratories for testing raw materials and finished goods to assure conformity to customer
specifications and to safeguard product quality. The Company’s laboratories also
conduct tests to determine the compatibility of its rubber components with customers’
drugs. In the United States (“U.S.”), rubber formulation information is filed
with the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), which is used in support of
customers’ drug applications. The analytical laboratories also provide specialized
testing for drug delivery systems and container closure components specializing in
extractables and leachable testing for customers on a contract basis. The laboratory
facilities are also used for development of new products. The Company’s engineering
departments are responsible for product and tooling design and testing, and for the design
and construction of processing equipment. In addition, a corporate product development
department develops new packaging and device concepts. In 2004, 57 professional employees
were engaged in these activities. Development and engineering expenditures for the
creation and application of new and improved device products and manufacturing processes
were $6.4 million in 2004, $6.3 million in 2003 and $5.4 million in 2002.

Government Regulation

The FDA extensively regulates the
research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising,
distribution and marketing of drugs in the U.S. under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. The
Company’s businesses are involved in a number of activities regulated by the FDA and
by comparable regulatory agencies in other countries.

The Company’s drug packaging
components, including stoppers, seals and syringe plungers, are used to package drug
products that are regulated by the FDA. To accommodate the needs of its customers, which
manufacture drug products, the Company must maintain detailed written procedures for the
receipt, identification, storage, handling, sampling, testing and approval or rejection of
its products. Before shipment, samples from each lot of components must be tested for
conformance with applicable specifications. Manufacturing facilities must establish and
conform to written procedures for production and process controls and must create and
retain records for a specified period of time.

The Company’s analytical
laboratory performs certain contract services for drug manufacturers and is subject to the
FDA’s current good manufacturing practices (“cGMP”) regulations. It must
also register as a contract laboratory with the FDA and is subject to periodic inspections
by the FDA. The Drug Enforcement Administration has licensed the contract laboratory to
handle and store controlled substances.

Order Backlog

At December 31, 2004, the
Company’s order backlog was $152.7.million, of which $145.1 million is expected to be
filled during fiscal year 2005. The order backlog was $131.6 million at the end of 2003.
Order backlog includes firm orders placed by customers for manufacture
over a period of time according to a customer’s schedule or upon confirmation by the
customer. The Company also has contractual arrangements with a number of its customers,
and products covered by these contracts are included in the Company’s backlog only as
orders are received from those customers.

Raw Materials

The Company uses three basic raw
materials in the manufacture of its Pharmaceutical Systems products: elastomers, aluminum
and plastic. The Company has access to adequate supplies of raw materials to meet its
production needs, and therefore foresees no significant availability problems in the near
future.

The Company is pursuing a supply
chain management strategy in its Pharmaceutical Systems reporting segment, which involves
purchasing from integrated suppliers that control their own sources of supply. This
strategy has reduced the number of raw material suppliers used by the Company. In most
cases, the Company will purchase raw materials from a single source to assure quality and
reduce costs. Due to regulatory control over our production processes, and the cost and
time involved in qualifying suppliers, the Company relies on single source suppliers for
many critical raw materials. This strategy increases the risks that the Company’s
supply lines may be interrupted in the event of a supplier production problem. These risks
are managed by selecting suppliers with multiple manufacturing sites, rigid quality
control systems, surplus inventory levels and other methods of maintaining supply in case
of interruption in production.

Patents, Trademarks and
Proprietary Rights

It is the Company’s policy to
maintain a strong patent position by obtaining patent protection on products and processes
deemed to possess potential commercial significance. This policy applies to patents
resulting from the efforts of the Company’s research and engineering staff or through
the research and development of others financed by the Company. The Company relies on
trade secret protection for many of its rubber and elastomer formulations. The Company
also relies upon trademarks, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing
opportunities to maintain and further develop its competitive position.

Employees and consultants, outside
scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors who receive
confidential information are required to execute confidentiality agreements upon the
commencement of employment or consulting relationships. The agreements provide that all
inventions by an employee shall be the Company’s property.

The Company’s patents,
trademarks and proprietary rights that relate to the Pharmaceutical Systems reporting
segment have been useful in establishing the Company’s market share and in the growth
of the Company’s business, and are expected to continue to be of value in the future,
as the Company continues to develop its proprietary products in this segment. Although of
importance in the aggregate, the Company does not consider its current Pharmaceutical
Systems segment business or its earnings to be materially dependent on any single patent,
trademark or proprietary right.

Markets and Major
Customers

The Company provides components
and/or contract services to major pharmaceutical, biotechnology and hospital
supply/medical device companies. Products and services are distributed primarily through
the Company’s own sales force, with nominal use of regional distributors.

Becton Dickinson and Company
(“BD”) accounted for approximately 11% of the Company’s 2004 consolidated
net sales. The principal products sold to BD are synthetic rubber, natural rubber, metal
and plastic components used in BD’s disposable and pre-filled syringes and blood
sampling and analysis systems. The Company expects to continue to be a major BD supplier.

Excluding BD, the next ten largest
customers accounted for approximately 34% of the Company’s consolidated net sales in
2004 but not one of these customers accounted for more than 5% of 2004 consolidated net
sales.

Competition

The Company competes with several
companies, some of which are larger than the Company, across its major Pharmaceutical
Systems product lines. In addition, many companies worldwide compete with the Company for
business related to specific product lines. However, the Company believes that it supplies
a major portion of the U.S. market requirements for pharmaceutical elastomer and metal
packaging components and also has a significant share of the European market for these
components.

Because of the special nature of
these products, competition is based primarily on product design and performance, although
total cost is becoming increasingly important as pharmaceutical companies continue with
aggressive cost control programs across their entire operations. Competitors often compete
on the basis of price. The Company differentiates itself from its competition as a
“full-service value-added” supplier that is able to provide pre-sale
compatibility studies and other services and sophisticated post-sale technical support on
a global basis.

The Company competes against numerous
competitors in the field of plastic closures for consumer products. Many of these
competitors are larger than the Company and command significant market shares. The Company
differentiates itself through its expertise in high-speed assembly of multiple-piece
closure systems.

Environmental
Regulations

The Company is subject to applicable
federal, state, local and foreign health, safety and environmental laws, including those
governing discharges of pollutants to air and water, the generation, management and
disposal of hazardous materials and wastes and the remediation of contaminated sites. Some
of the Company’s manufacturing facilities have been issued environmental permits or
certificates and have implemented controls to prevent or reduce discharges to air and
water. These documents are subject to modification, renewal and revocation by the issuing
authorities. The Company believes that its operations are currently in material compliance
with all environmental laws, regulations and permits. The Company also believes that ongoing
environmental operating and capital expenditures will not be material.

Information as to the material
effects of compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws, contained in Note
19 “Commitments and Contingencies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements included within Item 8 of this report.

International

The Company conducts business in most
of the major pharmaceutical markets in the world. Sales outside of the U.S. account for
approximately 50% of consolidated net sales. Although the general business process is
similar to the domestic business, international operations are exposed to additional risks
including fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, multiple tax jurisdictions and,
particularly in Latin and South America, political and social issues that could
destabilize local markets and affect the demand for the Company’s products.

For additional information see Note 7
“Segment Information” and Note 13 “Affiliated Companies” of the Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements included within Item 8 of this report.

The Company’s financial
condition and results are impacted by fluctuations in currency exchange-rate markets (See
Note 1 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies — Foreign Currency
Translation” and Note 5 “Other Expense (Income)” of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements included within Item 8 of this report). Hedging by
the Company of these exposures is discussed in Note 1 “Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies – Financial Instruments” and in Note 16 “Financial
Instruments” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included within
Item 8 of this report.

Recent Developments

On December 24, 2004 the Company
agreed to sell its drug delivery business to Archimedes Pharma Limited, a new company
formed by Warburg Pincus Private Equity VIII and Warburg Pincus International Partners, in
return for consideration of $7.1 million, consisting of cash and indebtedness assumed by
Archimedes. In addition, West received a 14% ownership interest in Archimedes and is
entitled to 3% of any future royalty income resulting from the commercial success of the
technologies contributed to the new company. The Company also determined that it will
dispose of its clinical services unit located in Evansville, Indiana. For financial
reporting purposes, the operating results of the drug delivery business and clinical
services unit have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
See Note 2 “Discontinued Operations” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements included within Item 8 of this report.

In December 2003, the Company
recorded a $7.0 million charge associated with the closure of a manufacturing site in the
United Kingdom (“U.K.”). The decision to close the site followed a decision by
the marketing and distribution partner for our customer to terminate its involvement with
the principal product manufactured at the U.K. plant. During 2004 an additional $1.0
million of charges was recorded upon the exit from this site. See Note 3
“Restructuring and Impairment Charges” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements included within Item 8 of this report.

On January 29, 2003, the
Company’s Kinston, North Carolina plant suffered an explosion and related fire that
resulted in six deaths, a number of injured personnel and substantial damage to the
building, machinery and equipment and raw material inventories. The Company’s
property and business interruption insurance coverage provided for a maximum insurance
recovery of approximately $66.0 million. The Company and its insurer reached an agreement
in February 2004 that the total losses for business interruption, insured incremental
costs and property replacement would exceed the maximum recoverable amount, resulting in
the final settlement of the insurance claim for $66.0 million. During 2003, the Company
began construction of a new molding facility at Kinston. The new facility was completed
and placed in service during the second half of 2004. See Note 4 “Kinston” and
Note 19 “Commitments and Contingencies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements included within Item 8 of this report.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings.

On February 24, 2003, plaintiffs
Terry Ellis, Rosalie Whitley and Gloria Young, on behalf of themselves and a purported
class of residents of Craven County, North Carolina and the surrounding area, filed a
lawsuit naming the Company and Thomas Clagon, then its Kinston, North Carolina plant
manager, as defendants. Plaintiffs allege negligence and strict liability arising out of
the explosion at the Company’s Kinston, North Carolina plant and seek unspecified
compensatory and punitive damages. The lawsuit was filed before the state court in Craven
County, North Carolina. On March 28, 2003, defendants removed the case to the United
States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina. On April 22, 2003, both
defendants filed answers to the complaint in federal court, denying liability and denying
that class certification is appropriate. On September 29, 2003, the federal court remanded
the case to the state court.

Item 7.   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Management’s discussion and
analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and
accompanying notes.

BUSINESS OVERVIEW

West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc.
(“the Company”) is the world’s leading manufacturer of primary packaging
components and systems for injectable drug delivery, including stoppers and seals for
vials, and closures and disposable components used in syringe, intravenous and blood
collection systems. West’s customers include the world’s leading pharmaceutical,
biotechnology, generic drug and medical device producers. The Company has manufacturing
locations in North and South America, Europe and Singapore, with partners in Mexico and
Japan.

The Company’s business is
organized into a single reportable segment referred to as the Pharmaceutical Systems
segment. The Pharmaceutical Systems segment consists of three operating segments: the
Americas, Europe/Asia and the Device Group. The Americas and Europe/Asia business units
manufacture and sell the majority of the Company’s elastomer and metal component
products in their respective geographic regions. The Device Group focuses on the
development and sale of product delivery systems relying heavily on plastic injection
molding.

The Pharmaceutical Systems segment
operates in a global market growing annually at a rate of approximately 2% to 3% in unit
volume. The Company has achieved growth above this level by introducing value-adding
enhancements such as advanced coating technologies (FluroTec® and Teflon®) and
post-manufacturing processes (Westar®) that promote drug formulation, stability and
eliminate time and capital-intense operations from customers’ manufacturing
processes, respectively.

Favorable business drivers for the
Pharmaceutical Systems segment include the increase in FDA regulations and enforcement of
good manufacturing processes, which create a need for stable sourcing of critical
components used in both pharmaceutical and biotechnology products, increased customer
demand for anti-counterfeiting technology, and global demographics.

The Company’s ability to achieve
its long-term goals depends upon a number of factors, including possible healthcare cost
containment initiatives, increased competition, and changes in global economic conditions
including the strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar relative to other foreign
currencies. Although inflation has not had a material impact in recent years, the impact
of continuing demand in China and high energy costs is expected to increase the
Company’s cost of raw materials, particularly with regard to plastic resins, aluminum
and synthetic and natural rubber materials that are used in the manufacture of most of the
Company’s products.

The financial position of the Company
remains strong. Debt to total capitalization improved to 35% and cash on hand increased to
$68.8 million at December 31, 2004. The recent divestiture of the drug delivery business
will free up additional resources and provide for increased funding of innovative new
product offerings along with business development opportunities for the Pharmaceutical
Systems segment product group. As further discussed below and in Note 2 of the Notes to
the Consolidated Financial Statements included within Item 8 of this report, on
December 24, 2004, the Company agreed to sell its drug delivery business in return for
cash, assumed debt and a 14% ownership interest in a new company. In addition, the Company
has also determined that it will dispose of its clinical services unit located in
Evansville, Indiana. For financial reporting purposes, the operating results of the drug
delivery business and clinical services unit have been classified as discontinued
operations for all periods presented.

   ========================================================================

Consolidated 2004 net sales increased
12% over sales reported in 2003. Approximately 5% of the sales increase resulted from the
strengthening of the Euro and other currencies against the U.S. dollar. Sales in the U.S.
were almost 10% above prior year levels, while sales in international markets increased by
14% over 2003, 9% of which was due to foreign currency translation. Sales of specially treated
stoppers used in serum and lyophilized
pharmaceutical packaging products led the sales growth over the prior year. Approximately
$10.0 million of the pharmaceutical packaging sales growth is attributed to products sold
under a distributorship arrangement with Daikyo Seiko Ltd., the Company’s 25% owned
affiliate located in Japan, and is partially attributed to customers increasing inventory
levels in advance of a formulation change in the B2–Coating process. The Company also
experienced a $4.8 million increase in sales of components used in the packaging of an ulcer
treatment drug with continued demand expected in 2005. An additional $4.2 million in sales
growth is attributed to other customers’ build of inventory prior to a formulation
change in Teflon® film barriers and the recapture of business from multiple
competitors. The sales of disposable medical components were affected by the loss of
orders for an applicator device used to apply a hair growth stimulant. Within products
destined for the personal care/food packaging market, the sales growth was led by
increased demand in domestic markets for custom plastic fittings used in beverage
containers and an increase in baby nurser nipples produced in Brazil. The increase in the
laboratory and other service category is largely attributed to increased tooling and
engineering design and development service revenue on product development projects.
Overall price increases accounted for less than 1.0% of the sales increase over 2003. The
sales order backlog at December 31, 2004, was $152.7 million, versus $131.6 million at
December 31, 2003. The increase in the backlog is attributed to growth in the U.S. mostly
due to the advance orders from a biotechnology firm ($7.7 million), favorable foreign
exchange rates ($7.2 million) and generally strong demand in international markets ($6.2
million).

Consolidated 2003 net sales increased
17% over sales reported in 2002. Approximately 7% of the sales increase resulted from the
strengthening of the Euro and other currencies against the U.S. dollar. Sales were strong both
in international markets (25% growth over 2002, 16% of which was due to foreign currency translation)
and in domestic markets (10% growth). The success of customer products for the treatment of diabetes
and oncology, as well as various dental applications, led to increased sales of component parts for both
prefillable injection systems (pharmaceutical packaging) and non-filled syringes
(disposable medical components) in Europe. The increased sales volumes in Europe were made
possible by plant expansions in Germany and France that started to come on-line in the
fourth quarter of 2002. Overall price increases accounted for 1.6% of the sales increase
over 2002.

GROSS PROFIT

Although 2004 sales volumes improved
$58.2 million over the prior year, gross profit improved by only $2.5 million over 2003 levels.
The consolidated gross margin declined by three basis points to 29% in 2004 versus 32% in
2003. The majority of the decrease in the gross margin is associated with costs incurred
in implementing the Company’s interim production strategies following the January
2003 explosion at the Company’s production facility in Kinston, North Carolina.
During 2003, these costs totaled $9.8 million, but were completely offset by business
interruption insurance reimbursements. As a result of the final insurance settlement
recorded at the end of 2003, no additional insurance coverage was available for costs
incurred in subsequent periods. In 2004, similar costs totaling $11.6 million were
incurred, resulting in a 2.1 percentage point decrease in gross margin. During 2004, the
Company completed the construction of molding operations at a new facility in Kinston
and by the fourth quarter of 2004 the majority of the costs associated with the interim
production plans had ceased. The new plant was operating at 75% of planned capacity at
December 31, 2004. Management expects gross margin to improve to approximately 30% in 2005
as the new plant comes to full utilization, but increased depreciation charges and higher
oil-based resin and other raw material costs will partially offset the efficiency
improvement gains.

  Total Selling, General and Administrative costs         $105.2    $91.1    $67.6
==================================================================================

Pharmaceutical Systems segment
selling and administrative costs in 2004 increased by $7.1 million over 2003 levels. The
strength of European currencies versus the U.S. dollar contributed $3.0 million of the
cost increase. Higher compensation costs, including personnel increases in the quality
assurance function in North America along with sales and marketing staff increases in the
Company’s plastic device and South American operations, accounted for $3.0 million of
the 2004 increase over 2003. Other Pharmaceutical Systems administrative cost increases in
2004 included $0.6 million of business development consulting costs and $0.5 million in
audit fee increases associated with Sarbanes-Oxley compliance activities. In 2003,
Pharmaceutical Systems selling and administrative costs were $12.7 million higher than in
2002, with an increase of $9.0 million mostly due to compensation and headcount increases
including higher sales commission bonuses, and foreign exchange rate changes of $3.7
million. Selling, general and administrative costs in the Pharmaceutical Systems segment
were approximately 13% of total net sales in each of the 2004, 2003 and 2002 annual
periods.

General corporate costs encompass
executive officers’ costs, Board of Directors’ compensation, and legal,
compliance, finance and communication expenses. In 2004, these costs exceeded 2003 levels
by $2.4 million. Increases in the Company’s stock price resulted in a $1.0 million
charge associated with stock-based Board of Directors’ fees. Other general corporate
cost increases in 2004 included a $0.8 million increase in legal and patent costs, a $0.5
million increase in FDA information system compliance programs, and an additional $0.4
million of Sarbanes-Oxley related audit costs. These cost increases were partially offset
by lower management incentive compensation costs. In 2003, general corporate costs were
$4.3 million above those incurred in 2002. The increase in 2003 general corporate costs
over 2002 was led by higher insurance costs of $1.5 million and stock-based Board of
Directors’ fee increases of $1.0 million. The remaining 2003 over 2002 general
corporate cost increases were principally attributed to expenses associated with
implementing Sarbanes-Oxley requirements, including the newly created position of Chief
Compliance Officer, increased internal audit staffing and higher incentive bonus awards.

In 2004, the Company incurred $1.7
million in legal costs associated with finalizing regulatory investigations and responding
to plaintiffs in three lawsuits filed in connection with the Kinston explosion and related
fire. Similar costs in 2003 were reported as part of the Insurance Settlement line of the
income statement.

During 2004, the Company awarded
378,900 shares of performance vesting restricted shares to key employees under the 2004
Stock-Based Compensation Plan. The shares vest over three performance periods; a maximum
of 129,232 shares were eligible to vest according to 2004 annual results, a maximum of
124,834 shares could vest according to the combined 2004 and 2005 results, and a maximum
of 124,834 shares could vest according to the results achieved over the three-year period
ending December 31, 2006. The ultimate amount of shares that will vest is determined by
the achievement of certain performance targets involving annual growth rates on revenue
and return on invested capital. For the performance periods ending in 2005 and 2006,
additional shares may be granted if the performance levels exceed certain targets. As the
ultimate number of shares that will be awarded will not be known until the end of these
performance periods, the plan is accounted for as a variable award plan and compensation
expense is recognized over the performance period(s) based on an estimate of the number of
shares that will vest, taking into account the performance criteria and the market price of
the stock at the end of each period until the final award is determined. Based upon the
performance targets achieved in 2004 and management’s estimate of the results
expected for the awards earned over the two- and three-year performance periods ending in
2005 and 2006, the Company recognized a charge of $5.1 million in 2004. Of the 129,232
shares eligible to vest in 2004, 117,782 shares vested and 11,450 shares expired according
to the performance levels achieved for the year.

The recovery of the U.S. stock market
in 2003 and its continued positive performance in 2004 has increased the value of the
Company’s pension plan assets, resulting in greater investment income in the pension
plan and a $1.4 million decrease in U.S. pension plan expenses in 2004. In 2005, U.S.
pension plan expenses are expected to remain approximately even with 2004 levels, as the
favorable impact of higher asset values and investment returns will be offset by higher
benefit obligation liabilities resulting from the decrease in the discount rate (5.75% at
December 31, 2004, versus 6.00% at December 31, 2003) used to measure plan liabilities.

During 2003, the Company completed
the implementation of a new financial consolidation system and finalized several
electronic billing and website improvement projects initiated in 2002. In 2005, the
Company will begin a project to upgrade cash disbursement, general ledger and other
production control systems in North America. Management estimates incremental project
expenses of $1.2 million in 2005, with additional related capital spending of $4.8
million.

INSURANCE SETTLEMENT

On January 29, 2003, the
Company’s Kinston, N.C., plant suffered an explosion and related fire that resulted
in six deaths, a number of injured personnel and substantial damage to the building,
machinery and equipment and raw material inventories. The Company’s property and
business interruption coverage with its principal insurer provided for a maximum insurance
recovery of $66 million. The Company and its insurer reached a consensus that the total
losses for business interruption, insured incremental costs and property replacement would
exceed the maximum recoverable amount, resulting in the final settlement of the insurance
claim for the full $66 million reimbursement. The final accounting for the insurance
settlement and related costs is presented below:

RESTRUCTURING CHARGES

During 2004, the Company finalized
the closure of a plastic device manufacturing plant in the U.K. The plant operations
utilized leased facilities, with lease terms ending in 2010. In connection with the
exit from the plant, the Company recorded $1.0 million of restructuring charges in 2004,
principally consisting of the excess of future lease costs over expected sub-lease rental
income, as well as additional severance expense and repair costs necessary to return the
leased facility to its original condition.

In December 2003, the Company
recorded a $7.0 million charge associated with the planned closure of the plastic device
manufacturing plant located in the U.K. referred to above. The decision to close the plant
followed a decision by a marketing and distribution partner for the Company’s
customer to terminate its involvement with the principal product produced by the facility.
Accordingly, the Company recorded a $6.0 million impairment charge for the difference
between the carrying value and the expected fair value of the equipment at this site. A
related charge of $1.0 million was also recorded for statutory post-employment benefit
costs deemed probable of being paid.

OTHER EXPENSE (INCOME)

Other Expense (Income) was $1.5
million, $0.6 million and $(1.6) million for years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. In
2004, the majority of the expense related to losses on surplus equipment sales and asset
impairment adjustments. The 2003 expense principally represents foreign currency
transaction losses. As a result of the devaluation of the Argentine peso, the
Company’s subsidiary in Argentina recorded a foreign exchange gain of $1.7 million on
assets denominated in non-peso currencies in 2002.

INTEREST EXPENSE (NET)

The following table summarizes the
Company’s net interest expense for the three-year period ended December 31, 2004:

($ in millions)                                 2004      2003       2002

     Interest expense (net)                          $7.0       $7.5      $9.5
     ==========================================================================

Net interest expense declined $0.5 million
in 2004 compared to 2003 results, largely as a result of lower average debt levels and an
increase in capitalized interest associated with the Kinston construction project. In
2003, net interest expense declined $2.0 million from 2002 levels. The majority of the
2003 decrease was due to interest income generated from advances made to customers in
connection with tooling and mold design projects. The remaining decrease in 2003 net
interest expense was attributed to lower interest rates, as average debt levels remained
essentially constant with those of 2002.

INCOME TAXES

The effective tax rate on
consolidated income from continuing operations was 27.0% in 2004, 36.0% in 2003 and 28.9%
in 2002.

The 2004 effective tax rate was
favorably impacted by a change in French tax law extending the life of net operating loss
carryforwards, the use of U.S. foreign tax credits that were previously expected to expire unutilized and the favorable resolution of
several prior year tax issues. The combined impact of these items, offset partially by
the non-deductible restructuring charge, resulted in a 4.5% reduction in the 2004
effective tax rate. The 2003 effective tax rate was unfavorably affected by the impairment
charge in the U.K., which did not result in a tax benefit, as management did not expect to
generate future taxable income in the specific U.K. legal entity sufficient to utilize net
operating loss carryforwards. Additionally, management provided a $0.5 million valuation
allowance on a deferred tax asset connected with this location that was unlikely to be
realized. These items increased the 2003 effective tax rate by 3.7%. The 2002 effective
tax rate was favorably affected by a $2.4 million tax benefit realized upon the change in
a U.S. tax law related to loss disallowance rules, partially offset by the tax impact of a
foreign exchange gain in Argentina and a non-deductible restructuring charge related to
the impairment of a technology investment, resulting in a 4.0% decrease to the 2002
effective tax rate.

EQUITY IN AFFILIATES

The contribution to earnings from a
25% ownership interest in Daikyo Seiko, Ltd. in Japan and a 49% ownership interest in
three companies in Mexico was income of $3.4 million in 2004, income of $1.6 million in
2003, and a loss of $0.3 million in 2002. The 2004 results from Daikyo improved by $1.0
million over 2003, reflecting a combination of improved sales results, a non-recurr ing
investment gain, a decrease in income tax rates and the continuing strength of the
Japanese Yen versus the U.S. dollar. Daikyo’s improved sales results were favorably
affected by orders from customers in advance of raw material changes initiated by
suppliers of coating materials and by increased sales of pre-fillable syringes using Resin
CZ® plastics. (Resin CZ® is a registered trademark of Daikyo Seiko, Ltd.) The
2004 results of the Mexican affiliates improved by $0.8 million over 2003 levels,
including a $0.6 million gain on the sale of real estate. Equity earnings in 2003 were
$1.9 million above 2002 levels, reflecting a strong sales year for Daikyo and break-even
results for the Mexican affiliates following losses in 2002 associated with the
restructuring of plant operations.

Company purchases from all affiliates
totaled approximately $28.6 million in 2004, $18.4 million in 2003 and $11.5 million in
2002, the majority of which relates to a distributorship agreement allowing the Company to
purchase and re-sell Daikyo products. Sales to affiliates were $0.6 million, $0.7 million
and $1.0 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

INCOME FROM CONTINUING
OPERATIONS

Net income from continuing operations
in 2004 was $33.5 million, or $1.09 per diluted share. Results for 2004 include
incremental manufacturing costs of $11.6 million ($7.9 million, net of tax, or $0.26 per
share) in connection with the interim production processes that were put in place
following the Kinston accident. In the prior year these incremental manufacturing costs
were reimbursed under insurance coverage. 2004 results also include Kinston-related legal
expenses of $1.7 million ($1.2 million net of tax, or $0.04 per share). The closure of a
manufacturing plant in the U.K. resulted in 2004 restructuring charges of $1.0 million
($0.03 per share). Equity income included a $0.6 million ($0.02 per share) real estate
gain. 2004 results also include $2.1 million ($0.07 per share) of favorable tax
adjustments resulting from a change in French tax law extending the life of net operating loss
carryforwards, the use of U.S. foreign tax credits that were previously expected to expire
unutilized and the favorable resolution of several prior year tax issues.

Net income from continuing operations
in 2003 was $42.9 million, or $1.48 per diluted share. Results for 2003 included a net
gain from an insurance settlement of $17.3 million ($12.1 million, net of tax), or $0.42
per share, and asset impairment and post-employment benefit charges at the U.K. device
operation of $7.0 million ($7.5 million including a related tax charge), or $0.26 per
share.

The Company’s 2002 net income
from continuing operations was $22.6 million, or $0.78 per share. These results included
restructuring charges of $9.9 million ($7.4 million, net of tax), or $0.26 per share,
primarily related to the termination of an information systems project and a write-down of
an investment in a genetic research technology company. Results also included $0.8
million, or $0.03 per share, of severance and plant shutdown costs from the Company’s
49% ownership interest in Mexico. Offsetting these costs was a $1.7 million ($0.8 million,
net of tax), or $0.03 per share, foreign exchange gain associated with the devaluation of
the Argentine peso and a $2.4 million, or $0.09 per share, tax benefit associated with the
2001 sale of a manufacturing facility in Puerto Rico.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

In December 2004, the Company entered
into a Share and Asset Purchase Agreement to sell its drug delivery business to Archimedes
Pharma Limited, a new company formed by Warburg Pincus Private Equity VIII and Warburg
Pincus International Partners to facilitate the acquisition. At the February 2005 closing
date, the Company received consideration of $7.1 million, consisting of cash and
indebtedness assumed by the new company. In addition, the Company received a 14% ownership
interest in the new company valued at $1.0 million which will be accounted for under the
cost method. As a result of the transaction, the Company recorded a pre-tax loss of $4.7
million ($5.2 million after-tax, or $0.17 per diluted share). The $0.5 million net tax
expense is primarily the result of the reversal of current and prior year tax benefits
that may no longer be available as a result of the transaction.

The Company also announced in
December of 2004 that it intends to exit the clinical services business within the next
year. The net book value of the facility and goodwill connected with the clinical services
unit totaled $2.2 million at December 31, 2004. Based on current positive operating trends
for this business and preliminary discussions with potential buyers, management believes
that it will recover the book value of the assets in a disposal transaction, and
accordingly no impairment loss was recorded in 2004.

The pre-tax loss from discontinued
drug delivery and clinical services operations was $13.5 million, $17.5 million and $15.7
million for each of the years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The 2002 results include
$0.7 million of costs associated with the former contract manufacturing and consumer
healthcare units.

In 2002, the Company also recorded a
$5.9 million, or $0.20 per share, tax benefit in discontinued operations connected with
the 2001 disposition of the contract manufacturing and packaging business. This tax
benefit and related refund resulted from a change in U.S. tax law in 2002 related to loss
disallowance rules.

FINANCIAL CONDITION,
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The collection of insurance
receivables and strong cash flow from operations led to a $31.0 million increase in the
cash balance at December 31, 2004 compared to 2003. Accounts receivable and inventory
turnover ratios remained consistent with prior year results. Working capital totaled
$110.0 million and the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 1.9 to 1 at
December 31, 2004.

Consolidated debt was $160.8 million
at December 31, 2004. Debt to total invested capital (total debt and shareholders’
equity) was 34.8% at December 31, 2004, a 5.7 percentage point improvement over year-end
2003, with shareholders’ equity benefiting from additional capital provided by stock
option exercises and from favorable currency translation on non-U.S. dollar net assets.

Cash flows generated from operations
totaled $81.0 million in 2004, compared to $83.7 million in 2003. The Company’s
European and Asian business units continued to provide strong cash flow results,
offsetting declining results in the Americas’ region, which were affected by
increased costs related to Kinston interim production programs and start-up costs at the
new plant. Other operating cash flows include $9.2 million of insurance collections
received in 2004 that helped offset the payment of liabilities related to the 2003 Kinston
accident.

Capital spending for 2004 totaled
$57.4 million. The construction of the new Kinston molding operation accounted for $13.1
million of the 2004 capital spent. Other major capital projects included the expansion of
the Stolberg, Germany, metal and plastics facility ($5.1 million) and additional
manufacturing capacity for the Westar® product line at the Jersey Shore, Pa., plant
($2.4 million). The remaining capital spending consists of efficiency, safety and
infrastructure improvements ($11.6 million), new manufacturing equipment purchases ($11.5
million), additional new product and expansion projects ($7.3 million), plastic and rubber
tooling projects ($3.4 million), and information system upgrades ($3.0
million). The Company anticipates that total 2005 capital spending will be approximately
$50.0 million, of which 60% is scheduled to be used for new equipment, efficiency, safety
and infrastructure improvements and tooling projects, 27% for new product and expansion
projects and the remainder for information technology systems and equipment.

Cash provided by investing activities
in 2004 includes $31.8 million of insurance proceeds related to the Kinston accident,
which helped to fund construction of the new facility. Other investing cash flows
included $0.5 million of proceeds received on miscellaneous equipment sales and a $0.6
million payment from the Company’s affiliate in Mexico in partial satisfaction of a
note receivable.

Financing cash flows include proceeds
from stock option exercises of $13.5 million and dividends paid to shareholders totaling
$12.8 million ($0.425 per share). The Board of Directors intends to continue the practice
of declaring dividends following its quarterly review of the Company’s financial
condition. Management expects that cash flows from continuing operations, net of capital
spending requirements, will provide sufficient funding for the current dividend policy.

The following table summarizes the
Company’s contractual obligations at December 31, 2004, and the effect the
obligations are expected to have on its liquidity and cash flow in future periods:

=======================================================================================

(1)    
          At December 31, 2004, the $50.8 million of borrowings under the revolving credit
          facility maturing in January 2009 bear interest at LIBOR plus a margin (0.7% at
          December 31, 2004) and the $100.0 million of senior notes maturing in April 2009
          bear interest at 6.81% payable quarterly and such interest payments are expected
          to be $1.2 million and $6.8 million, respectively, per year until the maturity
          of the agreements. Expected interest payments related to the revolving credit
          facility will fluctuate based on changes in LIBOR, the Company’s debt to
          total capital ratio, and changes in the amount of outstanding borrowings.

The Company has letters of credit
totaling $4.0 million supporting the reimbursement of workers’ compensation and other
claims paid on West’s behalf by insurance carriers. The Company’s accrual for
insurance obligations was $3.4 million at December 31, 2004.

On May 17, 2004, the Company replaced
its existing revolving credit facility. The new agreement, involving a group of six banks,
provides a $125.0 million committed revolving credit facility through January 5, 2009.
Financing costs on the new credit facility of $0.5 million were deferred and are being
amortized over the life of the agreement. Under the new agreement, the Company’s
Leverage Ratio (the ratio of total debt less cash to consolidated capitalization) may not
exceed 50% and its Consolidated Net Worth (shareholders equity, excluding cumulative
translation adjustments) must be at least $198.9 million plus half of any net income after
taxes earned after December 31, 2003. As of December 31, 2004, the Company’s Leverage
Ratio was 24.9%, its Consolidated Net Worth stood at $258.3 million and the Company was in
compliance with all debt covenants. Failure to meet these or other debt covenants would
cause all borrowings under the revolving credit facility, as well as $100.0 million of
senior notes, to become immediately due and payable and may trigger early payment
penalties.

Interest costs on notes drawn under
the revolving credit facility are primarily based on London Interbank Offering Rates plus
an applicable margin ranging from 0.70% to 1.20% dependent on the Company’s Leverage
Ratio. In addition, the Company must pay an annual facility fee ranging from 0.175% to
0.30% during the commitment period as determined by the Leverage Ratio. As of December 31,
2004, the Company had borrowed $50.8 million under the revolving credit facility.

The Company believes that its
financial condition, current capitalization and expected income from operations will be
sufficient to meet the Company’s future expected cash requirements.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING
POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

Management’s discussion and
analysis addresses consolidated financial statements that are prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The application of these
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions, some of which are
subjective and complex, that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial
statements. Management believes the following accounting policies and estimates are
critical to understanding and evaluating the results of operations and financial position
of the Company:

REVENUE RECOGNITION:

Sales of
manufactured components are recorded at the time title and risk of loss passes to the
customer. Some customers receive pricing rebates upon attaining established sales volumes.
Management records rebate costs based on its assessment of the likelihood that these
volumes will be attained. The Company also establishes product return liabilities for
customer quality claims when such amounts are deemed probable and can be reasonably
estimated. Revenue associated with tooling and other engineering service agreements is
recognized as services are performed in relation to management’s estimate of the
total costs to be incurred on the agreement. For agreements with multiple deliverables,
the Company assesses whether more than one unit of accounting exists. If more than one
unit exists, revenue for each separate unit is recorded as earned.

IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS:

The Company
reviews goodwill and long-lived assets (principally property, plant and equipment and
patents) annually and whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these
assets may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment as part of the reporting
unit to which it belongs. The Company has determined its reporting units to be the
Americas, Europe/Asia and Device Group divisions of the Pharmaceutical Systems segment.
For assets held and used in the business, management estimates the future cash flows to be
derived from the related asset or business unit. For assets held for sale, management
determines fair value by estimating the anticipated proceeds to be received upon the sale
of the asset, less costs to sell. Changes in management’s estimate of fair value,
including management’s estimate of future cash flows, could have a material impact on
the Company’s future results of operations and financial position.

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS:

The measurement of
the obligations under the Company’s defined benefit pension and post-retirement
medical plans are subject to a number of assumptions. These include the rate of return on
plan assets and the rate at which the future obligations are discounted to present value.
For U.S. plans, which account for over 90% of global plan assets, the long-term rate of
return assumption remained at 9.0%. This return assumption was determined by reviewing the
expected mix of plan assets (approximately 65% equity and 35% debt securities) and the
projected return over a 10-year period. The discount rate was reduced 25 basis points to
5.75% on December 31, 2004, to reflect current market conditions. Changes in these
estimates, including the market performance of plan assets and other actuarial
assumptions, could have a material impact on the Company’s future results of
operations and financial position. Every 25 basis point reduction in the long-term rate of
return assumption would increase pension expense by approximately $0.4 million. A 25 basis
point reduction in the discount rate would increase pension expense by approximately $0.6
million. In addition, restructuring events such as plant closures or changes in pension
plan provisions could result in curtailment or settlement of pension plan obligations,
which would result in gain or loss recognition in the period when such an event occurs.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION:

The Company
currently accounts for employee stock options and other stock-based compensation under the
intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees”. According to the intrinsic value
method, compensation cost for stock options is measured as the excess, if any, of the
quoted market price of the stock at the date of the option grant over the exercise price.
The Company has not recorded any compensation cost for stock options as the grants were
made at 100% of the fair market value of the stock at the grant date. As permitted under
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard 123 “Share-Based Payment” (FAS 123),
the Company discloses the impact of applying a fair value approach to measure stock option
expense in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included within Item 8
of this report.

In December 2004, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board revised FAS 123. The revised statement prohibits the use of the
intrinsic value method and requires the use of a fair-value based measurement method in
accounting for share-based payment transactions with employees. The requirements of the
revised FAS 123 standard are mandatory for interim reporting periods beginning after June
15, 2005. The Company plans to adopt the statement early on January 1, 2005 using the
modified prospective method. Under this method, stock-based employee compensation cost
will be recognized for all new awards granted after January 1, 2005. Additionally,
compensation costs for unvested stock options and awards that are outstanding at January
1, 2005 will be recognized over the requisite service period based on the grant-date fair
value of those options and awards as previously calculated under the pro-forma disclosures
under FAS 123. Management expects the compensation expense associated with stock options
and employee stock purchase programs to impact full year diluted earnings per share from
continuing operations by approximately $.03 – $.05 per share in 2005.

INCOME TAXES:

The Company estimates
income taxes payable based upon current domestic and international tax legislation. In
addition, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are established to recognize
differences between the tax basis and financial statement carrying values of the
Company’s assets and liabilities. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce
deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. The
recoverability of tax assets is subject to the Company’s estimates of future
profitability, generally at the local subsidiary company and country level. Changes in tax
legislation, business plans and other factors may affect the ultimate recoverability of
tax assets or final tax payments, which could result in adjustments to tax expense in the
period such change is determined.

In October 2004, the American Jobs
Creation Act of 2004 (the “Act”) was signed into law. The Act creates a temporary incentive for
U.S. corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an 85 percent
dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations.  The
deduction is subject to a number of limitations.  On March 5, 2005, the Company’s Board of
Directors approved a plan to repatriate up to $70 million, representing existing cash balances at qualified
controlled foreign corporations.  The repatriated funds will principally be used to pay down existing
domestic debt.  The Company will be required to allocate tax expense to repatriating distributions
under the Act in its 2005 quarterly and annual financial statements.  The Act ’s 85 percent
exclusion of qualifying dividends reduces the 35% U.S. federal statutory rate to 5.25% of
distributions.  However, the determination of allocable expense to distributions will depend on,
among other things, the Company's affirmative elections to apply the special tax law to each
distribution, the 2005 actual earnings and tax expense of each distributing entity and of the U.S.
parent company, the Company's ability to credit foreign taxes against the resulting federal tax, the
effect of U.S. state taxes on the distribution and the reversal of provisions for deferred taxes on certain
unremitted earnings of prior periods.  The Company currently estimates that its first quarter 2005 tax

Please refer to Note 1: Summary of

additional information on accounting and reporting standards considered in the preparation
and presentation of the Company’s financial statements.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT
REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION

Certain statements contained in this
Report or in other Company documents and made by management of the Company orally may
contain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform
Act of 1995. These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate
strictly to historic or current facts. They use words such as “estimate,”
“expect,” “intend,” “believe,” “plan,”
“anticipate” and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any
discussion of future operating or financial performance or condition. In particular, these
include statements concerning future actions, future performance or results of current and
anticipated products, sales efforts, expenses, the outcome of contingencies such as legal
proceedings and financial results.

Because actual results are affected by risks
and uncertainties, the Company cautions investors that actual results may differ materially from
those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statement.

It is not
possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties, but factors that could
cause the actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results
include, but are not limited to: sales demand; the timing of customers’ projects and
the commercial success of customers’ new products incorporating the Company’s
products and services; the maintenance or improvement of production efficiencies and
overhead absorption; the Company’s ability to maintain its market position and
pricing in the face of lower-cost competitors, particularly in the European marketplace;
the Company’s ability to develop and market value-added proprietary products; the
average profitability, or mix, of products sold in a reporting period; financial
performance of uncontrolled affiliates; strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar,
particularly in relation to the Euro, U.K. pound, Danish Krone and Singapore Dollar;
inflation; potential price increases in raw materials, including those that are
petroleum-based, and the continued availability of raw materials; the successful
resolution of Kinston-related litigation and the adequacy of applicable insurance
coverage; realization by the Company of its investment in the clinical services operation
upon disposition; and the impact of recent tax legislation relating to repatriation of
foreign earnings.

The Company assumes no obligation to
update forward-looking statements as circumstances change. Investors are advised to
consult any further disclosures that the Company makes or has made on related subjects in
the Company’s Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk

.

The Company is exposed to market risk
from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The following
describes the nature of these risks. All debt securities and derivative instruments are
considered non-trading.

Foreign Currency Exchange
Risk

The Company has subsidiaries outside
the U.S. accounting for approximately 50% of consolidated net sales. Virtually all of
these sales and related operating costs are denominated in the currency of the local
country and translated into U.S. dollars. Although the majority of the assets and
liabilities of these subsidiaries are in the local currency of the subsidiary and are
therefore translated into U.S. dollars, the foreign subsidiaries may hold assets or
liabilities not denominated in their local currency. These items may give rise to foreign
currency transaction gains and losses. As a result, the Company’s results of
operations and financial position are exposed to changing exchange rates. The Company
periodically uses forward contracts to hedge certain transactions or to neutralize
month-end balance sheet exposures on cross currency intercompany loans. The Company has a
number of forward contracts totaling $800,000 as of December 31, 2004 to purchase various
currencies in Europe and Asia.

Interest Rate Risk

As a result of its normal borrowing
activities the Company is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, which the Company
manages primarily through its financing activities. The Company has short- and long- term
debt with both fixed and variable interest rates. Short-term debt is primarily comprised
of notes payable to banks under lines of credit at variable interest rates. Long-term debt
consists of $100,000,000 in senior notes at a fixed rate of interest and revolving credit
facilities at variable rates.

The following table summarizes the
Company’s interest rate risk-sensitive instruments:

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

(in thousands, except share and per share data)

Note 1: Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation:

The financial
statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States. These principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and revenue and expenses and the
disclosure of contingencies in the financial statements. Actual amounts realized may
differ from these estimates.

Principles of Consolidation:

In
deciding which entities should be reported on a consolidated basis, the Company first
determines whether the entity is a variable interest entity (“VIE”) as defined
in Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation No. 46. If an
entity meets the criteria for VIE status, the Company consolidates that entity if the
Company has the obligation to absorb more than 50% of the entity’s expected losses or
receive more than 50% of the entity’s expected residual returns. If an entity does
not meet the criteria for VIE status, the Company consolidates those in which it has
control. Investments in joint ventures and other companies in which the Company does not
have control, but the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and
financial policies, are accounted for by the equity method. Investments in which the
Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and
financial policies are carried at cost. Material intercompany transactions and accounts
are eliminated in consolidation.

Cash and Cash Equivalents:

Cash
equivalents include time deposits, certificates of deposit and all highly liquid debt
instruments with original maturities of three months or less.

Accounts Receivable:

The
Company’s accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2004 and 2003, was net of an
allowance for doubtful accounts of $500 and $700, respectively. The Company records the
allowance based on a specific identification methodology.

Inventories:

Inventories are valued
at the lower of cost or market. The cost of inventories located in the U.S. is determined
on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. The cost of inventories located outside the U.S.
is determined principally on the average cost method.

Foreign Currency Translation:

Foreign
currency transaction gains and losses and translation gains and losses of subsidiaries
operating in high-inflation economies are recognized in the determination of net income.
Foreign currency translation adjustments of other subsidiaries and affiliates operating
outside the U.S. are accumulated in other comprehensive income, a separate component of
shareholders’ equity.

Financial Instruments:

The Company
records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. The change in fair value of a
derivative designated and qualified as part of a hedging transaction is recorded each
period in earnings or other comprehensive income depending on the type of hedging
instrument. The change in fair value of a derivative instrument with no hedging
designation or purpose is recognized immediately into earnings.

The Company uses interest rate swaps
and forward exchange contracts to minimize the economic exposure related to fluctuating
interest and foreign exchange rates. Interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow
hedges; therefore, unrealized gains and losses are recorded in other comprehensive income.
As the underlying transaction occurs, any unrealized gains or losses on the related hedge
are reclassified from other comprehensive income to the statement of income (interest
expense), offsetting the income effects of the transaction to which they relate. Gains and
losses on forward exchange contracts designated as fair value hedges, primarily related to
raw material purchase commitments, are deferred and recognized as part of the underlying
transaction. Forward contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recorded at
fair value with any gains or losses recognized in other expense (income). The Company also
engages in hedges of its net investments in foreign operations in order to minimize the
economic exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates. Fair value adjustments for hedges
of the net investment in foreign operations are reported in other comprehensive income as
foreign currency translation adjustments and are released to earnings upon disposal of the
investment.

Revenue Recognition:

Sales of
manufactured components are recorded at the time title and risk of loss passes to the
customer. Some customers receive pricing rebates upon attaining established sales volumes.
Management records rebate costs based on its assessment of the likelihood that these
volumes will be attained. The Company also establishes product return liabilities for
customer quality claims when such amounts are deemed probable and can be reasonably
estimated. Revenue associated with tooling and other engineering service agreements is
recognized as services are performed in relation to management’s estimate of the
total costs to be incurred on the agreement. For agreements with multiple deliverables,
the Company assesses whether more than one unit of accounting exists. If more than one
unit exists, revenue for each separate unit is recorded as earned.

Shipping and Handling Costs:

Net
sales includes shipping and handling costs collected from customers in connection with the
sale. Costs incurred for shipping and handling are included in cost of sales.

Property, Plant and Equipment:

Property, plant and equipment assets are carried at cost. Maintenance and minor repairs
and renewals are charged to expense as incurred. Costs incurred for computer software
developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized for application development
activities and immediately expensed for preliminary project activities or
post-implementation activities. Upon sale or retirement of depreciable assets, costs and
related accumulated depreciation are eliminated, and gains or losses are recognized in
other expense (income). Depreciation is computed principally on the straight-line method
over the estimated useful lives of the assets, or the remaining term of the lease, if
shorter.

Goodwill and Other Intangibles:

Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment on at least
an annual basis or more frequently if an event occurs that indicates that there could be
an impairment. The first step of the impairment test compares the fair value of a
reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the
reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step is performed. The second step
compares the carrying amount of the goodwill to its implied fair value. The implied fair
value is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the
assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a
business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid
to acquire the reporting unit. The excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the
amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. If
the fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is
recorded. Other intangible assets, including patents and licensed technology, are recorded
at cost and are amortized on a straight-line method over their useful lives. The Company
capitalizes patent application costs and expenses other costs incurred in patent
development.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

:
Long-lived assets including property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets subject
to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever circumstances indicate that the
carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. An asset is considered impaired if
the carrying value of the asset exceeds the sum of the future expected undiscounted cash
flows to be derived from the asset. Once an asset is considered impaired, an impairment
loss is recorded for the difference between the asset’s carrying value and its fair
value. This loss is included in operating profit. For assets to be held and used in the
business, management determines fair value by estimating the future cash flows to be
derived from the asset and discounts these flows to a net present value using an
appropriate discount rate. For assets held for sale or for investment purposes, management
determines fair value by estimating the anticipated proceeds to be received upon sale of
the asset, less costs to sell.

Research and Development:

Research,
development and engineering expenditures are for the creation and application of new or
improved products and processes. Expenditures include primarily salaries and outside
services for those directly involved in research and development activities. Research and
development costs of $6,400 in 2004, $6,300 in 2003 and $5,400 in 2002, were expensed as
incurred.

Environmental Remediation and
Compliance Costs:

Environmental remediation costs are accrued when such costs are probable
and reasonable estimates are determinable. Cost estimates are not discounted and include
investigation, cleanup and monitoring activities; such estimates are adjusted, if
necessary, based on additional findings. In general, environmental compliance costs are
expensed. Environmental compliance costs at current operating sites are capitalized if
they increase the value of the property and/or prevent environmental hazards from
occurring.

Litigation:

The Company is from time
to time party to lawsuits arising from its operations. The Company records liabilities
when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. These estimates are based on an
analysis made by internal and external legal counsel considering information known at the
time.

Income Taxes:

Deferred income taxes
are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates, applicable to future years, to
temporary differences between the tax bases and financial statement carrying values of the
Company’s assets and liabilities. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce
deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. U.S. income
taxes and withholding taxes are accrued on the portion of earnings of international
subsidiaries and affiliates (which are corporate joint ventures) intended to be remitted
to the parent company.

Stock-Based Compensation:

The Company
accounts for stock-based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in
Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees,” and related interpretations. Under the intrinsic value method,
compensation cost for stock options and other stock awards is measured as the excess, if
any, of the quoted market price of the Company’s stock at the date of the grant over
the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock. Compensation expense for restricted
stock and other stock awards is measured under the intrinsic value method and amortized
into expense over the required service or vesting period. The Company did not record
compensation cost for stock options granted in the years ended 2004, 2003 and 2002,
because the stock option grants were at 100% of fair market value of the stock on the
grant date. The Company also did not record compensation cost for shares issued under the
employee stock purchase plan as the plan meets the APB No. 25 criteria for a
non-compensatory plan. If the fair value based method prescribed in Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,”
had been applied to stock option grants and shares issued under the employee stock
purchase plan in the most recent three years, the Company’s net income and basic and
diluted net income per share would have been reduced as summarized below:

2004      2003       2002
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Net income, as reported:                            $  19,400  $ 31,900  $  18,400

    Diluted, pro forma                                 $     .59  $   1.05  $     .59
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In 2004, the Company accelerated the
vesting dates for options held by employees of the drug delivery business resulting in a
$600 charge recorded in discontinued operations.

Net Income (Loss) Per Share:

Basic
net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted
average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period. Net income (loss)
per share assuming dilution considers the potential issuance of common shares under the
Company’s stock option and award plans, based on the treasury stock method. The
treasury stock method assumes the use of exercise proceeds to repurchase common stock at
the average fair market value in the period.

Note 2: Discontinued
Operations

In December 2004, the Company entered
into a Share and Asset Purchase Agreement to sell its drug delivery business to Archimedes
Pharma Limited, a new company formed by Warburg Pincus Private Equity VIII and Warburg
Pincus International Partners to facilitate the acquisition. At the February 2005 closing
date, the Company received consideration of $7,100 consisting of cash and indebtedness
assumed by the new company. In addition, the Company received a 14% ownership interest in
the new company valued at $1.0 million which will be accounted for under the cost method.
As a result of the transaction, the Company recorded a pre-tax loss of $4,700 ($5,200
after-tax, or $0.17 per diluted share). The $500 net tax provision is primarily the result
of the reversal of current and prior year tax benefits that may no longer be available as
a result of the transaction.

The Company also announced in
December of 2004 that it intends to exit the clinical services business within the next
year. The net book value of the facility and goodwill connected with the clinical services
unit totaled $2,200 at December 31, 2004. Based on current positive operating trends for
this business and preliminary discussions with potential buyers, management believes that
it will recover the book value of the assets in a disposal transaction, and accordingly no
impairment loss was recorded in 2004.

In December 2002, the Company sold
its consumer healthcare research business located in Indianapolis, Ind. This business unit
was previously a part of the Drug Delivery Systems segment. The sales price totaled
$2,000, consisting of $1,900 cash and $100 in escrow. Cash proceeds from the sale were
used to repay the Company’s debt. During 2002 but prior to the sale of the business,
the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $600; as a result, there was no gain
or loss recorded on the sale of the business. The results of this business have been
reflected as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements
for all periods presented.

The pre-tax loss from discontinued
drug delivery and clinical services operations was $13,500, $17,500 and $15,700 for each
of the years 2004, 2003, and 2002 respectively. The 2002 results include $700 of costs
associated with the former contract manufacturing and consumer healthcare units.

In 2002
the Company also recorded a $5,900, or $0.20 per share, tax benefit in discontinued
operations connected with the 2001 disposition of the contract manufacturing and packaging
business. This tax benefit resulted from a change in U.S. tax law in 2002 related to loss
disallowance rules.

Net sales and income from
discontinued operations were as follows:

==============================================================================

During 2004, the Company recorded
$1,000 of net charges principally consisting of the excess of future lease costs over
expected sub-lease rental income, as well as additional severance expense and repair costs
necessary to return the leased facility to its original condition.

In 2003, the Company recorded a
$7,000 charge associated with a decision to discontinue a product line intended for
production at the Company’s plastic device plant located in the U.K., a part of the
Pharmaceutical Systems segment. The charge consisted of a $6,000 impairment of fixed
assets, including related asset retirement obligations, and a $1,000 provision for
statutory post-employment benefit obligations for approximately 70 employees. As the
Company’s fair value projections for the unit significantly relied on the achievement
of sales from this product line, the carrying value of the long-lived assets could no
longer be supported.

In 2002, the Company’s
continuing operations included a $9,900 restructuring charge connected with the
termination of an information systems implementation project, an impairment of a
technology company investment, the closure of a sales office in Korea and other employee
terminations. The $800 severance provision covered 19 employee terminations connected with
these actions that were completed in the fourth quarter of 2002. In addition to severance,
the restructuring charge included a $5,800 write-off of the information systems
implementation project, $500 for contract termination fees related to the information
systems project and a $2,800 impairment of the Company’s investment in a genotyping
technology firm.

The restructuring obligations at
December 31, 2004 are expected to be paid within the next year.

Note 4: Kinston

On January 29, 2003, the
Company’s Kinston, N.C., plant suffered an explosion and related fire that resulted
in six deaths, a number of injured personnel and substantial damage to the building,
machinery and equipment and raw material inventories. The Company’s property and
business interruption insurance coverage with its principal insurer provided for a maximum
insurance recovery of $66,000. In February 2004, the Company and its insurer reached a
consensus that the total losses for business interruption, insured incremental costs and
property replacement would exceed the maximum recoverable amount, resulting in the final
settlement of the insurance claim for the full $66,000 reimbursement. This settlement is
reflected in the Company’s results as of December 31, 2003.

The accounting for the insurance
settlement and related costs is presented below:

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Insurance coverage reimbursement                                  $ 66,000
   Less costs and expenses
      Business interruption costs                                       9,800
      Insured incremental costs                                        15,800
      Book value of property and equipment                             11,700
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Gain on insurance settlement                                        28,700
   Uninsured costs incurred                                            11,400
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Insurance settlement                                              $ 17,300
   ===========================================================================

As of December 31, 2003, the Company
had received $25,000 from its principal insurer; therefore, the Company had recorded an
insurance receivable of $41,000 as of December 31, 2003. The Company received payment of
this receivable in February of 2004.

As a consequence of the 2003
insurance settlement, no further insurance coverage was available for costs incurred in
subsequent periods. In 2004, business interruption costs of $11,600 and legal expenses of
$1,700 were incurred and included in cost of goods sold and selling, general and
administrative expenses, respectively.

   ==============================================================================

In 2002, the Company’s
subsidiary in Argentina recorded a pre-tax foreign currency exchange gain of $1,700 on net
assets denominated in non-peso currencies due to the devaluation of the Argentine peso.

Note 6: Income Taxes

Income before income taxes from
continuing operations was derived as follows:

A reconciliation of the U.S.
statutory corporate tax rate to the Company’s effective consolidated tax rate on
income before income taxes from continuing operations follows:

2004     2003      2002

   Effective tax rate, continuing operations               27.0%     36.0%     28.9%
   ==================================================================================

As a result of a 2004 change in
French tax law extending the life of certain net operating loss carryforwards and the use
of U.S. foreign tax credits and Danish net operating loss deductions that were previously
expected to expire unutilized, the Company reversed related valuation allowances, resulting
in a 2.6 percentage point decrease in the 2004 effective tax rate. The 2004 effective tax
rate was further reduced by 3.0 percentage points (included in the above reconciliation
under the line item labeled ‘other’) as a result of resolving certain prior year
tax issues.

In 2002, the Company recorded a tax
benefit associated with the 2001 disposition of its contract manufacturing and packaging
business and the shutdown of a plastic device manufacturing facility. Of the total
benefit, $5,900 was recorded in discontinued operations and $2,400 was reflected in
continuing operations. The tax benefit was a result of a change in U.S. tax law in 2002
related to loss disallowance rules.

The net current and noncurrent components of deferred income taxes recognized in the balance sheet at December
31 are as follows:

2004        2003
   --------------------------------------------------------------------
   Current assets                                $ 8,200    $  6,100

   ==========================================================================

At December 31, 2004, the Company had
state operating loss carryforwards of $135,000, which created a deferred tax asset of
$8,000, and foreign operating loss carryforwards of $16,000, which created a deferred tax
asset of $4,800. Management estimates that of the total state and foreign operating loss
carryforwards, $135,000 and $11,000, respectively, are unlikely to be utilized and
therefore have been fully reserved. These loss carryforwards are available to apply
against the future taxable income in the jurisdictions that created the losses. State loss
carryforwards expire as follows: $7,000 in 2006, $7,000 in 2007 and $121,000 after 2007.
Foreign loss carryforwards will expire as follows: $500 in 2008 and $15,500 has no
expiration date.

As of December 31, 2004, the Company
had available foreign tax credit carryforwards of $3,300 expiring as follows: $200 in
2009, $200 in 2010, $100 in 2011, $200 in 2012, $2,200 in 2013 and $400 in 2014. Based
upon current projections, management estimates that $3,300 may not be utilized and
therefore has been fully reserved. The Company has R&D credit carryforwards of $1,700,
of which $500 expires in 2021, $500 expires in 2022 and $700 expires in 2024.

At December 31, 2004, the Company had
undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, amounting to $198,700 on which deferred
income taxes have not been provided because such earnings are intended to be reinvested
indefinitely outside of the U.S.   In addition, the Company has provided deferred tax liabilities
on $1,300 related to certain undistributed foreign earnings of $18,100 that were not
intended to be reinvested indefinitely outside of the U.S. at December 31, 2004.
On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of
2004 (the“ACT”) was signed into law. The Act creates a temporary incentive for
U.S. corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an 85 percent
dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations.  The
deduction is subject to a number of limitations.  On March 5, 2005, the Company’s Board of
Directors approved a plan to repatriate up to $70 million, representing existing cash balances at qualified
controlled foreign corporations.  The repatriated funds will principally be used to pay down existing
domestic debt.  The Company will be required to allocate tax expense to repatriating distributions
under the Act in its 2005 quarterly and annual financial statements.  The Act ’s 85 percent
exclusion of qualifying dividends reduces the 35% U.S. federal statutory rate to 5.25% of
distributions.  However, the determination of allocable expense to distributions will depend on,
among other things, the Company's affirmative elections to apply the special tax law to each
distribution, the 2005 actual earnings and tax expense of each distributing entity and of the U.S.
parent company, the Company's ability to credit foreign taxes against the resulting federal tax, the
effect of U.S. state taxes on the distribution and the reversal of provisions for deferred taxes on certain
unremitted earnings of prior periods.  The Company currently estimates that its first quarter 2005 tax
expense allocable to the distribution resulting from the March 2005 Board of Directors’ action
will be between $2 million and $4 million, or between $0.06 and $0.13 per diluted share.
The Company expects to be in a position to finalize its assessment of possible additional amounts to be remitted
under the Act by December 31, 2005.

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
has completed and closed its audits of the Company’s U.S. tax returns through 1997.
The IRS is currently conducting audits of the 1998– 2002 tax returns.

Note 8: Net Income Per
Share

The following table reconciles shares
used in the calculation of basic net income per share to the shares used in the
calculation of net income per share assuming dilution. There is no adjustment to the net
income of the Company in the calculation of net income per share assuming dilution.

2004      2003      2002
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Income from continuing operations                      $33,500   $42,900   $22,600

Average shares assuming dilution                        30,842    29,092    28,868
===================================================================================

For 2003 and 2002, stock options of
2,493,200 and 4,235,800, respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted
earnings per share since the options’ exercise prices were greater than the average
market price for the related periods. For 2004, there were no stock options excluded from
the computation.

Note 9: Comprehensive
Income

Comprehensive income consists of
reported net income and other comprehensive income, which reflects revenue, expenses and
gains and losses that generally accepted accounting principles exclude from net income.
For the Company, the items excluded from current net income are cumulative foreign
currency translation adjustments, unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale
securities of affiliates, fair value adjustments on derivative financial instruments and
additional minimum pension liability adjustments.

The components of accumulated other
comprehensive income at December 31 are as follows:

2004        2003
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Foreign currency translation                            $42,900     $23,700
   Unrealized gains on securities of affiliates                600         300
   Minimum pension liability                                (7,100)     (5,100)
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                           $36,400     $18,900
   ============================================================================

The income tax provision recorded in
2004 and 2003 for the unrealized gains on securities of affiliates was $100 and $200,
respectively. The minimum pension liability had an income tax benefit of $800 recorded in
2004 and an income tax provision of $100 recorded in 2003. Income taxes are generally not
provided for translation adjustments.

Note 10: Inventories

2004        2003
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
   Finished goods                                     $28,800     $21,700
   Work in process                                      9,600       8,600
   Raw materials                                       18,300      17,300

                                                      $56,700     $47,600
   =======================================================================

Included in the amounts above are
inventories located in the U.S. that are valued on the LIFO basis, amounting to $19,100
and $15,300 at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, which are approximately $8,600
and $7,500, respectively, lower than replacement value.

Note 11: Goodwill and
Intangibles

The Company performed its initial
goodwill impairment test at January 1, 2002, and determined that no impairment of the
recorded goodwill existed. The Company has since performed an annual impairment test of
its continuing operations during the fourth quarter and determined that there is no
impairment. The Company did not record amortization expense for goodwill in 2004, 2003 and
2002.

The goodwill balance as of December
31, 2004, was $42,400 compared to $39,500 as of December 31, 2003. Foreign currency
translation adjustments increased the goodwill balance $2,900 and $6,000, respectively, as
of December 31, 2004 and 2003.

The cost and respective accumulated
amortization for the Company’s patents and licensed technology was $2,300 and $1,000,
respectively, as of December 31, 2004, and $2,200 and $800, respectively, as of December
31, 2003. The cost basis of patents and licensed technology includes the effects of
foreign currency translation adjustments. Amortization expense for the years ended
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $200, $100 and $100, respectively. Estimated
amortization for each of the next five years is approximately $200 per year.

   ========================================================================

During 2004, the Company’s
Mexican affiliate sold property which resulted in a gain. The Company’s portion of
this gain was $600 and was included in equity in net income of affiliated companies.

During 2002, the Company’s
Mexican affiliates recorded a restructuring charge related to the consolidation of two of
their rubber molding operations. Equity in net income (loss) of affiliated companies
includes $800 related to this restructuring. All employee terminations and payments
connected with this restructuring were made during 2002.

In connection with the 2002 plant
consolidation, the Company advanced $1,000 to its Mexican affiliate. The note, which is
denominated in U.S. dollars, is at a 4% interest rate and is due in 2005. During 2004, the
Mexican affiliate repaid $600 of the note. At December 31, 2004, the balance of the note
receivable was $400.

Unremitted income of affiliated
companies included in consolidated retained earnings amounted to $17,500, $14,200 and
$12,700 at December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Dividends received from
affiliated companies were $100 in 2004, 2003 and 2002.

The Company’s equity in
unrealized gains and losses of Daikyo Seiko, Ltd.‘s investment in securities
available for sale, included in accumulated other comprehensive income, a separate
component of shareholders’ equity, was $600, $300 and $(300) at December 31, 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively. The unrealized gains in 2004 and 2003 were net of income tax
expense of $300 and $400, respectively. The unrealized loss in 2002 was net of an income
tax benefit of $200.

Company purchases and royalty
payments made to affiliates totaled $28,600 and $18,400, respectively, in 2004 and 2003,
of which $2,800 and $4,400 was due and payable as of December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. These transactions primarily relate to a distributorship agreement allowing
the Company to purchase and re-sell Daikyo products. Sales to affiliates were $600 and
$700, respectively, in 2004 and 2003, of which $200 was receivable as of December 31, 2004
and 2003.

Note 14: Benefit Plans

The Company and certain domestic and
international subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans. In addition, the Company
provides minimal life insurance benefits for certain U.S. retirees and pays a portion of
healthcare (medical and dental) costs for retired U.S. salaried employees and their
dependents. Benefits for participants are coordinated with Medicare and the plan mandates
Medicare risk (HMO) coverage wherever possible and caps the total contribution for non-HMO
coverage.

The Company uses a December 31
measurement date for all pension and other retirement benefit plans.

The expense (income) components of
net pension expense (income) are as follows:

plans was $190,100 and $170,500 at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, including
$30,700 and $23,300 for international pension plans, respectively. The pre-tax change in
the additional minimum liability included in other comprehensive income was $2,800 in 2004
and $(400) in 2003.

The aggregate projected benefit
obligation and aggregate fair value of plan assets for pension plans with obligations in

The Company expects to contribute
approximately $1,200 to pension plans, of which $600 is for international plans, and $400
to other retirement plans in 2005.

Weighted average assumptions used to
determine net periodic pension cost for the years ended December 31 are as follows:

Rate of compensation increase           4.69%       4.72%            -         -
======================================================================================

The discount rate used to determine
the benefit obligations for U.S. plans was 5.75% and 6.00% for the years ended December 31,
2004 and 2003, respectively. The weighted average discount rate used to determine the
benefit obligations for all international plans was 5.19% and 5.69% for the years ended
December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The rate of compensation increase for U.S. plans
was 5.00% for all years presented while the weighted average rate for all international
plans was 3.19% and 3.09% for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Other retirement benefits were only available to U.S. employees.

The long-term rate of return for U.S.
plans, which account for 92% of global plan assets, was 9.00% for the years ended December
31, 2004 and 2003, and 9.50% for the year ended December 31, 2002. This return assumption
was determined by reviewing the expected mix of plan assets and the projected return over
a 10-year period.

The assumed healthcare cost trend
used is 11.50% for all participants in 2004, decreasing to 5.50% by 2011. Increasing or
decreasing the assumed trend rate for healthcare costs by one percentage point would
result in a $500 increase or decrease, respectively, in the accumulated benefit
obligation. The related change in the aggregate service and interest cost components of
the 2004 plan expense would be a $100 increase or decrease, respectively.

The Company’s pension plans
weighted average asset allocations by asset category for the years ended December 31 are
as follows:

2004          2003

   Equity securities                               68%            66%

   ==================================================================

The Company’s U.S. pension plan
is managed as a balanced portfolio comprised of two components: equity and fixed income
debt securities. Equity investments are used to maximize the long-term real growth of fund
assets, while fixed income investments are used to generate current income, provide for a
more stable periodic return, and to provide some protection against a prolonged decline in
the market value of fund equity investments. Temporary funds may be held as cash. The
Company maintains a long-term strategic asset allocation policy which provides guidelines
for ensuring that the fund’s investments are managed with the short-term and
long-term financial goals of the fund but provide the flexibility to allow for changes in
capital markets.

The following are the Company’s
target asset allocations and acceptable allocation ranges:

Target       Allocation
                                               allocation            range
   ------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Equity securities                                 65%            55%-75%
   Debt securities                                   35%            25%-45%
   Other                                              0%              0%-5%
   ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Diversification across and within
asset classes is the primary means by which the Company mitigates risk. The Company
maintains guidelines for all asset and sub-asset categories in order to avoid excessive
investment concentrations. Fund assets are monitored on a regular basis. If at any time
the fund asset allocation is not within the acceptable allocation range, funds will be
reallocated. The Company also reviews the fund on a regular basis to ensure that the
investment returns received are consistent with the short-term and long-term goals of the
fund and with comparable market returns.

The Company is prohibited from
investing pension fund assets in the following: the Company’s own stock, securities
on margin, or derivative securities, and from pledging of securities.

The Company provides certain
post-employment benefits for terminated and disabled employees, including severance pay,
disability-related benefits and healthcare benefits. These costs are accrued over the
employee’s active service period or, under certain circumstances, at the date of the
event triggering the benefit.

The Company also sponsors a defined
contribution savings plan for certain salaried and hourly U.S. employees. Company
contributions are equal to 50% of each participant’s contribution up to 6% of the
participant’s base compensation. Company contributions were $1,400 in 2004, $1,200 in
2003 and $1,100 in 2002.

Note 15: Debt

Short-Term: Notes payable, which
includes short-term lines of credit in the amounts of $10,000 and $8,000 at December 31,
2004 and 2003, respectively, are payable within one year and bear interest at a weighted
average interest rate of 3.1% and 5.1%, respectively.

   ===========================================================================

All borrowings at December 31, 2004 are denominated in
U.S. dollars except for a $16,600 note under the revolving credit facility denominated in
1.7 billion Japanese Yen.

In May 2004, the Company replaced its
revolving credit facility. The new agreement involving a group of six banks, provides a
$125,000 committed revolving credit facility through January 5, 2009. Financing costs on
the new agreement of $500 were deferred and are being amortized over the life of the
agreement. Under the new agreement, the Company’s Leverage Ratio (the ratio of total
debt less cash to consolidated capitalization) may not exceed 50% and Consolidated Net
Worth (shareholders equity, excluding cumulative translation adjustments) must be at least
$198,900 plus half of any net income after taxes earned after December 31, 2003. As of
December 31, 2004 the Company’s Leverage Ratio was 24.9% and its Consolidated Net
Worth stood at $258.3 million. Failure to meet these or other debt covenants would cause
all borrowings under the revolving credit facility, as well as $100,000 of senior notes,
to become immediately due and payable and may trigger early payment penalties.

Long-term debt maturing in the years
following 2004 is: $0 in 2005, $0 in 2006, $0 in 2007, $0 in 2008, $150,800 in 2009 and $0
thereafter.

Interest costs incurred during 2004,
2003 and 2002 were $9,800, $10,400 and $11,300, respectively, of which $1,300, $700 and
$700, respectively, were capitalized as part of the cost of constructing certain assets.

Note 16: Financial
Instruments

The following disclosure reflects the
estimated fair value of financial instruments of the Company as of December 31:

Carrying value         Estimated Fair Value
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Asset (liability)                           2004       2003           2004        2003

Cash and cash equivalents                $68,800    $37,800        $68,800     $37,800
Accounts receivable                       72,900     72,300         72,900      72,300
Short- and long-term debt               (160,800)  (175,000)      (167,800)   (185,900)
Forward exchange contracts                   800       (100)           800        (100)
=======================================================================================

Methods used to estimate the fair
market values of the above listed financial instruments are as follows: cash and cash
equivalents and accounts receivable, due to their short maturity, are estimated at
carrying values that approximate market; debt is estimated based on current market quotes
for instruments of similar maturity; and forward exchange rate contracts are valued at
published market prices, market prices of comparable instruments or quotes.

The Company uses interest rate swaps
and forward exchange contracts to minimize the economic exposure related to fluctuating
interest and foreign exchange rates. Derivatives used by the Company are highly effective
as all of the critical terms of the derivative instruments match the hedged item.
Effectiveness is measured on a quarterly basis. In October 2003, the Company’s
remaining interest rate swap, designated as a cash flow hedge, expired. As a result, the
$200, net of tax, which was included in accumulated other comprehensive income as of
December 31, 2002, was reclassified from other comprehensive income to the statement of
income (interest expense).

The Company is exposed to currency
fluctuations on cross-currency intercompany loans. As a result, short-term foreign
exchange contracts are used to neutralize month-end balance sheet exposures. The forward
contracts are not designated as hedges and are recorded at fair value with any gains or
losses recognized in current period earnings in accordance with SFAS No. 133,
“Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities.” Gains
and losses on these contracts are typically offset by gains and losses on the underlying
hedged item.

In January 2003, due to continuing
fluctuations in the Japanese yen, the Company entered into an arrangement to hedge its net
investment in Daikyo Seiko, Ltd., a Japanese company in which the Company has a 25%
ownership interest. The Company’s strategy was to minimize the exposure to foreign
currency fluctuations by employing borrowings in the functional currency of the
investment. The Company borrowed 1.7 billion yen under its five-year revolving credit
facility and has designated the borrowing as a hedge of its net investment in the
Company’s investment in Daikyo. As of December 31, 2004, a $2,300 loss is included in
the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment related to this hedge.

In order to minimize the exposure to
foreign currency fluctuations, the Company borrowed 10,000 BPS in 2002 and designated the
borrowing as a hedge of the Company’s net investment in its U.K. subsidiaries. Due to
unfavorable interest rates, the 10,000 BPS debt was repaid in January 2003. The
mark-to-market currency adjustments of $1,900, recorded as a cumulative translation
adjustment to shareholders’ equity, will remain there until the disposal of the
investment.

Note 17: Capital Stock

On September 29, 2004, the Company
completed a two-for-one split on common stock to all shareholders of record as of
September 15, 2004. All share and per share data included in the accompanying financial
statements for all periods presented have been adjusted to retroactively reflect the stock
split.

Purchases (sales) of common stock
held in treasury during the three years ended December 31, 2004, are as follows:

   ==============================================================================

In 2002, the Company’s Board of
Directors authorized the donation of up to 80,000 shares of the Company’s stock over
the next three years to a related party charitable organization. The Company donated
28,000 and 36,200 shares held in treasury to this organization in 2003 and 2002,
respectively. No shares were donated during 2004.

In 2000, the Company established a
nonqualified deferred compensation plan for designated executive officers. Deferred
amounts are invested in funds at the executives’ election. The plan requires that a
portion of the deferred amount be invested in the Company’s stock. Purchases of the
Company’s stock by the plan were 3,800, 1,000 and 5,800 in 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. As of December 31, 2004, there were 40,800 shares of the Company’s
stock held by the plan, including 20,500 shares deferred by employees under the 2004
Stock-Based Compensation Plan.

The Company maintains an employee
stock purchase plan, which provides for the sale of the Company’s common stock to
substantially all employees at a 15% discount. The plan has two six-month offering periods
per calendar year at which time employees can enroll. Payroll deductions are limited to
25% of the employee’s base compensation. Employees may also make cash contributions
to the plan. Employees may not buy more than $25 thousand worth of Company stock under the
plan in any one calendar year. Shares are purchased at the lower of 85% of the
Company’s stock price on the last trading day before commencement of the offering
period or 85% of the Company’s stock price on the last day of the offering period.
The plan purchases shares from stock held in treasury by the Company. The plan expires on
December 31, 2006.

Note 18: Stock Option and
Award Plans

During 2004, the 2004 Stock-Based
Compensation Plan was approved by the shareholders and replaced all previous plans. This
plan provides for the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock
awards and performance awards to employees and non-employee directors. At December 31,
2004, there were 2,100 shares of common stock available for future grants. A committee of
the Board of Directors determines the terms and conditions of grants, except that the
exercise price of certain options cannot be less than 100% of the fair market value of the
stock on the date of grant. Vesting requirements vary by option grant. Option activity is
summarized in the following table:

The weighted average fair value per
option granted in 2004, 2003 and 2002 using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model was
$5.19, $1.94 and $2.52, respectively. The following weighted average assumptions were used
to compute the fair value of the option grants in 2004, 2003 and 2002: a risk-free
interest rate of 3.9%, 1.9% and 3.3%, respectively; stock volatility of 27.7%, 29.1% and
26.8%, respectively; and dividend yields of 2.2%, 3.2% and 4.4%, respectively. Expected
lives averaged 6 years for options granted in 2004, 3 years for options granted in 2003
and 6 years for options granted in 2002 under the key management employee plan.

Under the Company’s management
incentive plan, participants are paid cash bonuses on the attainment of certain financial
goals. Bonus participants are required to receive 25% of the value of their bonus, after
certain adjustments for taxes payable, in shares of the Company’s common stock at
current fair market value. Bonus participants are given a restricted stock award equal to
one share for each four shares of common stock issued with bonus awards. The restricted
stock awards vest at the end of four years provided that the participant has not made a
disqualifying disposition of the stock purchased. Restricted stock award grants were
14,600 shares, 8,600 shares and 8,200 shares in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Restricted stock forfeitures of 800
shares, 2,400 shares and 1,400 shares occurred in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period based on the fair market value
of common stock on the award date: $18.25 per share in 2004, $9.67 per share in 2003 and
$14.42 per share in 2002.

In 2004, the Company awarded 378,900
shares of performance vesting restricted shares to key employees under the 2004
Stock-Based Compensation Plan. The shares vest over three performance periods upon the
achievement of certain performance targets involving annual growth rates on revenue and
return on invested capital. The awards are forfeited if results for the respective
performance period are less than 70% of the targeted performance conditions. The
achievement of performance conditions between 70% and 100% of the designated plan targets
will result in the vesting of 50% to 100% of the original award amounts. For the first
performance period ending in December 2004, 117,782 shares vested according to the
achievement of the performance conditions. For the second performance period ending in
December 2005, achievement of between 100% and 150% of the performance target will result
in the issuance of an additional unrestricted share award, up to a maximum of 50% of that
performance period’s original target award of 124,834 shares. For the third
performance period ending in December 2006, achievement of between 100% and 150% of the
performance target will result in the issuance of an additional unrestricted share award,
up to a maximum of 100% of that performance period’s original target award of 124,834
shares.

As the ultimate number of shares that
will be awarded will not be known until the end of these performance periods, the plan is
accounted for as a variable award plan under APB 25, and compensation expense is
recognized over the performance period(s) based on an estimate of the number of shares
that will vest, taking into account the performance criteria and the market price of the
stock at the end of each interim period until the final award is determined.

Unearned compensation of $8,000 was
recorded for the performance vesting restricted shares at the date of grant. Compensation
expense of $5,100 was recognized for these shares during 2004. In addition to the
performance vesting restricted share awards, unearned compensation of $300 was recorded
for time-vesting restricted shares under the previous described management incentive
program. The remaining balance of unearned compensation on all restricted stock awards is
included as a separate component of equity and will be recognized as an expense over the
respective vesting periods.

Note 19: Commitments and
Contingencies

At December 31, 2004, the Company was
obligated under various operating lease agreements with terms ranging from one month to 20
years. Net rental expense in 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $7,000, $6,700 and $6,500,
respectively, and is net of sublease income of $700, $700, and $600, respectively.

At December 31, 2004, future minimum
rental payments under non-cancelable operating leases were:

     ====================================================================

At December 31, 2004, outstanding
unconditional contractual commitments for the purchase of equipment and raw materials
amounted to $2,700, all of which is due to be paid in 2005.

During 2003, the Company purchased
land from Lenoir County, N.C., for $2,000 on which the Company rebuilt its compression
molding operation. Under the terms of the agreement, commencing in 2005, the County will
reimburse the purchase price of the land in yearly increments of $200 as long as the
Company complies with certain capital investment and employment conditions.

The Company has accrued the estimated
cost of environmental compliance expenses related to soil or ground water contamination at
current and former manufacturing facilities. The Company believes the accrued liability of
$2,100 at December 31, 2004 is sufficient to cover the future costs of these remedial
actions, including the expected demolition and environmental cleanup at the former
Kinston, North Carolina site. The accrued liability at December 31, 2003 was $2,500. The
facilities being addressed are as follows: 1) former Technical Center facility in
Phoenixville, Pa.; 2) former plastics manufacturing facility in Wayne, N.J.; 3) current
operating plant in St. Petersburg, Fla.; and 4) former Kinston, N.C. facility, which was
destroyed by fire in January 2003.

The Company has letters of credit
totaling $4,000 supporting the reimbursement of workers’ compensation and other claims paid
on West’s behalf by insurance carriers. The Company’s accrual for insurance
obligations was $3,400 at December 31, 2004.

The Company has been named a
defendant in three lawsuits filed in connection with the explosion and related fire at the
Kinston, N.C. plant. In the first, plaintiffs seek unspecified compensatory and punitive
damages from the Company. Because this lawsuit is in its early stages, the Company is
unable to estimate the plaintiffs’ alleged damages. The second is a subrogation
action on behalf of local fire departments seeking reimbursement for equipment allegedly
damaged while fighting the fire. Investigation to date indicates that the maximum amount
in controversy in this matter is $200. In the third suit, plaintiffs did not name the
Company as a defendant, but the Company has been brought in as an additional party by
named defendants under a North Carolina procedure. Under this procedure, a finding of
liability against the Company would not result in a payment by the Company. Instead, the
finding would reduce any damages awarded to plaintiffs against the named defendants by the
amount that the Company and its workers’ compensation carrier would otherwise be
entitled to receive by way of subrogation from the plaintiffs. In addition, the finding
would extinguish the right to subrogation of amounts paid by the Company’s carrier in
workers’ compensation benefits to those plaintiffs. The Company believes that overall
it has sufficient insurance to cover losses from expected litigation associated with the
incident.

Note 20: New Accounting
Standards

In December 2004, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) revised Statement of Financial Accounting
Standard 123, “Share-Based Payment” (FAS 123). The revised statement prohibits
the use of the intrinsic value method and requires the use of a fair-value based measurement
method in accounting for share-based payment transactions with employees. The requirements
of the revised FAS 123 standard are mandatory for interim reporting periods beginning
after June 15, 2005. The Company plans to adopt the statement early on January 1, 2005
using the modified prospective method. Under this method, stock-based employee
compensation cost will be recognized for all new awards granted after January 1, 2005.
Additionally, compensation costs for unvested stock options and awards that are
outstanding at January 1, 2005 will be recognized over the requisite service period based
on the grant-date fair value of those options and awards as previously calculated under
the pro-forma disclosures under FAS 123. Management expects the compensation expense
associated with stock options and employee stock purchase programs to impact full-year
diluted earnings per share from continuing operations by approximately $.03 — $.05
per share in 2005.

In November 2004, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) released Statement of Financial Accounting
Standard 151, “Inventory Costs – An Amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4”
(FAS 151). FAS 151 clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight,
handling costs and spoilage should be expensed as incurred and not included in overhead.
Further, FAS 151 requires that allocation of fixed and production facilities overheads on
conversion costs should be based on normal capacity of the production facilities. The
provisions in Statement 151 are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years
beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company does not believe that the adoption of FAS 151
will have a significant effect on its financial position or results of operations.

In November 2004, the FASB’s
Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) reached a consensus on Issue 03-13,
“Applying the Conditions in Paragraph 42 of FASB Statement No. 144 in Determining
Whether to Report Discontinued Operations” (EITF 03-13). The guidance should be
applied to a component of an enterprise that is either disposed of or classified as held
for sale in fiscal periods that began after December 15, 2004. The Company does not
believe that the adoption of EITF 03-13 will have a significant effect on its financial
position or results of operations.

In December 2003, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) released Interpretation No. 46,
“Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of Accounting
Research Bulletin No. 51” (FIN 46R). FIN 46R requires a company to consolidate a
variable interest entity if the company has a variable interest that will absorb the
majority of the entity’s expected losses if they occur, receive a majority of the
entity’s expected residual returns if they occur, or both. The new interpretation was
effective immediately at the time of its release for variable interest entities created
after January 31, 2003 and effective in the first interim or annual period beginning after
December 15, 2003, for variable interest entities in which the company holds a variable
interest that it acquired before February 1, 2003. The Company adopted FIN 46R on January
1, 2004. The adoption of FIN 46R did not have an impact on the Company’s financial
position or results of operations.

Report of Independent
Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Shareholders and the Board of
Directors of West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc.

We have completed an integrated audit
of West Pharmaceutical Services Inc.’s 2004 consolidated financial statements and of
its internal control over financial reporting as of 2004 and audits of its 2003 and 2002
consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Our opinions, based on our audits, are presented below.

Consolidated financial statements and
financial statement schedule

In our opinion, the consolidated
financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a) (1), present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc. and
its subsidiaries at December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of their operations and
their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule appearing under Item
15(a)(2), presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein
when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These
financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits
of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Internal control over financial
reporting

Also, in our opinion,
management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that the Company maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 based on criteria established in
Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore in our opinion, the Company maintained in
all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2004 based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework
issued by the COSO. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on
management’s assessment and on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit of internal
control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An audit of internal
control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating
the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other
procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control
over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets
that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Per common share amounts for the
quarters and full years have each been calculated separately. Accordingly, quarterly
amounts may not add to the full year amounts because of differences in the average common
shares outstanding during each period and, with regard to diluted per common share amounts
only, because of the inclusion of the effect of potentially dilutive securities only in
the periods in which such effect would have been dilutive.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.

Evaluation of Disclosure
Controls and Procedures

An evaluation was performed under the
supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of  the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), as of
the end of the period covered by this annual report on Form 10-K. Based on this
evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that,
as of December 31, 2004 our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.

Management’s Report
on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The management of West Pharmaceutical
Services, Inc. (the “Company”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company’s internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the Company’s principal
executive and principal financial officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company’s financial
statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles.

Management assessed the effectiveness
of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004
based on the framework established in “Internal Control-Integrated Framework”
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
Based on this assessment, management has determined that the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2004.

Because of its inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Our management’s assessment of
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 has
been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered pubic accounting
firm, as stated in their report, which is included herein.

Item 9B. Other Information.

On February 14, 2005, the Company
filed a Current Report on Form 8-K. Under Items 1.01 and 2.01, the Company furnished to
the Commission information regarding the completed sale of a substantial majority interest
in its drug delivery business to Archimedes Pharma, a new U.K.-based European specialty
pharmaceutical company backed by Warburg Pincus. Under Item 9.01(b), the Company stated
that pro forma financial information would be filed with the Commission within 71 days of
the date on which this Report was due. All financial information presented within
Item 8 of this report has been restated to include the drug delivery business as a
discontinued operation.
