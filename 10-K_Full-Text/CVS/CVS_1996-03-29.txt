Item 1. Business

     Melville  Corporation,  a New York  corporation  (in this Item 1 called the
"Company"  and  together  with  its   subsidiaries,   collectively   called  the
"Companies"),  is one of the  largest  diversified  specialty  retailers  in the
United  States.  On October  24,  1995,  the Company  announced a  comprehensive
strategic  restructuring  program  which would  result in the  creation of three
independent  publicly traded retailing companies in the chain drug, footwear and
toy  industries.  As part of its  restructuring,  the Company also completed the
sale of its Marshalls business on November 17, 1995, and announced its intention
to try and sell its Wilsons and This End Up  businesses.  The chain drug holding
company will include the Company's CVS and, initially,  its Linens 'n Things and
Bob's Stores businesses. The footwear company will be comprised of the Company's
Meldisco,  Footaction  and Thom McAn  businesses.  Because the footwear  company
constitutes an entire segment, it has been classified as discontinued operations
in this  report and in the  Company's  financial  statements.  The  Kay-Bee  Toy
business was to be the separate toy company.  As discussed in more detail below,
the Company subsequently  announced that it had reached an agreement to sell its
Kay-Bee Toy  business.  All of these actions are expected to be completed by the
summer of 1996.

     In  general,  the  retailing  business  is  seasonal  in  nature  with each
particular business of the Company affected, to varying degrees, by certain peak
selling  periods.  The peak  selling  periods  are  characterized  by  inventory
build-ups prior to such periods.  The build-ups are financed,  in part, with the



issuance of  commercial  paper and bank loan  participation  notes.  To maintain
financial  flexibility,  the Company  also has on file with the  Securities  and
Exchange  Commission a shelf  registration  statement  for the issuance of up to
$300 million in debt securities, including medium-term notes. No debt securities
have been issued to date.

     The Christmas  holiday is the most significant  seasonal selling period for
the Company  overall and the peak selling period for its toy and leather apparel
businesses.  The peak selling periods, other than the Christmas holiday, for the
Company's  non-leather  apparel and footwear businesses coincide with the Easter
holiday  and the opening of school in the fall.  Competition  is based upon such
factors  as price,  style,  quality  and  design of  product  and the layout and
location of stores.

     The Company's  principal office is located in Rye, New York. As of December
31, 1995, the Companies had approximately 97,000 full and part-time associates.

                          BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION

     The Company is principally a specialty retailer  conducting business in the
three major segments listed below:



     -    Prescription drugs, health and beauty care retailing.

     -    Apparel  retailing,  which  includes  men's and women's  specialty and
          leather  apparel  and brand name and  private  label  apparel for men,
          women and children.

     -    Toys and home furnishings retailing, which includes retailing of toys,
          domestics and furniture (as well as furniture manufacturing).

     Because the Company  announced  its  intention  to  spin-off  its  footwear
segment to shareholders in 1996 as part of its  restructuring  plan, the results
of operations for these footwear businesses have been classified as discontinued
operations  for  all  periods  presented  in  the  consolidated   statements  of
operations in the Company's Annual Report to Shareholders incorporated herein by
reference.  The financial  information  concerning industry segments required by
Item 101(b) of Regulation  S-K is set forth on page 36 of the  Company's  Annual
Report to Shareholders for the year ended December 31, 1995, and is incorporated
herein by reference.

PRESCRIPTION DRUGS, HEALTH AND BEAUTY CARE RETAILING

     On December 31, 1995,  the Companies  operated  1,366  prescription  drugs,
health and beauty  care stores in 14 states and the  District of Columbia  under
the name "CVS",  substantially all of which have pharmacies. Net sales for these



stores  for  1995  represented  approximately  50.2%  of the  net  sales  of the
Companies' continuing operations.

     These stores are considered  "destination" stores and are located primarily
in "strip" shopping centers and freestanding  units. In the prescription  drugs,
health and beauty care retailing  business,  the Company counts itself among the
largest  retailers  in  terms of  number  of  stores  in its  primary  marketing
territories,  which is the mid-Atlantic and Northeast United States. The monthly
business periodical entitled "Chain Drug Review" has ranked CVS fourth in number
of stores and sixth in dollar  volume among the top ten drug store chains in the
United  States  based upon  dollar  volume and store  count.  These  stores also
compete with general merchandise stores, supermarkets and mail order pharmacies.

     PharmaCare  started  in  1994  as  a  full  service  prescription  benefits
management  company that markets and administers  prescription  benefit programs
directly to managed care  organizations,  employers,  and other health insurance
companies. PharmaCare was formed to serve as the strategic marketing arm of CVS.
It has developed a range of service  offerings to distinguish CVS and PharmaCare
in the prescription management market.

APPAREL RETAILING

     On December 31, 1995, the Companies  operated 548 men's and women's leather
and suede apparel and accessory stores,  which are located primarily in regional



shopping  malls in 46 states,  the District of Columbia  and the United  Kingdom
under the names  "Wilsons  Suede &  Leather",  "Wilsons  The  Leather  Experts",
"Tannery  West",  "Bermans  The Leather  Experts",  "Bermans",  "Snyder  Leather
Outlets",  "Pelle Cuir" and "Georgetown  Leather Design".  Net sales for 1995 in
these stores  represented  approximately 4.7% of the net sales of the Companies'
continuing operations.

     On December 31,  1995,  the  Companies  operated 34 stores  selling  casual
clothing  and  footwear  for the entire  family  under the name "Bob's  Stores",
principally in "strip" shopping  centers located in Connecticut,  Massachusetts,
New York, New Jersey, Rhode Island,  Pennsylvania,  New Hampshire,  Virginia and
Maryland.  Net sales at Bob's stores for 1995 represented  approximately 3.6% of
the net sales of the Companies' continuing operations.

TOYS AND HOME FURNISHINGS

     On December 31, 1995, the Companies  operated 1,004 toy and hobby stores in
all 50 states and Puerto Rico under the names "Kay-Bee Toys" and "Toy Works". As
discussed in more detail below, the Company announced on March 25, 1996, that it
expects  to  complete  the  sale of this toy  business  to  Consolidated  Stores
Corporation  in May 1996.  The  Kay-Bee  Toys stores are  located  primarily  in
regional  shopping malls. The Toy Works stores are located  primarily in "strip"
shopping centers



and  freestanding  units. Net sales in toy and hobby stores for 1995 represented
approximately 11.1% of the net sales of the Companies' continuing operations.

     On December 31, 1995, the Companies operated 155 quality brand name linens,
towels,  bath and other household items stores,  which are located  primarily in
"strip" shopping centers in 29 states under the name "Linens 'n Things".  Linens
'n Things' net sales for 1995 represented approximately 5.7% of the net sales of
the Companies' continuing operations.

     On  December  31,  1995,  the  Companies  operated  228  stores  carrying a
distinctive line of casual furniture and coordinated accessories for residential
and commercial use, located  primarily in regional  shopping malls in 33 states,
under the names "This End Up" and "Wood's End".  Net sales of furniture for 1995
represented  approximately  1.4% of the net sales of the  Companies'  continuing
operations.

     In the toy  retailing  business,  the  Company is among the largest toy and
hobby chain store  operators in the United States in terms of sales,  as well as
number of retail  outlets.  Based upon sales  volume,  the  business  periodical
"Discount  Store News" has ranked Kay-Bee among the top toy specialty  chains in
the United States.

     In the home furnishings retailing business,  the Company believes itself to
be a significant factor in the markets for the products which it carries.  Based
on total revenues,  This End Up has been ranked by "Furniture  Today",  a weekly



business periodical,  as the 17th largest home furnishing retailer in the United
States.

     Manufacturing

     During  1995,  the  Company,   through  This  End  Up  Furniture   Company,
manufactured a distinctive line of casual  furniture in seven factories  located
in the Southeast United States.  Approximately 99% of the furniture manufactured
is sold through the Company's  This End Up division.  The Company  believes that
these factories have the capacity to supply all of the sales volume requirements
of its  "This  End Up" and  "Wood's  End"  retail  stores  and  currently  these
factories supply substantially all of such requirements.

     This End Up Furniture Company manufactures a large portion of its furniture
from  southern  yellow pine,  which is in plentiful  supply in the  Southeastern
United States.  Southern yellow pine is a renewable  resource and most producers
have reforestation programs in effect.

FOOTWEAR - DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

     As part of the  Company's  restructuring  plan,  it plans to  spin-off  its
footwear  operations to shareholders during 1996. As of December 31, 1995, these
included 2,568 leased  footwear  departments,  439 retail stores under the names
"FOOTACTION USA" and "FOOTACTION For Kids" and 315 retail stores under the names
"Thom McAn" and  "B.O.Q.".  Collectively,  these leased  departments  and retail



stores are located in all 50 states,  Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands,  the
Czech Republic, Slovakia, Mexico, Guam and Singapore.

     Each of the  leased  departments  is  operated  by the  Company's  Meldisco
division which sells  footwear for the entire family.  All but 390 of the leased
departments operated during the fiscal year ended December 31, 1995 were located
in Kmart discount department stores in the United States, Puerto Rico, the Czech
Republic,  Slovakia,  Mexico, Guam and Singapore. The 390 leased departments are
located in Pay Less or Thrifty Drug  Stores,  and are owned by Thrifty Pay Less,
Inc.

     Pursuant  to  an  agreement  between  the  Company  and  Kmart  Corporation
("Kmart")  entered into  effective  July 1, 1995,  and an agreement  between the
Company and Pay Less Drug Stores  Northwest,  Inc.  dated October 10, 1988,  the
Company has the exclusive right to operate the footwear departments in Kmart and
Pay Less Drug  stores.  All  license  agreements  relating  to the Kmart  leased
departments  expire  July 1, 2012 and all  agreements  relating  to Pay Less and
Thrifty  Drug  stores  have  terms  of 25  years  and  are  subject  to  certain
performance  standards.  Rental  payments under all such license  agreements are
based on a  percentage  of sales,  with  additional  payments  to be made  under
certain of the license agreements with Kmart based on profits. The Company has a
51%  equity  interest,  and  Kmart  has  a  49%  equity  interest,  in  all  the
subsidiaries  which  operate  leased  departments  in  Kmart  stores,  with  the
exception of 35 such subsidiaries in which the Company



has a 100% equity  interest.  The Company has a 100% equity  interest in all the
subsidiaries  which  operate  leased  departments  in Pay Less or  Thrifty  Drug
Stores.  Aggregate net sales for 1995 of Meldisco leased departments represented
approximately  10.3% of the  Companies'  net  sales,  including  the  businesses
classified as discontinued operations.

     Footaction stores are located  primarily in regional shopping malls.  These
stores specialize in brand name casual and athletic footwear and related apparel
for the entire family. Footaction's net sales for 1995 represented approximately
3.7% of the  Companies'  net  sales,  including  the  businesses  classified  as
discontinued operations.

     A majority  of the Thom McAn stores are also  located in regional  shopping
malls and sell  footwear  and related  items for men and women.  Thom McAn's net
sales for 1995  represented  approximately  1.8% of the  Companies'  net  sales,
including the businesses classified as discontinued operations.

     In the footwear  retailing  business the  Companies,  through  their retail
stores and leased  departments,  compete with footwear chain store operators and
many other  types of  footwear  retailers,  e.g.,  general  merchandise  stores,
traditional department stores, mail order businesses and apparel stores.



DISPOSITIONS

     During 1995, the Company sold its Marshalls  division to The TJX Companies,
Inc. for a total purchase  price of  approximately  $600 million,  consisting of
$375 million in cash and $175 million in TJX convertible  preferred stock,  with
the balance  representing an adjustment to the purchase price based on the final
accounting  for working  capital.  Net sales for the Marshalls  division in 1995
through its date of disposition represented approximately 23.3% of the net sales
of the Companies' continuing operations.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

     On March 25,  1996,  the  Company  announced  that it reached a  definitive
agreement  for the sale of its  Kay-Bee  Toys  division to  Consolidated  Stores
Corporation for approximately  $315 million,  including $215 million in cash and
$100  million in a  four-year  subordinated  note.  This  transaction,  which is
subject to regulatory  approval and certain closing  conditions,  is expected to
close in May, 1996.

Item 2.  Properties

     The  registrant  and its  subsidiaries  lease  various  retail  stores  and
warehouse,  plant and office  facilities.  Most of these leases contain  initial
terms ranging from 5 to 25 years and many have options for extension  beyond the
initial term ranging from 5 to 15 years. Retail stores and office facilities are
leased in nearly all cases.



     The Company operated  twenty-nine  distribution centers located in thirteen
states  containing an aggregate of approximately  4,375,000 square feet that are
used in the health and beauty aids, linens,  furniture and apparel business. All

3 distribution  centers containing an aggregate of approximately  909,000 square
feet, which are owned by the registrant or one of its  subsidiaries.  By the end
of 1996, four of the distribution  centers used by these footwear operating will
be  closed.   Six  distribution   centers,   located  in  5  states   comprising
approximately  1,238,000  square  feet  are used in the toy  business.  All such
distribution  centers are leased with the exception of (2) distribution  centers
containing an aggregate of  approximately,  610,000 square feet, which are owned
by the registrant or one of its subsidiaries.

     During the fiscal year ended  December 31,  1995,  the  registrant  and its
subsidiaries  operated  seven  factories,  all of which  were  located  in North
Carolina  and are  furniture  factories  with  the  total  capacity  to  produce
approximately  1,092,000 pieces of furniture annually.  The registrant or one of



its subsidiaries own all such factories remaining in operation at the end of the
year.

Item 3.  Legal Proceedings

     There are no  material  pending  legal  proceedings,  other  than  ordinary
routine litigation incidental to the business, to which the registrant or any of
its  subsidiaries  is a party or of which  any of its or their  property  is the
subject.

Item 4.  Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

     There were no matters  submitted  to a vote of  security  holders,  through

                          Independent Auditors' Report


The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Melville Corporation:

Under date of February 15, 1996, we reported on the consolidated  balance sheets
of Melville  Corporation  and  subsidiary  companies as of December 31, 1995 and
1994, and related  consolidated  statements of operations,  shareholders' equity
and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31,
1995, as contained in the 1995 annual report to shareholders. These consolidated
financial statements and our report thereon are incorporated by reference in the
annual report on Form 10-K for the year 1995.  In connection  with our audits of
the  aforementioned  consolidated  financial  statements,  we also  audited  the
related consolidated  financial statement schedule as listed in the accompanying
index. This financial  statement schedule is the responsibility of the Company's
management.  Our  responsibility  is to express  an  opinion  on this  financial
statement schedule based on our audits.

In our opinion,  such financial statement schedule,  when considered in relation
to the  basic  consolidated  financial  statements  taken as a  whole,  presents
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

As  discussed  on page 28 of the  Annual  Report to  Shareholders,  the  Company
adopted the provisions of the Financial  Accounting  Standards Board's Statement
of Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 121,  "Accounting  for the Impairment of
Long-Lived  Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed of," in 1995, and as
discussed  on page 28,  the  Company  changed  its  policy  for  accounting  for
internally  developed software costs in 1995. Also, as discussed on page 30, the
Company  changed its method of  determining  retail  prices  indices used in the
valuation of LIFO inventories in 1993.
