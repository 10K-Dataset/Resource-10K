PART I

Item 1.  —  Business

OVERVIEW

CVS Corporation is a leader in the retail drugstore industry in the

United States with net sales of $22.2 billion in fiscal 2001, making us the

second largest retail drugstore chain based on sales. As of December 29, 2001,

we operated 4,191 retail and specialty pharmacy stores in 33 states and the

District of Columbia, making us the largest retail drugstore chain in the

nation based on store count. We currently operate in 60 of the top 100 U.S.

drugstore markets and hold the number one market share in 35 of these markets,

more than any other retail drugstore chain. Overall, we hold the number one or

number two market share in 73% of the markets in which we operate. During

fiscal 2001, we filled over 309 million prescriptions, or approximately 11% of the

U.S. retail market. Our current operations are grouped into two businesses:

Retail Pharmacy and Pharmacy Benefit Management (“PBM”). Prior to 2001, our

operations were grouped into four businesses: Retail Pharmacy, PBM, Specialty

Pharmacy and the Internet Pharmacy business. During fiscal 2001, we changed our

reporting structure and as a result, the Specialty Pharmacy and Internet

Pharmacy businesses are no longer considered to be separate businesses. The

Specialty Pharmacy business is now a component of the PBM business and the

Internet Pharmacy business is a component of the Retail Pharmacy business.

Retail

Pharmacy

~ As of

December 29, 2001, the Retail Pharmacy business included 4,145 retail

drugstores and the online retail website, CVS.com. The retail drugstores are

located in 26 states and the District of Columbia, operating under the CVS® or

CVS/pharmacy® name. CVS/pharmacy stores sell prescription drugs and a wide

assortment of general merchandise, including over-the-counter drugs, greeting

cards, film and photofinishing services, beauty products and cosmetics,

seasonal merchandise and convenience foods, which we refer to as “front store”

products. Existing stores generally range in size from approximately 8,000 to

12,000 square feet, although most new stores are based on either an

approximately 11,000 or 12,000 square foot prototype building, which typically

include a drive-thru pharmacy. The Retail Pharmacy is our only reportable

segment as it represented approximately 96% of consolidated net sales and

operating profit in fiscal 2001.

Pharmacy

Benefit Management

~

The PBM business provides a full range

of prescription benefit management services to managed care and other

organizations. These services include plan design and administration, formulary

management, mail order pharmacy services, claims processing and generic

substitution. The PBM business, which currently manages more than 12 million

lives, operates under the PharmaCare Management Services name and ranks as one

of the top ten full service PBMs in the nation. The PBM business also includes

our Specialty Pharmacy operations, which represent the largest integrated

retail and mail provider of specialty pharmacy services in the nation.

Specialty pharmacy focuses on supporting individuals that require complex and

expensive drug therapies to treat conditions such as organ transplants,

HIV/AIDS and genetic conditions such as infertility, multiple sclerosis and

certain cancers. As of December 29, 2001, we operated 46 specialty pharmacies,

located in 20 states and the District of Columbia, and two specialty mail order

facilities. Specialty pharmacy stores, which operate under the CVS ProCare

name, average 2,000 square feet in size and sell prescription drugs and a

limited assorted of front store items such as alternative medications,

homeopathic remedies and vitamins.

Our fiscal 2001 sales of

$22.2 billion are grouped into two major categories, pharmacy and front store.

Pharmacy sales have been growing, and we believe will continue to grow, at a

faster pace than front store sales. Pharmacy sales represented 66% of total

sales in fiscal 2001, compared to 63% in fiscal 2000 and 59% in fiscal 1999.

Total pharmacy sales increased 14.5% to $14.8 billion, while front store sales,

which are generally higher margin than pharmacy sales, increased 3.9% to $7.4

billion. We believe that our pharmacy operations will continue to represent a

critical part of our business and strategy due to our ability to attract and

retain managed care customers, favorable industry trends and our on-going

program of purchasing customer lists from independent pharmacies. The U.S.

retail pharmacy market is estimated to exceed $165 billion in sales for 2001

and is expected to continue to be among the fastest growing segments in the retail

sector as it continues to benefit from favorable industry trends. These trends

include an aging American population consuming a greater number of prescription

drugs, pharmaceuticals being used more often as the first line of defense for

managing illness and the introduction and direct to consumer marketing of new

drugs.


Front store sales should

continue to benefit from our strategy to be the first to market with new

products and services, using innovative marketing, introducing more products

which are unique to CVS and adjusting our mix of merchandise to match customer

needs and preferences. Examples of this are our aggressive expansion of unique

photo services, which has resulted in CVS becoming a leader in one-hour and

online photo services and one of Kodak’s largest online customers. The

ExtraCare® card program, our relationship marketing program, is another example

whereby we offer special promotions and incentives to our best customers to

reward their patronage and encourage increased loyalty. Currently, over 25

million CVS customers have an ExtraCare card. We also continue to expand our

private label product offers, particularly with the expansion of the Essence of

Beauty® line of bath and body products.

Merger

with Revco D.S., Inc. ~

On May 29, 1997, we completed a merger with Revco D.S. Inc., pursuant

to which 120.6 million shares of CVS common stock were exchanged for all the

outstanding common stock of Revco. The aggregate value of this transaction,

including the assumption of $900 million of existing Revco debt, was $3.8

billion (based on stock market valuations at the time of the merger). The

merger with Revco was a milestone event for our company in that it more than

doubled our revenues and made us the nation’s number one drugstore retailer in

terms of store count. The merger brought us into high-growth, contiguous

markets in the Mid-Atlantic, Southeast and Midwest regions of the United

States.

Merger

with Arbor Drugs, Inc. ~

On March 31, 1998, we completed a merger with Arbor Drugs, Inc.,

pursuant to which 37.8 million shares of CVS common stock were exchanged for

all the outstanding common stock of Arbor. The aggregate value of this

transaction, including the assumption of $17 million of existing Arbor debt,

was $1.5 billion (based on stock market valuations at the time of the merger).

The merger with Arbor made us the market share leader in metropolitan Detroit,

the nation’s fourth largest retail drugstore market at the time, and strengthened

our position as the nation’s top drugstore retailer in terms of store count and

retail prescriptions dispensed.

Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the

trading symbol “CVS”. CVS Corporation is a Delaware corporation. Our Store

Support Center (corporate office) is located at One CVS Drive, Woonsocket,

Rhode Island 02895, telephone (401) 765-1500.

RETAIL

PHARMACY BUSINESS

Operating

Strategy ~

Our

operating strategy is to provide a broad assortment of high-quality merchandise

at competitive prices using a retail format that emphasizes service, innovation

and convenience. One of the keys to our strategy is technology, which allows us

to focus on constantly improving service and exploring ways to provide more

personalized product offerings and services. We believe that continuing to be

the first to market with new products and services, using innovative marketing,

introducing more products which are unique to CVS and adjusting our mix of

merchandise to match customer needs and preferences is very important to our

ability to maintain customer satisfaction.

Products ~

A typical CVS/pharmacy store sells

prescription drugs and a wide assortment of high-quality, nationally advertised

brand name and private label merchandise. General merchandise categories

include over-the-counter drugs, greeting cards, film and photofinishing

services, beauty products and cosmetics, seasonal merchandise and convenience

foods, which we refer to as “front store” products. We purchase our merchandise

from numerous manufacturers and distributors. We believe that competitive

sources are readily available for substantially all of the products we carry

and the loss of any one supplier would not have a material effect on the

business. Consolidated net sales by major product group are as follows:

(1) Percentages

are estimates based on store scanning data.


To complement the

national brand name products we offer, we also carry a full range of

high-quality private label products that are only available through CVS. We

carried over 1,500 CVS brand products, which accounted for approximately 12% of

our front store sales during fiscal 2001. Due to the success of our private

label program, we continue to assess opportunities to expand our range of

private label product offerings.

Store Development ~

The addition of new stores has played,

and will continue to play, a major role in our continued growth and success.

Our store development program focuses on three areas: entering new markets,

adding stores within existing markets and relocating stores to more convenient,

freestanding sites. During 2001, we opened 126 new stores, relocated 122 stores

and closed 68 stores. New store development included 43 stores in new markets,

including: Miami and Ft. Lauderdale, Florida; Las Vegas, Nevada; and Dallas,

Houston and Fort Worth, Texas. During the last five years we opened more than

1,700 new and relocated stores. Approximately half of our store base was opened

or significantly remodeled within the last five years. During fiscal 2002, we

expect to open approximately 150-175 new stores (including 75 in new markets),

100 relocations and 50 store closings in addition to the stores closing as a

part of the restructuring announced during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001.

We believe that continuing to grow our store base and locating stores in

desirable geographic markets are essential components to competing effectively

in the current managed care environment. As a result, we believe that our store

development program is an integral part of our ability to maintain our

leadership position in the retail drugstore industry.

Information

Systems ~

We have

invested significantly in information systems to enable us to deliver a high

level of customer service while lowering costs and increasing operating

efficiency. We were one of the first in the industry to introduce Drug

Utilization Review technology that checks for harmful interactions between

prescription drugs, over-the-counter products, vitamins and herbal remedies. We

were also one of the first in the industry to install a chain wide automatic

prescription refill system, called Rapid Rx Refill, which enables customers to

order prescription refills 24 hours a day using a touch-tone telephone. During

fiscal 2001, we completed the rollout of EPIC®, a multiyear project that

reengineered the way our pharmacists communicate and fill prescriptions. The

project included integrated workflow improvements, proprietary systems

technology and automated pill-counting machines in high volume stores. We

expect EPIC will continue to improve quality assurance and customer service,

while reducing labor costs. We also have several supply chain initiatives under

way, including our Promotional Forecasting and Allocation system and an

improved store-level Assisted Inventory Management system, which will more

effectively link our stores and distribution centers with suppliers to speed

the delivery of merchandise to our stores in a manner that both reduces

out-of-stock positions and lowers our investment in inventory.

Customers ~

During fiscal 2001, we served an average

of 2.5 million customers per day. Since our sales are to numerous customers,

including managed care organizations, the loss of any one customer would not

have a material effect on the business. No single customer accounts for 10% or

more of our total sales.

Seasonality ~

The majority of our sales, particularly pharmacy

sales, are generally not seasonal in nature. However, front store sales tend to

be higher during the December holiday season. For additional information we

refer you to the Note “Quarterly Financial Information” on page 30 of the

“Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in our Annual Report to

Stockholders for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2001.

Working Capital

Practices ~

We fund the growth of our business through a combination of

cash flow from operations, commercial paper and long-term borrowings. Our

liquidity is not currently dependent on the use of off-balance sheet

transactions other than normal operating leases. We currently expect to

continue to utilize our commercial paper program during fiscal 2002 to support

our working capital needs. We may also elect to use additional long-term

borrowings and/or other financing sources in the future to support our

continued growth. Due to the nature of the retail drugstore business, the

majority of our non-pharmacy sales are in cash, while third party insurance

programs, which typically settle in less than 30 days, represented 91% of our

pharmacy sales in 2001. Our customer returns are not significant.


Associate Development ~

As of December 29, 2001, we employed

approximately 107,000 associates, about 54,000 of whom are part-time employees

working less than 30 hours per week. To deliver the highest levels of service

to our customers and partners, we devote considerable time and attention to our

people and service standards. We emphasize attracting and training friendly and

helpful associates to work in our stores and throughout our organization. Our

pharmacists consistently rank among the best in the industry on measurements of

trust, relationship building and accessibility. This high level of service and

expertise has played a key role in the growth of our company.

Intellectual Property and Licenses ~

We have registered or applied for

registration of a variety of trade names, service marks, trademarks and

business licenses for use in our business. We regard our intellectual property

as having significant value and as being an important factor in the marketing

of the Company and our stores. We are not aware of any facts that could

negatively impact our continuing use of any of our intellectual property. Our

pharmacies and pharmacists must be licensed by the appropriate state boards of

pharmacy. Our pharmacies and distribution centers are also registered with the

Federal Drug Enforcement Administration. Because of these licensing and

registration requirements, we must comply with various statutes, rules and

regulations, a violation of which could result in a suspension or revocation of

these licenses or registrations.

Competition ~

The

retail drugstore business is highly competitive. We believe that we compete

principally on the basis of: (i) store location and convenience, (ii) customer

service and satisfaction, (iii) product selection and variety and (iv) price.

In each of the markets we serve, we compete with independent and other retail

drugstore chains, supermarkets, convenience stores, mail order prescription

providers, discount merchandisers and internet pharmacies.

Cautionary Statement Concerning

Forward-Looking Statements ~

The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995

(the “Reform Act”) provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made

by or on behalf of CVS Corporation. The Company and its representatives may,

from time to time, make written or verbal forward-looking statements, including

statements contained in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange

Commission and in its reports to stockholders. Generally, the inclusion of the

words “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “will,” and

similar expressions identify statements that constitute “forward-looking

statements”. All statements addressing operating performance of CVS Corporation

or any subsidiary, events, or developments that the Company expects or

anticipates will occur in the future, including statements relating to sales

growth, earnings or earnings per common share growth, free cash flow, inventory

levels and turn rates, store development, relocations and new market entries,

as well as statements expressing optimism or pessimism about future operating

results or events, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the

Reform Act. The forward-looking statements are and will be based upon

management’s then-current views and assumptions regarding future events and

operating performance, and are applicable only as of the dates of such

statements. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any

forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future

events, or otherwise. By their nature, all forward-looking statements involve

risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated

by the forward-looking statements for a number of reasons, including but not

limited to:

•

The strength of the economy in general or in the

markets served by CVS, including changes in consumer purchasing power and/or

spending patterns;

•

Increased competition from other drugstore chains, from alternative

distribution channels such as supermarkets, membership clubs, mail order

companies, discount retailers and internet companies (e-commerce) and from

other third party plans;

•

Changes in consumer preference or loyalties;

•

Price reductions taken by the Company in response to

competitive pressures, as well as price reductions taken to drive demand that

may not result in anticipated sales levels;

•

Our ability to achieve projected levels of efficiencies,

cost reduction measures and other benefits from the restructuring plan

announced during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 and other initiatives;

•

The effects of litigation and the creditworthiness of

the purchasers of former businesses whose store leases are guaranteed by CVS;

•

Our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to

support capital expansion, and general operating activities, and our ability to

obtain necessary financing at favorable interest rates;

•

Changes in laws and regulations, including changes in

accounting standards, taxation requirements, including tax rate changes, new

tax laws and revised tax law interpretations;

•

Interest rate fluctuations and other capital market

conditions;


•

The continued introduction of successful

new prescription drugs;

•

The continued efforts of health maintenance

organizations, managed care organizations, pharmacy benefit management

companies and other third party payers to reduce prescription drug costs;

•

Our ability to continue to successfully implement new computer systems

and technologies;

•

Our ability to successfully attract customers through our customer

reactivation program;

•

Our ability to continue to secure suitable new store locations at

favorable lease terms;

•

Our ability to continue to purchase inventory on favorable terms;

•

Our ability to attract, hire and retain suitable pharmacists and

management personnel;

•

Our ability to establish effective advertising, marketing and

promotional programs (including pricing strategies) in the different geographic

markets in which we operate; and

•

Other risks and uncertainties detailed from time to

time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The foregoing list is not

exhaustive. There can be no assurance that the Company has correctly identified

and appropriately assessed all factors affecting its business. Additional risks

and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that it currently

believes to be immaterial also may adversely impact the Company. Should any

risks and uncertainties develop into actual events, these developments could

have material adverse effects on the Company’s business, financial condition,

and results of operations. For these reasons, you are cautioned not to place

undue reliance on the Company’s forward-looking statements.

Properties

We lease most of our

stores under long-term leases that vary as to rental amounts, expiration dates,

renewal options and other rental provisions. For additional information on the

amount of our rental obligations for our leases, we refer you to the Note

“Leases” on page 24 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” in our

Annual Report to Stockholders for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2001.

As of December 29,

2001, we owned approximately 2% of our 4,191 retail and specialty pharmacy

drugstores. Net selling space for our retail and specialty pharmacy drugstores

increased approximately 2.5% to 31.5 million square feet as of December 29,

2001, from 30.8 million square feet as of December 30, 2000. Approximately half

of our store base was opened or significantly remodeled within the last five

years.

We own five

distribution centers located in Alabama, North Carolina, Rhode Island, South

Carolina and Tennessee and lease five additional facilities located in Indiana,

New Jersey, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Virginia. The ten distribution centers

total approximately 5,400,000 square feet as of December 29, 2001. During the

fourth quarter of 2001, we announced our plan to close the Henderson, North

Carolina distribution center. It is anticipated that the Henderson facility

will be closed by May 2002 and its operations will be transferred among the

remaining distribution centers.

We own our

corporate headquarters building located in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, which

contains approximately 552,000 square feet. We lease approximately 200,000

square feet of additional office space in Rhode Island. We also lease

approximately 199,000 square feet in three mail order service facilities

located in Columbus and Fairfield, Ohio and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. During

the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, we announced our intent to close the

Columbus, Ohio mail order facility. The Columbus facility was closed in March

2002 and its operations were transferred to the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania

facility.


Following is a

breakdown by state of our 4,191 retail and specialty pharmacy store locations

as of December 29, 2001:

In addition, in

connection with certain business dispositions completed between 1991 and 1997,

we continue to guarantee lease obligations for approximately 1,100 former

stores. We are indemnified for these guarantee obligations by the respective

purchasers. These guarantees generally remain in effect for the initial lease

term and any extension thereof pursuant to a renewal option provided for in the

lease prior to the time of the disposition. For additional information, we

refer you to the Note “Commitments & Contingencies” on page 28 of “Notes to

Consolidated Financial Statements” in our Annual Report to Stockholders for the

fiscal year ended December 29, 2001.

Management believes that

its owned and leased facilities are suitable and adequate to meet the Company’s

anticipated needs. At the end of the existing lease terms, management believes

the leases can be renewed or replaced by alternate space.

Legal Proceedings

On November 21, 2000, a collective action under the Fair Labor Standards

Act (the “FLSA”) styled

Hill v. CVS Rx Services, Inc.,

Civil Action No.

CV 00-HGD-3355-S, was filed against CVS in the Federal District Court of

Alabama by certain current and former CVS pharmacists. The action contends

that, as a result of CVS’ pay practices, these pharmacists should not be

treated as salaried exempt employees for purposes of the FLSA and, therefore,

the Company violated the FLSA by failing to pay such pharmacists at a rate of

time and one half for hours worked over 40 in any given week. Plaintiffs seek

recovery of unpaid overtime as well as payment of liquidated damages, expenses

and reasonable attorneys’ fees. This action is in the discovery phase and it is

not yet possible to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate the possible

range of loss, if any, for this case.

The Company and Thomas M. Ryan, the chairman, chief executive officer

and president of the Company, are named as defendants in s

ix purported shareholder class action

complaints that have been filed in the Federal District Court of Massachusetts

that assert claims under the federal securities laws.  By an order of the Court entered on February 6, 2002, those

actions were consolidated under the caption

In re CVS Corporation Securities

Litigation

, Civil Action No. 01-11464-JLT. The complaints in the constituent

actions, which are substantially identical, alleged that several public

statements by the Company between February and May 2001 failed to

disclose that, as later reported by the Company in a June 27, 2001 press

release, the Company’s earnings per share for the second quarter and for the

full year would be lower than previously anticipated. According to the

complaints, following the June 27, 2001 announcement, the price of the

Company’s common stock fell from $44.10 to $36.51 per share. Plaintiffs asserted

claims for alleged securities fraud under sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the

Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.  The complaint sought certification of

similar classes of the Company’s shareholders as well as recovery of monetary

damages in an amount to be proven at trial plus plaintiffs’ expenses (including

reasonable attorneys fees). Under the Court’s consolidation order, a lead

plaintiff and lead plaintiff’s counsel were appointed as provided under the

Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended, and plaintiffs

were directed to file a consolidated amended complaint within 60 days of entry

of that order. The consolidated amended complaint has not yet been filed. These

actions are in their earliest stages. The Company and Mr. Ryan believe that the

claims asserted in the actions are without merit and intend to defend against

them vigorously.

The Company is also a

party to other litigation arising in the normal course of its business, none of

which is expected to be material to the Company.

Market for Registrant’s Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters
