Item 1.    Business

General

Corning traces its origins to a glass business established in 1851. The present corporation was incorporated in the State of New York in December 1936. The
Company’s name was changed from Corning Glass Works to Corning Incorporated on April 28, 1989.

Corning is a global,
technology-based corporation that operates in five reportable business segments: Display Technologies, Telecommunications, Environmental Technologies, Specialty Materials and Life Sciences. Corning manufactures and processes products at
approximately 60 plants in 13 countries.

Display Technologies Segment

Corning’s Display Technologies segment manufactures glass substrates for active matrix liquid crystal displays (LCDs), that are used primarily in notebook computers, flat panel desktop monitors, and
LCD televisions. Corning’s facilities in Kentucky, Japan, Taiwan, and China and those of Samsung Corning Precision Glass Co., Ltd. (Samsung Corning Precision) develop, manufacture and supply high quality glass substrates using a proprietary
fusion manufacturing process and technology expertise. Corning owns 50% of Samsung Corning Precision, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. owns 43% and three other shareholders own the remaining 7%. Samsung Corning Precision sells LCD glass to panel
manufacturers in Korea, while those panel manufacturers in other leading LCD-producing areas of the world - Japan, Taiwan, Singapore and China - are supplied by Corning. Samsung Corning Precision’s financial statements are attached in
Item 15, Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules.

Corning is a technology leader in this market introducing new large-sized glass
substrates used by our customers in the production of larger LCDs for monitors and television. We are recognized for providing product innovations that help our customers produce larger, lighter, thinner and higher-resolution displays more
affordably. In industry language, glass sizes advance in what are called generations. Glass substrates are currently available from Corning in sizes up to Generation 10 (2,850mm x 3,050mm). Generation 10 glass substrates are produced at our newest
manufacturing facility which opened in October 2009. This advanced facility, located at Sharp Corporation’s plant in Sakai City, Japan, eliminates the need for traditional packaging, shipping, and delivery methods. Large substrates (Generation
5 and higher) allow LCD manufacturers to produce larger and a greater number of panels from each substrate. The larger size leads to economies of scale for LCD manufacturers.

Corning invented its proprietary fusion manufacturing process, which is the cornerstone of the Company’s technology leadership in
the LCD industry. The automated process yields high quality glass substrates with excellent dimensional stability and uniformity - essential attributes for the production of increasingly larger, high performance active matrix LCDs. Corning’s
fusion process is scalable and has proven to be among the most effective processes in producing large size substrates. In 2006, Corning launched EAGLE XG

™

, the industry’s first environmentally-friendly LCD glass substrate that is free of heavy metals.

LCD glass manufacturing is a highly capital intensive business. Corning has made significant investments to expand its LCD glass facilities in response to customer demand. The environment is very
competitive. Important attributes for success include efficient manufacturing, access to capital, technology know-how, and patents.

Patent
protection and proprietary trade secrets are important to this segment’s operations. Corning has a growing portfolio of patents relating to its products, technologies and manufacturing processes. Corning licenses certain of its patents to
Samsung Corning Precision and other third parties and generates royalty income from these licenses. Refer to the material under the heading “Patents and Trademarks” for information relating to patents and trademarks.

Competition

Corning competes across all of its product lines with many large and varied manufacturers, both domestic and foreign. Some of these competitors are larger than Corning, and some have broader product
lines. Corning strives to maintain its position through technology and product innovation. For the future, Corning believes its competitive advantage lies in its commitment to research and development, and its commitment to quality. There is no
assurance that Corning will be able to maintain its market position or competitive advantage.

Display Technologies Segment

Corning, including Samsung Corning Precision, is the largest worldwide producer of glass substrates for active matrix LCD displays. Although the LCD
glass substrate industry was negatively impacted by economic conditions in 2008 and in the first quarter of 2009, demand increased in the second quarter and remained strong during the rest of 2009, allowing Corning to remain in a strong competitive
position. Corning believes it has sustained its competitive advantages in LCD glass substrate products by investing in new technologies, providing a consistent and reliable supply and using its proprietary fusion manufacturing process. This process
allows us to deliver glass that is larger, thinner and lighter, with exceptional surface quality and without heavy metals. Asahi Glass, Nippon Electric Glass and Avan Strate, Inc. (formerly NH Techno) are Corning’s principal competitors in
display glass substrates.

Telecommunications Segment

Competition within the telecommunications equipment industry is intense among several significant companies. Corning is a leading competitor in the segment’s principal product lines, which include
optical fiber and cable and hardware and equipment. Price and new product innovations are significant competitive factors. The competitive landscape includes increasing competition, causing price pressure in all regions. These competitive conditions
are likely to persist.

Corning is the largest producer of optical fiber and cable products, but faces significant competition due to
continued excess manufacturing capacity in the market, price pressure and new product innovations. Corning believes its large scale manufacturing experience, fiber process, technology leadership and intellectual property assets yield cost advantages
relative to several of its competitors. The primary competing producers of optical fiber and cable products are Furukawa Electric/OFS, Fujikura Ltd., Sumitomo Electric, Prysmian Cables & Systems and Draka Comteq.

For hardware and equipment products, significant competitors are 3M Company (3M), Tyco Electronics, Furukawa OFS, CommScope, and ADC Communications.



Environmental Technologies Segment

For worldwide automotive ceramic substrate products, Corning has a leading market position that has remained relatively stable over the past year. Corning believes its competitive advantage in automotive
ceramic substrate products for catalytic converters is based upon global presence, customer service, engineering design services and product innovation. Corning has established a strong presence in the heavy duty and light duty diesel vehicle
market. Corning’s Environmental Technologies products face principal competition from NGK, Denso, and Ibiden.

Specialty Materials
Segment

Corning is one of very few manufacturers with deep capabilities in materials science, optical design, shaping, coating,
finishing, metrology, and system assembly. Corning is addressing emerging needs of the consumer electronics industry with the development of its chemically strengthened glass. Our capabilities include sophisticated technologies in forming, coating,
and finishing that deliver high performance, durable solutions. These capabilities position the Company to meet the needs of a broad array of markets including aerospace/defense, display, semiconductor, astronomy, vision care, industrial/commercial,
and telecommunications. For this segment, Schott, Shin-Etsu Quartz Products, Asahi Fine Glass, Carl Zeiss, Nikon, NEG, Transitions Optical, Oerlikon, Hoya and Heraeus are the main competitors.

Life Sciences Segment

Corning is a
leading supplier of glass and plastic laboratory products, with a growing plastics products market presence in North America and Europe, and a solid laboratory glass products market presence. Corning seeks to maintain competitive advantages by
emphasizing product quality, product availability, supply chain efficiency, a wide product line and superior product attributes. For laboratory products, Greiner, Becton Dickinson, Kimble-Chase, and Duran are the principal worldwide competitors.
Corning also faces increasing competition from two large distributors that have pursued backward integration or introduced private label products.

Raw Materials

Corning’s production of specialty glasses, ceramics, and related materials requires significant
quantities of energy, uninterrupted power sources, certain precious metals, and various batch materials.

Although energy shortages have not
been a problem recently, the cost of energy remains volatile. Corning has achieved flexibility through important engineering changes to take advantage of low-cost energy sources in most significant processes. Specifically, many of Corning’s
principal manufacturing processes can be operated with natural gas, propane, oil or electricity, or a combination of these energy sources.

Availability of resources (ores, minerals, polymers, and processed chemicals) required in manufacturing operations, appears to be adequate. Corning’s suppliers, from time to time, may experience capacity limitations in their own
operations, or may eliminate certain product lines. Corning believes it has adequate programs to ensure a reliable supply of batch materials and precious metals. For many products, Corning has alternate glass compositions that would allow operations
to continue without interruption in the event of specific materials shortages.

Certain key materials and proprietary equipment used in the
manufacturing of products are currently sole-sourced or available only from a limited number of suppliers. Any future difficulty in obtaining sufficient and timely delivery of components could result in lost sales due to delays or reductions in
product shipments, or reductions in Corning’s gross margins.

Patents and Trademarks

Inventions by members of Corning’s research and engineering staff have been, and continue to be, important to the Company’s growth. Patents have
been granted on many of these inventions in the United States and other countries. Some of these patents have been licensed to other manufacturers, including companies in which Corning has equity investments. Many of the earlier patents have now
expired, but Corning continues to seek and obtain patents protecting its newer innovations. In 2009, Corning was granted over 180 patents in the U.S. and over 300 patents in countries outside the U.S.



Each business segment possesses its own patent portfolio that provides certain competitive advantages in
protecting Corning’s innovations. Corning has historically enforced, and will continue to enforce, its intellectual property rights. At the end of 2009, Corning and its wholly-owned subsidiaries owned over 4,350 unexpired patents in various
countries of which about 2,450 were U.S. patents. Between 2010 and 2012, approximately 11% of these patents will expire, while at the same time Corning intends to seek patents protecting its newer innovations. Worldwide, Corning has over 5,700
patent applications in process, with about 1,760 in process in the U.S. Corning believes that its patent portfolio will continue to provide a competitive advantage in protecting Corning’s innovation, although Corning’s competitors in each
of its businesses are actively seeking patent protection as well.

Item 1A.    Risk Factors

Set forth below are some of the principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual business results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements contained in this Report or
otherwise have a detrimental affect on the Company. These risks should be considered in making any investment decisions in Corning. Future results could be materially affected by general industry and market conditions, changes in laws or accounting
rules, general economic and political conditions, including a global economic slowdown, fluctuation of interest rates or currency exchange rates, terrorism, political unrest or international conflicts, political instability or major health concerns,
natural disasters or other disruptions of expected business conditions. These risk factors should be considered in addition to our cautionary comments concerning forward-looking statements in this Annual Report. Additional risks not described above,
or unknown to us, may also adversely affect Corning or its results.

As a result of the recession in the economies of the United States and
many other countries and volatility and uncertainty in global capital and credit markets, a number of the risks we normally face may increase in both our consolidated operations and at our equity method investments. These include:

•

Reduced consumer demand for the products our customers manufacture, notably automobiles and heavy duty trucks, LCD televisions and computer monitors
which results in lowering demand for the products we sell.

•

Increased price competition resulting in lower sales, profitability and cash flow.

•

Deterioration in the financial condition of our customers resulting in reduced sales, an inability to collect receivables, payment delays or
potentially bankruptcy or insolvency.

•

Increased risk of insolvency of financial institutions, which may limit Corning’s liquidity in the future or adversely affect its ability to use
its revolving credit facility, or result in losses from hedged transactions or from counterparty risk on various financial transactions.

•

Increased turmoil in the financial markets may limit Corning’s, its customers’ or suppliers’ ability to access the capital markets or
require limitations or terms and conditions for such access that are more restrictive and costly than in the past.

•

Declines in our businesses that could result in material charges for restructuring or asset impairments.

•

Increased risk that financial investments by our customers, suppliers or equity companies may not achieve historical levels of liquidity.

Our sales could be negatively impacted by the actions or circumstances of one or more key customers leading to the
substantial reduction in orders for our products

In 2009, Corning’s ten largest customers accounted for 52% of our sales.



In addition, a relatively small number of customers accounted for a high percentage of net sales in the
majority of our reportable operating segments. For 2009, three customers of the Display Technologies segment accounted for 62% of total segment net sales when combined. In the Telecommunications segment, one customer accounted for 12% of segment net
sales. In the Environmental Technologies segment, three customers accounted for 85% of total segment sales in aggregate. In the Life Sciences segment, two distributors accounted for 45% of segment sales in 2009. As a result of mergers and
consolidations between customers, Corning’s customer base could become more concentrated.

Samsung Corning Precision’s sales were
also concentrated in 2009, with sales to two LCD panel makers located in South Korea accounting for approximately 93% of total Samsung Corning Precision sales.

The sale of LCD glass substrates in 2009 and previous years provide no assurance that positive trends will continue. Our customers are LCD panel and color filter makers. As they switch to larger size
glass, the pace of their orders may be uneven while they adjust their manufacturing processes and facilities. Additionally, consumer preferences for panels of differing sizes, designs, price, or other seasonal factors, may lead to pauses in market
growth from time to time. Our customers may not be able to maintain their profitability or access sufficient capital to fund routine maintenance and operations or planned expansions, which may limit their pace of orders to us. Emerging material
technologies could replace our glass substrates for certain applications resulting in a decline in demand for our LCD products. Technologies for displays in competition with LCD panels may reduce or eliminate the need for our glass substrates. These
technologies may include organic light emitting diodes and plasma display panels. New process technologies developed by our competitors may also place us at a cost or quality disadvantage. Our inability to manufacture glass substrates in the sizes
and quantities needed by our customers may result in loss of revenue, margins and profits or liabilities for failure to supply. A scarcity of resources, limitations on technology, personnel or other factors resulting in a failure to produce
commercial quantities of very large size glass substrates, particularly from facilities at a major customer in Japan, could have adverse financial consequences to us.

Our Telecommunications segment customers’ purchases of our products are affected by their capital expansion plans, general market and economic uncertainty and regulatory changes, including broadband
policy. Sales in the Telecommunications segment are expected to be impacted by the pace of fiber-to-the-premises deployments by our customers such as Verizon Communications Inc. Our sales will be dependent on planned targets for homes passed and
connected. Changes in our customers’ deployment plans could adversely affect future sales in any quarter or for the full year.

In the
Environmental Technologies segment, sales of our ceramic substrate and filter products for automotive and diesel emissions and pollution control are expected to fluctuate with vehicle production. Changes in governmental laws and regulations for air
quality and emission controls may also influence future sales. Sales in our Environmental Technologies segment are mainly to three catalyzers and emission system component manufacturers. Our customers sell these systems to automotive original
equipment manufacturers and diesel engine manufacturers. Sales within this segment may be affected by adverse developments in the global vehicle or U.S. freight hauling industries or by such factors as higher fuel prices that may affect vehicle
sales or downturns in freight traffic.

Sales in our Specialty Materials segment track worldwide economic cycles and our customers’
responses to that cycle.

Sales in our Life Sciences segment are through two large distributors, and the remaining balance is to a variety of
government entities, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, hospitals, universities and other research facilities. In 2009, our two largest distributors accounted for 45% of Life Sciences’ segment sales. Changes in our distribution
arrangements in this segment may adversely affect this segment’s financial results.

If the markets for our products do not develop
and expand as we anticipate, demand for our products may decline, which would negatively impact our results of operations and financial performance

The markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technologies, evolving industry or government standards and new product introductions. Our success is expected to depend, in substantial
part, on the successful introduction of new products, or upgrades of current products, and our ability to compete with new technologies. The following factors related to our products and markets, if not achieved, could have an adverse impact on our
results of operations:

•

our ability to introduce leading products such as glass substrates for liquid crystal displays, optical fiber and cable and hardware and equipment, and
environmental substrate and filter products at competitive prices;

•

our ability to manufacture adequate quantities of increasingly larger glass substrates to satisfy our customers technical requirements and our
contractual obligations;

•

continued strong demand for notebook computers and LCD monitors;

•

growth in purchases of LCD televisions to replace other technologies;

•

screen size of LCD televisions, which affects glass demand;



•

our ability to develop new products in response to government regulations and laws, particularly diesel filter products in the Environmental
Technologies segment;

•

growth of the fiber-to-the-premises build-out in North America and western Europe; and

•

growth in emerging markets in other geographic regions.

We face pricing pressures in each of our leading businesses that could adversely affect our financial performance

We face pricing pressure in each of our leading businesses as a result of intense competition, emerging new technologies, or over-capacity. While we will work toward reducing our costs to offset pricing
pressures, we may not be able to achieve proportionate reductions in costs or to sustain our current rate of cost reduction We anticipate pricing pressures will continue into 2010 and beyond in all our businesses.

We face risks related to our international operations and sales

We have customers and significant operations, including manufacturing and sales, located outside the U.S. We have large manufacturing operations for liquid crystal display glass substrates in Taiwan,
Japan and Korea, including an equity investment in Samsung Corning Precision operating in South Korea that makes glass substrates for the Korean LCD market. All of our Display segment customers are located in the Asia-Pacific region. As a result of
these and other international operations, we face a number of risks, including:

•

geographical concentration of our factories and operations and regional shifts in our customer base;

•

periodic health epidemic concerns;

•

difficulty of managing global operations;

•

difficulty in protecting intellectual property or sensitive commercial and operations data or information technology systems generally;

•

tariffs, duties and other trade barriers including anti-dumping duties;

•

differing legal systems;

•

natural disasters such as earthquakes;

•

potential power loss affecting glass production and equipment damage;

•

political and economic instability in foreign markets; and

•

foreign currency risk.

Any of these items could cause our sales or profitability to be significantly reduced.

Additionally, a significant amount of the
specialized manufacturing capacity for our Display Technologies segment is concentrated in three overseas countries and it is reasonably possible that the use of one or more such facilities could be disrupted. Due to the specialized nature of the
assets and the customers’ locations, it may not be possible to find replacement capacity quickly or substitute production from facilities in other countries. Accordingly, loss of these facilities could produce a near-term severe impact on our
display business and the Company as a whole.

We face risks due to foreign currency fluctuations

Because we have significant customers and operations outside the U.S., fluctuations in foreign currencies, especially the Japanese yen, New Taiwan dollar,
Korean won, and euro, affect our sales and profit levels. Foreign exchange rates may make our products less competitive in countries where local currencies decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar and Japanese yen. Sales in our Display
Technologies segment, representing 45% of Corning’s sales in 2009, are denominated in Japanese yen. If sales grow in our Display Technologies segment, that will increase our exposure to currency fluctuations. Corning hedges significant
transaction and balance sheet currency exposures and uses derivatives instruments to limit exposure to foreign currency fluctuations associated with certain monetary assets and liabilities as well as operating results. Although we selectively hedge
these items, changes in exchange rates (especially the Japanese yen to U.S. dollar) may significantly impact our reported revenues and profits.

If the financial condition of our customers declines, our credit risks could increase

Although we have a rigorous process to
administer credit and believe our reserve is adequate, we have experienced, and in the future may experience, losses as a result of our inability to collect our accounts receivable. If our customers or our indirect customers fail to meet their
payment obligations for our products, we could experience reduced cash flows and losses in excess of amounts reserved. Some customers of our Display Technologies segment are thinly capitalized and/or marginally profitable. In our Environmental
Technologies segment, the U.S. auto makers and certain of their suppliers have encountered credit downgrades or have filed for bankruptcy protection. These factors may result in an inability to collect receivables or a possible loss in business. As
of December 31, 2009 reserves and allowances for trade receivables totaled approximately $20 million.



If we do not successfully adjust our manufacturing volumes and fixed cost structure, or achieve
manufacturing yields or sufficient product reliability, our operating results and cash flow could suffer, and we may not achieve anticipated profitability levels

Investments in additional manufacturing capacity of certain businesses, including liquid crystal display glass and diesel emission substrates and filters present challenges. We may face technical and
process issues in moving to commercial production and there can be no assurance that Corning will be able to pace its capacity expansion to the actual demand. Economic results may adversely affect our ability to complete planned capacity expansion
and products. It is possible that manufacturing capacity may exceed or lag customer demand during certain periods.

The manufacturing of our
products involves highly complex and precise processes, requiring production in highly controlled and dust-free environments. Changes in our manufacturing processes could significantly reduce our manufacturing yields and product reliability. In some
cases, existing manufacturing may be insufficient to achieve the requirements of our customers. We will need to develop new manufacturing processes and techniques to achieve targeted volume, pricing and cost levels that will permit profitable
operations. While we continue to fund projects to improve our manufacturing techniques and processes, we may not achieve satisfactory cost levels in our manufacturing activities that will fully satisfy our profitability targets.

Our future financial performance depends on our ability to purchase a sufficient amount of materials, precious metals, parts, and manufacturing equipment
components to meet the demands of our customers

Our ability to meet customer demand depends, in part, on our ability to obtain timely and
adequate delivery of materials, precious metals, parts and components from our suppliers. We may experience shortages that could adversely affect our operations. Although we work closely with our suppliers to avoid shortages, there can be no
assurances that we will not encounter these problems in the future. Furthermore, certain manufacturing equipment, raw materials or components are available only from a single source or limited sources. We may not be able to find alternate sources in
a timely manner. A reduction, interruption or delay of supply, or a significant increase in the price for supplies, such as manufacturing equipment, precious metals, raw materials or energy, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses.

We have incurred, and may in the future incur, restructuring and other charges, the amounts of which are difficult to predict accurately

We have recorded several charges for restructuring, impairment of assets, and the write-off of cost and equity-based investments. As a
result of the decline in the economy and its impact on Corning’s businesses, we recorded restructuring charges of $228 million in 2009. Certain of our equity affiliates have also recorded restructuring charges. We and our affiliates may have
additional actions that result in restructuring charges in the future.

We have incurred, and may in the future incur, goodwill and other
intangible asset impairment charges

At December 31, 2009, Corning had goodwill and other intangible assets of $676 million. While we
believe the estimates and judgments about future cash flows used in the goodwill impairment tests are reasonable, we cannot provide assurance that future impairment charges will not be required if the expected cash flow estimates as projected by
management do not occur, especially if an economic recession occurs and continues for a lengthy period or becomes severe, or if acquisitions made by the Company fail to achieve expected returns.

If our products, including materials purchased from our suppliers, experience performance issues, our business will suffer

Our business depends on the production of products of consistently high quality. Our products, components and materials purchased from our suppliers, are
typically tested for quality. These testing procedures are limited to evaluating our products under likely and foreseeable failure scenarios. For various reasons, our products, including materials purchased from our suppliers, may fail to perform as
expected. In some cases, product redesigns or additional expense may be required to correct a defect. A significant or systemic product failure could result in customer relations problems, lost sales, and financial damages.

We face competition in most of our businesses

We expect that we will face additional competition from existing competitors, low cost manufacturers and new entrants. We must invest in research and development, expand our engineering, manufacturing and marketing capabilities, and
continue to improve customer service and support in order to remain competitive. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to maintain or improve our competitive position.



Changes in our effective tax rate or tax liability may have an adverse effect on our results of
operations

Our effective tax rate could be adversely impacted by several factors, some of which are outside of our control, including:

•

changes in the relative amounts of income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates;

•

changes in tax laws and the interpretation of those tax laws;

•

changes to our assessments about the realizability of our deferred tax assets that are based on estimates of our future results, the prudence and
feasibility of possible tax planning strategies, and the economic environments in which we do business;

•

the outcome of current and future tax audits, examinations, or administrative appeals;

•

changes in generally accepted accounting principles that affect the accounting for taxes; and

•

limitations or adverse findings regarding our ability to do business in some jurisdictions.

In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Significant judgment
is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination could be materially different from our historical tax provisions and accruals.

Accounting and disclosure rules may affect financial results

Generally accepted accounting principles and accompanying accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines, and interpretations for many areas of our business, such as revenue recognition, accounting
for investments, and accounting for stock options, are very complex and involve significant and sometimes subjective judgments. Changes in these rules or their interpretation could significantly impact our reported earnings and operating income and
could add significant volatility to those measures in the future, without a corresponding change in our cash flows.

We rely on key
personnel and the loss of their services or the inability to attract and retain them may negatively affect our businesses

Our ability to
continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified research and development, engineering and operating personnel, generally and during periods of rapid growth, especially in those of our businesses focused on new products and advanced manufacturing
processes, is essential to our business success. We also depend on the services of experienced key senior management.

The loss of the
services of any of our key research and development, engineering or operational personnel or senior management without adequate replacement, or the inability to attract new qualified personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our operations
and financial performance.

We are subject to strict environmental regulations and regulatory changes that could result in fines or
restrictions that interrupt our operations

Our manufacturing process generates chemical waste, waste water and other industrial waste and
various green house gases at various stages in the manufacturing process, and we are currently or may be in the future subject to a variety of laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of such substances. We have
installed various types of anti-pollution equipment for the treatment of chemical waste and waste water at our various facilities. We have taken steps to affect the amount of greenhouse gases created by our manufacturing operations. However, we
cannot provide assurance that environmental claims will not be brought against us or that the local or national governments will not take steps toward adopting more stringent environment standards.

Any failure on our part to comply with any present or future environmental regulations could result in the assessment of damages or imposition of fines
against us, or the suspension/cessation of production or operations. In addition, environmental regulations could require us to acquire costly equipment, incur other significant compliance expenses or limit or restrict production or operations and
thus materially and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Changes in regulations and the
regulatory environment in the U.S. and other countries, such as those resulting from the regulation and impact of global warming and CO


abatement, may affect our businesses and their results in adverse ways by, among other things, substantially increasing
manufacturing costs, limiting availability of scarce resources, especially energy, or requiring limitations on production and sale of our products or those of our customers.



We may experience difficulties in enforcing our intellectual property rights and we may be subject to
claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others

We may encounter difficulties in protecting our intellectual
property rights or obtaining rights to additional intellectual property necessary to permit us to continue or expand our businesses. We cannot assure you that the patents that we hold or may obtain will provide meaningful protection against our
competitors. Changes in laws concerning intellectual property may affect our ability to protect our intellectual property. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights. Litigation is inherently uncertain and the outcome is
often unpredictable. Other companies hold patents on technologies used in our industries and are aggressively seeking to expand, enforce and license their patent portfolios.

The intellectual property rights of others could inhibit our ability to introduce new products. We are, and may in the future be, subject to claims of intellectual property infringement or
misappropriation that may result in loss of revenue, require us to incur substantial costs, or lead to monetary damages or injunctive relief against us. We cannot assure you as to the outcome of any such claims.

Current or future litigation may harm our financial condition or results of operations

Pending, threatened or future litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties. Our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected by unfavorable outcomes, expenses and costs
exceeding amounts estimated or insured. In particular, we have been named as a defendant in numerous lawsuits alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos, and adverse rulings in such lawsuits or the inability to successfully resolve such
matters may adversely affect the Company. As described in Legal Proceedings, a new PCC Plan of Reorganization was filed with the Bankruptcy Court on January 29, 2009 proposing a resolution of PCC asbestos claims. It remains reasonably possible
that changes to the Amended PCC Plan may be negotiated, and the elements of the plan and its approval are subject to a number of contingencies before the resolution outlined in the Plan becomes final.

We face risks through our equity method investments in companies that we do not control

Corning’s net income includes significant equity in earnings of associated companies. For the year ended December 31, 2009, we recognized $1.4
billion of equity earnings, of which 98% came from our two largest investments: Dow Corning (which makes silicone and high purity polycrystalline products) and Samsung Corning Precision (which primarily makes liquid crystal display glass). Samsung
Corning Precision is located in the Asia-Pacific region and is subject to political and geographic risks mentioned above, as well as business and other risks within the Display segment. Our equity investments may not continue to perform at the same
levels as in recent years. In 2007, we recognized equity losses associated with Samsung Corning Co., Ltd. (a 50% equity method investment that made glass panels and funnels for conventional televisions), which recorded fixed asset and other
impairment charges. Dow Corning emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2004 and has certain obligations under its Plan of Reorganization to resolve and fund claims of its creditors and personal injury claimants. Dow Corning may incur further
bankruptcy charges in the future, which may adversely affect its operations or assets.

We may not have adequate insurance coverage for
claims against us

We face the risk of loss resulting from product liability, securities, fiduciary liability, intellectual property,
antitrust, contractual, warranty, environmental, fraud and other lawsuits, whether or not such claims are valid. In addition, our product liability, fiduciary, directors and officers, property including business interruption, natural catastrophe and
comprehensive general liability insurance may not be adequate to cover such claims or may not be available to the extent we expect in the future. Our insurance costs can be volatile and, at any time, can increase given changes in market supply and
demand and our claim history. We may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage in the future at acceptable costs. A successful claim that exceeds or is not covered by our policies could require us to pay substantial sums. Some of the
carriers in our primary and excess insurance programs are in liquidation and may not be able to respond if we should have claims reaching into their layers. The financial health of other insurers may deteriorate. Several of our insurance carriers
are litigating with us the extent, if any, of their obligation to provide insurance coverage for asbestos liabilities asserted against us. The results of that litigation may adversely affect our insurance coverage for those risks. In addition, we
may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage for certain types of risk such as political risks, terrorism or war.

Our businesses
may be subject to increased regulatory enforcement

Some of our business segments operate in industries with a concentrated number of
competitors and customers both foreign and domestic. While we have adopted a corporate-wide compliance program, we may become the subject of antitrust or other governmental investigations from many jurisdictions that may adversely impact our
reputation or our ability to make and sell products in the future.



Other

Additional information in response to Item 1 is found in Note 20 (Operating Segments) to the Consolidated Financial Statements and in Item 6 (Selected Financial Data).

Item 1B.    Unresolved Staff Comments

None.

Item 2.    Properties

We operate approximately 60 manufacturing plants and processing facilities, of which approximately one-half are located in the U.S. We own substantially all
of our executive and corporate buildings, which are located in Corning, New York. We also own substantially all of our research and development facilities and the majority of our manufacturing facilities. We own approximately 23% of our sales and
administrative facilities, while the remaining portion are leased facilities.

For the years ended 2009, 2008 and 2007, we invested a total of
$4.1 billion, primarily in facilities outside of the U.S. in our Display Technologies segment. Of the $890 million spent in 2009, approximately half was for facilities outside the U.S.

Manufacturing, sales and administrative, and research and development facilities have an aggregate floor space of approximately 24 million square feet. Distribution of this total area follows:

Total assets and capital expenditures by operating segment are included in Note 20 (Operating Segments) to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Information concerning lease commitments is included in Note 14 (Commitments, Contingencies,
and Guarantees) to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

As a result of a decline in demand for our LCD glass in the second half of 2008, we
had temporarily idled more than half of our manufacturing capacity in the Display Technologies segment by the end of 2008. A large portion of this capacity was brought back on-line in 2009 to meet an increase in demand and to replace existing
capacity when needed.

Since 2002, we have had excess manufacturing capacity in our Telecommunications segment and have not utilized a portion
of space in the facilities listed above. The largest unused portion is our optical fiber manufacturing facility in Concord, North Carolina that was mothballed in 2002 as a result of lowered demand of optical fiber products. In 2007, we re-opened a
portion of the Concord, North Carolina facility as a result of volume growth in the optical fiber market.

Item 3.    Legal Proceedings

Environmental Litigation.

Corning has been named by the
Environmental Protection Agency (the Agency) under the Superfund Act, or by state governments under similar state laws, as a potentially responsible party for 21 active hazardous waste sites. Under the Superfund Act, all parties who may have
contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site, identified by such Agency, are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the Agency agrees otherwise. It is Corning’s policy to accrue for its estimated liability related to
Superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned by Corning based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants. At December 31, 2009, Corning had accrued approximately $26
million (undiscounted) for its estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation. Based upon the information developed to date, management believes that the accrued reserve is a reasonable estimate of the Company’s liability
and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote.

Dow Corning Bankruptcy.

Corning
and Dow Chemical each own 50% of the common stock of Dow Corning. In May 1995, Dow Corning filed for bankruptcy protection to address pending and claimed liabilities arising from many thousands of breast implant product lawsuits. On June 1,
2004, Dow Corning emerged from Chapter 11 with a Plan of Reorganization (the Plan) which provided for the settlement or other resolution of implant claims. The Plan also includes releases for Corning and Dow Chemical as shareholders in exchange for
contributions to the Plan.



Under the terms of the Plan, Dow Corning has established and is funding a Settlement Trust and a Litigation
Facility to provide a means for tort claimants to settle or litigate their claims. Inclusive of insurance, Dow Corning has paid approximately $1.6 billion to the Settlement Trust. As of December 31, 2009, Dow Corning had recorded a reserve for
breast implant litigation of $1.6 billion and anticipates insurance receivables of $16 million. As a separate matter arising from the bankruptcy proceedings, Dow Corning is defending claims asserted by a number of commercial creditors who claim
additional interest at default rates and enforcement costs, during the period from May 1995 through June 2004. As of December 31, 2009, Dow Corning has estimated the liability to commercial creditors to be within the range of $83 million to
$260 million. As Dow Corning management believes no single amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other amount within the range, Dow Corning has recorded the minimum liability within the range. Should Dow Corning not
prevail in this matter, Corning’s equity earnings would be reduced by its 50% share of the amount in excess of $83 million, net of applicable tax benefits. In addition, the London Market Insurers (the LMI Claimants) have claimed a reimbursement
right with respect to a portion of insurance proceeds previously paid by the LMI Claimants to Dow Corning. This claim is based on a theory that the LMI Claimants overestimated Dow Corning’s liability for the resolution of implant claims
pursuant to the Plan. The LMI Claimants offered two calculations of their claim amount: $54 million and $93 million, plus minimum interest of $67 million and $116 million, respectively. These estimates were explicitly characterized as preliminary
and subject to change. Litigation regarding this claim is in the discovery stage. Dow Corning disputes the claim and is unable to reasonably estimate any potential liability. There are a number of other claims in the bankruptcy proceedings against
Dow Corning awaiting resolution by the U.S. District Court, and it is reasonably possible that Dow Corning may record bankruptcy-related charges in the future. There are no remaining tort claims against Corning, other than those that will be
channeled by the Plan into facilities established by the Plan or otherwise defended by the Litigation Facility.

Pittsburgh Corning
Corporation.

Corning and PPG Industries, Inc. (PPG) each own 50% of the capital stock of Pittsburgh Corning Corporation (PCC). Over a period of more than two decades, PCC and several other defendants have been named in numerous lawsuits
involving claims alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos. On April 16, 2000, PCC filed for Chapter 11 reorganization in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. At the time PCC filed for bankruptcy
protection, there were approximately 11,800 claims pending against Corning in state court lawsuits alleging various theories of liability based on exposure to PCC’s asbestos products and typically requesting monetary damages in excess of one
million dollars per claim. Corning has defended those claims on the basis of the separate corporate status of PCC and the absence of any facts supporting claims of direct liability arising from PCC’s asbestos products. Corning is also currently
involved in approximately 10,400 other cases (approximately 38,800 claims) alleging injuries from asbestos and similar amounts of monetary damages per case. Those cases have been covered by insurance without material impact to Corning to date. As
described below, several of Corning’s insurance carriers have filed a legal proceeding concerning the extent of any insurance coverage for these claims. Asbestos litigation is inherently difficult, and past trends in resolving these claims may
not be indicators of future outcomes.

On March 28, 2003, Corning announced that it had reached agreement with the representatives of
asbestos claimants for the resolution of all current and future asbestos claims against it and PCC, which might arise from PCC products or operations (the 2003 Plan). The 2003 Plan would have required Corning to relinquish its equity interest in
PCC, contribute its equity interest in Pittsburgh Corning Europe N.V. (PCE), a Belgian corporation, contribute 25 million shares of Corning common stock, and pay a total of $140 million in six annual installments (present value $131 million at
March 2003), beginning one year after the plan’s effective date, with 5.5 percent interest from June 2004. In addition, the 2003 Plan provided that Corning would assign certain insurance policy proceeds from its primary insurance and a portion
of its excess insurance.

On December 21, 2006, the Bankruptcy Court issued an order denying confirmation of the 2003 Plan for reasons it
set out in a memorandum opinion. Several parties, including Corning, filed motions for reconsideration. These motions were argued on March 5, 2007, and the Bankruptcy Court reserved decision.

On January 10, 2008, some of the parties in the proceeding advised the Bankruptcy Court that they had made substantial progress on a proposed amended
plan of reorganization (the Amended PCC Plan) that resolved issues raised by the Court in denying the confirmation of the 2003 Plan and that would therefore make it unnecessary for the Bankruptcy Court to decide the motion for reconsideration. On
March 27, 2008 and May 22, 2008, the parties further informed the Bankruptcy Court on the progress toward the Amended PCC Plan. The parties filed a partial tentative plan on August 8, 2008. The parties continued to inform the
Bankruptcy Court of the status of their discussions on the Amended PCC Plan. The complete Amended PCC Plan and its ancillary documents were filed with the Bankruptcy Court on January 29, 2009.



As a result, Corning believes the Amended PCC Plan now represents the most probable outcome of this matter
and expects that the Amended PCC Plan will be confirmed by the Court. At the same time, Corning believes the 2003 Plan no longer serves as the basis for the Company’s best estimate of liability. Key provisions of the Amended PCC Plan address
the concerns expressed by the Bankruptcy Court. Accordingly, in the first quarter of 2008, Corning adjusted its asbestos litigation liability to reflect components of the Amended PCC Plan. The proposed resolution of PCC asbestos claims under the
Amended PCC Plan requires Corning to contribute its equity interests in PCC and PCE and to contribute a fixed series of payments, recorded at present value. Corning will have the option to use its shares rather than cash to make these payments, but
the liability is fixed by dollar value and not the number of shares. The Amended PCC Plan would require Corning to make (1) one payment of $100 million one year from the date the Amended PCC Plan becomes effective and certain conditions are met
and (2) five additional payments of $50 million, on each of the five subsequent anniversaries of the first payment, the final payment of which is subject to reduction based on the application of credits under certain circumstances.

The Amended PCC Plan does not include non-PCC asbestos claims that may be or have been raised against Corning. Corning has recorded an additional $150
million for such claims in its estimated asbestos litigation liability. The liability for non-PCC claims was estimated based upon industry data for asbestos claims since Corning does not have recent claim history due to the injunction issued by the
Bankruptcy Court. The estimated liability represents the undiscounted projection of claims and related legal fees over the next 20 years. The amount may need to be adjusted in future periods as more Company-specific data becomes available.

The Amended PCC Plan is subject to a number of contingencies. Payment of the amounts required to fund the Amended PCC Plan from insurance and
other sources are subject to a number of conditions which may not be achieved. The approval of the Amended PCC Plan by the Bankruptcy Court is not certain and faces objections by some parties. Any approval of the Amended PCC Plan by the Bankruptcy
Court is subject to appeal. The Amended PCC Plan is subject to a vote of PCC’s creditors. For these and other reasons, Corning’s liability for these asbestos matters may be subject to changes in subsequent quarters. The estimate of the
cost of resolving the non-PCC asbestos claims may also be subject to change as developments occur. Management continues to believe that the likelihood of the uncertainties surrounding these proceedings causing a material adverse impact to
Corning’s financial statements is remote.

Several of Corning’s insurers have commenced litigation for a declaration of the rights
and obligations of the parties under insurance policies, including rights that may be affected by the potential resolutions described above. Corning is vigorously contesting these cases. Management is unable to predict the outcome of this insurance
litigation and therefore cannot estimate the range of any possible loss.

Seoul Guarantee Insurance Co. and other creditors against Samsung
Group and affiliates.

Prior to their merger, Samsung Corning Precision Glass Co., Ltd. (Samsung Corning Precision) and Samsung Corning Co. Ltd. (Samsung Corning) were two of approximately thirty co-defendants in a lawsuit filed by Seoul
Guarantee Insurance Co. and thirteen other creditors (SGI and Creditors) for alleged breach of an agreement that approximately twenty-eight affiliates of the Samsung group (Samsung Affiliates) entered into with SGI and Creditors on August 24,
1999 (the Agreement). The lawsuit is pending in the courts of South Korea. Under the Agreement it is alleged that the Samsung Affiliates agreed to sell certain shares of Samsung Life Insurance Co., Ltd. (SLI), which had been transferred to SGI and
Creditors in connection with the petition for court receivership of Samsung Motor Inc. In the lawsuit, SGI and Creditors allege a breach of the Agreement by the Samsung Affiliates and are seeking the loss of principal (approximately $1.95 billion)
for loans extended to Samsung Motors Inc., default interest and a separate amount for breach. On January 31, 2008, the Seoul District Court ordered the Samsung Affiliates: to pay approximately $1.30 billion by disposing of 2,334,045 shares of
SLI less 1,165,955 shares of SLI previously sold by SGI and Creditors and paying the proceeds to SGI and Creditors; to satisfy any shortfall by participating in the purchase of equity or subordinate debentures issued by them; and pay default
interest of 6% per annum. The ruling has been appealed. On November 10, 2009, the Appellate Court directed the parties to attempt to resolve this matter through mediation. As a result, the parties are discussing the possibility of a
settlement of this matter. Due to the uncertainties around the financial impact to each of the respective Samsung affiliates, Samsung Corning Precision is unable to reasonably estimate the amount of potential loss, if any, associated with this case
and therefore no provision for such loss is reflected in its financial statements. Other than as described above, no claim in these matters has been asserted against Corning or any of its affiliates.

Ellsworth Industrial Park, Downers Grove, IL Environmental Litigation.

Corning has settled claims for contribution for personal injury and property
damage arising from the alleged release of solvents from the operations of several corporate defendants at the Ellsworth Industrial Park into soil and groundwater. Corning has also settled a cost-recovery action by the State of Illinois against a
number of corporate defendants as a result of an alleged groundwater contamination at this industrial park site. Two additional corporate defendants have made claims for contribution for property damage and cost recovery for remediations at this
industrial park site, one of which has been voluntarily dismissed. The second case was dismissed by the Court on August 12, 2009. On November 17, 2009, the Court denied plaintiff’s request to file an amended complaint. On
December 14, 2009, plaintiff gave notice of its appeal of the District Court’s opinion and order dismissing its case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.



Commission of European Communities Competition Investigation.

In connection with an investigation by
the Commission of the European Communities, Competition DG, of alleged anticompetitive behavior relating to the worldwide production of LCD glass, Corning and Samsung Corning Precision received a request on March 30, 2009, for certain
information from the Competition DG. Corning and Samsung Corning Precision have responded to those requests for information. On October 9, 2009, in connection with its investigation, the Competition DG made a further request for information
from both Corning and Samsung Corning Precision to which each party has responded. Samsung Corning Precision has also responded to the Competition DG and authorities in other jurisdictions, including the United States in connection with similar
investigations of alleged anticompetitive behavior relating to worldwide production of cathode ray tube glass.

Supply Agreement
Disputes.

In early September 2009, a significant customer of Corning’s LCD glass display business in Asia notified Corning Display Technologies Taiwan Co. Ltd. in writing that it considers Corning Display Technologies to be in breach of the
supply agreement between the companies. Corning Display Technologies disagrees that any breach exists, and the parties are currently engaged in discussions with a view to resolving these matters. Corning Display Technologies anticipates an amicable
resolution. However, failure to resolve the disputed claims could result in arbitration and the award of damages to the customer and/or the termination of the supply agreement.

In January 2010, Corning received notification from one of the indirect customers for its environmental products seeking reassurance from Corning that Corning would honor certain supply obligations
regarding the supply of catalytic converter substrates and objecting to a proposed allocation of such products that might affect that customer. Corning is discussing these issues with this and other indirect and direct customers of its Environmental
Technologies segment.

Forward-Looking Statements

OVERVIEW

Corning delivered strong operating results in 2009 in spite of the recession that followed last
year’s global economic decline and financial market disruption. Although results for most of our operating segments were down when compared to last year, we saw demand for Display Technologies products increase as the year progressed and some
strength in our other segments as well. Government incentives helped to improve results in the Environmental Technologies segment in the second half of the year. Results in the Telecommunications segment reflected strength in demand for optical
fiber and cable products in China. In the Life Sciences segment, we completed the acquisition of Axygen BioScience, Inc. to support our strategy to expand our portfolio of products and enhance global customer access in this business. We saw an
increase in sales of Corning Gorilla

®

glass, our protective cover glass that is optimized for portable display
devices. We ended the year on a positive note as sales in most of our segments continued to improve in the fourth quarter of 2009 when compared to the third quarter of 2009. Net income, although substantially lower than the previous year, reflected
a number of non-operating items in 2008 that were not repeated in the current year. Those items are described more fully in the discussion of our profitability below.

In the second half of 2008 and in early 2009, the Company responded to a decline in demand by scaling back manufacturing operations, reducing research, development, and engineering expenses, reducing
capital spending, and reducing operating costs. In 2009, we recorded restructuring charges totaling $228 million for costs associated with workforce reductions in all of our operating segments.

We faced other challenges this past year, as well. In August, an earthquake halted production at one of the Company’s LCD glass manufacturing
facilities in Japan. In mid-October, production at our LCD glass manufacturing facility in Taichung, Taiwan was impacted by a power disruption. Production capacity in Taiwan and our ability to quickly resume some manufacturing helped to ease the
impact of both of these disruptions.

Corning remains committed to a strategy of growing through global innovation while preserving our
financial independence. This strategy has served us well. Our key priorities for 2009 are similar to those of the previous four years: protect our financial health and invest in the future. During 2009, we made the following progress on these
priorities:

Financial Health

Despite the uncertainty in the global economic environment, our financial position remained sound and we delivered strong cash flows from operating activities. Significant items in 2009 included the following:

•

Our debt to capital ratio at 11% was unchanged from December 31, 2008.

•

Operating cash flow for the year was $2.1 billion.

•

We ended the year with $3.6 billion of cash and short-term investments, which was approximately $800 million higher than last year.

Profitability

For the year ended December 31, 2009, we generated net income of $2.0 billion or $1.28 per share compared to net income of $5.3 billion or $3.32 per share for 2008. When compared to last year, the
decline in net income was due largely to the following items:

•

The absence of certain tax adjustments totaling $2.5 billion which included a $2.4 billion valuation allowance release in 2008 on our deferred tax
assets resulting from a change in the judgment about the realizability of deferred tax assets in future years.



•

The absence of a credit to asbestos litigation expense of $340 million reflecting the change in the estimate of our asbestos litigation liability
compared to expense of $20 million reported in the current year. In the first quarter of 2008, Corning reduced its liability for asbestos litigation by $327 million as a result of the increase in the likelihood of a settlement under more recently
proposed terms and a corresponding decrease in the likelihood of a settlement under terms established in 2003. For additional information on this matter, refer to Note 7 (Investments) to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 3. Legal
Proceedings.

•

Lower net income in the Display Technologies segment due to lower volume and lower prices.

•

The impact of restructuring charges in 2009 totaling $228 million for costs associated with workforce reductions in all of our operating segments.

The decrease in net income in 2009 was offset somewhat by $393 million from the favorable impact of movements in foreign
exchange rates along with lower operating expenses resulting from the Company’s restructuring activities.

Investing in our future

We continue to focus on the future and on what we do best - creating and making keystone components that enable
high-technology systems. While our spending levels for research, development and engineering were lower in 2009 when compared to 2008, we remain committed to investing in research, development, and engineering to drive innovation. We continue to
work on technologies for glass substrates for active matrix LCDs, diesel filters and substrates in response to tightening emissions control standards, and the optical fiber and cable and hardware and equipment that enable fiber-to-the-premises. We
continue to make investments in promising technologies such as the Epic™ system, synthetic green lasers, and advanced flow reactors. In 2010, we are broadening our innovation strategy to include a focus on opportunities that are adjacent or
closely related to our existing capabilities. These opportunities, which include products such as Gorilla

®

glass
for consumer products and thin-film photovoltaics for solar applications, leverage existing materials or manufacturing processes with slight modifications.

Our research, development and engineering expenditures decreased by $64 million in 2009 when compared to 2008, but remained somewhat constant as a percentage of net sales. Reduced spending in 2009 was
driven primarily by the impact of restructuring actions and cost reduction efforts. We believe our spending levels are adequate to support our technology and innovation strategies.

Our capital expenditures have been focused on expanding manufacturing capacity in the Display Technologies segment in anticipation of a
larger display market in 2010 and growing demand for Corning’s Gorilla

®

glass. In December 2007, we
announced a 5-year capital expenditure plan to locate a glass manufacturing facility at Sharp Corporation’s plant in Sakai City, Japan. We continued to advance this project to align with Sharp Corporation’s progress on their adjoining
facility and in October of 2009, the facility was opened. In February 2008, we announced a $453 million expansion of our LCD manufacturing facility in Taichung, Taiwan. Given the dramatic changes to the global economic landscape and the decline in
demand for our products in late 2008, we stopped further expansion in Taiwan. Total capital expenditures for 2009 were $890 million. Approximately $552 million was directed toward our Display Technologies segment in 2009, of which about $525 million
related to construction in 2008. Approximately $51 million in 2009 was invested in our Environmental Technologies segment.

We expect our 2010
capital spending to be about $600 million to $700 million, but there could also be up to $300 million of additional spending for adjacent opportunities, possible capacity in China, and precious metals to support growing capacity. Approximately $250
million to $350 million will be directed toward our Display Technologies segment.

Corporate Outlook

Our outlook for 2010 is favorable. Although we believe our sales and profitability will continue to be buffeted by the difficult global economic climate, we
believe worldwide demand for LCD glass will continue to increase. We expect sales in 2010 to be higher than 2009 driven by continued strength in demand for LCD televisions, computer notebooks, and desktop monitors. We believe gross margin will
expand driven by improvements in the Display and Environmental Technologies segments. We think equity earnings will improve as well. We expect to continue to generate positive cash flow from operations in line with recent years. We will monitor the
levels of recovery in certain of our businesses and we may incur further charges to reduce our workforce and consolidate capacity, where necessary. We will continue to focus on protecting our financial health, controlling our costs, and accelerating
new products while maintaining our emphasis on research and development investments for longer term growth. We may take advantage of acquisition opportunities that support the long-term strategies of our businesses, such as our recent purchase of
Axygen. We remain confident that our strategy to grow through global innovation, while preserving our financial stability, will enable our continued long-term success.



RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Selected highlights from our continuing operations follow (dollars in millions):

*

The percentage change calculation is not meaningful.

Net Sales

Net sales in 2009 decreased 9% due to lower sales in the majority of our segments when compared to 2008,
driven primarily by volume and price declines in the Display Technologies segment offset somewhat by $194 million from the positive impact of movements in foreign exchange rates. The largest portion of the net sales decline occurred in the first
quarter of 2009 as LCD glass demand fell rapidly in response to worsening economic conditions. Over the remainder of 2009, we saw demand levels for LCD glass increase in comparison to first quarter levels and, we believe, a corresponding expansion
in the LCD industry supply chain as demand for LCD televisions improved. In the fourth quarter of 2009, net sales increased 41% when compared to the same period last year and 4% when compared to the third quarter of 2009, driven by increased net
sales in the Display Technologies segment. For the full year of 2009, lower volume in the Environmental Technologies and Telecommunications segments also contributed to the decline in net sales as demand for automotive products declined and spending
for telecommunications networks contracted.

Net sales in 2008 were up slightly when compared to 2007, primarily due to the positive impact of
$354 million from the movement in foreign exchange rates offset by volume and price declines in a number of our segments as sales results followed the changing global economic conditions in 2008. Net sales for the first half of 2008 were up 21% when
compared with the first half of 2007, but down 16% for the second half of 2008 when compared to the second half of 2007, as the LCD glass market experienced a supply chain contraction that worsened with deteriorating economic conditions. Declines in
consumer spending reduced demand for LCD televisions and monitors and automotive products in the second half of 2008.

In 2009, net sales into
international markets continued to surpass those into the U.S. market. For 2009, net sales into international markets accounted for 76% of net sales. For 2008 and 2007, net sales into international markets accounted for 74% and 72%, respectively, of
net sales.



Cost of Sales

The types of expenses included in the cost of sales line item are: raw materials consumption, including direct and indirect materials; salaries, wages and benefits; depreciation and amortization;
production utilities; production-related purchasing; warehousing (including receiving and inspection); repairs and maintenance; inter-location inventory transfer costs; production and warehousing facility property insurance; rent for production
facilities; and other production overhead.

Gross Margin

For 2009, gross margin in dollars and as a percentage of net sales declined when compared to 2008, due primarily to the impact of price declines in the Display Technologies segment and reduced volume in
the Environmental Technologies and Telecommunications segments. As a percentage of net sales, gross margin of 27% in the first quarter of 2009, reflected the sharp decline in net sales as first quarter LCD glass demand continued to fall in response
to worsening economic conditions. As a percentage of net sales, gross margin approximated 41% in the second, third, and fourth quarters of 2009 and reflected improved demand in a number of our businesses.

For 2008, gross margin in dollars and as a percentage of net sales was relatively even when compared with 2007. Although gross margin was comparable on a
full year basis, in 2008 our gross margin percent remained above 47% in each of the first three quarters and then fell to 28% in the fourth quarter. The decline in gross margin in the fourth quarter resulted from significantly lower volume in our
Display Technologies, Telecommunications, and Environmental Technologies segments, the impact of excess idle capacity costs, and accelerated depreciation as we idled the manufacturing capacity in our Display Technologies segment by more than 50%.

Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general, and administrative expenses, in dollars, for 2009 were down slightly when compared to 2008, due primarily to the favorable impact of cost reduction efforts and restructuring actions in
2009, offset somewhat by an increase in performance-based compensation costs. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general, and administrative expenses in 2009 were up slightly because the rate of decline in sales exceeded the rate of decline in
spending for selling, general, and administrative costs.

The slight decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses for 2008 when
compared to 2007, in dollars, resulted from a decrease in performance-based compensation costs caused by the impact of the decline in profitability in most of our operating segments in the second half of 2008.

The types of expenses included in the selling, general and administrative expenses line item are: salaries, wages and benefits; travel; sales commissions;
professional fees; and depreciation and amortization, utilities, and rent for administrative facilities.

Research, Development, and
Engineering Expenses

Research, development, and engineering expenses for 2009 decreased by $64 million in 2009 when compared to 2008,
but remained constant as a percentage of net sales. Reduced spending in 2009 was driven primarily by the impact of restructuring actions and cost reduction efforts. We believe our spending levels are adequate to support our technology and innovation
strategies.

Research, development, and engineering expenses increased by $62 million in 2008 when compared to 2007, but remained fairly
constant as a percentage of net sales. The largest driver of increased spending was for the development of new businesses.

Restructuring, Impairment, and Other Charges and (Credits)

Corning recorded restructuring, impairment, and other
charges and credits in 2009 and in 2008, which affect the comparability of our results for the periods presented. A description of those charges follows:

2009 Restructuring Actions

In response to anticipated lower sales
in 2009, we recorded charges of $228 million in 2009 primarily for a corporate-wide restructuring plan to reduce our global workforce. The charges included costs for severance, special termination benefits, outplacement services, and the impact of a
$32 million curtailment loss for postretirement benefits in 2009. Total cash expenditures associated with these actions are expected to be approximately $155 million, with the majority of spending completed by 2010. We estimate annualized savings
from these actions will be about $224 million and will be reflected largely in cost of sales and selling, general, and administrative expenses.

2008 Restructuring Actions

In the fourth quarter of 2008, we
recorded $22 million of severance costs primarily for a restructuring plan in the Telecommunications segment.



Asbestos Litigation

In 2009, we recorded an increase to our asbestos litigation liability of $20 million compared to a net decrease of $340 million in 2008. The net decrease in 2008 was due primarily to a $327 million
reduction to our estimated liability for asbestos litigation that was recorded in the first quarter of 2008, as a result of the increase in the likelihood of a settlement under more recently proposed terms and a corresponding decrease in the
likelihood of a settlement under terms that had been established in 2003. For the remainder of 2008, we recorded net credit adjustments of $13 million to reflect the change in value of the estimated settlement liability.

In 2007 we recorded an increase to our asbestos litigation liability of $185 million for the change in the estimated fair value of the components of the
asbestos litigation liability under terms established in 2003.

Our asbestos litigation liability was estimated to be $682 million at
December 31, 2009, compared with an estimate of $662 million at December 31, 2008. The entire obligation is classified as a non-current liability as installment payments for the cash portion of the obligation are not planned to commence
until more than 12 months after the proposed plan is ultimately effective, and a portion of the obligation fulfilled through the direct contribution of Corning’s investment in PCE (currently recorded as a non-current other equity method
investment).

See Legal Proceedings for additional information about this matter.

Equity in Earnings of Affiliated Companies, Net of Impairments

The following provides a summary of equity earnings of affiliated companies, net of impairments (in millions):

The
increase in equity earnings of affiliated companies in 2009 was driven by Samsung Corning Precision when compared to the same period last year. Equity earnings at Samsung Corning Precision reflected increased volume, manufacturing efficiency gains,
and the positive impact of $187 million from movements in foreign exchange rates, offset somewhat by lower pricing when compared to 2008.

The
2008 increase in equity earnings of affiliated companies reflected strong sales and earnings performance at both Samsung Corning Precision and Dow Corning when compared to 2007.

The change in equity earnings from Samsung Corning Precision is explained more fully in the discussion of the performance of the Display Technologies segment and in All Other.

The decline in equity earnings from Dow Corning in 2009 was primarily due to lower sales and restructuring charges at Dow Corning, offset somewhat by the
impact of excess foreign tax credits on foreign dividends when compared to the previous year. Sales at Dow Corning declined 7% in 2009 when compared to the prior year and included volume declines in Dow Corning’s traditional silicone businesses
that were offset somewhat by an increase in volume at Hemlock Semiconductor Corporation (Hemlock), Dow Corning’s consolidated subsidiary that makes high purity polycrystalline for the semiconductor and solar industries. Sales of Dow
Corning’s traditional silicone businesses reflected the impact of the economic downturn in 2009. Sales at Hemlock increased in 2009, driven by improvements in sales for solar applications when compared to 2008. Movements in foreign exchange
rates did not significantly impact equity earnings from Dow Corning.

Dow Corning’s 2008 performance was driven by sales growth in its
traditional silicone product lines and at Hemlock. Dow Corning sales grew 10% in 2008 with the largest growth at Hemlock. Sales of Dow Corning’s traditional silicone product lines were also higher when compared to 2007. Net income at Dow
Corning, and Corning’s resulting equity earnings from Dow Corning, increased 7% in 2008 when compared to 2007, reflecting the growth in net sales along with the positive impact from both a change in depreciation method and a change in the
useful lives of certain fixed assets, offset in part by an other-than-temporary impairment for certain securities of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Our share of this impairment was $18 million.



Sales at Dow Corning in 2010 are expected to increase greater than 10% when compared to 2009, driven by
higher sales of silicone products and an increase in sales at Hemlock. When compared to 2009, equity earnings of Dow Corning are expected to improve in 2010 offset somewhat by an increase in costs for additional capacity. In the first quarter of
2010, equity earnings from Dow Corning are expected to be down when compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, driven by seasonably lower sales at Hemlock.

Until December 31, 2007, Corning had a 50% interest in Samsung Corning. Samsung Electronics Company, Ltd. and affiliates owned the remaining 50% interest in Samsung Corning. On December 31,
2007, Samsung Corning Precision acquired all of the outstanding shares of Samsung Corning. After the transaction, Corning retained its 50% interest in Samsung Corning Precision. In 2007, equity earnings from Samsung Corning were reduced by $40
million primarily due to restructuring and impairment charges.

Other Income (Expense), Net

“Other income (expense), net” in Corning’s consolidated statements of income includes the following (in millions):

Income Before Income Taxes

In addition to the items identified under Gross Margin, Restructuring, Impairment and Other
Charges and (Credits), Asbestos Litigation (Credit) Charges, and Other (Expense) Income, Net, movements in foreign exchange rates also impacted results for the years presented. In 2009, Income Before Income Taxes included $414 million from the
positive impact of movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to 2008. In 2008, Income Before Income Taxes, included $35 million for the positive impact of movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to the previous year.

Provision for Income Taxes

Our
(benefit) provision for income taxes and the related effective income tax rates were as follows (in millions):

The
effective income tax rate for 2009 differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the following items:

•

Rate differences on income/(losses) of consolidated foreign companies;

•

The impact of equity in earnings of affiliated companies;

•

The benefit of tax holidays and investment credits in foreign jurisdictions;

•

The benefit of the U.S. Research and Experimentation tax credit for years 2005-2009;

•

The benefit of recording additional deferred taxes for the tax exempt subsidy attributable to our OPEB liability; and

•

The impact of the net increase in valuation allowances due to changes in judgment on the realizability of certain state and foreign deferred tax
assets.

The effective income tax (benefit) rate for 2008 differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the
following items:

•

The release of $2.5 billion of valuation allowances attributable to a change in judgment about the realizability of U.S. deferred tax assets in future
years, described below;

•

The impact of not recording net tax expense on income generated in the U.S.;

•

The impact of equity in earnings of affiliated companies;



•

The benefit of tax holidays and investment and other credits in foreign jurisdictions; and

•

A $40 million benefit related to a favorable tax settlement with the Canadian Revenue Agency.

The effective income tax rate for 2007 differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the following items:

•

The impact of not recording net tax expense on income generated in the U.S.;

•

The release of valuation allowances on foreign deferred tax assets;

•

The impact of equity in earnings of affiliated companies; and

•

The benefit of tax holidays in foreign jurisdictions.

Prior to 2007, we recorded valuation allowances against our U.S. deferred tax assets as a result of significant losses in the U.S. In 2007, we generated income from continuing operations in the U.S. The
tax expense on such income was fully offset by the tax benefit of releasing a portion of the valuation allowance to reflect the realization of deferred taxes resulting from the generation of U.S. income.

As more fully described in Note 6 (Income Taxes) to the Consolidated Financial Statements, all of our U.S. deferred tax assets had full valuation allowances
until the second quarter of 2008. At that time, we concluded that it was more likely than not that we would realize substantially all of our U.S. deferred tax assets because we expect to generate sufficient levels of income in the U.S. As a result,
we released $2.4 billion of valuation allowances on our U.S. deferred tax assets in the second quarter of 2008. We considered all available evidence, both positive and negative, to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation
allowance was needed.

The evaluation of the realizability of deferred tax assets is inherently subjective. Following are the key items that
provided positive evidence to support the release of the valuation allowance for a large portion of our deferred tax assets in the second quarter of 2008:

•

Positive pre-tax income in the U.S. for the first half of 2008 and the preceding year;

•

The impact of positive results in the Display Technologies operating segment and the royalty income generated from the foreign locations in this
segment;

•

The number of years remaining to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards; and

•

Increased confidence in our longer-term forecasted income levels, which were supported by detailed sensitivity analyses.

At June 30, 2008, the following items were considered as negative evidence in our valuation allowance assessment, but were less heavily weighted
than our positive evidence:

•

Uncertainty of future taxable earnings;

•

Historical utilization of deferred tax assets caused largely by non-recurring items; and

•

Economic and consumer demand uncertainty.

Deferred tax liabilities totaled $26 million at December 31, 2008, and therefore, were not a significant factor in our assessment of the realizability of deferred tax assets.

U.S. profits of approximately $8.3 billion dollars will be required to fully realize the deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2009. Of that amount,
$3.6 billion of U.S. profits will be required over the next 16 years to fully realize the deferred tax assets associated with federal net operating loss carry forwards.

In 2008 and 2007, we generated income from continuing operations in the U.S. The tax expense on such income was fully offset by the tax benefit of releasing a portion of our existing valuation allowance
to reflect the realization of deferred taxes resulting from the generation of U.S. income. The impact of the release of the valuation allowances, and thus not recording tax expense on income generated in the U.S., was a reduction in our effective
tax rate of 8.6 and 8.1 percentage points for 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Certain shorter-lived deferred tax assets such as those
represented by capital loss carry forwards and state tax net operating loss carry forwards, as well as other federal and state tax credits, will remain with a valuation allowance recorded against them as of December 31, 2009, because we cannot
conclude that it is more likely than not that we will earn income of the character required to utilize these assets before they expire. The amount of U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets that had valuation allowances at December 31, 2009 and
2008 was $245 million and $230 million, respectively.



We do not provide income taxes on the post-1992 earnings of domestic subsidiaries that we expect to recover
tax-free without significant cost. Income taxes have been provided for post-1992 unremitted earnings of domestic corporate joint ventures that we do not expect to recover tax-free. Unremitted earnings of domestic subsidiaries and corporate joint
ventures that arose in fiscal years beginning on or before December 31, 1992 have been indefinitely reinvested. We currently provide U.S. income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries and affiliated companies to the extent these earnings
are currently taxable or expected to be remitted. As of December 31, 2009, U.S. taxes have not been provided on approximately $7.3 billion of accumulated foreign unremitted earnings that are expected to remain invested indefinitely. It is not
practical to calculate the unrecognized deferred tax liability on those earnings.

In 2004, we recorded valuation allowances against our
entire German deferred tax assets due to losses in recent years. In 2007, due to sustained profitability and positive earnings projections for our overall German operations, we concluded that it is more likely than not that the German national
deferred tax assets are realizable and that the related valuation allowance was no longer required. The impact of the releases of the valuation allowances on our effective rate is a reduction in the rate of 7.1 percentage points for 2007.

Certain foreign subsidiaries in China and Taiwan are operating under tax holiday arrangements. The nature and extent of such arrangements
vary, and the benefits of such arrangements phase out through 2013 according to the specific terms and schedules of the relevant taxing jurisdictions. The impact of the tax holidays on our effective rate is a reduction in the rate of 7.3, 5.3 and
6.9 percentage points for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

While we expect the amount of unrecognized tax benefits to change in the next 12
months, we do not expect the change to have a significant impact on the results of operations or our financial position.

See Note 6 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding income tax matters.

Net Income Attributable to Corning Incorporated

As a result of the items discussed above, net income and per share data was as follows (in millions, except per share amounts):

OPERATING SEGMENTS

Effective January 1, 2008, Corning changed its internal reporting structure to better reflect the
Company’s focus on new business development and later-stage research projects and to provide more transparency on our Specialty Materials operating segment. As a result, our segment reporting includes the following changes that are in
accordance with the requirements for disclosures about segments:

•

We have provided separate financial information for the Specialty Materials operating segment. This operating segment was previously included in All
Other.

•

Certain later-stage development projects, such as advanced flow reactors and green lasers, meet the criteria for operating segments and are included in
All Other. Spending for these projects was previously part of Exploratory Research and was reported in the reconciliation of reportable segment net income to total net income.

•

Certain other new product lines meet the criteria for operating segments and are included in All Other. Spending related to these businesses was
previously included in our Life Sciences and Display Technologies operating segments.

Our reportable operating segments are
now as follows:

•

Display Technologies - manufactures liquid crystal display glass for flat panel displays.

•

Telecommunications - manufactures optical fiber and cable and hardware and equipment components for the telecommunications industry.

•

Environmental Technologies - manufactures ceramic substrates and filters for automotive and diesel applications. This reportable operating segment is
an aggregation of our Automotive and Diesel operating segments as these two segments share similar economic characteristics, products, customer types, production processes and distribution methods.



•

Specialty Materials - manufactures products that provide more than 150 material formulations for glass, glass ceramics and fluoride crystals to meet
demand for unique customer needs.

•

Life Sciences - manufactures glass and plastic consumables for scientific applications.

All other operating segments that do not meet the quantitative threshold for separate reporting have been grouped as “All Other.” This group is
primarily comprised of development projects and results for new product lines.

We prepared the financial results for our reportable segments
on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information to assist in making internal operating decisions. We included the earnings of equity affiliates that are closely associated with our operating
segments in the respective segment’s net income. We have allocated certain common expenses among segments differently than we would for stand-alone financial information prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in
the U.S. (U.S. GAAP). Segment net income may not be consistent with measures used by other companies. The accounting policies of our reportable segments are the same as those applied in the consolidated financial statements.

Effective January 1, 2009, we began providing U.S. income tax expense (or benefit) on U.S. earnings (losses) due to the change in our conclusion about
the realizability of our U.S. deferred tax assets in 2008. As a result of the change in our tax position, we adjusted the allocation of taxes to our operating segments in 2009 to reflect this difference. The impact of changing our allocation
methodology was not significant.

Display Technologies

(dollars in millions):

2009 vs. 2008

The decrease in net sales in 2009, reflected price declines of 19% and a decline in volume of 2%
(measured in square feet of glass sold) offset somewhat by the positive impact of $228 million from movements in foreign exchange rates. Net sales of this segment are denominated in Japanese yen and, as a result, are susceptible to movements in the
U.S. dollar-Japanese yen exchange rate. When compared to last year, the volume decline in 2009 occurred largely in the first quarter of 2009 and reflected a number of industry dynamics. Because Corning sells to panel makers and not to end market
consumers, supply chain expansion and contraction for this industry is a key factor in Corning’s volume. During the second half of 2008, the LCD market experienced a supply chain contraction that worsened as global economic conditions
deteriorated and demand rapidly declined. We believe the industry supply chain contraction ended in the first quarter of 2009, followed by replenishment in the second quarter. Over the remainder of 2009, we saw demand levels for LCD glass increase
in comparison to first quarter levels. In the fourth quarter of 2009, net sales increased 84% when compared to the same period last year and 6% when compared to the third quarter of 2009. With increasing demand over the course of 2009, we
strategically restarted some capacity that had been temporarily idled towards the end of last year.

In the third quarter of 2009, an
earthquake in Shizuoka, Japan halted production at the Company’s LCD glass manufacturing facility located there. In the fourth quarter of 2009, production at the Company’s LCD glass manufacturing facility in Taichung, Taiwan was impacted
by a power disruption. Incremental production capacity and the ability to resume some manufacturing in our affected facilities helped to ease the impact of both disruptions and support LCD glass shipments. We believe our market share was negatively
impacted because our capacity was lower during a period when demand remained robust. The Company incurred approximately $30 million of costs for accelerated depreciation charges and asset write-offs from these events.

In 2009, equity earnings of Samsung Corning Precision reflected the positive impact of $187 million from movements in foreign exchange rates and an increase
in volume of 35% offset somewhat by price declines of 20% when compared to the same period last year. Equity earnings from Samsung Corning Precision are impacted by movements in both the U.S. dollar - Japanese yen and U.S. dollar - Korean won
exchange rates. Results of Samsung Corning Precision reflected improvements in the overall LCD glass market which grew approximately 20% in 2009 when compared to previous year. The economic recession has had a greater impact on our wholly-owned
business in Taiwan than on Samsung Corning Precision. Since Taiwanese panel makers do not have strong brand recognition, they are the first to experience supply chain corrections and slower to benefit from improvements in demand.



When compared to 2008, the decline in net income in 2009 was primarily due to the impact of volume and price
declines, costs associated with the earthquake in Japan, and restructuring charges in the first quarter of 2009. These items were offset somewhat by $342 million from the positive impact of movements in foreign exchange rates and stronger equity
earnings. Net income of this segment in 2009 included $31 million of restructuring charges associated with the Company’s corporate-wide restructuring plan to reduce its global workforce in response to anticipated lower sales in 2009. Net income
also includes royalty income from Samsung Corning Precision, which was higher in 2009 when compared to last year reflecting the improvements in sales volume at Samsung Corning Precision. Corning licenses certain of its patents and know-how to
Samsung Corning Precision, as well as to third parties, which generate royalty income. Refer to Note 7 (Investments) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about related party transactions.

2008 vs. 2007

The net sales
increase for the Display Technologies segment in 2008 resulted from a slight improvement in volume (measured in square feet of glass sold) along with a $294 million positive impact from movements in foreign exchange rates, offset by price declines
of 7% when compared to 2007. Net sales of this segment are denominated in Japanese yen and, as a result, are susceptible to movements in the U.S. dollar - Japanese yen exchange rate. In the first half of 2008, glass volume of this segment increased
by 37%, when compared to the same period in 2007 driven by LCD television market growth and demand for LCD monitors and notebook computers. In the second half of 2008, as a result of worsening global economic conditions, our LCD glass volume
declined by 27% when compared to the second half of 2007. The largest decline in our glass volume occurred in the fourth quarter when volume fell about 50% when compared to the prior year.

The overall LCD glass market grew approximately 15% in 2008. Growth rates by region differed dramatically, resulting in volume in our wholly-owned business
increasing only 1% while volume at Samsung Corning Precision in Korea increased 28% compared to 2007. The lower growth rate in our wholly-owned business was caused in part by a decline in volume in Taiwan, particularly in the second half of the
year, and reflected a number of key market dynamics. As described above, Taiwanese panel makers do not have as strong of brand recognition with consumers as do Korean and Japanese panel makers. In addition, a number of Taiwanese panel makers were
providing capacity to customers that also produce their own LCD panels, and as demand has slowed, purchases of this excess capacity declined. Fluctuating exchange rates also appear to have made Korean panel makers more competitive during the
industry downturn in 2008. Finally, we believe the Taiwanese panel makers had to reduce production to align their inventory levels with lower demand.

When compared to 2007, net income for 2008 was up 10% primarily due to improvements in equity earnings from Samsung Corning Precision and the positive impact of movement in foreign exchange rates. These improvements were offset somewhat by
lower volume and price declines in Corning’s wholly-owned business. During the first half of 2008, operating performance at Corning’s wholly-owned business benefited from manufacturing facilities that were running at or near capacity. As
demand leveled off in the third quarter and then sharply declined in the fourth quarter, we temporarily idled certain production assets. These actions resulted in accelerated depreciation for glass tanks that were taken out of production earlier
than planned. By the end of 2008, more than half of the manufacturing capacity in our wholly-owned business was temporarily idled.

Equity
earnings from Samsung Corning Precision’s LCD business for 2008 increased by 54% when compared to 2007, due to volume gains of 28%, improved manufacturing performance, and the positive impact of movements in foreign exchange rates offset
somewhat by price declines of 9%. Samsung Corning Precision experienced a similar, but less severe, decline in second half performance. At the end of 2008, Samsung Corning Precision had idled approximately 25% of its capacity. Equity earnings for
2008 were positively impacted by approximately $210 million due to movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to 2007.

Other
Information

The Display Technologies segment has a concentrated customer base comprised of LCD panel and color filter makers primarily
located in Japan and Taiwan. For 2009 and 2008, three customers of the Display Technologies segment, which individually accounted for more than 10% of segment net sales, accounted for 62% and 65%, respectively, of total segment sales when combined.
Our customers face the same global economic dynamics as we do in this market. We believe panel makers in Taiwan have been more significantly impacted by the economic downturn given their relative size when compared to Korean panel makers who have a
stronger presence in the end market for LCD products. While we are not aware of any significant customer credit issues, our near-term sales and profitability would be impacted if any individual customers were unable to continue to purchase our
products.

In addition, Samsung Corning Precision’s sales are concentrated across a small number of its customers. In 2009 and 2008,
sales to two LCD panel makers located in Korea accounted for 93% and 94%, respectively, of Samsung Corning Precision sales.



Corning has invested heavily to expand capacity to meet the demand for LCD glass substrates. In 2009, 2008
and 2007, capital spending in this segment was $552 million, $1.4 billion, and $883 million, respectively. We expect capital spending for 2010 to be approximately $250 million to $350 million.

In 2005 and 2004, several of Corning’s customers entered into long-term purchase and supply agreements in which Corning’s Display Technologies
segment would supply large-size glass substrates to these customers over periods of up to six years. As part of the agreements, these customers agreed to advance cash deposits to Corning for a portion of the contracted glass to be purchased. We
received our last deposit of $105 million in July 2007 and do not expect to receive additional deposits related to these agreements. During 2009, 2008 and 2007, we issued $253 million, $266 million, and $231 million, respectively, in credits that
were applied to customer receivable balances when payments were due. In the event customers do not purchase the agreed upon quantities of product, subject to specific conditions outlined in the agreements, Corning may retain certain amounts of the
customer deposits. If Corning does not deliver agreed upon product quantities, subject to specific conditions outlined in the agreements, Corning may be required to return certain amounts of our customers’ deposits. Refer to Note 11 (Other
Liabilities) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Outlook:

We expect the overall LCD glass market in 2010, measured in square feet of glass, will increase by approximately 14% to 22% when compared to 2009, resulting
from increased demand for LCD televisions and computer notebook sales. We expect gross margin to expand in 2010 driven by increased volume, cost reduction, and moderate price declines. We think regional market share will stabilize although regional
mix shifts as described, that benefit volume at Samsung Corning Precision more than Corning’s wholly owned business, remain possible. We will also pursue growth opportunities in China as that country’s LCD TV market continues to grow.
Although the LCD supply chain has been impacted by the global recession, we believe that the long-term drivers of this market, specifically increased penetration of LCD into the total television market, increased screen size and increased
televisions per household, remain intact.

In the first quarter of 2010, we expect volume at our wholly-owned business to increase 8% to 12%
and volume at Samsung Corning Precision to be flat to up slightly when compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. We expect moderate price declines in the first quarter of 2010 at both our wholly-owned business and Samsung Corning Precision when
compared to the fourth quarter of 2009.

The end market demand for LCD televisions, monitors and notebooks is dependent on consumer retail
spending, among other things. We are cautious about the potential negative impacts that economic conditions, particularly the global economic recession, and world political tensions could have on consumer demand. While the industry has grown rapidly
in recent years, economic volatility along with consumer preferences for panels of differing sizes, prices, or other factors may lead to pauses in market growth. Therefore, it is possible that glass manufacturing capacity may exceed demand from time
to time. We may incur further charges in this segment to reduce our workforce and consolidate capacity. In addition, changes in foreign exchange rates, principally the Japanese yen, will continue to impact the sales and profitability of this
segment.

Telecommunications

(dollars in millions):

2009 vs. 2008

In 2009, net sales of this segment decreased when compared to the same period last year and reflected
declines across all of our businesses. When compared to the previous year, lower volumes in both North America and Europe were offset somewhat by higher net sales for optical fiber and cable in China as the country continues to expand its
telecommunications infrastructure. Volume in North America and Europe reflected the continuing impact of the economic recession. In addition, net sales of this segment were negatively impacted by $23 million from movements in foreign exchange
rates.



For 2009, the decline in net income reflected the volume impacts as described above and the impact of
restructuring charges, offset somewhat by lower operating expenses resulting from restructuring actions when compared to 2008. Net income of this segment included the impact of $42 million of restructuring charges in 2009 associated with the
Company’s corporate-wide restructuring plan. Actions in this segment included workforce reductions, the consolidation of manufacturing operations that resulted in the closure of two plants and the exit of some minor businesses. Movements in
foreign exchange rates did not have a significant impact on the comparability of net income for the periods presented.

The Telecommunications
segment has a concentrated customer base. In 2009, one customer of the Telecommunications segment accounted for 12% of total segment net sales. In 2008 and 2007, two customers of the Telecommunications segment, which individually accounted for more
than 10% of total segment net sales, collectively accounted for 24% and 25%, respectively, of total segment sales when combined.

vs. 2007

Net sales for the segment were up slightly over 2007 primarily due to volume gains in fiber-to-the-premises products and the
positive impact of movements in foreign exchange rates. Increased sales in fiber-to-the-premises products reflected strong demand in Europe, and North America. The increase was partially offset by moderating price declines, reduced demand for copper
based products in Europe and the absence of sales from Corning’s European submarine cabling business that was sold in April 2007.

Net
income in 2008 included $17 million for the cost of a restructuring plan that was implemented in the fourth quarter. The decline in net income in 2008 reflected the impact of the restructuring charge, price declines, higher operating expenses, and
the absence of a $19 million gain on the sale of the European submarine cabling business when compared to 2007. In 2008, movements in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact the net income of this segment.

Outlook:

We expect net sales of the
Telecommunications segment to be down in 2010, driven by a decline in demand for private and public network products, lower spending for telecommunications infrastructure in China in 2010, and lower sales due to the exit of certain businesses in
2009.

Changes in our customers’ expected deployment plans, or additional reductions in their inventory levels of fiber-to-the-premises
products, could also affect sales levels. Should these plans not occur at the pace anticipated, our sales and earnings would be adversely affected. In the first quarter of 2010, we expect net sales of this segment to be down 10% to 15%, when
compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, due to lower demand for private network products and fiber demand in China.

Environmental
Technologies

(dollars in millions):

2009 vs. 2008

When compared to 2008, net sales for 2009 were negatively impacted by lower automotive production caused
by the global recession and subsequent inventory reductions at automotive manufacturers and dealers. In the first quarter of 2009, U.S. automotive builds were at their lowest levels since Corning entered this business. In the first half of 2009, net
sales of this segment declined 40% when compared to the first half of 2008. In the second half of 2009, year-over-year net sales were up 14% when compared to the same period last year due to government incentives in China, Europe and the U.S. In
addition, we believe inventories at automotive manufacturers and dealers returned to more normalized levels in the fourth quarter of 2009, which also caused increased demand. Diesel product sales in 2009 reflected the impact of the recession-driven
weak freight industry in the U.S. This was offset somewhat by improved demand in the second half of 2009 as engine manufacturers prepared for next year’s stricter heavy duty diesel emission standards. Net sales in 2009 were negatively impacted
by $9 million due to movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to the same period last year.



Net loss in 2009 reflected lower sales and manufacturing volume of both automotive and diesel products,
offset somewhat by lower operating expenses, when compared to net income 2008. In addition, net loss of this segment in 2009 included the impact of restructuring charges. Restructuring charges for this segment totaled $28 million for the
Company’s corporate-wide restructuring plan to reduce its global workforce in response to lower sales in 2009. Movements in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact the results of this operating segment.

The Environmental Technologies reportable operating segment sells to a concentrated customer base of catalyzer and emission control systems manufacturers,
who then sell to automotive and diesel engine manufacturers. Although our sales are to the emission control systems manufacturers, the use of our substrates and filters is generally required by the specifications of the automotive and diesel engine
manufacturers. Our customers and their customers are experiencing the negative impact of the automotive and freight industry downturns. For 2009, three customers of the Environmental Technologies segment, which individually accounted for more than
10% of segment sales, accounted for 85% of total segment sales. For 2008 and 2007, net sales to those same three customers accounted for 81% of total segment sales. While we are not aware of any significant customer credit issues with our direct
customers, our near-term sales and profitability would be impacted if any individual customers were unable to continue to purchase our products.

2008 vs. 2007

Sales of the Environmental Technologies segment in 2008 were down 6% when compared to the previous year
and reflected lower sales of automotive and diesel products, offset somewhat by favorable foreign exchange rate movements. Sales of automotive products reflected the significant decline in demand in the European and U.S. automotive industry in the
second half of 2008 in line with worsening economic conditions. Diesel product sales increased due to the positive impact of movements in foreign exchange rates, offset somewhat by volume declines. Diesel product sales reflect the continued decline
in the U.S. freight industry that began in late 2007. Net sales of this segment in 2008 were positively impacted by $24 million due to movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to the prior year.

Net income of this segment was down when compared to last year, due primarily to reduced sales volumes and manufacturing inefficiencies in both businesses.
Net income was positively impacted by $3 million due to movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to the prior year.

Outlook:

We expect net sales of this segment to improve in 2010 driven by moderate growth in demand for automotive products. We expect to see continued
strength in demand due to replenishment of dealer and supply chain inventories through the first quarter of 2010. Diesel product sales are expected to improve slightly driven by regulation tightening, but will not reflect any significant growth
until the freight industry recovers and excess fleet inventory is fully utilized. When compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, net sales of this segment in the first quarter of 2010, are expected to start strongly but decline 10% in the full quarter
as the rebuild of auto inventories nears completion.

Specialty Materials

(dollars in millions):

*

The percentage change calculation is not meaningful.

2009 vs. 2008

The Specialty Materials segment manufactures products that provide more than 150 material formulations
for glass, glass ceramics and fluoride crystals to meet demand for unique customer needs. Consequently, this segment operates in a wide variety of commercial and industrial markets that include consumer electronics, display optics and components,
semiconductor optics and components, aerospace and defense, astronomy, ophthalmic products, and telecommunications components.



Net sales decreased in 2009 due primarily to lower sales of semiconductor optics and
components as a result of the significant market downturn when compared to the prior year. This decrease was offset somewhat by an increase in sales of Gorilla

®

glass, a protective cover glass that is optimized for portable display devices. Sales of Gorilla

®

glass have continued to increase as the Company moves to capitalize on market opportunities for this product. The net loss for 2009 resulted from the decline in net
sales along with manufacturing development costs for Gorilla

®

glass when compared to 2008. The net loss in 2009
also included $17 million of restructuring charges for the Company’s corporate-wide restructuring plan to reduce its global workforce in response to anticipated lower sales in 2009, and costs associated with closing one of this segment’s
manufacturing facilities. In 2009, movements in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact the profitability of this segment.

In the
Specialty Materials segment, there were no individual customers that accounted for 10% or more of this segment’s net sales for 2009.

2008 vs. 2007

When compared to the previous year, net sales were down 2% in 2008 due to a decline
in sales of semiconductor materials products that were negatively impacted by the global recession, offset somewhat by increased sales of Gorilla

®

glass and the favorable impact of movements in foreign exchange rates. The increase in net loss for this segment was due to the decline in sales along with higher
operating expenses for Gorilla

®

glass.

For 2008, one customer of the Specialty Materials segment accounted for 11% of total segment sales.

Outlook:

For 2010, we expect sales of this segment to increase driven by increased sales of Gorilla

®

glass when compared to 2009. We expect a modest increase in sales of semiconductor products as the semiconductor
industry begins to improve. In the first quarter of 2010, we expect net sales to be down 10% to 15%, when compared to the fourth quarter of 2009.

Life Sciences

(dollars in millions):

2009 vs. 2008

For 2009, the increase in net sales of this segment reflected sales from the acquisition of Axygen, which
was completed in the third quarter of 2009, offset somewhat by volume declines in the Company’s existing life sciences products. Sales of Axygen products were approximately $36 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. For 2009, the decline in net
income resulted primarily from acquisition-related costs and the impact of $8 million of restructuring charges associated with the Company’s corporate-wide restructuring plan, when compared to the 2008. Movements in foreign exchange rates did
not significantly impact net sales or net income of this operating segment in 2009.

For 2009, two customers in the Life Sciences segment
which individually accounted for more than 10% of total segment net sales collectively accounted for 45% of total segment sales. For 2008 and 2007, one customer accounted for 45% and 44%, respectively, of total segment sales.

2008 vs. 2007

Net sales of the Life
Sciences segment for 2008 were up when compared to 2007 driven by sales growth of scientific laboratory products in all of this segment’s global markets, price increases, and $8 million from the favorable impact of movements in foreign exchange
rates. Government and private spending for drug development, discovery, and production, fueled market growth in this segment. The improvement in net income in 2008 reflected the sales increases as described offset somewhat by higher operating
expenses.

Outlook:

Sales of
the Life Sciences segment for 2010 are expected to be up primarily due to the acquisition of Axygen when compared to 2009. In the first quarter of 2010, we expect net sales to be even with or up 5% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2009.



All Other

(dollars in millions):

*

The percentage change calculation is not meaningful.

2009 vs. 2008

All Other includes all other operating segments that do not meet the quantitative
threshold for separate reporting. This group is primarily comprised of development projects, such as advanced flow reactors and synthetic green lasers, and results for new product lines, such as the Epic

™

system. This segment also includes results for certain corporate investments such as Samsung Corning Precision’s non-LCD glass businesses and the
results of Corsam Technologies LLC (Corsam), an equity affiliate established between Corning and Samsung Corning Precision to provide glass technology research. Refer to Note 7 (Investments) for additional information about Samsung Corning Precision
and related party transactions.

The decrease in this segment’s net loss for 2009 resulted primarily from lower operating expenses as a
result of restructuring actions in the first quarter of 2009, cost reduction efforts, and the impact of the change in the Company’s tax position. Net loss of this segment for 2009 included $4 million of restructuring charges associated with the
Company’s corporate-wide restructuring plan.

2008 vs. 2007

In 2008, the increase in net loss reflected higher spending for new development projects and a $14 million loss on the sale of Corning’s Steuben glass business, offset somewhat by the absence of
restructuring and impairment charges. In 2007, equity earnings of All Other included $40 million for our share of restructuring and impairment charges for Samsung Corning Precision’s non-LCD businesses.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Financing and Capital Structure

The following items impacted Corning’s financing and capital structure during
2009 and 2008:

•

In the first quarter of 2009, we recorded the impact of a capital lease obligation for a manufacturing facility associated with our Display
Technologies segment. The balance of this obligation at December 31, 2009 was $150 million.

•

In the second quarter of 2009, we issued $250 million of 6.625% senior unsecured notes and $100 million of 7% senior unsecured notes that mature on
May 15, 2019, and May 15, 2024, respectively. The net proceeds of $346 million were designated for general corporate purposes.

•

In the third and fourth quarters of 2008, we recognized $53 million of net losses on short-term investments. Net losses included other-than-temporary
impairments of $26 million for securities of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., which filed for bankruptcy protection in mid-September, and $11 million for securities which had declined in value and been down-graded. The remaining losses resulted from
the sale of asset-backed debt securities and debt securities of financial institutions as we reduced our exposure to these sectors. In addition, we classified $40 million of mortgage-backed securities from current assets to long-term assets.

•

Through the end of September 2008, we repurchased 29.5 million shares of common stock for $625 million as part of repurchase programs announced in
July 2007 and July 2008. We have made no additional repurchases.

We have access to a $1.1 billion committed, unsecured,
multi-currency credit facility. This credit facility expires in November 2011. The facility includes two financial covenants: a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio. At December 31, 2009, we were in compliance with both financial
covenants.



Capital Spending

Capital spending totaled $890 million, $1.9 billion and $1.3 billion in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Capital spending in 2009 was driven primarily by projects in our Display Technologies segment
that were started in 2008. Capital spending in 2008 and 2007 primarily included expansion of LCD glass capacity in the Display Technologies segment and new capacity for diesel products in the Environmental Technologies segment. Our 2010 capital
spending program is expected to be approximately $600 million to $700 million, but there could also be up to $300 million of additional spending for adjacent opportunities, possible capacity in China, and precious metals to support growing capacity.
Approximately $250 million to $350 million will be directed toward our Display Technologies segment.

Cash Flows

Summary of cash flow data:

2009 vs. 2008

Although 2009 net income decreased significantly from 2008, operating cash flow declined only slightly.
The decrease in net income resulted primarily from two non-recurring, non-cash items: the release of $2.5 billion of deferred tax asset valuation allowances and a $340 million reduction in asbestos related liabilities. When compared to 2008,
operating cash flow in 2009 reflected higher pension contributions and restructuring payments, offset somewhat by an increase in cash from changes in working capital and higher dividends from equity affiliates.

Net cash used in investing activities was lower in 2009 when compared to 2008 due to lower capital expenditures in our Display Technologies segment, offset
partially by the acquisition of Axygen.

Net cash used in financing activities also decreased in 2009 when compared to the prior year due to
the issuance of long-term debt and the discontinuation of common stock repurchases.

2008 vs. 2007

As the significant increase in 2008 net income was largely driven by two non-cash items, 2008 operating cash increased only slightly when compared to 2007.
The two non-cash items were the release of $2.5 billion of deferred tax asset valuation allowances and a $340 million reduction in asbestos related liabilities.

In addition, cash from operating activities benefited from slower growth in working capital, higher dividends from equity affiliates, and lower contributions for retirement-related benefits compared to
2007. These benefits were partially offset by an increase in taxes paid and customer deposit credits issued.

Net cash used in investing
activities in 2008 increased when compared to the previous year due to a $659 million increase in capital spending largely attributable to higher spending in the Display Technologies segment and a smaller reduction in short-term investments compared
to 2007.

Net cash used in financing activities was higher when compared to the previous year due to an increase in repurchases of common
stock and an increase in dividends paid. Corning began paying a quarterly dividend of $0.05 per share in the third quarter of 2007.

Defined Benefit Pension Plans

We have defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic and international
employees. Our largest single pension plan is Corning’s U.S. qualified plan. At December 31, 2009, this plan accounted for 81% of our consolidated defined benefit pension plans’ projected benefit obligation and 90% of the related
plans’ assets.

We have traditionally contributed to the U.S. qualified pension plan on an annual basis in excess of the IRS minimum
requirements, and as a result, mandatory contributions are not expected to be required for this plan until some time after 2010. In 2009, we made voluntary cash contributions of $75 million to our domestic defined benefit pension plan and $5 million
to our international pension plans. In 2008, we made voluntary cash contributions of $50 million to our domestic defined benefit pension plan and $2 million to our international pension plans.



In 2008, we experienced significant negative returns on our pension assets for our primary defined benefit
plan as a result of deteriorating financial market conditions which increased pension expense for 2009 by $33 million. In 2009, actual investment experience on the pension assets of our primary defined benefit plan was favorable.

Although we will not be subject to any mandatory contributions in 2010, we anticipate making voluntary cash contributions of up to $230
million to our domestic and international pension plans in 2010.

Refer to Note 13 (Employee Retirement Plans) to the Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information.

Customer Deposits

Certain customers of our Display Technologies segment have entered into long-term supply agreements and have agreed to make advance cash deposits to secure supply of large-size glass substrates. The
deposits will be reduced through future product purchases, thus reducing operating cash flows in later periods as credits are applied for cash deposits received in earlier periods.

Between 2004 and 2007, we received a total of $937 million for customer deposit agreements. We received our last deposit of $105 million in 2007 and do not expect to receive additional deposits related to
these agreements.

In 2009, 2008 and 2007, we issued credit memoranda which totaled $253 million, $266 million, and $231 million,
respectively. These credit amounts were applied to customer receivable balances when payments were due. Customer deposit liabilities were $104 million and $369 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. In 2010, we expect to issue
approximately $80 million in credit memoranda.

Restructuring

In 2009, we recorded charges of $228 million associated with a corporate-wide restructuring plan to reduce our global workforce in response to anticipated lower sales in 2009. The charge included costs
for severance, special termination benefits, outplacement services, asset write-offs, and the impact of a curtailment loss for postretirement benefits. Total cash expenditures associated with these actions are expected to be approximately $155
million primarily related to termination benefits.

During 2009, 2008 and 2007, we made payments of $89 million, $17 million, and $39 million,
respectively, related to employee severance and other exit costs resulting from restructuring actions. Refer to Note 2 (Restructuring, Impairment and Other Charges (Credits)) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Credit Ratings

As of February 10, 2010, our credit ratings were as follows:

Management Assessment of Liquidity

We ended the fourth quarter of 2009 with $3.6 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. The Company has adequate sources of liquidity
and we are confident in our ability to generate cash to meet existing or reasonably likely future cash requirements. Our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments are held in various locations throughout the world and are generally
unrestricted. At December 31, 2009 about half of the consolidated amount was held outside of the U.S. Almost all of the amounts held outside of the U.S. are available for repatriation, subject to relevant tax consequences. We utilize a variety
of tax planning and financing strategies to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed. We expect accumulated non-U.S. cash balances will remain outside of the U.S. and that we will meet U.S. liquidity needs
through future cash flows, use of U.S. cash balances, external borrowings, or some combination of these sources.

In 2009, realized gains and
losses on available-for-sale securities were not significant. In 2008, we recorded $53 million of net realized losses on short-term investments which represented less than 6% of our total holdings of available-for-sale securities at that time. Refer
to Note 3 (Available-for-Sale Investments) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

In July 2007, Corning’s
Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program of up to $500 million to be completed by the end of 2008. In July 2008, Corning announced that its Board of Directors and Executive Committee had approved a second stock repurchase program of up
to an additional $1 billion to be completed by the end of 2009. Through December 31, 2008, we had repurchased approximately 40 million shares of common stock for $875 million under these programs. There were no repurchases in 2009.

We complete comprehensive reviews of our significant customers and their creditworthiness by analyzing their financial statements at least
annually or more frequently for customers where we have identified a measure of increased risk. We closely monitor payments and developments which may signal possible customer credit issues. We currently have not identified any potential material
impact on our liquidity resulting from customer credit issues.

Our major source of funding for 2010 and beyond will be our operating cash
flow and our existing balances of cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments. We believe we have sufficient liquidity for the next several years to fund operations, the asbestos litigation, research and development, capital expenditures,
scheduled debt repayments, and dividend payments. Corning also has access to a $1.1 billion unsecured committed credit through November 2011. If market conditions are favorable, the Company may seek to enter into negotiations with its bank group
prior to the expiration date to renew and extend the credit arrangements. The existing credit agreement includes two financial covenants: a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio. At December 31, 2009, we were in compliance with both
financial covenants.

The required leverage ratio, which measures debt to total capital, is a maximum of 50%. At December 31, 2009 and
2008, our leverage using this measure was 11%. The required interest coverage ratio, which is an adjusted earnings measure as defined by our facility, compared to interest expense, is a ratio of at least 3.5 times. At December 31, 2009 and
2008, our interest coverage ratio using this measure was 30.3 times and 43.5 times, respectively.

Our debt instruments contain customary
event of default provisions, which allow the lenders the option of accelerating all obligations upon the occurrence of certain events. In addition, the majority of our debt instruments contain a cross default provision, whereby a default on one debt
obligation of the Company in excess of a specified amount, also would be considered a default under the terms of another debt instrument. As of December 31, 2009, we were in compliance with all such provisions.



Management is not aware of any known trends or any known demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that
will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in a material increase or decrease in our liquidity. In addition, other than items discussed, there are no known material trends, favorable or unfavorable, in our capital resources and no
expected material changes in the mix and relative cost of such resources.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

Off balance sheet arrangements are transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which Corning has an
obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements.

Corning’s off balance sheet arrangements include
the following:

•

Guarantee contracts; and

•

Variable interests held in certain unconsolidated entities.

At the time a guarantee is issued, the Company is required to recognize a liability for the fair value or market value of the obligation it assumes. In the normal course of our business, we do not
routinely provide significant third-party guarantees. Generally, third-party guarantees provided by Corning are limited to certain financial guarantees, including stand-by letters of credit and performance bonds, and the incurrence of contingent
liabilities in the form of purchase price adjustments related to attainment of milestones. These guarantees have various terms, and none of these guarantees are individually significant.

Refer to Note 14 (Commitments, Contingencies, and Guarantees) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Corning leases certain transportation equipment from three Trusts that qualify as variable interest entities. The sole purpose of these entities is to lease transportation equipment to Corning.

For variable interest entities, we assess the terms of our interest in each entity to determine if we are the primary beneficiary. The
primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is the party that absorbs a majority of the entity’s expected losses, receives a majority of its expected residual returns, or both, as a result of holding variable interests, which are the
ownership, contractual, or other pecuniary interests in an entity that change with changes in the fair value of the entity’s net assets excluding variable interests.

Corning has identified three entities that qualify as variable interest entities. None of these entities is considered to be significant to Corning’s consolidated statements of position.

Corning does not have retained interests in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serve as credit, liquidity or market risk support to that
entity.

Contractual Obligations

The amounts of our obligations follow (in millions):

(1)

At December 31, 2009, $41 million of the $60 million was included in other accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.

(2)

Capital expenditure obligations, primarily related to our Display Technologies segment expansions, are included on our balance sheet.



(3)

At December 31, 2009, $2.0 billion was included on our balance sheet. Total debt above is stated at maturity value.

(4)

At December 31, 2009, $151 million of the $385 million represents imputed interest.

(5)

The estimate of interest payments assumes interest is paid through the date of maturity or expiration of the related debt, based upon stated rates in the respective
debt instruments.

(6)

At December 31, 2009, $16 million was included on our balance sheet related to uncertain tax positions. Of this amount, we are unable to estimate when $7 million
of that amount will become payable.

We are required, at the time a guarantee is issued, to recognize a liability for the fair
value or market value of the obligation it assumes. In the normal course of our business, we do not routinely provide significant third-party guarantees. Generally, third-party guarantees provided by Corning are limited to certain financial
guarantees, including stand-by letters of credit and performance bonds, and the incurrence of contingent liabilities in the form of purchase price adjustments related to attainment of milestones. These guarantees have various terms, and none of
these guarantees are individually significant.

We have agreed to provide a credit facility related to Dow Corning. The funding of the Dow
Corning credit facility will be required only if Dow Corning is not otherwise able to meet its scheduled funding obligations in its confirmed Bankruptcy Plan. The purchase obligations primarily represent raw material and energy-related take-or-pay
contracts. We believe a significant majority of these guarantees and contingent liabilities will expire without being funded.

ENVIRONMENT

Corning has been named by the Environmental Protection Agency (the Agency) under the Superfund Act, or by state governments under similar
state laws, as a potentially responsible party for 21 active hazardous waste sites. Under the Superfund Act, all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site, identified by the Agency, are jointly and severally liable for the
cost of cleanup unless the Agency agrees otherwise. It is Corning’s policy to accrue for its estimated liability related to Superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned by Corning based on expert analysis and
continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, Corning had accrued approximately $26 million (undiscounted) and $21 million (undiscounted), respectively, for its estimated liability for
environmental cleanup and related litigation. Based upon the information developed to date, management believes that the accrued reserve is a reasonable estimate of the Company’s liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount
materially higher than that accrued is remote.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein. The estimates, including future
projections of performance and relevant discount rates, that required us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments follow.

Impairment of assets held for use

We are required to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived
assets when an indicator of impairment has been identified. We review our long-lived assets in each quarter to assess whether impairment indicators are present. We must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event of impairment has occurred.

Manufacturing equipment includes certain components of production equipment that are constructed of precious metals, primarily platinum and
rhodium. These metals are not depreciated because they have very low physical losses and are repeatedly reclaimed and reused in our manufacturing process over a very long useful life. Precious metals are reviewed for impairment as part of our
assessment of long-lived assets. This review considers all of the Company’s precious metals that are either in place in the production process; in reclamation, fabrication, or refinement in anticipation of re-use; or awaiting use to support
increased capacity. Precious metals are only acquired to support our operations and are not held for trading or other purposes.

Examples of
events or circumstances that may be indicative of impairments include:

•

A significant decrease in the market price of an asset;

•

A significant change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset is being used or in its physical condition;

•

A significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the asset, including an adverse action or
assessment by a regulator;

•

An accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of an asset;

•

A current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates
continuing losses associated with the use of an asset; and

•

A current expectation that, more likely than not, an asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously
estimated useful life.



For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss, a long-lived asset or assets is grouped
with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. We must exercise judgment in assessing the lowest level for which identifiable cash
flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. For the majority of our reporting segments, we concluded that locations or businesses which share production along the supply chain must be combined in order to
appropriately identify cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.

For long-lived assets, when
impairment indicators are present, we compare estimated undiscounted future cash flows, including the eventual disposition of the asset group at market value, to the assets’ carrying value to determine if the asset group is recoverable. This
assessment requires the exercise of judgment in assessing the future use of and projected value to be derived from the assets to be held and used. Assessments also consider changes in asset utilization, including the temporary idling of capacity and
the expected timing for placing this capacity back into production. If there is an impairment, a loss is recorded to reflect the difference between the assets’ fair value and carrying value. This may require judgment in estimating future cash
flows and relevant discount rates and residual values in estimating the current fair value of the impaired assets to be held and used.

The
fair value of long-lived assets is determined using an “income approach” that starts with the forecast of all the expected future net cash flows including the eventual disposition at market value of long-lived assets, and also considers
the fair market value of all precious metals. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions in our analysis include: market size and growth, market share, projected selling prices, manufacturing cost and discount rate. Our estimates are
based upon our historical experience, our commercial relationships, and available external information about future trends. We believe fair value assessments are most sensitive to market growth and the corresponding impact on volume and selling
prices and that these are also more subjective than manufacturing cost and other assumptions. The Company believes its current assumptions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate.

As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, we have not identified any instances where the carrying values of our long-lived assets were not recoverable. At December 31, 2009 the fair market value of
precious metals was higher than our carrying value by $193 million. At December 31, 2008, the fair market value of precious metals was lower than our carrying value by $598 million. Currently these precious metal assets, primarily in the
Display Technologies segment, are recoverable as part of their asset groupings. There is the potential for impairment in the future if negative events significantly decrease the cash flow of our segments. Such events include, but are not limited to,
a significant decrease in demand for products of our Display Technologies segment or a significant decrease in its profitability.

Impairment of goodwill

We are required to make certain subjective and complex judgments on a number of matters,
including assumptions and estimates used to determine the fair value of our reporting units.

Our annual goodwill recoverability assessment is
completed in the fourth quarter, as it is traditionally based on our annual strategic planning process. This process includes an extensive review of expectations for the long-term growth of our businesses and forecasting future cash flows. Our
valuation method is an “income approach” using a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods, plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon, are discounted to their present value using an
appropriate rate of return. Our estimates are based upon our historical experience, our current knowledge from our commercial relationships, and available external information about future trends. As disclosed in Note 10 (Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets) to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Corning’s goodwill relates primarily to the Telecommunications, Specialty Materials and Life Sciences operating segments.

Telecommunications

Goodwill for
the Telecommunication segment is tested at the operating segment level. We have aggregated the Telecommunications operating segment businesses into a single reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing based on the manner in which we operate our
businesses; the vertically integrated nature of these operations; shared assets, operating and finance resources, and management; the nature of production processes and the regulatory environment; and the shared support and benefit from common
research and development activity.



Results for the Telecommunications segment in 2009 were down when compared with 2008. We expect the
worldwide telecommunications industry market to be negatively impacted by the global recession with lower sales in 2010 than in 2009. The results of our impairment tests in 2009 indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its book
value by a significant amount. A discount rate of 9% was used in 2009 and 10% was used in 2008. We determined a range of discount rates between 7% and 11% would not have affected our conclusion.

Specialty Materials

Goodwill for
the Specialty Materials segment is tested at the component level, which is one level below an operating segment, because the goodwill is the result of transactions associated with certain businesses in this operating segment. Although the Specialty
Materials segment had small reported losses in 2009 and 2008, we expect in the near term new products will partially offset some of the declines resulting from recent economic conditions, and we anticipate growth in new products will also improve
longer-term profitability. The results of our impairment test in 2009 and 2008 indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit significantly exceeded its book value. A discount rate of 9% was used in 2009 and 10% was used in 2008. We determined
a range of discount rates between 7% and 11% would not have affected our conclusion.

Life Sciences

In 2009, the Life Sciences segment recorded goodwill in connection with the acquisition of Axygen. Goodwill for the Life Sciences segment is tested at the
operating segment level. We have aggregated the Life Sciences operating segment businesses into a single reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing based on the manner in which we operate our businesses.

Results in the Life Sciences segment in 2009 reflected the impact of acquisition-related costs and $8 million of restructuring charges associated with the
Company’s corporate-wide restructuring plan, when compared to 2008. The results of our impairment tests in 2009 indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its book value by a significant amount. A discount rate of 8% was
used in 2009. We determined a range of discount rates between 6% and 10% would not have affected our conclusion.

Restructuring charges
and impairments resulting from restructuring actions

We are required to assess whether and when a restructuring event has occurred
and in which periods charges related to such events should be recognized. We must estimate costs of plans to restructure including, for example, employee termination costs. Restructuring charges require us to exercise judgment about the expected
future of our businesses, of portions thereof, their profitability, cash flows and in certain instances eventual outcome. The judgment involved can be difficult, subjective and complex in a number of areas, including assumptions and estimates used
in estimating the future profitability and cash flows of our businesses.

Restructuring events often give rise to decisions to dispose of or
abandon certain assets or asset groups which, as a result, require impairment. We are required to carry assets to be sold or abandoned at the lower of cost or fair value. We must exercise judgment in assessing the fair value of the assets to be sold
or abandoned.

Income taxes

We are required to exercise judgment about our future results in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets. Inherent in this estimation process is the requirement for us to estimate future book taxable income and possible tax
planning strategies. These estimates require us to exercise judgment about our future results, the prudence and feasibility of possible tax planning strategies, and the economic environments in which we do business. It is possible that actual
results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to allowances.

In the second quarter of 2008, we released $2.4 billion of
valuation allowances because we believe it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate sufficient levels of profitability in the U.S. to realize substantially all of our U.S. deferred tax assets. A key trend included in our projections
was the rate of penetration of LCD televisions driven by an increase in televisions per household, faster LCD television replacement rates, the continued decline of cathode ray tube products, and growth in emerging markets such as China. Another key
trend included global demand improvements for diesel products based on the timing of new government regulations and economic growth. In the third and fourth quarters of 2008, we released an additional $70 million, and $45 million, respectively, of
valuation allowances on our U.S. deferred tax assets as a result of a change in our estimate of U.S. taxable income.

Significant estimates
and assumptions used in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets included: the long-term stabilization of U.S. income from forecasted royalty income in our Display Technologies operating segment, the long-term growth of our diesel
business, and the future success of new products.



In determining our provision for income taxes, we use an annual effective income tax rate based on full year
income, permanent differences between book and tax income, and statutory income tax rates. Significant judgment is required in determining the Company’s worldwide income tax position, as well as the effective tax rate.

Equity method investments

At
December 31, 2009 and 2008, the carrying value of our equity method investments was $4.0 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively, with our two largest equity method investments comprising approximately 94% of the balance. We review our equity
method investments for indicators of impairment on a periodic basis or if an event or circumstances change to indicate the carrying amount may be other-than-temporarily impaired. When such indicators are present, we then perform an in-depth review
for impairment. An impairment assessment requires the exercise of judgment related to key assumptions such as forecasted revenue and profitability, forecasted tax rates, foreign currency exchange rate movements, terminal value assumptions,
historical experience, our current knowledge from our commercial relationships, and available external information about future trends.

As of
December 31, 2009 and 2008, we have not identified any instances where the carrying values of our equity method investments were not recoverable.

Fair value measures

As required, Corning uses two kinds of inputs to determine the fair value of assets and
liabilities: observable and unobservable. Observable inputs are based on market data or independent sources, while unobservable inputs are based on the Company’s own market assumptions. Once inputs have been characterized, we prioritize the
inputs used to measure fair value into one of three broad levels. Characterization of fair value inputs is required for those accounting pronouncements that prescribe or permit fair value measurement. In addition, observable market data must be used
when available. Corning’s major categories of financial assets and liabilities required to be measured at fair value are short-term and long-term investments and derivatives. These categories use observable inputs only and are measured using a
market approach based on quoted prices in markets considered active or in markets in which there are few transactions.

Derivative assets and
liabilities may include interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts that are measured using observable quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities. In arriving at the fair value of Corning’s derivative assets and liabilities, we
have considered the appropriate valuation and risk criteria, including such factors as credit risk of the relevant party to the transaction. Amounts related to credit risk are not material.

Probability of litigation outcomes

We are required to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain. In making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters, we consider the evaluation of legal counsel knowledgeable about each matter, case law,
and other case-specific issues. See Part II - Item 1. Legal Proceedings for a discussion of the material litigation matters we face. The most significant matter involving judgment is the liability for asbestos litigation. There are a number of
factors bearing upon our potential liability, including the inherent complexity of a Chapter 11 filing, our history of success in defending asbestos claims, our assessment of the strength of our corporate veil defenses, and our continuing dialogue
with our insurance carriers and the claimants’ representatives. The proposed asbestos resolution (Amended PCC Plan) is subject to a number of contingencies. The approval of the Amended PCC Plan by the Bankruptcy Court is not certain and faces
objections by some parties. Any approval of the Amended PCC Plan by the Bankruptcy Court is subject to appeal. The proposed Amended PCC Plan is also subject to a vote of PCC’s creditors. For these and other reasons, Corning’s liability for
these asbestos matters may be subject to changes in subsequent quarters. The estimate of the cost of resolving the non-PCC asbestos claims may also be subject to change as developments occur. Management continues to believe that the likelihood of
the uncertainties surrounding these proceedings causing a material adverse impact to Corning’s financial statements is remote.

Other possible liabilities

We are required to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain. In
making determinations of likely outcomes of certain matters, including certain tax planning and environmental matters, these judgments require us to consider events and actions that are outside our control in determining whether probable or possible
liabilities require accrual or disclosure. It is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to accruals.



Variable interest entities

The Company has interests in certain unconsolidated entities. These investments are evaluated periodically to determine if they qualify as variable interest entities and whether Corning is a primary
beneficiary for any of those qualifying interests. A variable interest entity (VIE) is an entity that lacks sufficient equity investment or in which the equity investors do not have certain characteristics of a controlling financial interest. A
company that absorbs a majority of the expected losses or receives a majority of the expected returns of a VIE is considered to be a primary beneficiary and must consolidate the VIE. The determination of whether an entity is a VIE and if a company
is the primary beneficiary of a VIE are complex areas that require judgments about items such as the sufficiency of the equity at risk, the evaluation of contractual arrangements, and assessments about forecasted information. While management
believes the assumptions used are appropriate, changes in these judgments or estimates could affect Corning’s results.

Pension and
other postretirement employee benefits (OPEB)

Pension and OPEB costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions used in calculating
such amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trend rates, benefits earned, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, and other factors. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, actual results that differ from
the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods. While management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in
actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect Corning’s pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense.

As of
December 31, 2009, the Projected Benefit Obligation (PBO) for U.S. pension plans was $2,465 million.

The following information
illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for U.S. pension plans:

The above sensitivities reflect the impact of
changing one assumption at a time. Note that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear. These changes in assumptions would have no effect
on Corning’s funding requirements.

In addition, at December 31, 2009, a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would decrease
stockholders’ equity by $87 million before tax, and a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would increase stockholders’ equity by $85 million. In addition, the impact of greater than a 25 basis point decrease in discount rate would
not be proportional to the first 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate.

The following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in
the discount rate assumption related to Corning’s U.S. OPEB plans:

The above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time. Note that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily
linear.

Revenue recognition

The Company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. In certain instances, revenue recognition is based on estimates of fair value of deliverables as well as estimates of product returns, allowances, discounts, and
other factors. These estimates are supported by historical data. While management believes that the estimates used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in estimates may affect Corning’s future results.



Stock compensation

Stock-based compensation expense and disclosures are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts. These assumptions include risk-free discount rates, expected term of the stock based
compensation instrument granted, volatility of stock and option prices, expected time between grant date and date of exercise, attrition, performance, and other factors. These assumptions require us to exercise judgment. Our estimates of these
assumptions typically are based upon our historical experience, currently available market place data, and forward looking explanatory variables. While management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience
or changes in assumptions may affect Corning’s future stock based compensation expense and disclosures.

Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks

We operate and conduct business in many foreign countries and as a result are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange
rates. Our exposure to exchange rates has the following effects:

•

Exchange rate movements on financial instruments and transactions denominated in foreign currencies that impact earnings; and

•

Exchange rate movements upon conversion of net assets and net income of foreign subsidiaries for which the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar,
which impact our net equity.

We have foreign currency exposure to the Japanese yen, euro, New Taiwan dollar and Korean won.
We selectively enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts with durations generally 18 months or less to hedge our exposure to exchange rate risk on foreign source income and purchases. These hedges are scheduled to mature coincident
with the timing of the underlying foreign currency commitments and transactions. The objective of these contracts is to neutralize the impact of exchange rate movements on our operating results. We also enter into foreign exchange forward contracts
when situations arise where our foreign subsidiaries or Corning enter into lending situations, generally on an intercompany basis, denominated in currencies other than their local currency. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments
for trading purposes. Corning uses derivative instruments (forwards) to limit the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations associated with certain monetary assets and liabilities. These derivative instruments are not designated as hedging
instruments for accounting purposes and, as such, are referred to as undesignated hedges. Changes in the fair value of undesignated hedges, along with foreign currency gains and losses arising from the underlying monetary assets or liabilities, are
recorded in current period earnings in Other (Expense) Income, Net in the consolidated statements of income.

Equity in earnings of affiliated
companies has historically contributed a significant amount to our income from continuing operations. Equity in earnings of affiliated companies, net of impairments were $1.4 billion in 2009 and 2008 with foreign-based affiliates comprising over 78%
of this amount in 2009. Equity earnings from Samsung Corning Precision totaled $1.1 billion for 2009 and $927 million for 2008. Exchange rate fluctuations and actions taken by management of these entities can affect the earnings of these companies.

We use a sensitivity analysis to assess the market risk associated with our foreign currency exchange risk. Market risk is defined as the
potential change in fair value of assets and liabilities resulting from an adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates. At December 31, 2009, we had open forward contracts, and foreign denominated debt with values exposed to exchange
rate movements, all of which were designated as hedges at December 31, 2009. A 10% adverse movement in quoted foreign currency exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of $278 million compared to $215 million at
December 31, 2008. Specific to the Japanese yen, a 10% adverse movement in quoted yen exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of $131 million compared to $118 million at December 31, 2008. Specific to the
euro, a 10% adverse movement in quoted euro exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of $107 million compared to $68 million at December 31, 2008.

As we derive approximately 76% of our net sales from outside the U.S., our sales and net income could be affected if the U.S. dollar significantly strengthens or weakens against foreign currencies, most
notably the Japanese yen and euro. Our forecasts generally assume exchange rates during 2010 remain constant at January 2010 levels. A plus or minus 10 point movement in the U.S. dollar - Japanese yen exchange rate would result in a change to 2010
net sales of approximately $246 million and net income of approximately $340 million. A plus or minus 10 point movement in the U.S. dollar - euro exchange rate would result in a change to 2010 net sales of approximately $34 million and net income of
approximately $8 million.

Interest Rate Risk Management

It is our policy to conservatively manage our exposure to changes in interest rates. At December 31, 2009, our consolidated debt portfolio contained less than 1% of variable rate instruments.

Item 9A.    Controls and Procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our
principal executive and principal financial officers, after evaluating the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the
period covered by this report, have concluded that based on the evaluation of these controls and procedures required by paragraph (b) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15, that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

(a)

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate disclosure controls and procedures and adequate internal control over
financial reporting for Corning. Management is also responsible for the assessment of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.

Disclosure controls and procedures mean controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to
be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Corning’s disclosure controls and
procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by Corning in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to Corning’s
management, including Corning’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or other persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Corning’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Corning’s internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of Corning’s assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that Corning’s receipts and expenditures are being made only
in accordance with authorizations of Corning’s management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of Corning’s assets that could
have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.

Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the system of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that Corning’s internal control over financial reporting was effective
as of December 31, 2009. The effectiveness of Corning’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in
their report which is included herein.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred
during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Corning Incorporated

2009 Annual Report

Index to Financial Statements and Financial Statement Schedules



Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Corning Incorporated:

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Corning Incorporated and its subsidiaries at
December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial
statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009 based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in “Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting,” appearing under Item 9A. Our
responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also
included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that,
in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Organization

Corning Incorporated is a provider of high-performance glass for LCD televisions, computer monitors, and
other information display applications; optical fiber and cable and hardware and equipment products for the telecommunications industry; ceramic substrates for gasoline and diesel engines in automotive and heavy duty vehicle markets; laboratory
products for the scientific community and specialized polymer products for biotechnology applications; advanced optical materials for the semiconductor industry and the scientific community; and other technologies. In these notes, the terms
“Corning,” “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our” mean Corning Incorporated and subsidiary companies.

Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation

Our consolidated financial statements were prepared in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (U.S. GAAP) and include the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of all majority-owned subsidiaries over which Corning exercises control and, when applicable, entities for
which Corning has a controlling financial interest.

The equity method of accounting is used for investments in affiliated companies that are
not controlled by Corning and in which our interest is generally between 20% and 50% and we have significant influence over the entity. Our share of earnings or losses of affiliated companies, in which at least 20% of the voting securities is owned
and we have significant influence but not control over the entity, is included in consolidated operating results.

We use the cost method to
account for our investments in companies that we do not control and for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies. In accordance with the cost method, these investments are recorded at
cost or fair value, as appropriate.

All material intercompany accounts, transactions and profits are eliminated in consolidation.

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current-year presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on our results of
operations, financial position, or changes in shareholders’ equity.

Effective September 30, 2009, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) established The FASB Accounting Standards Codification

™

(ASC) as the source
of authoritative accounting to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. Except for newly issued standards that have not been codified, references to codified literature have been
updated to reflect this change.

Corning evaluates all events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date through the date of
issuance of our financial statements. For the year ended December 31, 2009, subsequent events were evaluated through February 10, 2010.

Effective January 1, 2009, the Company, as required, adopted U.S. GAAP requirements for reporting noncontrolling interests in financial statements. A noncontrolling interest, previously called a minority interest, is the portion of
equity in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to a parent. Under the new standard, noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries are now included as a component of equity in the consolidated statements of financial position. This
guidance also provides the required accounting treatment for changes in ownership of noncontrolling interests. As required, the related presentation and disclosure provisions have been applied retrospectively. For all years presented, amounts
attributable to noncontrolling interests were not significant and therefore, are not presented separately on the consolidated statements of income. These amounts, which have been included in “Other income (expense), net,” are provided
below.

Effective January 1, 2009, the Company changed the presentation of equity in earnings of affiliated companies in the Consolidated
Statements of Income from below “Benefit (provision) for income taxes” to above “Income before income taxes.” The change in presentation reflects the strategic nature and economic importance of the Company’s investments
accounted for under the equity method of accounting. There was no effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operation, financial condition, or cash flows as a result of this change.



1.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Effective April 1, 2009, the Company, as required, adopted the following which resulted from the issuance of new fair value accounting standards under U.S. GAAP:

•

We changed the method for determining whether an other-than temporary impairment exists for debt securities and for determining the amount of an
impairment charge to be recorded in earnings;

•

We adopted new guidance for addressing the determination of (a) when a market for an asset or a liability is active or inactive and (b) when
a particular transaction is distressed; and

•

If applicable, we will provide required disclosures about fair value of financial instruments for interim reporting periods as well as in annual
financial statements.

The impact of adopting these fair value standards was not significant.

Use of Estimates

The preparation
of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes. Significant estimates and assumptions in these
consolidated financial statements include restructuring and other charges and credits, allowances for doubtful accounts receivable, estimates of fair value associated with goodwill and long-lived asset impairment tests, estimates of the fair value
of assets held for disposal, estimates of fair value of investments, environmental and legal liabilities, warranty liabilities, income taxes and deferred tax valuation allowances, the determination of discount and other rate assumptions for pension
and other postretirement employee benefit expenses and the determination of the fair value of stock based compensation involving assumptions about termination rates, stock volatility, discount rates, and expected time to exercise. Due to the
inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results reported in future periods may be different from these estimates.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue for sales of goods is recognized when a firm sales agreement is in place, delivery has
occurred and sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. If customer acceptance of products is not reasonably assured, sales are recorded only upon formal customer acceptance. Sales of goods typically do not
include multiple product and/or service elements.

At the time revenue is recognized, allowances are recorded, with the related reduction to
revenue, for estimated product returns, allowances and price discounts based upon historical experience and related terms of customer arrangements. Where we have offered product warranties, we also establish liabilities for estimated warranty costs
based upon historical experience and specific warranty provisions. Warranty liabilities are adjusted when experience indicates the expected outcome will differ from initial estimates of the liability.

Other Income (Expense), Net

“Other income (expense), net” in Corning’s consolidated statements of income includes the following (in millions):

Research and Development Costs

Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred. Research and
development costs totaled $465 million in 2009, $510 million in 2008, and $446 million in 2007.



1.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions

The determination of the functional
currency for Corning’s foreign subsidiaries is made based on the appropriate economic factors. For most foreign operations, the local currencies are generally considered to be the functional currencies. Corning’s most significant exception
is our Taiwanese subsidiary which uses the Japanese yen as its functional currency. For all transactions denominated in a currency other than a subsidiary’s functional currency, exchange rate gains and losses are included in income for the
period in which the exchange rates changed.

Foreign subsidiary functional currency balance sheet accounts are translated at current exchange
rates, and statement of operations accounts are translated at average exchange rates for the year. Translation gains and losses are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders’ equity. The
effects of remeasuring non-functional currency assets and liabilities into the functional currency are included in current earnings.

Stock-Based Compensation

Corning’s stock-based compensation programs include employee stock option grants,
time-based restricted stock awards, time-based restricted stock units, performance-based restricted stock awards, performance-based restricted stock units, and the Worldwide Employee Share Purchase Plan, as more fully described in Note 19
(Share-based Compensation). On January 1, 2006, the Company began expensing share-based payments using the “prospective adoption” transition method allowed under U.S. GAAP. Following the prospective adoption transition method, prior
periods were not restated. We applied the stated and nominal vesting period attribution approach for any share-based awards granted prior to January 1, 2006. The Company elected the alternative transition method for calculating the tax effects
of employee share-based compensation awards that were outstanding at January 1, 2006. All awards granted prior to January 1, 2006 were fully amortized as of December 31, 2009.

The cost of stock-based compensation awards is equal to the fair value of the award at the date of grant and compensation expense is recognized for those
awards earned over the vesting period, except as noted below. Corning estimates the fair value of stock based awards using a lattice-based option valuation model, which incorporates assumptions including expected volatility, dividend yield,
risk-free rate, expected time to exercise and departure rates.

Under U.S. GAAP, an award is considered vested when the employee’s
retention of the award is no longer contingent on providing subsequent service (the “non-substantive vesting period approach”). Prior to December 1, 2008, the terms and conditions of Corning’s stock option agreement specified
that employees continue to vest in option awards after retirement without providing any additional services. For awards granted from January 1, 2006 to December 1, 2008, compensation cost was recognized immediately for awards granted to
retirement eligible employees. For employees who become retirement eligible during the vesting period, expense is recognized evenly from the grant date to the date of retirement eligibility.

On December 1, 2008, Corning amended the terms and conditions of its stock option agreement for awards to retirement eligible employees. Under the
terms of this agreement, awards are earned ratably each month the employee provides service over the twelve months following the grant date, and the related compensation expense is recognized over this twelve month service period or over the period
from the grant date to the date retirement eligibility is achieved, whichever is longer.

Refer to Note 19 (Share-based Compensation).

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash. We consider securities with contractual maturities of three months or less, when purchased, to be cash equivalents. The carrying amount of these
securities approximates fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments.



1.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Supplemental disclosure of cash flow information follows (in millions):

(1)

Amounts represent credits applied to customer receivable balances for customers that made advance cash deposits under long-term purchase and supply agreements.

(2)

Included in this amount are approximately $29 million, $31 million, and $19 million of interest costs that were capitalized as part of property, net in 2009, 2008 and
2007, respectively.

Short-Term Investments

Our short-term investments consist of available-for-sale securities that are stated at fair value. Consistent with Corning’s cash investment policy, our short-term investments consist primarily of
fixed-income securities. Preservation of principal is the primary principle of our cash investment policy that is carried out by limiting interest rate, reinvestment, security, quality and event risk. Our investments are generally liquid and all are
investment grade quality. The portfolio is invested predominantly in U.S. Treasury securities. Unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, are computed on the first-in first-out basis and are reported as a separate component of accumulated other
comprehensive loss in shareholders’ equity until realized. Realized gains and losses are recorded in other income (expense), net.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts is determined based on a variety of
factors that affect the potential collectability of the related receivables, including length of time receivables are past due, customer credit ratings, financial stability of customers, specific one-time events and past customer history. In
addition, in circumstances where the Company is made aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations, a specific allowance is established. The majority of accounts are individually evaluated on a regular basis and
appropriate reserves are established as deemed appropriate based on the above criteria. The remainder of the reserve is based on management’s estimates and takes into consideration the length of time receivables are past due, historical trends,
market conditions, and the composition of the Company’s customer base.

Environmental Liabilities

The Company accrues for its environmental investigation, remediation, operating, and maintenance costs when it is probable that a liability has been
incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. For environmental matters, the most likely cost to be incurred is accrued based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site, current laws and regulations and
prior remediation experience. For sites with multiple potential responsible parties, the Company considers its likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation costs and the ability of the other parties to fulfill their obligations in
establishing a provision for those costs. Where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely to occur than another, the minimum is accrued. When future liabilities are determined to be reimbursable by insurance coverage, an accrual is
recorded for the potential liability and a receivable is recorded related to the insurance reimbursement when reimbursement is virtually certain. The uncertain nature inherent in such remediation and the possibility that initial estimates may not
reflect the final outcome could result in additional costs.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out basis) or market.

Property, Net of Accumulated Depreciation

Land, buildings, and equipment,
including precious metals, are recorded at cost. Depreciation is based on estimated useful lives of properties using the straight-line method. Except as described in Note 2 (Restructuring, Impairment and Other Charges and (Credits)) related to
accelerated depreciation arising from restructuring programs and Note 9 (Property, Net of Accumulated Depreciation) related to the depletion of precious metals, the estimated useful lives range from 10 to 40 years for buildings and 2 to 20 years for
equipment.



1.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Included in the subcategory of equipment are the following types of assets:

Manufacturing equipment includes certain components of production equipment that are constructed of precious metals. These assets are not depreciated because they have very low physical losses and are
repeatedly reclaimed and reused in our manufacturing process over a very long useful life. We treat the physical loss of precious metals in the manufacturing and reclamation process as depletion and account for these losses as a period expense based
on actual units lost. Precious metals are integral to many of our glass production processes. They are only acquired to support our operations and are not held for trading or other purposes.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill is the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter, and will be tested for
impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that more likely than not would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. Impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level. Reporting units are either
operating segments or one level below the operating segment. Goodwill relates to and is assigned directly to a specific reporting unit. An impairment loss generally would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s net assets
exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. Refer to Note 10 (Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets) for additional information.

Other intangible assets include patents, trademarks, and other intangible assets acquired from an independent party. Such intangible assets have a
definite life and are amortized on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives ranging from 4 to 50 years.

Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets

We review the recoverability of our long-lived assets, such as plant and equipment and intangible assets, when
events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable. When impairment indicators are present, we compare estimated undiscounted future cash flows, including the eventual
disposition of the asset group at market value, to the assets’ carrying value to determine if the asset group is recoverable. The fair value of long-lived assets is determined using an “income approach” that starts with the forecast
of all the expected future net cash flows including the eventual disposition at market value of long-lived assets, and also considers the fair market value of all precious metals. We assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived
assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. If there is an impairment, a loss is recorded to reflect the difference between the assets’ fair value and
carrying value.

Treasury Stock

Shares of common stock repurchased by us are recorded at cost as treasury stock and result in a reduction of shareholders’ equity in the consolidated balance sheets. From time to time, treasury
shares may be reissued as contributions to our employee benefit plans and for the retirement or conversion of certain debt instruments. When shares are reissued, we use an average cost method for determining cost. The difference between the cost of
the shares and the reissuance price is added to or deducted from additional paid-in capital.

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method prescribed by U.S. GAAP. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities
are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to operating loss and tax credit carry forwards and for differences between the carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.



1.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

In determining our provision for income taxes, we use an annual effective income tax rate based on full year income, permanent differences between book and tax income, and statutory income tax rates. The
effective income tax rate also reflects our assessment of the ultimate outcome of tax audits. In evaluating the tax benefits associated with our various tax filing positions, we record a tax benefit for uncertain tax positions using the highest
cumulative tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. Adjustments are made to our liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the period in which we determine the issue is effectively settled with the tax authorities, the
statute of limitations expires for the return containing the tax position or when more information becomes available. Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits, including accrued penalties and interest, is included in other long-term liabilities
on our consolidated balance sheets and in income tax expense in our consolidated statements of earnings.

Discrete events such as audit
settlements or changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur. Valuation allowances are established when management is unable to conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will
ultimately be realized.

The Company is subject to income taxes in the United States and in numerous foreign jurisdictions. No provision is
made for U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of wholly owned foreign subsidiaries because substantially all such earnings are indefinitely reinvested in those companies. Provision for the tax consequences of distributions, if any, from
consolidated foreign subsidiaries is recorded in the year in which the earnings are no longer indefinitely reinvested in those subsidiaries.

Equity Method Investments

Our equity method investments, as required, are reviewed for impairment on a periodic basis
or if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. This assessment is based on a review of the equity investments’ performance and a review of indicators of impairment to determine if there is
evidence of a loss in value of an equity investment. Factors we consider include:

•

Absence of our ability to recover the carrying amount;

•

Inability of the equity affiliate to sustain an earnings capacity which would justify the carrying amount of the investment; and

•

Significant litigation, bankruptcy or other events that could impact recoverability.

For an equity investment with impairment indicators, we measure fair value on the basis of discounted cash flows or other appropriate valuation methods,
depending on the nature of the company involved. If it is probable that we will not recover the carrying amount of our investment, the impairment is considered other-than-temporary and recorded in earnings, and the equity investment balance is
reduced to its fair value accordingly. We require our equity method affiliates to provide audited financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Consequently, required assessments of asset recoverability are included in their results. We also
include these financial statements in our recoverability assessment.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

As prescribed by U.S. GAAP, major categories of financial assets and liabilities, including short-term investments, other assets and derivatives are
measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Certain assets and liabilities including long-lived assets, goodwill, asset retirement obligations, and cost and equity investments are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.

Fair value is the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required to be recorded at fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and consider assumptions that
market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions, and risk of nonperformance.

Derivative Instruments

We participate in a variety of foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign exchange option
contracts entered into in connection with the management of our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. These financial exposures are managed in accordance with corporate policies and procedures.



1.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

All derivatives are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and hedges of net investments in foreign operations are recorded in
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Amounts related to cash flow hedges are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) when the underlying hedged item impacts earnings. This reclassification is recorded in the same
line item of the consolidated statement of operations as where the effects of the hedged item are recorded, typically sales, royalties, or cost of sales. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recorded currently
in earnings offset, to the extent the derivative was effective, by the change in the fair value of the hedged item. Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are recorded currently in earnings in the other income
line of the consolidated statement of operations.

We have issued foreign currency denominated debt that has been designated as a hedge of the
net investment in a foreign operation. The effective portion of the changes in fair value of the debt is reflected as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) as part of the foreign currency translation adjustment.

Variable Interest Entities

For
variable interest entities, we assess the terms of our interest in each entity to determine if we are the primary beneficiary as prescribed under U.S. GAAP. The primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is the party that absorbs a majority
of the entity’s expected losses, receives a majority of its expected residual returns, or both, as a result of holding variable interests, which are the ownership, contractual, or other pecuniary interests in an entity that change with changes
in the fair value of the entity’s net assets excluding variable interests.

Corning has performed the required assessments and has
identified three entities as being variable interest entities. None of these entities are considered to be significant to Corning’s consolidated statements of position.

New Accounting Standards

In June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 167,
“Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46 (R)” (SFAS 167). In December 2009, the FASB amended their codification for SFAS 167 to Accounting Standards Update 2009-17, Consolidations (Topic 810): Improvements to Financial Reporting by
Enterprises Involved with Variable Interest Entities (ASU 2009-17). ASU 2009-17 revises the consolidation guidance for variable interest entities and modifies the approach for determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity (VIE).
Under ASU 2009-17, the primary beneficiary is the variable interest holder that has (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb
losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. In addition, ASU 2009-17 provides guidance on shared power and joint venture relationships, removes the scope exemption for qualified
special purpose entities, revises the definition of a VIE, and requires additional disclosures. ASU 2009-17 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2009. Corning does not expect adoption of this standard to have a material
impact on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition.

In October 2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update
No. 2009-13, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605): Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements - a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force (ASU 2009-13). ASU 2009-13 addresses the accounting for sales arrangements that include multiple
products or services by revising the criteria for when deliverables may be accounted for separately rather than as a combined unit. Specifically, this guidance establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable,
which is necessary to separately account for each product or service. This hierarchy provides more options for establishing selling price than existing guidance. ASU 2009-13 is required to be applied prospectively to new or materially modified
revenue arrangements in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010. Early adoption is permitted. Corning does not expect adoption of this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations and financial
condition.

Restructuring, Impairment and Other Charges (Credits)

2009 Actions

Corning recorded net charges of $228 million in 2009. A summary of
the charges follows:

•

We recorded a charge of $228 million associated with a corporate-wide restructuring plan to reduce our global workforce in response to anticipated
lower sales in 2009. The charge included costs for severance, special termination benefits, outplacement services, asset disposal costs, and the impact of a $32 million curtailment loss for postretirement benefits in 2009. Total cash expenditures
associated with this plan are expected to be approximately $155 million with the majority of spending completed in 2010.

Available-for-Sale Investments

The
following is a summary of the fair value of available-for-sale securities (in millions):

Long-term investment securities are comprised of asset-backed securities with a fair value of $42
million at December 31, 2009. We do not intend to sell, nor do we believe it is more likely than not that we would be required to sell, the $75 million amortized cost-basis of these asset-backed securities (which are collateralized by
mortgages) before recovery of their amortized cost basis. It is possible that a significant degradation in the delinquency or foreclosure rates in the underlying assets could cause further temporary or other-than-temporary impairments in the future.

The following table summarizes the contractual maturities of available-for-sale securities at December 31, 2009 (in millions):

Significant Customers

For 2009, 2008,
and 2007, Corning’s sales to AU Optronics Corporation, a customer of our Display Technologies segment, represented 13%, 11%, and 12%, respectively, of the Company’s consolidated net sales. For 2008, Corning’s sales to Chi Mei
Optoelectronics Corporation, another customer of our Display Technologies segment, represented 10% of the Company’s consolidated net sales.

Income Taxes

The current and deferred amounts of the provision (benefit) for income taxes follow (in millions):

Amounts are reflected in the preceding tables based on the location of the taxing authorities.

Reconciliation of the U.S. statutory income tax rate to our effective tax rate for continuing operations follows:

Significant items that cause our effective tax rate to vary from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% are as
follows:

(1)

Certain foreign subsidiaries in China and Taiwan are operating under tax holiday arrangements. The nature and extent of such arrangements vary, and the benefits of
existing arrangements phase out in future years (through 2013) according to the specific terms and schedules of the relevant taxing jurisdictions. The impact of tax holidays on net income per share on a diluted basis was $0.09 in 2009, and $0.10 in
2008 and 2007.

(2)

Primarily related to investment tax credits in Taiwan, employment credits in Mexico and research & development credits in U.S. and France.

(3)

In 2007, certain U.S. and German deferred taxes were revised for enacted law changes.

(4)

In 2008, we released $2.5 billion of valuation allowances resulting from a change in judgment about the realizability of deferred tax assets in future years, as
described below.

(5)

In 2007, due to sustained profitability and positive earnings projections for our overall German operations, we concluded that it is more likely than not that the
German national deferred tax assets are realizable and that the related valuation allowance was no longer required.

(6)

For all three years presented, we generated positive income from continuing operations in the U.S. In 2008 and 2007, the tax expense on such income was fully offset by
the tax benefit of releasing a portion of valuation allowance to reflect the realization of deferred taxes resulting from the generation of U.S. income. The impact of the release of valuation allowance and consequently not recording tax expense on
income generated in the U.S. was a reduction in the rate of 8.6 and 8.1 percentage points for 2008 and 2007 respectively.



6.

Income Taxes (continued)

(7)

In 2009 and 2008, we recorded a $2 million and $40 million benefit, respectively, related to a favorable tax settlement with the Canadian Revenue Agency.

(8)

In 2009, we recorded a $37 million tax credit for U.S. Research and Experimentation - expenses incurred from 2005-2009.

(9)

Equity in earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates reported in the financials net of tax.

(10)

In 2009, we recorded an additional deferred tax asset related to tax free OPEB subsidies.

The tax effects of temporary differences and carryforwards that gave rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and liabilities follows (in millions):

The
net deferred tax assets are included in (in millions):

Details on deferred tax assets for loss and tax credit carryforwards at December 31, 2009 follow (in millions):

The recognition of windfall tax benefits from stock-based compensation deducted on the tax return is prohibited until realized through a reduction of income tax payable. Cumulative tax benefits totaling $248 million will be recorded in
additional paid-in-capital when the net operating loss carry forward is utilized and the windfall tax benefit can be realized.

Under U.S.
GAAP, deferred tax assets are to be reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available positive and negative evidence, it is more likely than not (a likelihood of greater than 50 percent) that some portion or all of the deferred
tax assets will not be realized. At December 31, 2007, all of our U.S. deferred tax assets had full valuation allowances.



6.

Income Taxes (continued)

In the second
quarter of 2008, we concluded that it was more likely than not that we would realize substantially all of our U.S. deferred tax assets because we expect to generate sufficient levels of income in the U.S. As a result, we released $2.4 billion of
valuation allowances on our U.S. deferred tax assets in the second quarter of 2008. We considered all available evidence, both positive and negative, to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance was needed.

The evaluation of the realizability of deferred tax assets is inherently subjective. Following are the key items that provided positive
evidence to support the release of the valuation allowance for a large portion of our deferred tax assets in the second quarter of 2008:

•

Positive pre-tax income in the U.S. for the first half of 2008 and the preceding year;

•

The impact of positive results in the Display Technologies operating segment and the royalty income generated from the foreign locations in this
segment;

•

The number of years remaining to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards; and

•

Increased confidence in our longer-term forecasted income levels, which were supported by detailed sensitivity analyses.

At June 30, 2008, the following items were considered as negative evidence in our valuation allowance assessment, but were less heavily weighted
than our positive evidence:

•

Uncertainty of future taxable earnings;

•

Historical utilization of deferred tax assets caused largely by non-recurring items; and

•

Economic and consumer demand uncertainty.

U.S. deferred tax liabilities totaled $26 million at December 31, 2008, and therefore, were not a significant factor in our assessment of the realizability of deferred tax assets.

As prescribed by U.S. GAAP, in the second half of 2008 we utilized a portion of the remaining valuation allowance to offset U.S. income tax expense (or
benefit) that would otherwise have been recorded on income (or losses) in the U.S. and therefore, reflected no net U.S. income tax expense. As our income for the second half of 2008 was lower than our June 30, 2008 forecast for this period, we
released an additional $115 million of valuation allowances in the second half of 2008. In 2009, we began providing U.S. income tax expense (or benefit) on U.S. earnings (losses).

U.S. profits of approximately $8.3 billion will be required to fully realize the deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2009. Of that amount, $3.6 billion of U.S. profits will be required over the
next 16 years to fully realize the deferred tax assets associated with federal net operating loss carry forwards.

Certain shorter-lived
deferred tax assets such as those represented by capital loss carry forwards and state tax net operating loss carry forwards, as well as other federal and state tax credits, will remain with a valuation allowance recorded against them as of
December 31, 2009, because we cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that we will earn income of the character required to utilize these assets before they expire. The amount of U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets that have remaining
valuation allowances at December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $245 million, and $230 million, respectively.

We do not provide income taxes on
the post-1992 earnings of domestic subsidiaries that we expect to recover tax-free without significant cost. Income taxes have been provided for post-1992 unremitted earnings of domestic corporate joint ventures that we do not expect to recover
tax-free. Unremitted earnings of domestic subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures that arose in fiscal years beginning on or before December 31, 1992 have been indefinitely reinvested. Our cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments
are held in various locations throughout the world. At December 31, 2009, about half of the consolidated amount was held outside of the U.S. Almost all of the amounts held outside of the U.S. are available for repatriation subject to relevant
tax consequences. We utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed. We currently provide income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries and
affiliated companies to the extent these earnings are currently taxable or expected to be remitted. As of December 31, 2009, taxes have not been provided on approximately $7.3 billion of accumulated foreign unremitted earnings that are expected
to remain invested indefinitely. It is not practical to calculate the unrecognized deferred tax liability on those earnings.



6.

Income Taxes (continued)

On
January 1, 2007, as prescribed by U.S. GAAP, we recognized a $25 million increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and a decrease to the January 1, 2007, balance of retained earnings of $4 million. A reconciliation of the
beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in millions):

Included in the balance at December 31, 2009 and 2008 are $35 million and $29 million,
respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits that would impact our effective tax rate if recognized.

We recognize accrued interest and
penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of tax expense. For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the amounts recognized in interest expense and income were immaterial. The amounts accrued at December 31, 2009
and 2008 for the payment of interest and penalties were not significant.

Corning Incorporated, as the common parent company, and all
80%-or-more-owned U.S. subsidiaries join in the filing of consolidated U.S. federal income tax returns. All such returns for periods ended through December 31, 2004, have been audited by and settled with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The
statute of limitations to audit the 2005 U.S. federal income tax expired in 2009, except to the extent that the loss generated in 2005 is utilized in a subsequent year. In that instance, the statute for the 2005 year may be re-opened.

Corning Incorporated and U.S. subsidiaries file income tax returns on a combined, unitary or stand-alone basis in multiple state and local jurisdictions,
which generally have statutes of limitations ranging from 3 to 5 years. Various state income tax returns are currently in the process of examination or administrative appeal.

Our foreign subsidiaries file income tax returns in the countries in which they have operations. Generally, these countries have statutes of limitations ranging from 3 to 7 years. Years still open to
examination by foreign tax authorities in major jurisdictions include Japan (2006 onward) and Taiwan (2004 and 2007 onward).

While we expect
the amount of unrecognized tax benefits to change in the next 12 months, we do not expect the change to have a significant impact on the results of operations or our financial position.

Affiliated Companies at Equity

The results of operations and financial position of the investments accounted for under
the equity method follow (in millions):

(1)

Amounts include the following restructuring, impairment and other charges and (credits):

•

In 2009, equity in earnings of affiliated companies included a charge of $29 million ($27 million after-tax) for our share of the restructuring charges and a credit of
$29 million ($27 million after-tax) primarily for excess foreign tax credits that Dow Corning Corporation generated from foreign dividends.

•

In 2008, Dow Corning recorded an other-than-temporary impairment for certain securities of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which reduced Corning’s equity earnings by
$18 million.

•

In 2007, equity earnings from Samsung Corning Co. Ltd. were reduced by $40 million primarily due to restructuring and impairment charges.

(2)

Corning purchases machinery and equipment on behalf of Samsung Corning Precision to support its capital expansion initiatives. The machinery and equipment are
transferred to Samsung Corning Precision at our cost basis, resulting in no revenue or gain being recognized on the transaction.

We have contractual agreements with several of our equity affiliates which include sales, purchasing, licensing and technology agreements.

At December 31, 2009, approximately $4.1 billion of equity in undistributed earnings of equity companies was included in our retained earnings.

Investments (continued)

A discussion
and summarized results of Corning’s significant affiliates at December 31, 2009 follows:

Samsung Corning Precision Glass Co.,
Ltd. (Samsung Corning Precision)

Samsung Corning Precision is a South Korea-based manufacturer of liquid crystal display glass for flat
panel displays. Samsung Corning Precision’s financial position and results of operations follow (in millions):

(1)

Corning purchases machinery and equipment on behalf of Samsung Corning Precision to support its capital expansion initiatives. The machinery and equipment are
transferred to Samsung Corning Precision at our cost basis, resulting in no revenue or gain being recognized on the transaction.

Balances due from Samsung Corning Precision were $36 million at December 31, 2009. Balances due to Samsung Corning Precision were $14 million at December 31, 2009. Balances due from Samsung Corning Precision were $17 million at
December 31, 2008.

Corning owns 50% of Samsung Corning Precision. Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. owns 43% and other shareholders own the
remaining 7%.

On December 31, 2007, Samsung Corning Precision acquired all of the outstanding shares of Samsung Corning. After the
transaction, Corning retained its 50% interest in Samsung Corning Precision. As a result of this transaction, a difference now exists between the carrying amount of Corning’s investment in Samsung Corning Precision and 50% of the net assets of
Samsung Corning Precision because Samsung Corning Precision accounted for the transaction at fair value, while Corning accounted for the transaction at historical cost.



7.

Investments (continued)

Prior to their
merger, Samsung Corning Precision Glass Co., Ltd. (Samsung Corning Precision) and Samsung Corning Co. Ltd. (Samsung Corning) were two of approximately thirty co-defendants in a lawsuit filed by Seoul Guarantee Insurance Co. and thirteen other
creditors (SGI and Creditors) for alleged breach of an agreement that approximately twenty-eight affiliates of the Samsung group (Samsung Affiliates) entered into with SGI and Creditors on August 24, 1999 (the Agreement). The lawsuit is pending
in the courts of South Korea. Under the Agreement it is alleged that the Samsung Affiliates agreed to sell certain shares of Samsung Life Insurance Co., Ltd. (SLI), which had been transferred to SGI and Creditors in connection with the petition for
court receivership of Samsung Motor Inc. In the lawsuit, SGI and Creditors allege a breach of the Agreement by the Samsung Affiliates and are seeking the loss of principal (approximately $1.95 billion) for loans extended to Samsung Motors Inc.,
default interest and a separate amount for breach. On January 31, 2008, the Seoul District Court ordered the Samsung Affiliates: to pay approximately $1.30 billion by disposing of 2,334,045 shares of SLI less 1,165,955 shares of SLI previously
sold by SGI and Creditors and paying the proceeds to SGI and Creditors; to satisfy any shortfall by participating in the purchase of equity or subordinate debentures issued by them; and pay default interest of 6% per annum. The ruling has been
appealed. On November 10, 2009, the Appellate Court directed the parties to attempt to resolve this matter through mediation. As a result, the parties are discussing the possibility of a settlement of this matter. Due to the uncertainties
around the financial impact to each of the respective Samsung affiliates, Samsung Corning Precision is unable to reasonably estimate the amount of potential loss, if any, associated with this case and therefore no provision for such loss is
reflected in its financial statements. Other than as described above, no claim in these matters has been asserted against Corning or any of its affiliates.

In connection with an investigation by the Commission of the European Communities, Competition DG, of alleged anticompetitive behavior relating to the worldwide production of LCD glass, Corning and
Samsung Corning Precision received a request on March 30, 2009, for certain information from the Competition DG. Corning and Samsung Corning Precision have responded to those requests for information. On October 9, 2009, in connection with
its investigation, the Competition DG made a further request for information from both Corning and Samsung Corning Precision to which each party has responded. Samsung Corning Precision has also responded to the Competition DG and authorities in
other jurisdictions, including the United States in connection with similar investigations of alleged anticompetitive behavior relating to worldwide production of cathode ray tube glass.

In September 2009, Corning and Samsung Corning Precision formed Corsam Technologies LLC (Corsam), a new equity affiliate established to provide glass technology research for future product applications.
Samsung Corning Precision invested $124 million in cash and Corning contributed intellectual property with a corresponding value. Corning and Samsung Corning Precision each own 50% of the common stock of Corsam, and Corning has agreed to provide
research and development services at arms length to Corsam. Corning does not control Corsam because Samsung Corning Precision’s other investors maintain significant participating voting rights. In addition, Corsam has sufficient equity to
finance its activities, the voting rights of investors in Corsam are considered substantive, and the risks and rewards of Corsam’s research are shared only by those investors noted. As a result, Corsam is accounted for under the equity method
of accounting for investments.

Dow Corning
Corporation (Dow Corning)

Dow Corning is a U.S.-based manufacturer of silicone products. Corning and the Dow Chemical Company (Dow
Chemical) each own half of Dow Corning.

Dow Corning’s financial position and results of operations follow (in millions):

At December 31, 2009, Dow Corning’s marketable securities
included approximately $1.1 billion of auction rate securities, net of impairments of $20.2 million. As a result of a temporary impairment, unrealized losses of $16.8 million, net of $3.4 million for a minority interests’ share, were included
in accumulated other comprehensive income in Dow Corning’s consolidated balance sheet. Corning’s share of this unrealized loss was $8.4 million and is included in Corning’s accumulated other comprehensive income.

In January 2010, Dow Corning received approval for U.S. Federal Advanced Energy Manufacturing Tax Credits of approximately $169 million. The tax credits
were granted as part of the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act of 2009, and are focused on job creation from U.S. manufacturing capacity which supplies clean and renewable energy products. The impact of tax credits will be recognized by Dow
Corning as prescribed by U.S. GAAP.

In 2008, Dow Corning recorded an other-than-temporary impairment of $37 million, net of $14 million for a
minority interests’ share, which was included in Dow Corning’s net income for certain securities of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Corning’s share of this loss was $18 million and is included in equity earnings in Corning’s
consolidated statements of income. No additional impairment on the Fannie Mae and Freddy Mac securities was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2009. The majority of Dow Corning’s securities are collateralized by portfolios of
student loans that are guaranteed by the U.S. government. Auctions for these securities have failed since the first quarter of 2008, reducing the immediate liquidity of these investments. Since Dow Corning does not know when a market will return or
develop for these securities, Dow Corning has classified these securities as non-current. Market conditions could result in additional unrealized or realized losses for Dow Corning. Corning’s equity earnings from Dow Corning would be reduced by
our 50% share of any future impairment that is considered to be other-than-temporary.

In 2008, Dow Corning changed its depreciation method
and the estimated useful lives of certain fixed assets. These changes were accounted for as a change in estimate resulting in increased net income of $40 million of which Corning’s share was $20 million.

Dow Corning has borrowed the full amount under its $500 million revolving credit facility and believes it has adequate liquidity to fund operations, its
capital expenditure plan, breast implant settlement liabilities, and shareholder dividends.

Investments (continued)

In 1995,
Corning fully impaired its investment of Dow Corning upon its entry into bankruptcy proceedings and did not recognize net equity earnings from the second quarter of 1995 through the end of 2002. Corning began recognizing equity earnings in the first
quarter of 2003 when management concluded that Dow Corning’s emergence from bankruptcy protection was probable. Dow Corning emerged from bankruptcy in 2004. See discussion below for additional information and for a history of this matter.
Corning considers the $249 million difference between the carrying value of its investment in Dow Corning and its 50% share of Dow Corning’s equity to be permanent.

Corning and Dow Chemical each own 50% of the common stock of Dow Corning. In May 1995, Dow Corning filed for bankruptcy protection to address pending and claimed liabilities arising from many thousands of
breast implant product lawsuits. On June 1, 2004, Dow Corning emerged from Chapter 11 with a Plan of Reorganization (the Plan), which provided for the settlement or other resolution of implant claims. The Plan also includes releases for Corning
and Dow Chemical as shareholders in exchange for contributions to the Plan.

Under the terms of the Plan, Dow Corning has established and is
funding a Settlement Trust and a Litigation Facility to provide a means for tort claimants to settle or litigate their claims. Inclusive of insurance, Dow Corning has paid approximately $1.6 billion to the Settlement Trust. As of December 31,
2009, Dow Corning had recorded a reserve for breast implant litigation of $1.6 billion and anticipates insurance receivables of $16 million. As a separate matter arising from the bankruptcy proceedings, Dow Corning is defending claims asserted by a
number of commercial creditors who claim additional interest at default rates and enforcement costs, during the period from May 1995 through June 2004. As of December 31, 2009, Dow Corning has estimated the liability to commercial creditors to
be within the range of $83 million to $260 million. As Dow Corning management believes no single amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other amount within the range, Dow Corning has recorded the minimum liability within
the range. Should Dow Corning not prevail in this matter, Corning’s equity earnings would be reduced by its 50% share of the amount in excess of $83 million, net of applicable tax benefits. In addition, the London Market Insurers (the LMI
Claimants) have claimed a reimbursement right with respect to a portion of insurance proceeds previously paid by the LMI Claimants to Dow Corning. This claim is based on a theory that the LMI Claimants overestimated Dow Corning’s liability for
the resolution of implant claims pursuant to the Plan. The LMI Claimants offered two calculations of their claim amount: $54 million and $93 million, plus minimum interest of $67 million and $116 million, respectively. These estimates were
explicitly characterized as preliminary and subject to change. Litigation regarding this claim is in the discovery stage. Dow Corning disputes the claim and is unable to reasonably estimate any potential liability. There are a number of other claims
in the bankruptcy proceedings against Dow Corning awaiting resolution by the U.S. District Court, and it is reasonably possible that Dow Corning may record bankruptcy-related charges in the future. There are no remaining tort claims against Corning,
other than those that will be channeled by the Plan into facilities established by the Plan or otherwise defended by the Litigation Facility.

Pittsburgh Corning Corporation (PCC)

Corning and PPG Industries, Inc. (PPG) each own 50% of the capital stock of Pittsburgh
Corning Corporation (PCC). Over a period of more than two decades, PCC and several other defendants have been named in numerous lawsuits involving claims alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos. On April 16, 2000, PCC filed for
Chapter 11 reorganization in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. At the time PCC filed for bankruptcy protection, there were approximately 11,800 claims pending against Corning in state court lawsuits alleging various
theories of liability based on exposure to PCC’s asbestos products and typically requesting monetary damages in excess of one million dollars per claim. Corning has defended those claims on the basis of the separate corporate status of PCC and
the absence of any facts supporting claims of direct liability arising from PCC’s asbestos products. Corning is also currently involved in approximately 10,400 other cases (approximately 38,800 claims) alleging injuries from asbestos and
similar amounts of monetary damages per case. Those cases have been covered by insurance without material impact to Corning to date. As described below, several of Corning’s insurance carriers have filed a legal proceeding concerning the extent
of any insurance coverage for these claims. Asbestos litigation is inherently difficult, and past trends in resolving these claims may not be indicators of future outcomes.

On March 28, 2003, Corning announced that it had reached agreement with the representatives of asbestos claimants for the resolution of all current and future asbestos claims against it and PCC,
which might arise from PCC products or operations (the 2003 Plan). The 2003 Plan would have required Corning to relinquish its equity interest in PCC, contribute its equity interest in Pittsburgh Corning Europe N.V. (PCE), a Belgian corporation,
contribute 25 million shares of Corning common stock, and pay a total of $140 million in six annual installments (present value $131 million at March 2003), beginning one year after the plan’s effective date, with 5.5 percent interest from
June 2004. In addition, the 2003 Plan provided that Corning would assign certain insurance policy proceeds from its primary insurance and a portion of its excess insurance.



7.

Investments (continued)

On
December 21, 2006, the Bankruptcy Court issued an order denying confirmation of the 2003 Plan for reasons it set out in a memorandum opinion. Several parties, including Corning, filed motions for reconsideration. These motions were argued on
March 5, 2007, and the Bankruptcy Court reserved decision.

On January 10, 2008, some of the parties in the proceeding advised the
Bankruptcy Court that they had made substantial progress on a proposed amended plan of reorganization (the Amended PCC Plan) that resolved issues raised by the Court in denying the confirmation of the 2003 Plan and that would therefore make it
unnecessary for the Bankruptcy Court to decide the motion for reconsideration. On March 27, 2008 and May 22, 2008, the parties further informed the Bankruptcy Court on the progress toward the Amended PCC Plan. The parties filed a partial
tentative plan on August 8, 2008. The parties continued to inform the Bankruptcy Court of the status of their discussions on the Amended PCC Plan. The complete Amended PCC Plan and its ancillary documents were filed with the Bankruptcy Court on
January 29, 2009.

As a result, Corning believes the Amended PCC Plan now represents the most probable outcome of this matter and expects
that the Amended PCC Plan will be confirmed by the Court. At the same time, Corning believes the 2003 Plan no longer serves as the basis for the Company’s best estimate of liability. Key provisions of the Amended PCC Plan address the concerns
expressed by the Bankruptcy Court. Accordingly, in the first quarter of 2008, Corning adjusted its asbestos litigation liability to reflect components of the Amended PCC Plan. The proposed resolution of PCC asbestos claims under the Amended PCC Plan
requires Corning to contribute its equity interests in PCC and PCE and to contribute a fixed series of payments, recorded at present value. Corning will have the option to use its shares rather than cash to make these payments, but the liability is
fixed by dollar value and not the number of shares. The Amended PCC Plan would require Corning to make (1) one payment of $100 million one year from the date the Amended PCC Plan becomes effective and certain conditions are met and
(2) five additional payments of $50 million, on each of the five subsequent anniversaries of the first payment, the final payment of which is subject to reduction based on the application of credits under certain circumstances.

The Amended PCC Plan does not include non-PCC asbestos claims that may be or have been raised against Corning. Corning has recorded an additional $150
million for such claims in its estimated asbestos litigation liability. The liability for non-PCC claims was estimated based upon industry data for asbestos claims since Corning does not have recent claim history due to the injunction issued by the
Bankruptcy Court. The estimated liability represents the undiscounted projection of claims and related legal fees over the next 20 years. The amount may need to be adjusted in future periods as more Company-specific data becomes available.

The liability for the Amended PCC Plan and the non-PCC asbestos claims was estimated to be $682 million at December 31, 2009, compared
with an estimate of liability of $662 million at December 31, 2008. For the year ended December 31, 2009, Corning recorded asbestos litigation expense of $20 million. The entire obligation is classified as a non-current liability as
installment payments for the cash portion of the obligation are not planned to commence until more than 12 months after the Amended PCC Plan becomes effective and the PCE portion of the obligation will be fulfilled through the direct contribution of
Corning’s investment in PCE (currently recorded as a non-current other equity method investment).

In the first quarter of 2008, Corning
recorded a credit to asbestos settlement expense of $327 million as a result of the increase in likelihood of a settlement under the Amended PCC Plan and a corresponding decrease in the likelihood of a settlement under the 2003 Plan. For the year
ended December 31, 2008, after the first quarter adjustment to the settlement amount, Corning recorded a benefit of $13 million to reflect the change in value of the estimated liability under an Amended PCC Plan.

The Amended PCC Plan is subject to a number of contingencies. Payment of the amounts required to fund the Amended PCC Plan from insurance and other sources
are subject to a number of conditions which may not be achieved. The approval of the Amended PCC Plan by the Bankruptcy Court is not certain and faces objections by some parties. Any approval of the Amended PCC Plan by the Bankruptcy Court is
subject to appeal. The Amended PCC Plan is subject to a vote of PCC’s creditors. For these and other reasons, Corning’s liability for these asbestos matters may be subject to changes in subsequent quarters. The estimate of the cost of
resolving the non-PCC asbestos claims may also be subject to change as developments occur. Management continues to believe that the likelihood of the uncertainties surrounding these proceedings causing a material adverse impact to Corning’s
financial statements is remote.

Several of Corning’s insurers have commenced litigation for a declaration of the rights and obligations
of the parties under insurance policies, including rights that may be affected by the potential resolutions described above. Corning is vigorously contesting these cases. Management is unable to predict the outcome of this insurance litigation and
therefore cannot estimate the range of any possible loss.



7.

Investments (continued)

At
December 31, 2009 and 2008, the fair value of PCE significantly exceeded is carrying value of $125 million and $112 million, respectively. There have been no impairment indicators for our investment in PCE and we continue to recognize equity
earnings of this affiliate. PCC filed for Chapter 11 reorganization in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court on April 16, 2000. At that time, Corning determined it lacked the ability to recover the carrying amount of its investment in PCC and its
investment was other than temporarily impaired. As a result, we reduced our investment in PCC to zero.

Samsung Corning Co., Ltd. (Samsung
Corning)

Samsung Corning was a South Korea-based manufacturer of glass panels and funnels for cathode ray tube (CRT) television and
display monitors.

In the fourth quarter of 2007, Samsung Corning recorded a gain of approximately $17 million on metal and scrap sales and
asset impairment and restructuring charges of $28 million. These items reduced Corning’s equity earnings by $6 million in the fourth quarter. During 2007, Samsung Corning incurred impairment and other charges totaling $94 million as a result of
a decline in the projected operating results for certain display businesses and gains of approximately $30 million on the sale of precious metals. These items reduced Corning’s equity earnings by $32 million for the full year.

Samsung Corning’s results of operations follow (in millions):

Until December 31, 2007, Corning had a 50% interest in Samsung Corning Company, Ltd. (Samsung
Corning), a producer of glass panels and funnels for cathode ray tubes for televisions and computer monitors, with manufacturing facilities in Korea, Germany, China and Malaysia. Samsung Electronics Company, Ltd. and affiliates owned the remaining
50% interest in Samsung Corning. On December 31, 2007, Samsung Corning Precision acquired all of the outstanding shares of Samsung Corning in a transaction accounted for by Samsung Corning Precision as a purchase. After the transaction, Corning
retained its 50% interest in Samsung Corning Precision.

Acquisition

On September 15, 2009,
Corning acquired all of the shares of Axygen Bioscience, Inc. and its subsidiaries from American Capital Ltd. for $410 million, net of $7 million cash received. Axygen is a leading manufacturer and distributor of high-quality life sciences plastic
consumable labware, liquid handling products, and bench-top laboratory equipment.

The purchase price of the acquisition was allocated to the
net tangible and other intangible assets acquired with the remainder recorded as goodwill on the basis of fair value. The following amounts represent preliminary estimates and are subject to revision when valuations are finalized (in millions):

(1)

None of the goodwill recognized is deductible for U.S. income tax purposes. The goodwill was allocated to the Life Sciences segment.



8.

Acquisition (continued)

Goodwill is
primarily related to the value of Axygen’s product portfolio and distribution network and its combination with Corning’s existing life science platform, as well as synergies and other intangibles that do not qualify for separate
recognition. Acquisition-related costs of $4 million in 2009 included costs for legal, accounting, valuation and other professional services and were included in selling, general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Supplemental pro forma information was not provided because Axygen is not material to Corning’s consolidated financial statements.

Property, net follows (in millions):

Approximately $29 million, $31 million, and $19 million of interest costs were capitalized as part of
property, net in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Manufacturing equipment includes certain components of production equipment that are
constructed of precious metals. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the recorded value of precious metals totaled $1.8 billion. Depletion expense related to the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007 totaled $12 million, $13 million, and
$16 million, respectively.

Other Liabilities

Other accrued
liabilities follow (in millions):

Asbestos Litigation

At December 31, 2009, Corning’s liability for asbestos litigation reflected the
components of a proposed resolution that requires Corning to contribute its equity interest in PCC and PCE and to contribute a fixed series of cash payments, recorded at present value on December 31, 2009. Corning will have the option to use
its shares rather than cash to settle the liability, but the liability is fixed by dollar value and not the number of shares. This proposed resolution would require Corning to make one payment of $100 million one year from the date the Amended PCC
Plan becomes effective and certain conditions are met and five additional payments of $50 million on subsequent anniversaries of the first payment, subject to certain credits applicable under certain circumstances to Corning’s final payment.

In addition, an amount is included in the asbestos litigation liability for non-PCC asbestos claims that may be or have been raised against
Corning. Corning has recorded an additional amount for such claims in its estimated asbestos litigation liability. The liability for non-PCC claims was estimated based upon industry data for asbestos claims since Corning does not have recent claim
history due to the injunction issued by the PCC Bankruptcy Court. The estimated liability represents the undiscounted projection of claims and related legal fees over the next 20 years. The amount may need to be adjusted in future periods as more
Company-specific data becomes available. Refer to Note 7 (Investments) for additional information on the asbestos litigation.

Customer
Deposits

In 2005 and 2004, several of Corning’s customers entered into long-term purchase and supply agreements in which
Corning’s Display Technologies segment would supply large-size glass substrates to these customers over periods of up to six years. As part of the agreements, these customers agreed to make advance cash deposits to Corning for a portion of the
contracted glass to be purchased.

Upon receipt of the cash deposits made by customers, we recorded a customer deposit liability. This
liability is reduced at the time of future product sales over the life of the agreements. As product is shipped to a customer, Corning recognizes revenue at the selling price and issues credit memoranda for an agreed amount of the customer deposit
liability. The credit memoranda are applied against customer receivables resulting from the sale of product, thus reducing operating cash flows in later periods as these credits are applied for cash deposits received in earlier periods.



11.

Other Liabilities (continued)

Between
2004 and 2007, we received a total of $937 million for customer deposit agreements. In 2007, we received our last deposit of $105 million. We do not expect to receive additional deposits related to these agreements. In 2009, 2008 and 2007, we issued
$253 million, $266 million, and $231 million, respectively, in credits that were applied to customer receivable balances when payments were due. In 2010, we expect to issue approximately $80 million in credits. In the event customers elect not to
purchase the agreed upon quantities of product, subject to specific conditions outlined in the agreements, Corning may retain certain amounts of the customer deposits. If Corning does not deliver agreed upon product quantities, subject to specific
conditions outlined in the agreements, Corning may be required to return certain amounts of customer deposits.

Debt

(In millions):

At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the weighted-average interest rate on current portion of long-term debt was 5.0% and 5.1%, respectively.

Based on borrowing rates currently available to us for loans with similar terms and maturities, the fair value of long-term debt was $2.0 billion at December 31, 2009 and $1.5 billion at December 31, 2008.

The following table shows debt maturities by year at December 31, 2009 (in millions):

In the fourth quarter of 2006, we amended our existing revolving credit facility. The amended facility provides us access to a $1.1 billion unsecured multi-currency line of credit and expires in November 2011. The facility includes two
financial covenants, including a leverage test (debt to capital ratio), and an interest coverage ratio (calculated on the most recent four quarters). As of December 31, 2009, we were in compliance with these covenants.

Debt Issuances and Retirements

During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded the impact of a capital lease obligation associated with a manufacturing facility in our Display Technologies segment. The balance of this obligation at December 31, 2009 was
$150 million and is included in our long-term debt balance.



12.

Debt (continued)

In the second quarter
of 2009, we issued $250 million of 6.625% senior unsecured notes and $100 million of 7% senior unsecured notes for net proceeds of approximately $248 million and $98 million, respectively. The 6.625% notes mature on May 15, 2019 and the 7%
notes mature on May 15, 2024. We may redeem these debentures at any time.

Corning redeemed $54 million principal amount of our 6.3%
notes due March 1, 2009. There were no other significant debt reductions during 2009.

On December 1, 2008, we filed a shelf
registration statement with the SEC that registered an indeterminate amount and number of securities, and allows us to offer such securities in numbers and amounts determined at the time of such offering.

During the year ended December 31, 2007, we paid $238 million to redeem $223 million principal amount of our 6.25% Euro notes due 2010. We recognized a
loss of $15 million upon the early redemption of these notes.

13.

Employee Retirement Plans

Defined
Benefit Plans

We have defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic and international employees. Our funding policy has
been to contribute, as necessary, an amount in excess of the minimum requirements in order to achieve the Company’s long-term funding targets. In 2009, we made a voluntary contribution of $80 million to our domestic and international pension
plans. In 2008, we made voluntary contributions of $52 million to our domestic and international pension plans.

In 2000, we amended our U.S.
pension plan to include a cash balance pension feature. Certain salaried and non-union hourly employees remain in the traditional defined benefit plan. All salaried and non-union hourly employees hired after July 1, 2000, are automatically
participants in the new cash balance plan. Under the cash balance plan, employee accounts are credited monthly with a percentage of eligible pay based on age and years of service. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 requires vesting after three years
for cash balance plans by January 1, 2008. Corning adopted this measure on January 1, 2008.

Corning offers postretirement plans
that provide health care and life insurance benefits for retirees and eligible dependents. Certain employees may become eligible for such postretirement benefits upon reaching retirement age. Prior to January 1, 2003, our principal retiree
medical plans required retiree contributions each year equal to the excess of medical cost increases over general inflation rates. For current retirees (including surviving spouses) and active employees eligible for the salaried retiree medical
program, we have placed a “cap” on the amount we will contribute toward retiree medical coverage in the future. The cap is equal to 120% of our 2005 contributions toward retiree medical benefits. Once our contributions toward salaried
retiree medical costs reach this cap, impacted retirees will have to pay the excess amount in addition to their regular contributions for coverage. This cap was attained for post-65 retirees in 2008 and has impacted their contribution rate in 2009.
The pre-65 retirees are expected to trigger the cap in 2011. Furthermore, employees hired or rehired on or after January 1, 2007 will be eligible for Corning retiree medical upon retirement; however, these employees will pay 100% of the cost.

In 2009, Corning recorded restructuring charges of $50 million for U.S. pension and postretirement benefit plans. This included a curtailment
charge of $33 million for the qualified defined benefit plan (U.S. pension plan) and the U.S. postretirement benefit plan. Accordingly, we remeasured the U.S. pension and postretirement benefit plan as of March 31, 2009. The remeasurement
resulted in an increase of $115 million to the Company’s U.S. pension liability and a decrease of $12 million to the U.S. postretirement benefit plan liability. As part of the remeasurement, we updated the assumed discount rate for both plans
to 6.25%, which reflected a 25 basis point increase from December 31, 2008.

Employee Retirement Plans (continued)

Obligations and Funded Status

The change in benefit obligation and funded status of our employee retirement plans follow (in
millions):

The accumulated benefit obligation for defined benefit pension plans was $2.7 billion and $2.5

Employee Retirement Plans (continued)

The following information is presented for pension plans where the projected benefit obligation and the accumulated benefit obligation as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 exceeded the fair value of plan assets (in millions):

The components of net periodic benefit expense for our employee retirement plans follow (in
millions):

The Company expects to recognize $52 million of net loss and $8 million of net prior service cost as
components of net periodic pension cost in 2010 for its defined benefit pension plans. The Company expects to recognize $15 million of net loss and $2 million of net prior service credit as components of net periodic postretirement benefit cost in
2010.

Corning uses a hypothetical yield curve and associated spot rate curve to discount the plan’s projected benefit payments. Once the
present value of projected benefit payments is calculated, the suggested discount rate is equal to the level rate that results in the same present value. The yield curve is based on actual high-quality corporate bonds across the full maturity
spectrum, which also includes private placements as well as Eurobonds that are denominated in U.S. currency. The curve is developed from yields on approximately 550-600 bonds from four grading sources, Moody’s, S&P, Fitch and the Dominion
Bond Rating Service. A bond will be included if at least half of the grades from these sources are Aa, non-callable bonds. The very highest and lowest 10th percentile yields are excluded from the curve to eliminate outliers in the bond population.

Measurement of postretirement benefit expense is based on assumptions used to value the postretirement benefit obligation at the beginning of
the year.

The discount rate at December 31, 2008 was 6.00%. At March 31, 2009 remeasurement date, the discount rate was changed to 6.25%.

The assumed rate of return was determined based on the current interest rate environment and historical market premiums relative to fixed income rates of
equities and other asset classes. Reasonableness of the results is tested using models provided by investment consultants and the plan actuaries.

Plan Assets

The Company’s overall investment strategy is to obtain sufficient return and provide adequate liquidity to
meet the benefit obligations of the pension plan. Investments are made in public securities to ensure adequate liquidity to support benefit payments. Domestic and international stocks and bonds provide diversification to the portfolio. The target
allocation for domestic equity investment is 12.5% which includes large, mid and small cap companies. The target allocation of international equities is 12.5%, which includes investments in both developed and emerging markets. The target allocation
for bond investments is 55%, which predominately includes both government and corporate bonds. Long duration fixed income assets are utilized to mitigate the sensitivity of funding ratios to changes in interest rates. The target allocation for
non-public investments in private equity and real estate is 15%, and is used to enhance returns and offer additional asset diversification. The target allocation for commodities is 5%, which provides some inflation protection to the portfolio.

bonds are subject to credit risk, such that a decline in credit ratings for the underlying companies would result in a decline in the value of the bonds. These bonds are also subject to default risk.

Currency Risk

24% of assets are valued in
non U.S. dollar denominated investments that are subject to currency fluctuations. The value of these securities will decline if the U.S. dollar increases in value relative to the value of the currencies in which these investments are denominated.



13.

Employee Retirement Plans (continued)

Liquidity Risk

13% of the securities are invested in Level 3 securities. These are long-term investments in private equity and
private real estate investments that may not mature or be sellable in the near-term without significant loss.

At December 31, 2009 and
2008, the amount of Corning common stock included in equity securities was not significant.

Cash Flow Data

We anticipate making voluntary cash contributions of approximately $230 million to our domestic and international plans in 2010.

The following reflects the gross benefit payments which are expected to be paid for the domestic and international plans and the gross amount of annual
Medicare Part D federal subsidy expected to be received (in millions):

Other Benefit Plans

We offer defined contribution plans covering employees meeting certain eligibility requirements. Total consolidated defined contribution plan expense was $50 million, $53 million and $39 million for the
years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

14.

Commitments, Contingencies, and Guarantees

The amounts of our obligations follow (in millions):

(1)

At December 31, 2009, $41 million of the $60 million was included in other accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.

(2)

Capital expenditure obligations, primarily related to our Display Technologies segment expansions, are included on our balance sheet.

(3)

At December 31, 2009, $2.0 billion was included on our balance sheet. Total debt above is stated at maturity value.

(4)

At December 31, 2009, $151 million of the $385 million represents imputed interest.

(5)

The estimate of interest payments assumes interest is paid through the date of maturity or expiration of the related debt, based upon stated rates in the respective
debt instruments.

(6)

At December 31, 2009, $16 million was included on our balance sheet related to uncertain tax positions. Of this amount, we are unable to estimate when $7 million
of that amount will become payable.



14.

Commitments, Contingencies, and Guarantees (continued)

We are required, at the time a guarantee is issued, to recognize a liability for the fair value or market value of the obligation it assumes. In the normal course of our business, we do not routinely
provide significant third-party guarantees. Generally, third-party guarantees provided by Corning are limited to certain financial guarantees, including stand-by letters of credit and performance bonds, and the incurrence of contingent liabilities
in the form of purchase price adjustments related to attainment of milestones. These guarantees have various terms, and none of these guarantees are individually significant.

We have agreed to provide a credit facility related to Dow Corning. The funding of the Dow Corning credit facility will be required only if Dow Corning is not otherwise able to meet its scheduled funding
obligations in its confirmed Bankruptcy Plan. The purchase obligations primarily represent raw material and energy-related take-or-pay contracts. We believe a significant majority of these guarantees and contingent liabilities will expire without
being funded.

Minimum rental commitments under leases outstanding at December 31, 2009 follow (in millions):






2015 and

thereafter

$54

Total rental expense was $65 million for 2009, $59 million for 2008 and $69 million for 2007.

A reconciliation of the changes in the
product warranty liability for the year ended December 31 follows (in millions):

Corning is a defendant in various lawsuits, including environmental, product-related suits, the Dow Corning and PCC matters discussed in Note 7 (Investments), and is subject to various claims that arise in the normal course of business. In
the opinion of management, the likelihood that the ultimate disposition of these matters will have a material adverse effect on Corning’s consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of operations, is remote. Other than certain
asbestos related claims, there are no other material loss contingencies related to litigation.

Corning has been named by the Environmental
Protection Agency (the Agency) under the Superfund Act, or by state governments under similar state laws, as a potentially responsible party for 21 active hazardous waste sites. Under the Superfund Act, all parties who may have contributed any waste
to a hazardous waste site, identified by the Agency, are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the Agency agrees otherwise. It is Corning’s policy to accrue for its estimated liability related to Superfund sites and other
environmental liabilities related to property owned by Corning based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants. At December 31, 2009, and December 31, 2008, Corning had accrued approximately $26
million (undiscounted) and $21 million (undiscounted), respectively, for the estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation. Based upon the information developed to date, management believes that the accrued reserve is a
reasonable estimate of the Company’s liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote.

The ability of certain subsidiaries and affiliated companies to transfer funds is limited by provisions of foreign government regulations, affiliate agreements and certain loan agreements. At
December 31, 2009, the amount of equity subject to such restrictions for consolidated subsidiaries was not significant. While this amount is legally restricted, it does not result in operational difficulties since we have generally permitted
subsidiaries to retain a majority of equity to support their growth programs.



15.

Hedging Activities

Effective
January 1, 2009, Corning adopted U.S. GAAP requirements for enhanced disclosures about derivatives. As required, we provide qualitative disclosures about objectives and strategies for using derivatives, quantitative disclosures about fair value
amounts of and gains and losses on derivative instruments, and disclosures about credit-risk related contingent features in derivative agreements. The adoption of these requirements did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
results of operation or financial condition.

Corning operates and conducts business in many foreign countries and as a result is exposed to
movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The areas in which exchange rate fluctuations affect us include:

•

Financial instruments and transactions denominated in foreign currencies, which impact earnings; and

•

The translation of net assets in foreign subsidiaries for which the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, which impact our net equity.

Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the Japanese yen, Korean won, New Taiwan dollar, and euro. We
selectively enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts with durations of generally 18 months or less to hedge our exposure to exchange rate risk on foreign source income and purchases. The hedges are scheduled to mature coincident with
the timing of the underlying foreign currency commitments and transactions. The objective of these contracts is to neutralize the impact of exchange rate movements on our operating results.

We engage in foreign currency hedging activities to reduce the risk that changes in exchange rates will adversely affect the eventual net cash flows
resulting from the sale of products to foreign customers and purchases from foreign suppliers. The hedge contracts reduce the exposure to fluctuations in exchange rate movements because the gains and losses associated with foreign currency balances
and transactions are generally offset with gains and losses of the hedge contracts. Because the impact of movements in foreign exchange rates on the value of hedge contracts offsets the related impact on the underlying items being hedged, these
financial instruments help alleviate the risk that might otherwise result from currency exchange rate fluctuations.

The following table
summarizes the notional amounts and respective fair values of Corning’s derivative financial instruments, which mature at varying dates (in millions):

Corning uses derivative instruments (forwards and options) to limit exposures to fluctuations related to certain monetary assets, monetary liabilities, and net earnings in foreign currencies. These derivative instruments are not designated
as hedging instruments for accounting purposes and, as such, are referred to as undesignated derivatives. Changes in the fair value of undesignated derivatives are recorded in current period earnings in the other income, net component, along with
the foreign currency gains and losses arising from the underlying monetary assets or liabilities in the consolidated statement of operations. The notional amount of the undesignated derivatives at each of December 31, 2009 and December 31,
2008 was $1.5 billion.



15.

Hedging Activities (continued)

The
following tables summarize the effect on the consolidated financial statements relating to Corning’s derivative financial instruments, which mature at varying dates (in millions):

(1)

Included in this amount is a loss of $8 million relating to derivatives that were de-designated by the company in the fourth quarter of 2008 for which the amounts
recorded in accumulated OCI were determined to still be probable or reasonably possible of occurring as originally forecasted.

The forward and option contracts we use in managing our foreign currency exposures contain an element of risk in that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements. However, we minimize this risk by selecting our
counterparties from a diverse group of highly-rated major domestic and international financial institutions with which we have other financial relationships. We are exposed to potential losses in the event of non-performance by these counterparties;
however, we do not expect to record any losses as a result of counterparty default. Neither we nor our counterparties are required to post collateral for these financial instruments.

The amount of ineffectiveness, related to derivatives, at December 31, 2009 was insignificant. The amount of ineffectiveness at December 31, 2008 was a loss of $19 million.

Cash Flow Hedges

Corning typically has
cash flow hedges that are comprised of foreign exchange forward and option contracts. Corning utilizes a regression analysis for the effectiveness analysis of its cash flow hedges, both prospectively and retrospectively.

Corning defers net gains and losses from cash flow hedges into accumulated other comprehensive income on the consolidated balance sheet until such time as
the hedged item impacts earnings. At that time, Corning reclassifies net gains and losses from cash flow hedges into the same line item of the consolidated statements of income where the effects of the hedged item are recorded, typically sales, cost
of sales, or royalty income. At December 31, 2009, the amount of net losses expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months was $16 million.



15.

Hedging Activities (continued)

Net
Investment in Foreign Operations

We have issued foreign currency denominated debt that has been designated as a hedge of the net
investment in foreign operations. The effective portion of the changes in fair value of the debt is reflected as a component of other accumulated comprehensive income (loss) as part of the foreign currency translation adjustment. Net losses related
to this investment included in the cumulative translation adjustment at December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, were $142 million, and $141 million, respectively.

16.

Fair Value Measurements

The Company
adopted the U.S. GAAP standards for fair value effective January 1, 2008 for all financial assets and liabilities as required. The adoption of these standards was not material to Corning’s financial statements or results of operations. The
standard defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in applying generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The standards also identify two kinds of inputs that are used
to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities: observable and unobservable. Observable inputs are based on market data or independent sources while unobservable inputs are based on the Company’s own market assumptions. Once inputs have
been characterized, the inputs are prioritized into one of three broad levels (provided in the table below) used to measure fair value.

The
standard applies whenever an entity is measuring fair value under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurement and requires the use of observable market data when available. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the
Company did not have any financial assets or liabilities that were measured using unobservable (or Level 3) inputs.

The following tables
provide fair value measurement information for the Company’s major categories of financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis (in millions):

(1)

Derivative assets and liabilities include foreign exchange contracts which are measured using observable quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities.

(2)

Short-term investments are measured using observable quoted prices for similar assets.

(1)

Derivative assets and liabilities include foreign exchange contracts that are measured using observable quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities.

(2)

Short-term investments are measured using observable quoted prices for similar assets.

Net of tax effect of $(18) million in 2009, $9 million in 2008 and zero tax effect of 2007.

(4)

Net of tax effect of $(7) million in 2009, $246 million in 2008, and $(8) million in 2007.

(5)

Net of tax effect of $(19) million in 2009, $4 million in 2008 and zero tax effect for 2007.



18.

Earnings Per Common Share

Basic
earnings per common share is computed by dividing income attributable to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per common share assumes the issuance of common shares for all
potentially dilutive securities outstanding.

The reconciliation of the amounts used to compute basic and diluted earnings per common share
from continuing operations follows (in millions, except per share amounts):

The following potential common shares were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per common share because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive. In addition, the following performance-based restricted stock awards have
been excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per common share because the number of shares ultimately issued is contingent on our performance against certain targets established for the performance period (in millions):

19.

Share-based Compensation

Stock
Compensation Plans

Corning’s share-based compensation programs include the following: employee stock options, time-based restricted
stock and stock units, performance-based restricted stock and restricted stock units, and the Worldwide Employee Share Purchase Plan (WESPP). At December 31, 2009, our stock compensation programs were in accordance with the 2005 Employee Equity
Participation Program, as amended, and the 2003 Equity Plan for Non-Employee Directors, as amended. Any ungranted shares from prior years will be available for grant in the current year. Any remaining shares available for grant, but not yet granted,
may be carried over and used in the following year. At December 31, 2009, there were approximately 59 million shares available for grant.



19.

Share-based Compensation (continued)

For share-based payment grants on or after December 1, 2005, the Company estimated the fair value of such grants using a lattice-based option valuation model. Prior to December 1, 2005, the Company estimated the fair value of
share-based payment awards using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.

The fair value of awards granted subsequent to January 1, 2006
that are expected to ultimately vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods. The number of options expected to vest equals the total options granted less an estimation of the number of forfeitures expected to occur prior to
vesting. The forfeiture rate is calculated based on 15 years of historical data and is adjusted if actual forfeitures differ significantly from the original estimates. The effect of any change in estimated forfeitures would be recognized through a
cumulative catch-up adjustment that would be included in compensation cost in the period of the change in estimate.

Total share-based
compensation cost of $127 million, $118 million, and $138 million was disclosed in operating activities on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Stock Options

Our stock option plans
provide non-qualified and incentive stock options to purchase authorized but unissued or treasury shares at the market price on the grant date and generally become exercisable in installments from one to five years from the grant date. The maximum
term of non-qualified and incentive stock options is 10 years from the grant date.

The following table summarizes information concerning
options outstanding including the related transactions under the options plans for the year ended December 31, 2009:

The aggregate intrinsic value (market value of stock less option exercise price) in the preceding table represents the total pretax intrinsic value, based on the Company’s closing stock price on December 31, 2009, which would have
been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options as of that date. The total number of in-the-money options exercisable on December 31, 2009, was approximately 35 million.

The weighted-average grant-date fair value for options granted for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $4.47, $7.39, and $9.65,
respectively. The total fair value of options that vested during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 was approximately $57 million, $68 million, and $58 million, respectively. Compensation cost related to stock options for the
years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, was approximately $65 million, $67 million, and $69 million, respectively.

As of
December 31, 2009, there was approximately $33 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options granted under the Plan. The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2 years.

Proceeds received from the exercise of stock options were $24 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, which were included in financing activities
on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The total intrinsic value of options exercised for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 was approximately $24 million, $126 million, and $221 million, respectively, which
is currently deductible for tax purposes. Refer to Note 6 (Income Taxes) to the Consolidated Financial Statements.



19.

Share-based Compensation (continued)

An
award is considered vested when the employee’s retention of the award is no longer contingent on providing subsequent service (the “non-substantive vesting period approach”). Prior to December 1, 2008, the terms and conditions of
Corning’s stock option agreement specified that employees continue to vest in option awards after retirement without providing any additional services. For awards granted from January 1, 2006 to December 1, 2008, compensation cost was
recognized immediately for awards granted to retirement eligible employees or over the period from the grant date to the date retirement eligibility is achieved, if that is expected to occur during the stated or nominal vesting period. Corning
amended the terms and conditions of its stock option agreement on December 1, 2008 for awards to retirement eligible employees. Awards are earned ratably each month that the employee provides service over the twelve months following the grant
date, and the related compensation expense is recognized over this twelve month service period or over the period from the grant date to the date of retirement eligibility for employees that become age 55 during the vesting period.

The lattice-based valuation model, used to estimate the fair values of option and restricted stock grants after November 30, 2005, incorporates the
assumptions (including ranges of assumptions) noted in the table below. Expected volatility is based on the blended short-term volatility (the arithmetic average of the implied volatility and the short-term historical volatility), long-term
historical volatility of Corning’s stock, and other factors.

Corning also uses historical data as well as forward looking explanatory
variables, to estimate future option exercises and employee termination within the valuation model. Separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. The expected time to
exercise of options granted is derived using a regression model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The range given below results from certain groups of employees exhibiting different behavior. The
risk-free rates used in the lattice model are derived from the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect from the grant date to the option’s expiration date. Since period-by-period calculations are employed in the lattice model, Corning uses
risk-free rates that apply from one period to the next, generally quarter to quarter. Such rates are typically referred to as “forward” rates. Being essentially marginal rates, forward rates both vary during the contractual term of the
option and exhibit greater variation than the yield curve from which they are derived.

The following inputs for the lattice-based valuation
model were used for option grants under our Stock Option Plans for the years presented:

Incentive Stock Plans

The Corning Incentive Stock Plan permits stock and stock
unit grants, either determined by specific performance goals or issued directly, in most instances, subject to the possibility of forfeiture and without cash consideration. Restricted stock and stock units under the Incentive Stock Plan are
generally granted at-the-money, contingently vest over a period of generally 1 to 10 years, and generally have contractual lives of 1 to 10 years.

The fair value of each restricted stock grant or restricted stock unit awarded under the Incentive Stock Plans was estimated on the date of grant for performance based grants assuming that performance goals will be achieved. The expected
term for grants under the Incentive Stock Plans is generally 1 to 10 years.

Time-Based Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units:

Time-based restricted stock and restricted stock units are issued by the Company on a discretionary basis, and are payable in shares of the
Company’s common stock upon vesting. The fair value is based on the market price of the Company’s stock on the grant date. Compensation cost is recognized over the requisite vesting period and adjusted for actual forfeitures before
vesting.



19.

Share-based Compensation (continued)

The following table represents a summary of the status of the Company’s nonvested time-based restricted stock and restricted stock units as of December 31, 2008, and changes during the year ended December 31, 2009:

As of December 31, 2009, there was approximately $46 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested time-based restricted stock and restricted stock units compensation arrangements granted under the Plan. The cost is
expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.0 years. The total fair value of time-based restricted stock that vested during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 was approximately $5 million, $5 million, and $1
million, respectively. Compensation cost related to time-based restricted stock and restricted stock units was approximately $14 million, $11 million, and $5 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Performance-Based Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units:

Performance-based restricted stock and restricted stock units are earned upon the achievement of certain targets, and are payable in shares of the Company’s common stock upon vesting typically over a
three-year period. The fair value is based on the market price of the Company’s stock on the grant date and assumes that the target payout level will be achieved. Compensation cost is recognized over the requisite vesting period and adjusted
for actual forfeitures before vesting. During the performance period, compensation cost may be adjusted based on changes in the expected outcome of the performance-related target.

The following table represents a summary of the status of the Company’s nonvested performance-based restricted stock and restricted stock units as of December 31, 2008, and changes during the
year ended December 31, 2009:

As of December 31, 2009, there was approximately $25 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested performance-based restricted stock and restricted stock unit compensation arrangements granted under the Plan. The cost
is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2 years. The total fair value of performance-based restricted stock that vested during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, was approximately $50 million, $49 million,
and $27 million, respectively. Compensation cost related to performance-based restricted stock and restricted stock units was approximately $44 million, $35 million, and $60 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively.

Worldwide Employee Share Purchase Plan

In addition to the Stock Option Plan and Incentive Stock Plans, we have a Worldwide Employee Share Purchase Plan (WESPP). Under the WESPP, substantially all employees can elect to have up to 10% of their
annual wages withheld to purchase our common stock. The purchase price of the stock is 85% of the end-of-quarter closing market price. Compensation cost related to the WESPP for all periods presented is immaterial.



20.

Operating Segments

Effective
January 1, 2008, Corning changed its internal reporting structure to better reflect the Company’s focus on new business development and later-stage research projects and to provide more transparency on our Specialty Materials operating
segment. As a result, our segment reporting includes the following changes which are in accordance with the requirements for disclosures about segments:

•

We have provided separate financial information for the Specialty Materials operating segment. This operating segment was previously included in All
Other.

•

Certain later-stage development projects, such as advanced flow reactors and green lasers, meet the criteria for operating segments and are included in
All Other. Spending for these projects was previously part of Exploratory Research and was reported in the reconciliation of reportable segment net income to total net income.

•

Certain other new product lines meet the criteria for operating segments and are included in All Other. Spending related to these businesses was
previously included in our Life Sciences and Display Technologies operating segments.

Our reportable operating segments are
now as follows:

•

Display Technologies - manufactures liquid crystal display glass for flat panel displays.

•

Telecommunications - manufactures optical fiber and cable and hardware and equipment components for the telecommunications industry.

•

Environmental Technologies - manufactures ceramic substrates and filters for automotive and diesel applications. This reportable operating segment is
an aggregation of our Automotive and Diesel operating segments as these two segments share similar economic characteristics, products, customer types, production processes and distribution methods.

•

Specialty Materials - manufactures products that provide more than 150 material formulations for glass, glass ceramics and fluoride crystals to meet
demand for unique customer needs.

•

Life Sciences - manufactures glass and plastic consumables for scientific applications.

All other operating segments that do not meet the quantitative threshold for separate reporting have been grouped as “All Other.” This group is
primarily comprised of development projects and results for new product lines.

We prepared the financial results for our reportable segments
on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information to assist in making internal operating decisions. We included the earnings of equity affiliates that are closely associated with our operating
segments in the respective segment’s net income. We have allocated certain common expenses among segments differently than we would for stand-alone financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Segment net income may not be
consistent with measures used by other companies. The accounting policies of our reportable segments are the same as those applied in the consolidated financial statements.

Effective January 1, 2009, we began providing U.S. tax expense (or benefit) on U.S. earnings (losses) due to the change in our conclusion about the realizability of our U.S. deferred tax assets in
2008. As a result of the change in our tax position, we adjusted the allocation of taxes to our operating segments in 2009 to reflect this difference. The impact of this change was not significant.



20.

Operating Segments (continued)

The
following provides historical segment information as described above:

Segment Information

(in millions)

(1)

Depreciation expense for Corning’s reportable segments includes an allocation of depreciation of corporate property not specifically identifiable to a segment.

(2)

Research, development, and engineering expenses include direct project spending that is identifiable to a segment.

(3)

In 2008, restructuring, impairment and other charges and (credits) include a charge of $22 million that was primarily comprised of severance costs for a restructuring
plan in the Telecommunications segment.

(4)

In 2007, equity in earnings of affiliated companies, included $40 million related to impairments and other charges and credits for Samsung Corning in the All Other
segment.

(5)

Many of Corning’s administrative and staff functions are performed on a centralized basis. Where practicable, Corning charges these expenses to segments based upon
the extent to which each business uses a centralized function. Other staff functions, such as corporate finance, human resources and legal are allocated to segments, primarily as a percentage of sales. In 2008, net income (loss) included a $12
million litigation settlement in the Display Technologies segment and a $14 million loss on the sale of a business in the All Other segment. In 2007, net income (loss) of the Telecommunications segment included a $19 million gain on the sale of the
European submarine cabling business.

(6)

Segment assets include inventory, accounts receivable, property and associated equity companies and cost investments.



20.

Operating Segments (continued)

For the
year ended December 31, 2009, the following number of customers, which individually accounted for 10% or more of each segment’s sales, represented the following concentration of segment sales:

•

In the Display Technologies segment, three customers accounted for 62% of total segment sales.

•

In the Telecommunications segment, one customer accounted for 12% of total segment sales.

•

In the Environmental Technologies segment, three customers accounted for 85% of total segment sales.

•

In the Specialty Materials segment, there were no customers that accounted for 10% of segment sales.

•

In the Life Sciences segment, two customers accounted for 45% of segment sales.

A significant amount of specialized manufacturing capacity for our Display Technologies segment is concentrated in Asia. It is at least reasonably possible
that the use of a facility located outside of an entity’s home country could be disrupted. Due to the specialized nature of the assets, it would not be possible to find replacement capacity quickly. Accordingly, loss of these facilities could
produce a near-term severe impact to our display business and the Company as a whole.

A reconciliation of reportable segment net income
(loss) to consolidated net income (loss) follows (in millions):

(1)

Net financing costs include interest expense, interest income, and interest costs and investment gains and losses associated with benefit plans.

(2)

Equity in earnings of affiliated companies, net of impairments and taxes is primarily equity in earnings of Dow Corning Corporation, which includes the following items:

•

In 2009, a $29 million credit primarily for our share of excess foreign tax credits from foreign dividends and a $29 million charge for our share of restructuring
charges.

•

In 2008, an $18 million charge representing our share of an other-than-temporary impairment of auction rate securities.

(3)

In 2009, Corning recorded charges of $20 million to adjust the asbestos liability for the change in value of certain components of the amended PCC Plan and the
estimated liability for non-PCC asbestos claims. In 2008, Corning reduced its liability for asbestos litigation by $327 million as a result of the increase in the likelihood of a settlement under recently proposed terms and a corresponding decrease
in the likelihood of a settlement under terms established in 2003. Also, in 2008, Corning recorded a credit of $13 million to adjust the asbestos liability for the change in value of certain components of the Amended PCC Plan. In 2007, Corning
recorded a charge of $185 million for the change in the estimated fair value of the components of the asbestos litigation liability under the terms of the 2003 plan.

(4)

Other corporate items include the tax impact of the unallocated amounts and the following significant items:

•

In 2009, Corning recorded $10 million of additional valuation allowance due to a change in judgment about the realizability of U.S. and United Kingdom deferred tax
assets in future years; a $41 million tax benefit to reflect a deferred tax asset associated with Medicare Part D subsidies; a $27 million U.S. tax credit for research and experimentation expenses incurred from 2005 to 2008; and $98 million of
restructuring charges.

•

In 2008, Corning released $2.5 billion of valuation allowances including $2.4 billion due to sustained profitability and positive future earnings projections for U.S.
entities and $115 million from a change in estimate regarding 2008 U.S. taxable income. Also, we recorded a $40 million gain related to a favorable tax settlement with the Canadian Revenue Agency and net losses of $53 million on certain
available-for-sale securities included in cash and short-term investments.

•

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and

Board
of Directors of

Dow Corning Corporation

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows and equity present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Dow Corning Corporation and its
subsidiaries at December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Note 2 to
the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of computing depreciation effective January 1, 2008. In addition, also as discussed in Note 2, the Company changed the presentation of ownership interests in subsidiaries
held by parties other than the parent to a separate component of equity.

NOTE 1 –
BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

Dow Corning Corporation (“Dow Corning”) was incorporated in 1943 by
Corning Glass Works, now Corning Incorporated (“Corning”) and The Dow Chemical Company (“Dow Chemical”) for the purpose of developing and producing polymers and other materials based on silicon chemistry. Dow Corning operates in
various countries around the world through numerous wholly owned or majority owned subsidiary corporations (hereinafter, the consolidated operations of Dow Corning and its subsidiaries may be referred to as the “Company”).

Dow Corning built its business based on silicon chemistry. Silicon is one of the most abundant elements in the world. Most of Dow
Corning’s products are based on polymers known as silicones, which have a silicon-oxygen-silicon backbone. Through various chemical processes, Dow Corning manufactures silicones that have an extremely wide variety of characteristics, in forms
ranging from fluids, gels, greases and elastomeric materials to resins and other rigid materials. Silicones combine the temperature and chemical resistance of glass with the versatility of plastics. Regardless of form or application, silicones
generally possess such qualities as electrical resistance, resistance to extreme temperatures, resistance to deterioration from aging, water repellency, lubricating characteristics, relative chemical and physiological inertness and resistance to
ultraviolet radiation.

The Company engages primarily in the discovery, development, manufacturing, marketing and distribution
of silicon-based materials and offers related services. Since its inception, Dow Corning has been engaged in a continuous program of basic and applied research on silicon-based materials to develop new products and processes, to improve and refine
existing products and processes and to develop new applications for existing products. The Company manufactures over 7,000 products and serves approximately 25,000 customers worldwide, with no single customer accounting for more than five percent of
the Company’s sales in any of the past three years. Principal United States manufacturing plants are located in Kentucky and Michigan. Principal foreign manufacturing plants are located in Belgium, China, France, Germany, Japan, South Korea and
the United Kingdom. The Company operates research and development facilities and/or technical service centers in the United States, Belgium, Brazil, China, Germany, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the United Kingdom.

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. Management has evaluated subsequent events
through February 8, 2010, the date the financial statements were available to be issued. Certain prior year items have been reclassified to conform to the 2009 presentation.

Bankruptcy Proceedings

On May 15, 1995, the company voluntarily
filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, Northern Division in order to resolve the Company’s breast implant liabilities and related matters. The
Company emerged from its Chapter 11 proceedings on June 1, 2004. See Note 14 for further information.

NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Dow Corning and all of its wholly owned and majority owned
domestic and foreign subsidiaries. The Company’s interests in 20% to 50% owned subsidiaries are carried on the equity basis and are included in “Other Assets - Other” in the consolidated balance sheets. Intercompany transactions and
balances have been eliminated in consolidation. In accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) guidance related to consolidations the Company’s policy is to include the accounts of entities in which the Company
holds a controlling interest based on exposure to economic risks and potential rewards (variable interests), and for which it is the primary beneficiary, in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Use of Estimates

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.



NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

(Continued)

Fair Value Measurements

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset
or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Level 1 inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. Level 2 inputs are quoted prices, not included in Level 1,
that are either directly or indirectly observable, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in inactive markets. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs and
include the Company’s assumptions that would be used by market participants.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of ninety days or less. The carrying amounts for cash
equivalents approximate their fair values. Cash equivalents are measured using Level 1 inputs as defined by FASB guidance related to fair value measurements and disclosures.

Inventories

The value of inventories is determined using lower of cost or
market as the basis. Produced goods are valued using a first-in, first-out cost flow methodology, while purchased materials and supplies are valued using an average cost flow methodology. See Note 6 for further information.

Property and Depreciation

Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less any impairment and are depreciated over estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. The Company periodically monitors actual experience to determine whether events and
circumstances have occurred that may warrant revision of the estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment. Engineering and other costs directly related to the construction of property, plant and equipment are capitalized as construction
in progress until construction is complete and such property, plant and equipment is ready and available to perform its specifically assigned function. Upon retirement or other disposal, the asset cost and related accumulated depreciation are
removed from the accounts and the net amount, less any proceeds, is charged or credited to income. If an asset is determined to be impaired, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its fair value and the difference is charged to income in the
period incurred.

Effective January 1, 2008, the Company changed its deprecation method for its property, plant and
equipment from accelerated methods to straight-line. The change was accounted for as a change in estimate effected by a change in accounting principle and applied prospectively in accordance with FASB guidance related to accounting changes and error
corrections. The straight-line method is preferable because it will better allocate the cost of assets to the pattern of consumption due to technological advances and improved maintenance systems and processes which have occurred over time. The
change increased pre-tax income by $43.0 and increased net income by $27.1 for the year ended December 31, 2008.

Effective October 1, 2008, the Company changed the useful lives of certain property, plant and equipment as a result of the Company’s historical experience which demonstrated longer useful lives for certain classes of assets. The
change was accounted for as a change in estimate and applied prospectively in accordance with FASB guidance related to accounting changes and error corrections. The effect of the change to depreciation expense increased pre-tax income by $21.7 and
increased net income by $13.7 for the year ended December 31, 2008.

The Company capitalizes the costs of internal-use
software in accordance with FASB guidance related to intangibles. Amounts capitalized during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 were $11.0 and $9.7, respectively. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, unamortized software costs were
$10.7 and $10.2, respectively. Amortization expense of $10.5, $10.5 and $7.4 were recognized during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, related to such capitalized software costs.

Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged against income as incurred. Expenditures that significantly increase asset value,
extend useful asset lives or adapt property to a new or different use are capitalized.

The Company follows the policy of
capitalizing interest as a component of the cost of capital assets constructed for its own use. See Note 9 for further information.



NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

(Continued)

The Company accounts for asset retirement obligations in accordance with FASB guidance. This guidance requires companies to record an asset
and related liability for the costs associated with the retirement of long-lived tangible assets when a legal liability to retire the assets exists. These obligations may result from acquisition, construction, or the normal operation of a long-lived
asset. The Company records asset retirement obligations at fair value in the period in which they are incurred. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company had noncurrent liabilities of $8.7 and $7.5, respectively, for asset retirement
obligations primarily related to landfill closure costs recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as “Other noncurrent liabilities.”

In addition, the Company has identified conditional asset retirement obligations, such as for the removal of asbestos and records such obligations when there are plans in place to undertake major
renovations or plans to exit a facility. Due to the nature of the Company’s operations, the Company believes that there is an indeterminate settlement date for the existing conditional asset retirement obligations as the range of time over
which the Company may settle the obligation is unknown or cannot be estimated. Therefore, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the liability.

Marketable Securities

The Company accounts for investments in debt and
equity securities in conformity with FASB guidance. This guidance requires the use of fair value accounting for trading or available for sale securities, while retaining the use of the amortized cost method for investments in debt securities that
the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity. Investments in debt and equity securities are included in “Marketable securities” in the consolidated balance sheets. All such investments are considered to be available
for sale. Because the Company does not intend to sell, nor is it likely to be forced to sell, its available-for-sale securities, declines in fair value are considered temporary. In addition, the Company regularly evaluates available evidence to
determine if it will be able to recover the cost of these securities. If the Company is unable to recover the cost of the securities, an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred and credit losses are charged to income in the period incurred.
Temporary declines in the fair value of investments are included in “Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss).” For the purpose of computing realized gain or loss on the disposition of investments, the specific identification method
is used. The Company’s policy is to purchase investment grade securities. See Note 5 for further information.

Credit
Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist
principally of cash, investments, derivative financial instruments and trade receivables. The Company’s policies limit the amount of credit exposure to any single counterparty for cash and investments. The Company uses major financial
institutions with high credit ratings to engage in transactions involving investments and derivative instruments. The Company minimizes credit risk in its receivables from customers through its sale of products to a wide variety of customers and
markets in locations throughout the world. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not require collateral. The Company maintains reserves for potential credit losses, and historically such losses have been
within expectations.

Intangibles

Intangible assets of the Company include goodwill, patents and licenses and other assets acquired by the Company that are separable and measurable apart from goodwill. Goodwill, representing the excess of
cost over the fair value of net assets of businesses acquired, is tested at least annually for impairment in accordance with FASB guidance for accounting for goodwill and intangibles. The Company completed its tests for impairment of goodwill during
the three month period ended September 30, 2009. Other intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. See Note 10 for further information.

Revenue

The Company
recognizes revenue only when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the price to the customer is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Revenue is recognized when
title and risk of loss transfer to the customer for products and as work is performed for professional services. Amounts billed to a customer in a sale transaction related to shipping costs are classified as revenue. The Company reduces revenue for
product returns, allowances and price discounts. Amounts billed to customers in excess of amounts recognized as revenue are reported as deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheets. See Note 12 for further information. The Company’s
revenue recognition policies comply with FASB guidance.



NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

(Continued)

Shipping Costs

Shipping
costs are primarily comprised of payments to third party shippers. The Company records shipping costs incurred as a component of “Cost of sales” in the consolidated statements of income. Shipping costs were $138.3, $151.0 and $134.3 for
the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Research and Development Costs

Research and development costs are charged to operations when incurred and are included in “Cost of sales” in the consolidated
statements of income. These costs are comprised of primarily labor costs, outside services and depreciation. Research and development costs were $216.6, $227.6 and $229.5 for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes in conformity with the provisions of FASB guidance. This guidance requires a company to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been
recognized in a company’s financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and
liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets when appropriate to reflect the expected future tax benefits to be
realized. In determining the appropriate valuation allowance, certain judgments are made relating to recoverability of deferred tax assets, use of tax loss carryforwards, level of expected future taxable income and available tax planning strategies.
These judgments are routinely reviewed by management. Further, the Company recognizes tax liabilities stemming from uncertain tax positions in accordance with FASB guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. At December 31, 2009
and 2008, the Company had net deferred tax asset balances of $943.6 and $995.4, respectively, after valuation allowances of $85.9 and $104.7, respectively. See Note 7 for further information.

Currency Translation

The
value of the U.S. dollar fluctuates against foreign currencies. Because the Company conducts business in many countries, these fluctuations affect the Company’s consolidated financial position and results of operations. The Company accounts for
these fluctuations in accordance with FASB guidance related to foreign currency matters.

Subsidiaries in Europe, Japan and
China translate their assets and liabilities, stated in their functional currency, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of the current period. The resulting gains or losses are reflected in “Cumulative translation
adjustment” in the stockholders’ equity section of the consolidated balance sheets. Changes in the functional currency value of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognized in “Other nonoperating
income, net” in the consolidated statements of income. The revenues and expenses of these non-U.S. subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates that prevailed during the period. Therefore, the reported U.S. dollar
results included in the consolidated statements of income fluctuate from period to period, depending on the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies.

For non-U.S. subsidiaries outside of Europe, Japan and China, where the U.S. dollar is the functional currency, inventories, property, plant and equipment and other non-monetary assets, together with
their related elements of expense, are translated at historical rates of exchange. All other assets and liabilities are translated at current exchange rates. All other revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates. Translation gains
and losses for these subsidiaries are recognized in “Other nonoperating income, net” in the consolidated statements of income.



NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

(Continued)

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company recognizes all derivatives as “Other current assets,” “Other noncurrent assets,” “Other current liabilities,” or “Other noncurrent liabilities” in the consolidated balance sheets at fair
value. On the date the derivative instrument is entered into, if the Company is designating the instrument as a hedge, the Company designates the derivative as either (1) a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized
asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment (fair value hedge), (2) a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows of a forecasted transaction (cash flow hedge), or (3) a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net
investment in a foreign operation. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as and meets all the required criteria for a fair value hedge, along with the gain or loss on the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the
hedged risk are recorded in current period earnings. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as and meets all the required criteria for a cash flow hedge are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified
into earnings as the underlying hedged item affects earnings. Changes in the fair value of a derivative or non-derivative that is designated as and meets all the required criteria for a hedge of a net investment are recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive income. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is not designated as a hedge are recorded immediately in earnings. Cash flows from derivatives designated as hedges are classified in the same category of the consolidated
statements of cash flows as the items being hedged. Cash flows from derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are classified in the investing activities section of the consolidated statements of cash flows.

Where an instrument is designated as a hedge, the Company formally documents all relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged
items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. This process includes relating all derivatives that are designated as fair value or cash flow hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the
balance sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions. The Company also formally assesses both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether each derivative is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values
or cash flows of the hedged item. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge, or if a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge, the Company will discontinue hedge accounting with respect to that derivative
prospectively. See Note 8 for further information.

Litigation

The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims arising out of the normal course of business. The Company routinely assesses the
likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters, as well as ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of the reserves required, if any, for these contingencies is made after analysis of each known issue and an
analysis of historical claims experience for incurred but not reported matters. The Company expenses legal costs, including those expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency, as incurred. The Company has an active risk management
program consisting of numerous insurance policies secured from many carriers. These policies provide coverage that is utilized to mitigate the impact, if any, of certain of the legal proceedings. The required reserves may change in the future due to
new developments in each matter. See Notes 14 and 15 for further information.

Environmental Matters

The Company determines the costs of environmental remediation for its facilities, facilities formerly owned by the Company and third party
waste disposal facilities based on evaluations of current law and existing technologies. Inherent uncertainties exist in these evaluations primarily due to unknown conditions, changing governmental regulations and legal standards regarding liability
and evolving technologies. The Company records a charge to earnings for environmental matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the Company’s costs can be reasonably estimated. The recorded liabilities are adjusted
periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical or legal information becomes available. See Note 15 for further information.

New Accounting Standards

In December 2009, the FASB issued guidance related to the accounting and
disclosure requirements for transfers of financial assets. This guidance requires greater transparency and additional disclosures for transfers of financial assets and the entity’s continuing involvement with them. The guidance also changes the
requirements for derecognizing the transferred assets and eliminates the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity. The guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2009. The Company
is in the process of assessing the impact of the adoption of this guidance on the Company’s financial position and results of operations.



NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

(Continued)

In December 2009, the FASB issued guidance related to the accounting and disclosure requirements for the consolidation of variable interest
entities (“VIEs”). This guidance requires an enterprise to perform a qualitative analysis on a continual basis to determine whether or not it must consolidate a VIE. Additionally, the guidance requires enhanced disclosures about an
enterprise’s involvement with VIEs as well as disclosure of any significant assumptions and judgments used to determine whether or not to consolidate a VIE. The guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning
after November 15, 2009. The Company is in the process of assessing the impact of the adoption of this guidance on the Company’s financial position and results of operations.

In October 2009, the FASB issued new guidance related to revenue recognition for multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements expanding the
disclosure requirements related to such arrangements. The guidance is effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010. The adoption is not expected to impact the
Company’s financial position and results of operations.

In July 2009, the FASB issued the Accounting Standards
Codification and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. The FASB named the Codification the single authoritative source of generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The Company adopted the Codification
effective September 1, 2009. The adoption did not impact the Company’s financial position and results of operations.

In May 2009, the FASB issued new guidance for subsequent events disclosure. This guidance establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements
are issued. The Company adopted the new guidance effective April 1, 2009. The adoption did not impact the Company’s financial position and results of operations. See Note 1 “Business and Basis of Presentation.”

In April 2009, the FASB issued new guidance for interim disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments. This guidance requires
summarized disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments for interim reporting periods. The Company adopted the new guidance effective April 1, 2009. The adoption did not impact the Company’s financial position and results of
operations.

In April 2009, the FASB issued new guidance for recognition and presentation of other-than-temporary impairments.
This guidance amends other-than-temporary impairment guidance for debt securities to make the guidance more operational and to improve the presentation and disclosure of other-than-temporary impairments on debt and equity securities in the financial
statements. The Company adopted the new guidance effective April 1, 2009. The adoption did not impact the Company’s financial position and results of operations. See Note 5 “Investments.”

In April 2009, the FASB issued new guidance for determining the fair value when the level of market activity has significantly decreased and
for identifying transactions that are not orderly. The Company adopted the new guidance effective April 1, 2009. The adoption did not impact the Company’s financial position and results of operations. See Note 5 “Investments.”

In December 2008, the FASB issued new guidance for employers’ disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets to
require expanded disclosures. The guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2009. The Company adopted the new guidance effective December 31, 2009. The adoption did not impact the
Company’s financial position and results of operations.

In April 2008, the FASB issued new guidance that amended the
assumptions to be used by the Company when determining the useful lives of intangible assets. The Company adopted the guidance effective January 1, 2009. The adoption did not impact the Company’s financial position and results of
operations.

In March 2008, the FASB issued new guidance which requires additional disclosures about derivative instruments
and hedging activities. The Company adopted the guidance effective January 1, 2009. The adoption did not impact the Company’s financial position and results of operations. See Note 8 “Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities.”

In February 2008, the FASB issued new guidance deferring the effective date of new guidance for fair value
measurements for nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are not disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis. The new guidance was effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. The Company adopted the guidance January 1,
2009. The adoption did not impact the Company’s financial position and results of operations.

In December 2007, the FASB
issued new guidance for noncontrolling interests. This guidance changes the classification of ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent to a separate component of equity. The guidance requires retrospective adoption
of the presentation and disclosure requirements for existing noncontrolling interests. The Company adopted the guidance effective January 1, 2009. The adoption did not impact the Company’s financial position and results of operations.



NOTE 3 – RESTRUCTURING

In February 2009, in response to current economic challenges, Dow Corning announced it would reduce its workforce through reduction-in-force
programs and site closures globally. These actions were part of broader cost-saving measures taken by the Company, including efforts to maximize operational efficiency and tightly controlling expenses. The Company’s restructuring liability is
expected to be settled by December 31, 2010. The Company recorded restructuring expenses of $101.6 during the year ended December 31, 2009. This amount was comprised of approximately $95.6 for employee-related costs associated with ongoing
benefit arrangements and one-time termination benefits and $6.0 for lease terminations, asset disposals and demolitions. No further material costs are expected.

The following table summarizes activities related to restructuring for the year ended December 31, 2009:

NOTE 4 – ACQUISITIONS OF BUSINESS INTERESTS

On November 5, 2009, the Company acquired 100% of the equity of Globe Metais Industria e Comercio S.A. (“Metais”), a silicon
metal producer with manufacturing operations in Brazil. Concurrently, the Company contributed cash in exchange for 49% of the equity interests of Globe Metallurgical Inc.’s silicon manufacturing operation, WVA Manufacturing LLC
(“WVA”), a silicon metal producer with manufacturing operations in West Virginia. The Company paid approximately $75.0 in cash in exchange for the stock of Metais and $100.0 in cash for the equity interests in WVA. Direct costs of the
acquisition were approximately $3.6 related to legal and advisory services. The Company believes that these transactions enhance both the security of supply and cost effectiveness of a key raw material.

The acquisition of the controlling interest of Metais was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with FASB guidance. The
balance sheet and results of operations of Metais were included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2009. Because the Company does not hold a controlling interest in WVA, the investment was accounted for
by the equity method of accounting for investments in accordance with FASB guidance and included in “Other” in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2009. The results of operations of Metais and the equity
results of WVA were not material to the consolidated statement of income.

As of December 31, 2009, determination of the
fair value of the assets and liabilities at the acquisition date for the Metais business combination was not complete. Determining the fair values of certain of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities required the Company to exercise significant
judgment. Additional information including the valuation of forestry assets, the final appraisal of property, plant and equipment and valuation of certain intangible assets, as well as a complete evaluation of contingent liabilities is expected to
be completed during the first several months of 2010.

The Company’s initial estimates resulted in a fair value of assets
and liabilities which exceeded the purchase price for Metais by approximately $14.8. This amount has been recorded as a bargain purchase gain in “Other nonoperating (expense) income, net” of the consolidated statement of income as of
December 31, 2009. The gain was primarily related to access to a stable and favorably priced supply of electricity under a long-term contract, the relative condition of property, plant and equipment in relation to replacement cost and the
benefit of a net operating loss carryforward that the Company expects to be able to utilize based on its strategic plans for this business. Final determinations of the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed may result in adjustments
to the values presented below and a corresponding adjustment to the bargain purchase gain recorded as of December 31, 2009.



NOTE 4 – ACQUISITIONS OF BUSINESS INTERESTS

(Continued)

The fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed on November 5, 2009 related to Metais were as follows:

NOTE 5 – INVESTMENTS

Investments reflected in “Other current assets” and “Marketable securities” in the consolidated balance sheets at
December 31, 2009 and 2008 were $1,075.5 and $1,109.0, respectively. These investments have been classified as available for sale.

As of December 31, 2009, all debt securities with fair value less than cost have been in an unrealized loss position for 12 months or more. The cost, gross unrealized gains, gross unrealized losses
and fair value of the investments as of December 31 were as follows:



NOTE 5 – INVESTMENTS

(Continued)

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the
fair value measurement. The classifications as of the balance sheet dates as of December 31 were as follows:

The changes in fair value of Level 3 assets as of
December 31 were as follows:

Level 3 available for sale securities with a par value of $132.9 were sold or redeemed during the year ended
December 31, 2009. These sales and redemptions related to securities backed by student loans and auction rate preferred securities. The sales or redemptions were at a weighted average of 99% of par.

The contractual maturities of the debt securities, excluding auction rate preferred securities, as of December 31 were as follows:

Auction Rate Securities

As of December 31, 2009, the Company held auction rate securities of $1,062.0 included in the consolidated balance sheet. These
securities consisted principally of revenue bonds backed by student loans that are guaranteed by the U. S. Government, revenue bonds backed by insured student loans and bundled preferred equity securities.

Historically, the cost of the auction rate securities approximated fair value. The Company had experienced a long history of successful
auctions. However, in mid-February 2008, auctions began to fail and continued to fail for virtually all of these securities because there were an insufficient number of buy bids. Upon failure of an auction, the Company is required to hold the
security until the next auction date at a contractually predetermined interest rate generally higher than the risk-free treasury rate. A failed auction reduces the immediate liquidity available to the Company, since there are currently no secondary
markets for the auction rate securities held by the Company. Since the Company does not know when a market will return or develop, securities valued at $1,062.0 were classified as noncurrent assets as of December 31, 2009. Management believes
the Company has sufficient sources of liquidity to fund its operations, capital expenditure plan, breast implant settlement liabilities and shareholder dividends through cash on hand, cash generated by operations or access to credit markets.



NOTE 5 – INVESTMENTS

(Continued)

Due to the absence of observable prices in an active market for the same or similar securities, the fair value of $1,062.0 of the securities
was based on a discounted cash flow analysis using forecasts of future cash flows and interest rates. The data used for the forecasts included benchmark interest rates such as LIBOR and U.S. Treasury rates, commercial paper rates and other interest
rate indices reflecting market required rates of return. The valuation considered variable coupon payments, the restriction in liquidity due to failed auctions, the credit risk related to each group of securities and the probability of recovery or
replacement of the auction rate securities market. Other considerations also included the nature of the collateralizations, guarantees, contractual structures of the securities and issuers’ indication of intent to redeem. In accordance with
fair value measurement guidance, the auction rate securities were included in Level 3 at December 31, 2009 because certain of the cash flow model inputs were not readily observable.

Auction Rate Securities backed by Student Loans

The Company held auction
rate securities backed by student loans valued at $994.8 included in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2009. The securities had the following credit ratings: AAA – 88%, A – 5%, A- – 5% and CCC – 2%. These
auction rate securities were variable rate debt instruments with underlying securities that have contractual maturities that range from 14 to 33 years and whose interest rates are reset every 28 to 35 days through an auction process. Since the
auctions have failed, default interest rates are applicable and each issuer has continued to pay required interest payments. Because the fair value of these securities was lower than the cost, an unrealized loss of $8.8, net of the noncontrolling
interests’ share of $2.6, was recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” in the year ended December 31, 2009.

Auction Rate Preferred Securities

The Company held auction rate securities backed by preferred equity
securities valued at $67.2 included in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2009. The securities had the following ratings: A- – 10%, BB – 73% and BBB+ – 17%. The interest rates reset on these variable rate equity
instruments every 16 to 38 days through an auction process. Since the auctions have failed, default dividend allocation methods are in effect. The issuers of the underlying preferred equity securities have continued to remit dividends consistent
with historical practices. Because the fair value of these securities was lower than the cost, an unrealized loss of $8.0, net of the noncontrolling interests’ share of $0.8, was recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” in
the year ended December 31, 2009.

Classification of Unrealized Losses

As of December 31, 2009, the Company had no intent to sell, nor was expected to be required to sell, auction rate securities backed by
student loans and auction rate preferred securities before the anticipated recovery in market value. In determining that the unrealized losses related to these securities were not other-than-temporary, the Company considered several other factors.
These factors included the financial condition and prospects of the issuer, expected continuation of interest and dividend payments, the magnitude of losses compared with the cost of the investments, the length of time the investments have been in
an unrealized loss position and the credit rating of the security. Management believes the decline in fair value is primarily related to the current interest rate environment and market inefficiencies and not to the credit deterioration of the
individual issuers. Total unrealized losses of $16.8, net of $3.4 for the noncontrolling interests’ share, related to auction rate securities were included in “Accumulated Other comprehensive loss” in the consolidated balance sheet as
of December 31, 2009. The fair value of these securities could be subject to further adjustments in the future if indicated by either observable prices in an active market or a change in the results of valuations.

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac

The year ended December 31, 2008 included an unrealized loss of $50.6 in “Other nonoperating expense, net” related to auction rate preferred securities with a par value of $51.5 issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. On
September 7, 2008, the Federal Housing Finance Agency announced that it was placing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac under conservatorship and the payments of dividends on the preferred securities of the type owned by the Company were suspended.
Accordingly, management believed the fair value of these securities was other-than-temporarily impaired, and credit losses were incurred in the amount of $50.6.



NOTE 6 – INVENTORIES

The value of inventories is determined using the lower of cost or market as the basis. Produced goods are valued using a first-in, first-out
(FIFO) cost flow methodology, while purchased materials and supplies are valued using an average cost flow methodology. The components of inventories as of December 31 were as follows:

Produced goods include both work-in-process and
finished goods. Due to the nature of the Company’s operations, it is impractical to classify inventory between work-in-process and finished goods as such classifications can be interchangeable for certain inventoriable items. Purchased
materials primarily consist of the Company’s raw material inventories. Maintenance and supplies included in inventory primarily represent spare component parts that are critical to the Company’s manufacturing processes.

The tax effects of the principal temporary differences
giving rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31 were as follows:



NOTE 7 – INCOME TAXES

(Continued)

The Company believes that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will be realized. This belief is based on criteria
established in FASB guidance related to income taxes. The criteria that management considered in making this determination were historical and projected operating results, the ability to utilize tax planning strategies and the period of time over
which the tax benefits can be utilized.

Tax effected operating loss carryforwards at December 31, 2009 amounted to
$155.6 compared to $96.9 at December 31, 2008. Substantially all of the tax effected operating loss carryforwards are subject to an indefinite carryforward period and were generated by the Company’s subsidiaries in Brazil and the United
Kingdom. The carryforward period of net operating losses in these countries is unlimited. The Company has determined that no valuation allowance is needed for the net operating losses.

The valuation allowance of $85.9 at December 31, 2009 includes $11.6 attributable to the inability to utilize net operating loss
carryforwards from the Company’s subsidiaries of $10.8 in China and $0.8 in the United States. The operating loss carryforward period in China is five years. The majority of the remaining valuation allowance is attributable to realized and
unrealized capital losses on marketable securities of $27.1 and $47.2 from Chinese subsidiaries that are in the initial start-up phase of operations.

Cash paid during the year for income taxes, net of refunds received, was $234.4 in 2009, $399.8 in 2008 and $360.7 in 2007.

The income tax provision at the effective rate may differ from the income tax provision at the United States federal statutory tax rate. A reconciliation of the tax rate for the year ended
December 31 is illustrated in the following table:

During 2009, the Company’s subsidiary in the Netherlands paid a dividend to the United States that
resulted in a $62.9 reduction in the income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2009.

During 2008, the Company
settled a United States Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) audit for the 2004 and 2005 calendar years. This settlement resulted in a $7.0 reduction in the income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2008. In July 2008, the
United Kingdom tax authority enacted a new tax law that resulted in a reduction in tax liability of $9.1 recognized in the year ended December 31, 2008.

As of December 31, 2009, income and remittance taxes have not been recorded on $625.2 of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, either because any taxes on dividends would be offset
substantially by foreign tax credits or because the Company intends to reinvest those earnings indefinitely.

The Company
files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state, local or non-U.S. income tax examination by tax authorities
for years before 2005.



NOTE 7 – INCOME TAXES

(Continued)

The following table indicates, for each significant jurisdiction, the earliest tax year that remains subject to examination:

The IRS commenced an
examination of the Company’s U.S. income tax returns for 2006 and 2007 during 2008. The Company is also participating in the IRS Compliance Assurance Process (“CAP”) for the 2008 and 2009 tax years. In addition, certain foreign
jurisdictions and certain states have commenced examinations of returns filed by the Company and some of its foreign subsidiaries. Management anticipates that, except for the 2009 tax year, these audits will be closed during 2010. Management
anticipates that the 2009 audit will be completed in 2011. As of December 31, 2009, no jurisdiction has proposed any significant adjustments to the Company’s tax returns that would materially affect the Company’s financial position.
In addition, the effect of any proposed adjustment would either be offset by overpayments currently on deposit with the appropriate jurisdictions or would be immaterial. The Company anticipates that no additional payments will be made during 2010
related to any audit activity, and that any changes to its liability for unrecognized tax benefits would be immaterial.

The
Company adopted the provisions of FASB guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, as of January 1, 2007. As a result of the implementation of this guidance, the Company recognized a decrease of approximately $0.3 in the liability
for unrecognized tax benefits, which was accounted for as an addition to the January 1, 2007 balance of retained earnings. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31 were as follows:

As of December 31, 2009, the Company had approximately $15.1 total gross unrecognized tax benefits. Of
this total, $12.4, net of the federal benefit on state issues, represents the amounts of the unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective income tax rate in any future periods. The Company recognizes interest accrued
related to unrecognized tax benefits and penalties in income tax expense. During the year ended December 31, 2009 the Company did not incur any interest and penalties. During the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company
recognized approximately $1.0 and $0.6, respectively, in interest and penalties. The Company had approximately $3.4, $3.6 and $3.1 accrued for the payment of interest and penalties as of December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Tax Effect of Other Comprehensive Income

The following table details the tax (expense) benefit of other comprehensive income amounts recognized during the year ended December 31:



NOTE 8 – DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

The Company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on its earnings,
cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities. In addition, the Company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce the impact of changes in natural gas and other commodity prices on its earnings and cash flows. The Company enters into
derivative financial contracts based on analysis of specific and known economic exposures. The Company’s policy prohibits holding or issuing derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The types of instruments
typically used are forward contracts, but may also include option combinations and purchased option contracts.

Cash Flow Hedges

The Company uses forward contracts and options to hedge the exposure to changes in the prices of commodities, primarily
natural gas. Net unrealized gains and losses on these contracts are recorded as a component of “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets and are reclassified into earnings in the same period
or periods during which the underlying hedged item impacts earnings. Gains or losses on the derivatives representing either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in current
earnings. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had outstanding commodity forward contracts to hedge forecasted purchases of 7.9 million mmbtu of natural gas. Net losses of $12.6 ($7.9 after tax) are expected to be reclassified from
“Accumulated other comprehensive loss” to the consolidated statements of income and included as part of cost of sales in the next 12 months. The forward contracts and options outstanding at December 31, 2009 hedge forecasted
transactions expected to occur within the next 24 months.

Foreign exchange options are also used to hedge specific firm
commitments or forecasted transactions by locking in exchange rates for such anticipated cash flows. Gains and losses on these instruments are recorded as a component of “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” in the consolidated balance
sheets until the forecasted transaction occurs. As of December 31, 2009, the Company did not have outstanding foreign currency cash flow hedges. Net losses of $0.9 ($0.6 after tax) are expected to be reclassified from “Accumulated other
comprehensive loss” to the consolidated statements of income and included as part of “Other nonoperating (expense) income, net” during the next 12 months. The options outstanding as of December 31, 2009 hedge forecasted
transactions expected to occur within the next 3 months.

Economic Hedges

Contracts used to hedge the economic exposure to foreign currency fluctuations associated with certain monetary assets and liabilities are
not designated as hedging instruments. Changes in the fair value of these items are recorded in earnings to offset the foreign exchange gains and losses of the monetary assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2009, the total notional amount
of the Company’s non-designated foreign currency fair value hedges was $644.7, expressed as U.S. dollars.

The location
and amounts of derivative fair values in the Company’s statement of financial position are included in the following table.



NOTE 8 – DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

The location and amounts of derivative gains and losses in the Company’s income statement are included in the following table.

The table below details gains and losses recognized in “Other comprehensive loss”
(“OCI”) and gains and losses reclassified from “Accumulated other comprehensive income” (“AOCI”) related to derivatives that were designated as cash flow hedges during the year ended December 31, 2009. The amount
of ineffectiveness related to existing cash flow hedges at December 31, 2009 was immaterial.

Derivative options held by the Company as of December 31, 2009 were valued using observable
market inputs and the Black-Scholes model. Forward contracts were also valued using observable market inputs. The inputs used in valuation were considered Level 2 because the inputs are readily observable for the derivative asset or liability.

The amounts below represent fair value classifications of derivative instruments held as of the balance sheet dates and are
prior to consideration of counterparty netting arrangements. The net assets and liabilities are recorded in “Other current assets” and “Other current liabilities” in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31,
accordingly.



NOTE 9 – PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

The components of property, plant and equipment as of December 31 were as follows:

The Company recorded depreciation expense of $192.7, $218.4 and $240.2 for the years ended December 31,
2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

The amount of interest capitalized as a component of the cost of capital assets
constructed for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $49.1, $32.8 and $8.6, respectively. The Company includes interest expense incurred on all liabilities, including interest related to commercial creditor obligations, in the
amount of interest expense subject to capitalization. See Note 14 for additional details on interest payable to the Company’s commercial creditors.

NOTE 10 – GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

The gross and net amounts of intangible assets, excluding goodwill, as of December 31 were as follows:

As of December 31, 2009, other intangible assets
include $35.3 for a contractual relationship acquired in conjunction with the purchase of 100% of the equity of Metais. See Note 3 “Acquisitions of Business Interests” for further information about the transaction. The intangible asset
acquired will be fully amortized over the expected useful life of approximately 10 years.



NOTE 10 – GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

(Continued)

The Company recorded amortization expense related to these intangible assets of $6.2, $5.1 and $4.6 for the years ended December 31,
2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The estimated aggregate amortization expense to be recorded in each of the next five years is as follows:

The changes in the
carrying amount of goodwill for the year ended December 31 were as follows:

NOTE 11 – NOTES PAYABLE AND CREDIT FACILITIES

The Company has a $500.0 revolving credit arrangement which expires in 2011. The revolving credit agreement allows for borrowing in various
currencies for general corporate purposes of the Company and its subsidiaries and requires the payment of commitment fees. The credit arrangement sets the interest rate at LIBOR at the time of borrowing plus a margin representing a credit spread,
which is reset quarterly. The Company is in compliance with its debt covenants, including leverage and interest coverage ratios, related to this credit arrangement. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company had borrowed the maximum allowed
under this credit arrangement. The Company also had outstanding short-term debt of $169.1 in Asia. The borrowings in Asia consisted of $30.0 denominated in U.S. dollars with an interest rate of LIBOR plus 250 basis points. The remaining borrowings
in Asia are denominated in Renminbi with an interest rate generally set by the People’s Bank of China at the time of borrowing. The weighted average interest rate for the outstanding short-term borrowings was 1.81% at December 31, 2009.

In April 2009, a majority owned subsidiary of the Company entered into an unsecured five year term loan facility with a
syndicate of commercial banks in China. The amount of the facility was 4.2 billion Renminbi (approximately $615.0 U.S. dollars). The facility permits borrowing in various currencies with repayment required to begin two years after the drawdown date.
Repayment will begin in April 2011. The subsidiary is in compliance with its debt covenants, including interest coverage ratio and tangible net worth, related to this credit arrangement. As of December 31, 2009, the subsidiary had borrowed
approximately $607.8 under the facility.

In October 2009, a majority owned subsidiary of the Company entered into an
unsecured term loan facility with a syndicate of commercial banks in China that will expire in 4.5 years. The amount of the facility was 1.6 billion Renminbi (approximately $234.3 U.S. dollars) and permits borrowing in Renminbi only. Repayment is
required to begin 18 months after the drawdown date. Repayment will begin in April 2011. The subsidiary is in compliance with its debt covenants, including interest coverage ratio and tangible net worth, related to this credit arrangement. As of
December 31, 2009, the subsidiary had borrowed approximately $73.2 under the facility. On January 18, 2010, the subsidiary borrowed an additional $161.0 against the facility.

Since the interest rates for the borrowings in the U.S. and Asia are reset regularly based on market conditions, management believes the
carrying value of the debt approximates its fair value.

In addition, the Company had unused and committed credit facilities
for use by foreign subsidiaries at December 31, 2009 and 2008 with various U.S. and foreign banks totaling $416.2 and $323.1, respectively. These credit facilities require the payment of commitment fees. The Company intends to renew these
facilities at their respective maturities. These facilities are available in support of working capital requirements.



NOTE 11 – NOTES PAYABLE AND CREDIT FACILITIES

(Continued)

Accounts Receivable Securitizations

Dow Corning Toray (“DCT”) maintains an accounts receivable securitization facility with its primary bank. The discount rate under this facility is TIBOR plus 0.20%. DCT sold accounts receivable
in the amount of $201.3 to such bank in exchange for cash proceeds of $201.2 during the year ended December 31, 2009. Under the facility, DCT continues to collect the receivables from the customer but retains no interest in the accounts
receivable. The facility agreement does not permit DCT to transfer the accounts receivable to any other institution and DCT is not permitted to repurchase the transferred receivables. The transfer of receivables provides additional liquidity to DCT.
As of December 31, 2009, $26.8 was outstanding under the facility.

Additionally, the Company has access to a short term
borrowing facility securitized by accounts receivable in the U.S. which expires in 2011. The interest rate under this facility is based on commercial paper pool rates. The facility requires the payment of commitment fees on the unused portion. The
Company is in compliance with its debt covenants, including leverage and interest coverage ratios, related to this credit arrangement. As of December 31, 2009, there were no outstanding amounts under this agreement. As of December 31,
2008, the bank held interest in $82.4 of the Company’s accounts receivable.

The counterparties for both accounts
receivables facilities are financial institutions that specialize in receivables securitization transactions. They are financed through the issuance of commercial paper.

Long-term Debt

Long-term debt as of December 31 consisted of the
following:

The fair value of the Company’s long-term debt,
including the portion due within one year, approximated its book value of $746.0 and $90.4 at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Annual aggregate maturities of the long-term debt of the Company are: $4.0 in 2010, $72.3 in 2011, $140.6 in 2012, $140.9 in 2013, $388.2 thereafter.

Cash paid during the year for interest was $51.7 in 2009, $24.1 in 2008 and $4.7 in 2007.

NOTE 12 – DEFERRED REVENUE

The Company enters into long-term product sales agreements with certain customers. Under these agreements, customers are obligated to purchase minimum quantities of product and make specified payments.
The product sales agreements extend over various periods and the revenue associated with the agreements is recognized using the average sales price over the life of the agreements. Differences between amounts invoiced to customers under the
agreements and amounts recognized using the average price methodology are included as deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheets.



NOTE 12 – DEFERRED REVENUE

(Continued)

Under certain agreements, customers were required to make initial non-refundable advanced cash payments. During the years ended
December 31, 2009 and 2008, advanced payments of $946.7 and $770.2, respectively, were received by the Company. These amounts are recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized as income ratably on a per kilogram basis as products are shipped
over the life of the agreements. The Company expects to receive advanced payments of $983.4 in the next twelve months and $692.0 in periods thereafter. In the event that certain product delivery timelines are not met, subject to specific conditions
outlined in the agreements, customers may be entitled to damages up to the amount of the advanced cash payments.

Deferred
revenue included in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $2,533.4 and $1,656.7, respectively. The current portion of $209.1 and $119.2 was recorded as “Current deferred revenue” in the consolidated
balance sheets as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The remaining amounts were included in the consolidated balance sheets as “Deferred revenue” in noncurrent liabilities. The advanced payments received are reported as cash
flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.

NOTE 13 – PENSION AND OTHER
POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

Defined Benefit Pension Plans

The Company maintains defined benefit employee retirement plans covering most domestic and certain non-U.S. employees. The components of
pension expense for the Company’s U.S. and non-U.S. plans for the year ended December 31 were as follows:

Due to corrections of employee demographic data, pension expense for the year ended December 31, 2008
included an adjustment of $12.0 and the projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2008 included an adjustment of $29.0

Other changes in plan assets and benefit obligations that were recognized in or reclassified from other comprehensive income as of December 31 were as follows:



NOTE 13 – PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

The Company’s defined benefit employee retirement plans have a measurement date of December 31 of the applicable year. The
projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for defined benefit plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets as of December 31 were as follows:

The following table

Level 1 assets were valued based on quoted prices in active markets. Level 2 assets were primarily comprised
of assets held in investment funds. The value of these funds was determined based on quoted prices in active markets for assets that are identical to the underlying assets held by the funds.

Level 3 assets were investments in a long term property lease fund. Due to the absence of observable prices in an active market for the same
or similar securities, the fair value of the securities was based on the last available market price for the underlying assets.

The following table represents amounts recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31:

The Company expects to recognize $44.9 of net loss and $3.6 of net prior service cost as a component of net
periodic pension cost in 2010 for its defined benefit pension plans.

The expected return on plan assets is a long-term
assumption based on projected returns for assets and the approved asset allocations of the plan. For the purpose of pension expense recognition, the Company uses a market-related value of assets that amortizes the difference between the
expected return and the actual return on plan assets over a three-year period. The Company had approximately $67.5 of net unrecognized asset losses associated with its U.S. pension plans as of December 31, 2009 that will be recognized in the
calculation of the market-related value of assets and subject to amortization in future periods.

For the United States
defined benefit plan, as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the fair value of plan assets included 56% of equity securities and 44% of debt securities. The plan targets an asset allocation of 50% equity securities and 50% debt securities. The
plan’s expected long-term rate of return is primarily based on historical returns of similarly diversified passive portfolios and expected results from active investment management.

Given the relatively long horizon of the Company’s aggregate obligation, its investment strategy is to improve and maintain the funded
status of its U.S. and non-U.S. plans over time without exposure to excessive asset value volatility. The Company manages this risk primarily by maintaining actual asset allocations between equity and fixed income securities for the plans within a
specified range of its target asset allocation. In addition, the Company ensures that diversification across various investment subcategories within each plan are maintained within specified ranges.

All of the Company’s pension assets are managed by outside investment managers and held in trust by third-party custodians. The
selection and oversight of these outside service providers is the responsibility of investment committees and their advisors. The selection of specific securities is at the discretion of the investment manager and is subject to the provisions set
forth by written investment management agreements and related policy guidelines regarding permissible investments and risk control practices.



NOTE 13 – PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

(Continued)

The Company’s funding policy is to contribute to defined benefit plans when pension laws and economics either require or encourage
funding. Contributions of approximately $115.1 are planned for the U.S. plans in 2010. Contributions of approximately $32.6 are planned for non-U.S. plans in 2010.

The weighted-average assumptions used to determine the benefit obligation and to determine the net benefit costs are shown in the following table. Discount rates and rates of increase in future
compensation are weighted based upon the projected benefit obligations of the respective plans. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is weighted based on total plan assets for each plan at year end. The long-term rate of return on
plan assets assumption is determined considering historical returns and expected future asset allocation and returns for each plan.

The Company
uses the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve and matches points along the curve to the estimated future benefit payments of the U.S. defined benefit plans to arrive at an effective discount rate. The discount rates for non-U.S. defined benefit plans
are based on benchmark rate indices specific to the respective countries and durations similar to those of the plans’ liabilities.

The Company expects to pay benefits under its defined benefit plans in future periods as detailed in the following table. The expected benefits have been estimated based on the same assumptions used to
measure the Company’s benefit obligation as of December 31, 2009 and include benefits attributable to future employee service.

Other Postretirement Plans

In addition to providing pension benefits, the Company, primarily in the United States, provides certain health care and life
insurance benefits for most retired employees. The cost of providing these benefits to retirees outside the United States is not significant. Net periodic postretirement benefit cost includes the following components for the year ended
December 31:



NOTE 13 – PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

(Continued)

Other changes in benefit obligations that were recognized in or reclassified from other comprehensive income for the year ended
December 31 included:

The following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31.

The Company expects to recognize $4.3 of net loss and $6.8 of net prior service credit as a component of net
periodic postretirement benefit cost in 2010.

postretirement benefit obligation was 8.7% in 2009 and was assumed to decrease gradually to 5.0% in 2033 and remain at that level thereafter. The health care cost trend rate assumption has an effect on the amounts reported, but is offset by plan
provisions that limit the Company’s share of the total postretirement health care benefits cost for the vast majority of participants. The Company’s portion of the total annual health care benefits cost is capped at specified dollar
amounts for participants who retired in 1994 or later, and such limits are expected to be reached in all subsequent years. Increasing the assumed health care cost trend rate by one percentage point in each year would increase the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation by 1.8% and the aggregate of the service and interest cost components of net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 2009 by 1.1%. Decreasing the assumed health care cost trend rates by one percentage point in each
year would decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by 1.0% and the aggregate of the service and interest cost components of net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 2009 by 1.5%.

The discount rate used in determining the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was 5.75% and 6.00% at December 31, 2009 and
2008, respectively. The Company uses the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve and matches points along the curve to the estimated future benefit payments of the U.S. postretirement health care benefit plans to arrive at an effective discount rate.



NOTE 13 – PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

(Continued)

The Company funds most of the cost of the postretirement health care and life insurance benefits as incurred. Benefit payments to retirees
were $17.1 for the year ended December 31, 2009. Reimbursements received under Medicare Part D were $1.7 for the year ended December 31, 2009. The Company expects to pay future benefits under its postretirement health care and life
insurance benefit plans and expects to receive reimbursements from annual Medicare Part D subsidy as detailed in the following table. The expected payments have been estimated based on the same assumptions used to measure the Company’s
postretirement benefit obligations as of December 31, 2009.

Defined Contribution Plans

The Company has various defined contribution and savings plans covering certain employees. The Company made matching
contributions under defined contribution plans of $19.7, $20.7 and $16.2 for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The U.S. plan is the largest of the defined contribution and savings plans maintained by the Company.
Employer matching contributions for the U.S. defined contribution plan for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $12.9. The Company expects to make total contributions of approximately $20.0 to all defined contribution plans during 2010.

NOTE 14 – PROCEEDING UNDER CHAPTER 11

Prior to 1992, the Company was engaged in the manufacture and sale of silicone gel breast implants and the raw material components of those
products. In January 1992, the Company ceased production of these products following a request by the United States Food and Drug Administration that breast implant producers voluntarily halt the sale of silicone gel breast implants. Between 1991
and 1995, the Company experienced a substantial increase in the number of lawsuits against the Company relating to breast implants.

By May 1995, the Company was named in thousands of lawsuits filed by, or on behalf of, individuals who claim to have, or have had, breast implants. As a result, on May 15, 1995 (the “Filing Date”), the Company voluntarily
filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”) with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, Northern Division (the “Bankruptcy Court”) in order to resolve the
Company’s breast implant liabilities and related matters (the “Chapter 11 Proceeding”). The Company emerged from the Chapter 11 Proceeding on June 1, 2004 (the “Effective Date”) and is currently in the process of
implementing its plan of reorganization.

Plan of Reorganization

In 1999, the Company, with the Committee of Tort Claimants, a committee appointed in the Chapter 11 Proceeding to represent products
liability claimants, filed a joint plan of reorganization (the “Joint Plan of Reorganization”) and a related disclosure statement. In November 1999, the Bankruptcy Court issued an order confirming the Joint Plan of Reorganization. The
Joint Plan of Reorganization became effective on the Effective Date. The Joint Plan of Reorganization provides funding for the resolution of breast implant and other products liability litigation covered by the Chapter 11 Proceeding through several
settlement options or through litigation and for the satisfaction of commercial creditor claims.

Breast Implant and Other Products
Liability Claims

Products liability claims to be resolved by settlement are administered by a settlement facility (the
“Settlement Facility”), and products liability claims to be resolved by litigation are defended by a litigation facility (the “Litigation Facility”). Products liability claimants choosing to litigate their claims are required to
pursue their claims through litigation against the Litigation Facility. Under the Joint Plan of Reorganization, the total amount of payments by the Company committed to resolve products liability claims will not exceed a present value of $2.35
billion determined as of the Effective Date using a discount rate of 7%. Of this amount, no more than a present value of $400.0 determined as of the Effective Date will be used to fund the Litigation Facility. Payments made by the Company will be
placed in a trust and withdrawn by the Settlement Facility to pay eligible settling claimants and to cover the Settlement Facility’s operating expenses. Amounts will also be withdrawn from the trust as necessary to fund the resolution of claims
via the Litigation Facility and the operational expenses of the Litigation Facility.



NOTE 14 – PROCEEDING UNDER CHAPTER 11

(Continued)

Funding the Settlement and Litigation Facilities

The Company has an obligation to fund the Settlement Facility and the Litigation Facility (collectively, the “Facilities”) over a 16-year period, commencing at the Effective Date. The Company
anticipates that it will be able to meet its remaining payment obligations to the Facilities utilizing cash flow from operations, insurance proceeds and/or prospective borrowings. Under certain circumstances, the Company will also have access to a
ten-year unsecured revolving credit commitment, established by Dow Chemical and Corning, to assist in the timely funding of the Facilities. During the first five years after the Effective Date, the maximum aggregate amount available to the Company
under this revolving credit commitment was $300.0. Beginning June 1, 2009, the amount available decreases by $50.0 per year. As of December 31, 2009, the maximum aggregate amount available to the Company under this revolving credit
commitment was $250.0. The credit commitment will fully expire June 1, 2014. Borrowings under this revolving credit commitment will only be permitted in the event that the Company is unable to meet its remaining obligations to fund the
Facilities. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had not drawn any amounts against the revolving credit commitment.

Funds are paid by the Company (a) to the Settlement Facility with respect to products liability claims, as such claims are processed and allowed by the Settlement Facility and (b) via the Settlement Facility with respect to
products liability claims processed through the Litigation Facility, as such claims are resolved. Insurance settlements are paid by the Company’s insurers directly to the Settlement Facility on behalf of the Company. The amount of funds paid by
or on behalf of the Company is subject to annual and aggregate funding limits. The Company has made payments of $1,637.1 to the Settlement Facility through December 31, 2009.

Based on funding agreements relating to the amount and timing of the Company’s remaining payment obligations to the Settlement
Facility, future payments to the Settlement Facility will be made on a periodic basis until such payment obligations are met. Based on these funding agreements, the recorded liability is adjusted to maintain the present value of $2.35 billion
determined as of the Effective Date using a discount rate of 7% (“Time Value Adjustments”). The Company has made early payments to the Settlement Facility in advance of their due dates and has recognized Time Value Adjustments for certain
of those early payments consisting primarily of insurance proceeds. The actual amounts payable and the timing of payments by the Company to the Settlement Facility are uncertain and will be affected by, among other things, the rate at which claims
are resolved by the Facilities, the rate at which insurance proceeds are received by the Company from its insurers and the degree to which Time Value Adjustments are recognized.

Insurance

The Company had a substantial amount of unexhausted products
liability insurance coverage with respect to breast implant lawsuits and claims. Many of the Company’s insurers reserved the right to deny coverage, in whole or in part. Litigation between the Company and its insurers (“Litigating
Insurers”) regarding coverage for products liability was conducted between 1993 and 1999 and resulted in judicial rulings substantially in favor of the Company’s position (the “Insurance Litigation”). A majority of the Litigating
Insurers have reached settlements with the Company. The Company is continuing settlement negotiations with the remaining Litigating Insurers and other insurers that were not involved in the Insurance Litigation.

In addition, the London Market Insurers (the “LMI Claimants”), have claimed a reimbursement right with respect to a portion of
insurance proceeds previously paid by the LMI Claimants to the Company. This claim is based on a theory that the LMI Claimants overestimated the Company’s liability for the resolution of implant claims pursuant to the Joint Plan of
Reorganization. During the third quarter of 2008, the LMI Claimants offered two calculations of their claim amount; $54.0 and $92.5, plus minimum interest of $67.0 and $115.5, respectively. These estimates were explicitly characterized as
preliminary and subject to change. Litigation regarding this claim is in the beginning stages of discovery. The Company disputes the claim. It is not currently possible to predict the ultimate outcome or reasonably estimate the potential liability,
if any.



NOTE 14 – PROCEEDING UNDER CHAPTER 11

(Continued)

Insurance Allocation Agreement between the Company and Dow Chemical

A number of the products liability insurance policies relevant to claims against the Company name the Company and Dow Chemical as co-insureds (the “Shared Insurance Assets”). A portion of the
Shared Insurance Assets may, under certain conditions, become payable by the Company to Dow Chemical under an insurance allocation agreement between the Company and Dow Chemical originally entered into on February 17, 1998 (the “Insurance
Allocation Agreement”), amended on November 9, 1998 and on October 19, 2001 (the “Insurance Allocation Agreement Amendments”). The Insurance Allocation Agreement was reached between Dow Chemical and the Company in order to
resolve issues related to the amount of the Shared Insurance Assets that would be available to the Company for resolution of its products liability claims. Under the Insurance Allocation Agreement, 25% of certain of the Shared Insurance Assets will
be paid by the Company to Dow Chemical subsequent to the Effective Date. However, the amount of Shared Insurance Assets that will be payable to Dow Chemical by the Company under the Insurance Allocation Agreement will not exceed approximately
$285.0. In addition, a portion of any such amounts paid to Dow Chemical, to the extent not used by Dow Chemical to pay certain products liability claims, will be paid over to the Company after the expiration of a 17.5-year period commencing on the
Effective Date. Furthermore, the Company recognized an obligation of $35.0 to Dow Chemical related to additional insurance coverage under which the Company and Dow Chemical are co-insureds. The Company previously recorded the maximum amount of
insurance proceeds payable to Dow Chemical pursuant to the Insurance Allocation Agreement (the “Co-insurance payable”). As a result of the Insurance Allocation Agreement Amendments and settlements entered into between the Company and
certain of its insurers, the Co-insurance payable is paid in full as of December 31, 2009.

Commercial Creditor Issues

The Joint Plan of Reorganization provides funding to satisfy commercial creditor claims, including accrued interest. The Joint Plan of
Reorganization, as amended pursuant to a May 2004 ruling of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan (the “District Court”), provides that each of the Company’s commercial creditors (the “Commercial
Creditors”) would receive in cash the sum of (a) an amount equal to the principal amount of their claims and (b) interest on such claims. The actual amount of interest that will ultimately be paid to these Commercial Creditors is
uncertain due to pending litigation between the Company and the Commercial Creditors. As previously reported between 1999 and 2004, there have been a number of Bankruptcy Court and District Court rulings related to the interest rate that should be
applied to claims of the Commercial Creditors from the Filing Date through the Effective Date (“Pendency Interest”). The Commercial Creditors and the Company disagree on the interpretation and application of these rulings to determine the
amount of Pendency Interest.

The Company’s position is that (a) Pendency Interest should be (i) an amount
determined by applying non-default rates of interest for floating rate obligations in accordance with the formulas in the relevant contracts, except that the aggregate amount of interest cannot be less than that resulting from the application of a
fixed rate of 6.28% through the Effective Date and (ii) the higher of the relevant contract rates or 6.28% for all other obligations to the Commercial Creditors through the Effective Date, (b) interest payable to the Commercial Creditors
for periods following the Effective Date should be computed at five percent (5%) and (c) default interest rates should not apply (the “Company’s Position”). The Commercial Creditors’ position is that (a) Pendency
Interest should be an amount determined by applying default rates of interest with respect to amounts overdue under the terms of the relevant debt and commercial agreements until the Effective Date, (b) interest payable to the Commercial
Creditors for periods following the Effective Date should be computed at five percent (5%) and (c) certain of the Commercial Creditors are entitled to unspecified fees, costs and expenses (the “Commercial Creditors Position”).
The Company has paid to the Commercial Creditors an amount of interest that the Company considers to be undisputed, which was calculated by application of the Company’s Position (the “Undisputed Portion”).

In July 2006, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit (the “Court of Appeals”) issued a ruling reversing the District
Court’s previous ruling regarding Pendency Interest that interest on unpaid amounts was to be determined by the higher of fixing the interest rate for floating rate debt at the actual contractual non-default rates in effect when the Company
commenced its Chapter 11 Proceeding or 6.28%, and that higher default rates of interest were not to be applied. The Court of Appeals concluded that there is a presumption that contractually specified default interest should be paid by a solvent
debtor to unsecured creditors (the “Interest Rate Presumption”) and permitting the Company’s Commercial Creditors to recover fees, costs and expenses where permitted by relevant loan agreements and state law. The Court of Appeals
remanded the matter to the District Court for further proceedings to determine (a) whether the Interest Rate Presumption, when considered with countervailing equitable considerations, should be applied to the Company’s debt obligations to
its Commercial Creditors and (b) the amount, if any, of additional interest and the amount, if any, of fees, costs and expenses to be paid by the Company to its Commercial Creditors (the “Court of Appeals decision”). In August 2006,
the Company filed a petition for rehearing en banc with the Court of Appeals requesting that the Court of Appeals reconsider the issues previously addressed regarding Pendency Interest and fees, costs and expenses. In November 2006, the Court of
Appeals denied this petition and the Company filed a petition for a writ of certiorari requesting the Supreme Court of the United States to review the Court of Appeals decision. In March 2007, the Supreme Court denied the petition for the writ of
certiorari.



NOTE 14 – PROCEEDING UNDER CHAPTER 11

(Continued)

The Pendency Interest matter is remanded back to the District Court for determination of the presence of equitable considerations that would
preclude the application of the “Interest Rate Presumption” or, in the absence of equitable considerations, what the default rates of interest will be, along with any recoverable fees, costs and expenses.

As of December 31, 2009, the Company has paid approximately $1.5 billion to the Commercial Creditors, representing principal and the
Undisputed Portion. As of December 31, 2009, the Company has estimated its liability payable to the Commercial Creditors to be within a range of $83.4 and $260.1. However, no single amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than
any other amount within the range. Therefore, the Company has recorded the minimum liability within the range. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the amount of interest included in “Accrued interest” recorded in the consolidated
balance sheets related to the Company’s potential obligation to pay additional interest to its Commercial Creditors in the Chapter 11 Proceeding was $76.1 and $72.7, respectively. These amounts are substantially comprised of (a) interest
on the principal portion of Commercial Creditor claims relating to floating rate debt during the Chapter 11 Proceeding until the Effective Date determined by fixing the interest rate for floating rate debt at the contractual non-default rates in
effect when the Company commenced its Chapter 11 Proceeding plus (b) interest on such amount of interest for periods following the Effective Date determined by applying a five percent (5%) interest rate less (c) the Undisputed
Portion.

NOTE 15 – COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND GUARANTEES

Chapter 11 Related Matters

Insurance Receivable

The total “Anticipated implant insurance receivable” of $15.7 as of
December 31, 2009 and $55.5 as of December 31, 2008 represents amounts to be received by the Company pursuant to settlements with the Company’s insurance carriers. The principal uncertainties that exist with respect to the realization
of the “Anticipated implant insurance receivable” include the ultimate cost of resolving implant litigation and claims, the results of settlement negotiations with insurers and the extent to which insurers may become insolvent in the
future. Management believes that, while uncertainties regarding this asset continue to exist, these uncertainties are not reasonably likely to result in a material adverse change to the Company’s financial position or results of operations, and
that it is probable that this asset will ultimately be realized. This belief is further supported by the fact that the Company received insurance recoveries of $1,569.0 from September 1, 1994 through December 31, 2009, and entered into
settlements with certain insurers for future reimbursement.

Implant Reserve

As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company’s “Implant reserve” recorded in the consolidated balance sheets was
$1,580.3 and $1,597.6, respectively, to reflect the Company’s estimated remaining obligation to fund the resolution of breast implant claims pursuant to the Company’s Chapter 11 plan of reorganization and other breast implant litigation
related matters (see Note 9, “Proceeding Under Chapter 11” for further discussion). During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company recorded expense of $16.2, $5.4 and $10.5, respectively. The expense was recorded
in the caption “Other nonoperating (expense) income, net” to reflect Time Value Adjustments.

Accrued Interest

As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the amount of interest included in “Accrued interest” recorded in the consolidated balance
sheets related to the Company’s potential obligation to pay interest to the Commercial Creditors in the Chapter 11 Proceeding was $76.1 and $72.7, respectively. The actual amount of interest that will be paid to these creditors is uncertain and
will ultimately be resolved through continued proceedings in the District Court (see Note 14, “Proceeding Under Chapter 11” for further discussion).

Co-Insurance Payable

As of December 31, 2009, payables pursuant to
the “Insurance Allocation Agreement” were paid in full. As of December 31, 2008, the total amount payable related to the “Insurance Allocation Agreement” recorded in the consolidated balance sheets was $8.8, of which $5.2
was recorded in “Other current liabilities” and $3.6 was recorded in “Other noncurrent liabilities” in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet (see Note 14, “Proceeding Under Chapter 11” for further discussion).



NOTE 15 – COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND GUARANTEES

(Continued)

Risks and Uncertainties

While the Company does not anticipate a need to further revise amounts recorded in its consolidated financial statements for these Chapter 11 related matters, as additional facts and circumstances develop, it is at least reasonably possible
that amounts recorded in the Company’s consolidated financial statements may be revised. Future revisions, if required, could have a material effect on the Company’s financial position or results of operations in the period or periods in
which such revisions are recorded. Since any specific future developments, and the impact such developments might have on amounts recorded in the Company’s consolidated financial statements, are unknown at this time, an estimate of possible
future adjustments cannot be made.

Environmental Matters

The Company had been advised by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) or by similar state and non-U.S.
national regulatory agencies that the Company, together with others, is a Potentially Responsible Party (“PRP”) with respect to a portion of the cleanup costs and other related matters involving a number of waste disposal sites. Management
believes that there are 20 sites at which the Company may have some liability, although management expects to settle the Company’s liability for eight of these sites for de minimis amounts.

Based upon preliminary estimates by the EPA or the PRP groups formed with respect to these sites, the aggregate liabilities for all
PRP’s at those sites at which management believes the Company may have more than a de minimis liability is $32.9. Management cannot estimate the aggregate liability for all PRP’s at all of the sites at which management expects the Company
has a de minimis liability. The Company records accruals for environmental matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the Company’s costs can be reasonably estimated. The amount accrued for environmental matters as of
December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $3.2 and $2.9, respectively.

As additional facts and circumstances develop, it is at
least reasonably possible that the accrued liability related to environmental matters may be revised. While there are a number of uncertainties with respect to the Company’s estimate of its ultimate liability for cleanup costs at these waste
disposal sites, management believes that any costs incurred in excess of those accrued will not have a material adverse impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations. This opinion is based upon the number of
identified PRP’s at each site, the number of such PRP’s that are believed by management to be financially capable of paying their share of the ultimate liability, and the portion of waste sent to the sites for which management believes the
Company might be held responsible based on available records.

Other Regulatory Matters

Companies that manufacture and sell chemical products may experience risks under current or future laws and regulations which may result in
significant costs and liabilities. The Company routinely conducts health, toxicological and environmental tests of its products. The Company cannot predict what future legal, regulatory or other actions, if any, may be taken regarding the
Company’s products or the consequences of their production and sale. Such actions could result in significant losses, and there can be no assurance that significant losses would not be incurred. However, based on currently available
information, the Company’s management does not believe that any such actions would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations.

Guarantees and Letters of Credit

Guarantees arise in the normal
course of business from relationships with customers, employees and nonconsolidated affiliates when the Company undertakes an obligation to guarantee the performance of others (via delivery of cash or other assets) if specified triggering events
occur. Non-performance under a contract by the guaranteed party triggers the obligation of the Company. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these guarantees was $28.8 as of December 31, 2009. Of this amount, $23.0 relates to
the guarantee of the debt of a nonconsolidated affiliate, which is due to be repaid by May 2011. In addition, $5.8 relates to guarantees of housing loan obligations of certain employees of the Company’s subsidiaries in Asia. These guarantees
have various expiration dates and typically span approximately 20 years. The Company’s estimated potential obligation under these guarantees is not material to the consolidated financial statements and no liability has been recorded on the
Company’s consolidated balance sheets for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. The Company does not expect to be required to make any payments related to these agreements.



NOTE 15 – COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND GUARANTEES

(Continued)

The Company also has guarantees related to its performance under certain operating lease arrangements and the residual value of leased
assets. If certain operating leases are terminated by the Company, it guarantees a portion of the residual value loss, if any, incurred by the lessors in disposing of the related assets. Expiration dates vary, and certain leases contain renewal
options. The maximum amount of future payments the Company was potentially obligated to make for guarantees of residual values of leased assets was $4.6 and $4.8 at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Management believes that, based on
facts and circumstances, the Company’s estimated potential obligation under its residual value lease guarantees is not material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements and as such, no liability has been recorded on the
Company’s consolidated balance sheets for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008.

The Company had outstanding
letters of credit of $13.2 at December 31, 2009 and $21.2 at December 31, 2008. These letters of credit related primarily to the Company’s wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary.

Leases

The Company
leases certain real and personal property under agreements that generally require the Company to pay for maintenance, insurance and taxes. Lease expense was $51.1 in 2009, $52.0 in 2008 and $40.8 in 2007. The minimum future lease payments required
under noncancellable operating leases at December 31, 2009, in the aggregate, are $158.2 including the following amounts due in each of the next five years: 2010 - $38.4, 2011 - $24.3, 2012 - $16.0, 2013 - $10.6 and 2014 - $8.0.

Warranties

In the
normal course of business to facilitate sales of its products, the Company has issued product warranties, and it has entered into contracts and purchase orders that often contain standard terms and conditions that typically include a warranty. The
Company’s warranty activities do not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations.

NOTE 16 – RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

The Company has transactions in the
normal course of business with its shareholders, Dow Chemical and Corning and their affiliates. The following tables summarize related party transactions for the year ended December 31 and balances with the Company’s shareholders as of
December 31.

In addition, non-wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries of the Company have transactions in the
normal course of business with their noncontrolling shareholders. The following tables summarize related party transactions for the year ended December 31 and balances between these non-wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries and their minority
owners as of December 31.

Management believes the costs of such purchases and the prices for such sales were competitive
with purchases from other suppliers and sales to other customers.



NOTE 16 – RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS (Continued)

In addition, DCT loans excess funds to its minority shareholder Toray Industries, Inc. The amount of loans receivable at December 31,
2009 and 2008 was $20.6 and $14.9, respectively. These balances are included in “Notes and other receivables” in the consolidated balance sheets. Management believes that interest earned from this loan arrangement is at rates commensurate
with market rates for companies of similar credit standing.

In December 2009, the Company purchased an office building and
technology center from Rohm & Haas Investment Holding Co. Ltd, a subsidiary of The Dow Chemical Company for approximately $47.2.

NOTE 17 – SUBSEQUENT EVENT

On January 8, 2010, the Company was
approved to receive Advanced Energy Manufacturing Tax Credits of approximately $169.0. The tax credits were granted as part of the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act of 2009, and are focused on job creation from increased domestic manufacturing
capacity supplying clean and renewable energy projects. The credits granted to the Company are related to the Company’s manufacturing expansion projects supporting the solar industry. The impact of these tax credits was not recognized in the
Company’s statement of position and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2009.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

The accompanying consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”). Significant accounting
policies followed by the Company in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements are summarized below.

Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company, including its subsidiaries in which a controlling interest is held. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Equity investments in which the Company exercises significant
influence but does not control are accounted for using the equity method.

New Accounting Standards Adopted

Effective September 30, 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) established

The FASB
Accounting Standards Codification

™

(“ASC”) as the source of authoritative accounting to be
applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP. Except for newly issued standards which have not been codified, references to codified literature have been updated to reflect this change.

The Company accounts for business combinations as required by the provisions of the Business Combinations Topic of the FASB
ASC (formerly referenced as Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 141 (revised 2007),

Business Combinations

), which includes provisions that the Company adopted effective January 1, 2009. The accounting
for business combinations retains the underlying concepts of the previously issued standard in that all business combinations are still required to be accounted for at fair value, but changes the method of applying the acquisition method in a number
of significant aspects. Acquisition costs are generally expensed as incurred; noncontrolling interests are valued at fair value at the acquisition date; in-process research and development is recorded at fair value as an indefinite-lived intangible
asset at the acquisition date; restructuring costs associated with a business combination are generally expensed subsequent to the acquisition date; and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the
acquisition date generally affect income tax expense. These changes are effective prospectively to all business combinations subsequent to the effective date, with the exception of the accounting for valuation allowances on deferred taxes and
acquired tax contingencies. Adjustments for valuation allowances on deferred taxes and acquired tax contingencies associated with acquisitions that closed prior to January 1, 2009 would also apply the revised accounting for business combination
provisions. The adoption of the new accounting policy did not have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.



Samsung Corning Precision Glass Co., Ltd.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Effective January 1, 2009, the Company, as required, adopted ASC 810, Consolidation
(formerly referenced as SFAS No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements

) requirements for reporting noncontrolling interests in financial statements. A noncontrolling interest, previously called a minority
interest, is the portion of equity in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to a parent. Under the new standard, noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries are now included as a component of equity in the consolidated statements of
financial position. This guidance also provides the required accounting treatment for changes in ownership of noncontrolling interests. The provisions of the standard were applied to all noncontrolling interests prospectively, except for the
presentation and disclosure requirements, which were applied retrospectively to all periods presented. As a result, upon adoption, the Company retroactively reclassified the “Minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries” balance
previously included in the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheet to a new component of equity with respect to noncontrolling interests in consolidated subsidiaries. The adoption also impacted certain captions previously used on the
consolidated statements of income, largely identifying net income including noncontrolling interests and net income attributable to the Company. Additional disclosures required by this standard are also included in Note 11. The adoption of this
standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Subsequent Events

The Company evaluates all events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date
through the date of issuance of the Company’s financial statements. For the year ended December 31, 2009, subsequent events were evaluated through February 8, 2010.

Foreign Currency Translation

The Company operates primarily in Korean Won, its local and functional currency. The Company has chosen the U.S. dollar as its reporting currency. In accordance with ASC 830,

Foreign Currency
Matters

(formerly referenced as SFAS No. 52,

Foreign Currency Translation

), revenues and expenses are translated into U.S. dollars at average exchange rates prevailing during the period. Assets and liabilities are translated at the
exchange rates on the balance sheet date. Equity accounts are translated at historical rates and the resulting translation gain or loss are recorded directly as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in
shareholders’ equity. Transaction gains or losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included in the income statement as incurred. Assets and liabilities
denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date and the related exchange gains or losses are recorded in the statement of income.

Translation of Foreign Currency Financial Statements of Subsidiaries

The financial position and results of operations of SCM are measured using its functional currency of the U.S. dollar. All other subsidiaries
use their local currency as their functional currency. The financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated into Korean won, the Korean parent company’s functional currency, using the current exchange rate method. Income and expenses
are translated into U.S. dollars at average exchange rates prevailing during the period. Assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using the exchange rates at the balance sheet date. Equity accounts are translated at historical rates
and the resulting translation adjustments are recorded directly in accumulated other comprehensive income as a component of shareholder’s equity.

Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists, the products have been delivered and all risks of ownership have been transferred to the customers, the sale price is fixed and determinable, and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured.
Utilizing these criteria, product revenue is recognized upon delivery of the product at customer’s location or upon customer acceptance, depending on the terms of the arrangements. At the time revenue is recognized, allowances are recorded,
with the related reduction to revenue, for estimated product returns and price discounts based upon historical experience.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and disclosures. The most significant estimates and assumptions relate to the useful life of property, plant and
equipment, allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable, contingent liabilities, inventory valuation, impairment of long-lived assets and allocated expenses. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events
and actions that the Company may undertake in the future, actual results may be different from those estimates.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash. We consider securities with contractual
maturities of three months or less, when purchased, to be cash equivalents. The carrying amount of these securities approximates fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments.

Restricted Cash

Restricted cash represents bank time deposits under an escrow agreement between the Company and Shenzhen Electronics Group Co., Ltd. (“SEG”) to provide financial support for Shenzhen SEG Samsung Group (“SSG”), an equity
method investment of the Company (see Note 5). The restricted cash placed in escrow shall be used for the payment of SSG liabilities. The payment of the SSG liabilities is expected to be completed by December 31, 2010. The Company has included
the restricted cash in the other current assets at December 31, 2009.

Short-Term Financial Instruments

The Company’s short-term financial instruments are time deposits with financial institutions. These time deposits have
original maturities of six months or less, and their carrying values approximate fair value.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost being determined by the average cost method, which approximates the
first-in, first-out method. The cost of inventories is determined based on the normal capacity of the production facility. In case the capacity utilization is lower than a level that management believes to be normal, the fixed overhead costs per
production unit which exceeds those under normal capacity, are charged to cost of sales rather than capitalized as inventories.

Property and Depreciation

Property, plant and equipment, including precious metals, are stated at cost less
accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method based on the following estimated useful lives except for the depreciation of precious metals.

Buildings

15–40 years

Machinery and equipment (excluding precious metals)

1.5–8 years

Vehicle, tools, furniture and fixtures

2–8 years

Manufacturing equipment includes certain components of production equipment that are
constructed of precious metals. These assets are not depreciated because they have very low physical losses and are repeatedly reclaimed and reused in the Company’s manufacturing process over a very long useful life. The Company treats the
physical loss of precious metals in the manufacturing and reclamation process as depletion and accounts for these losses as a period expense based on reasonably estimated units lost. Precious metals are integral to many of the Company’s glass
production processes. Precious metals are only acquired to support operations and are not held for trading or other purposes.

Intangible Assets

Intangible assets consist of patents acquired in a business combination and a license
agreement for the use of Corning’s technology (Frit Sealing). Such intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from three to five years, which approximate their estimate useful life. Intangible assets are
included in other non-current assets in the consolidated balance sheets.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset
may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset or asset group against future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the asset or asset group. The Company
assesses the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. If the sum of the expected future cash flows is
less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group, an impairment loss is measured as the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Accrued Severance Benefits

Employees and directors with one or more years of service are entitled to severance benefits upon the termination of their employment based
on their length of service and rate of pay. As of December 31, 2009, approximately 90% of all employees of the Company were eligible for severance benefits. Accrued severance benefits represent the amount which would be payable assuming
eligible employees and directors were to terminate their employment with the Company as of the balance sheet date.

Accrued
severance benefits are funded at approximately 70% and 65% as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, through a group severance insurance plan. The amounts funded under this insurance plan are classified as a deduction to the accrued
severance benefits. Subsequent accruals are to be funded at the discretion of the Company.

In accordance with the National
Pension Act of the Republic of Korea, a certain portion of accrued severance benefits is deposited with the National Pension Fund and deducted from the accrued severance benefits. The contributed amount is refunded to employees from the National
Pension Fund upon their retirement.

Research and Development Costs

Research and development expenditures, which include costs in relation to new product, development, research, process improvement and product
use technology, are expensed as incurred and included in operating expenses.

Income Taxes and Investment Tax Credit

The Company recognizes deferred income taxes for anticipated future tax consequences resulting from temporary differences
between amounts reported for financial reporting and income tax purposes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed on the said temporary differences by applying the enacted statutory tax rates applicable to the years when such
differences are expected to reverse. Deferred income tax assets are recognized when it is more likely than not that they will be realized. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amount
expected to be realized. The total income tax provision includes the current income tax expense under the applicable tax regulations and the change in the balance of deferred income tax assets and liabilities during the year.

The Company is eligible to use investment tax credits that are temporarily allowed for qualified plant and equipment expenditures. The
investment tax credit is recognized as a reduction of tax expense in the year in which the qualified plant and equipment expenditure is incurred.

On January 1, 2007, the Company adopted the provisions of ASC 740,

Income taxes

(formerly referenced as FASB Financial Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes
- - an interpretation of SFAS No. 109

), which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. This interpretation also provides guidance on de-recognition,
classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The evaluation of a tax position in accordance with this interpretation is a two-step process. In the first step, recognition, the Company determines
whether it is more-likely-than-not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. The second step addresses measurement of a
tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not criteria. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.

The Company’s policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within income tax expense line item in
the consolidated statements of income. This classification has not changed as a result of implementing the provisions of ASC 740.

Equity Method Investments

The Company accounts for its equity method investments in accordance with ASC 323,

Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures

(formerly referenced as Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18,

The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock

).



Samsung Corning Precision Glass Co., Ltd.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

The Company’s equity method investments, as required, are reviewed for impairment
on a periodic basis or if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. This assessment is based on a review of the equity investments’ performance and a review of indicators of impairment to
determine if there is evidence of a loss in value of an equity investment. Factors the Company considers include:

•

Absence of our ability to recover the carrying amount;

•

Inability of the equity affiliate to sustain an earnings capacity which would justify the carrying amount of the investment; and

•

Significant litigation, bankruptcy or other events that could impact recoverability.

For an equity investment with impairment indicators, the Company measures fair value on the basis of discounted cash flows or other
appropriate valuation methods, depending on the nature of the company involved. If it is probable that the Company will not recover the carrying amount of their investment, the impairment is considered other-than-temporary and recorded in earnings,
and the equity investment balance is reduced to its fair value accordingly. The Company requires their equity method affiliates to provide audited financial statements in accordance with US GAAP. Consequently, required assessments of asset
recoverability are included in their results. The Company also includes these financial statements in their recoverability assessment.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 167,

Amendments to FASB
Interpretation No. 46 (R) (SFAS 167)

. SFAS 167 revises the consolidation guidance for variable interest entities. SFAS 167 modifies the approach for determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity (VIE). Under SFAS
167, the primary beneficiary is the variable interest holder that has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to
receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. In addition, SFAS 167 provides guidance on shared power and joint venture relationships, removes the scope exemption for qualified special purpose entities, revises the
definition of a VIE, and requires additional disclosures. SFAS 167 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2009. The Company does not expect adoption of this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated results of
operations and financial condition.

In October 2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2009-13,

Revenue
Recognition

(Topic 605):

Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements - a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force

(ASU 2009-13). ASU 2009-13 addresses the accounting for sales arrangements that include multiple products or services
by revising the criteria for when deliverables may be accounted for separately rather than as a combined unit. Specifically, this guidance establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable, which is necessary
to separately account for each product or service. This hierarchy provides more options for establishing selling price than existing guidance. ASU 2009-13 is required to be applied prospectively to new or materially modified revenue arrangements in
fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect adoption of this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition.

Business Combination

On
December 31, 2007, SCP acquired all of the outstanding common and preferred stock of SSC in exchange for 217,462 shares of SCP’s common stock and 107 shares of SCP’s preferred stock (the “Acquisition”). The transaction was
accounted for as a business combination. The value assigned to the stock issued for the purchase consideration was $1,445 per share based on the estimated fair value of SCP’s stock as at December 31, 2007. SCP believes that combining SSC
would enable SCP to strengthen its competitiveness and improve efficiency in management by maximizing synergy effects.

SSC
was incorporated on December 20, 1973 under the laws of the Republic of Korea in accordance with a joint venture agreement between Corning and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (“SEC”). The principal business activity of SSC relates to
the production and sale of CRT glass, ITO (Indium Tin Oxide) target and PDP (Plasma Display Panel) filters.

A summary of the
purchase price for the acquisition is as follows:



Samsung Corning Precision Glass Co., Ltd.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

The aggregate purchase consideration has been allocated to the assets and liabilities
acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, based on their respective estimated fair values. The respective estimated fair values were determined at the acquisition date, and resulted in excess fair value of the net assets acquired over the
purchase consideration of $33,763 thousand. The negative goodwill of $33,763 thousand was allocated on a pro rata basis to all of the acquired assets except financial assets, assets to be disposed of by sale, deferred income tax assets and other
current assets.

A summary of the allocation of the purchase price is as follows:

During the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2007, SSC management announced the
closure of certain businesses including CRT, BLU (Back Light Unit) and STN (Super Twisted Nematic). SCD was dissolved effective as of October 1, 2007 and the settlement-phase of SCD has finished during the first quarter of 2009. Assets and

Equity Investments

On
December 31, 2007, as part of the Acquisition, the Company has an investment in SSG, which is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The ownership percentage of the investment is 30.1% and 31.9% at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
respectively.

During 2008, SSG incurred impairment charges totaling $82,712 thousand as a result of a decline in the
projected operating results of its CRT glass business. The charge, which was recognized in relation to manufacturing assets, reduced the Company’s equity method investment by $2,489 thousand in 2008. As the investment was reduced to zero, the
Company discontinued recognition of the Company’s share of SSG losses.



Samsung Corning Precision Glass Co., Ltd.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

During 2009, the Company decided to exit the China CRT market. The Company and SEG
entered into a Production and Operation Adjustment Arrangement Agreement (the “Operation Agreement”) on August 17, 2009. In accordance with the Operation Agreement, the Company agreed to provide SSG with financial support in amount of
$20,307 thousand. The financial support was comprised of a cash investment of $12,155 thousand and a commitment to provide an additional cash investment of $8,152 thousand. The Company has recorded a current liability for the commitment to provide
additional cash funding. As the Company’s share of SSG’s losses are in excess of the Company’s investment amount, the $20,307 thousand financial support amount has been included in the equity losses of affiliated companies in the
consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2009. As of December 31, 2009, the Company is in process of share disposal subject to relevant laws and regulations.

In September 2009, the Company entered into a certain Joint Venture agreement (the “JV Agreement”) with Corning. Pursuant to the
JV Agreement, the parties established Corsam Technologies LLC (“Corsam”), a new equity affiliate established to provide glass technology research for future product applications. The Company invested $124 million in cash and Corning
contributed intellectual property with a corresponding value. The Company and Corning each own 50% of the common stock of Corsam and Corning has agreed to provide research and development services at arms length to Corsam. Corsam has sufficient
equity to finance its activities, the voting rights of investors in Corsam are considered substantive, and the risks and rewards of Corsam’s research are shared only by those investors noted. The Company does not control Corsam. As a result,
the Company accounts for its investment in Corsam under the equity method of accounting for investments. The Company’s share Corsam net losses of $ 35,284 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2009, has been included in equity
losses of affiliated companies in the consolidated statements of income.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment comprise the following:

Manufacturing equipment includes certain components of production equipment that are
constructed of precious metals. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the recorded value of precious metals totaled $938 million and $900 million, respectively.

7.

Impairment Charges

During the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 the Company recorded impairment charges totaling $12,393 thousand and $20,208 thousand, respectively, in accordance with ASC 360,

Property, Plant, and Equipment

(formerly
referenced as SFAS No. 144,

Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

). These amounts are included with selling and administrative expenses on the statement of income. The impairment charges recorded in 2009 and 2008 related to
projected decline in earnings of PDP-Filters business and CRT glass business in the Malaysian plant, respectively. The net book value of the asset group before the impairment charges is approximately $40,209 thousand and $23,388 thousand for 2009
and 2008, respectively.

The impairment charge was measured as an excess of the carrying value of the asset group over its
estimated fair value. The fair value of the asset group was estimated using a present value technique, where expected future cash flows from the use and eventual disposal of the asset group were discounted by an interest rate commensurate with the
risk of the cash flows.

Fair Value Measurement

In September 2006, the FASB issued ASC 820,

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

(formerly referenced as SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair
value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The provisions of ASC 820 are effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. In February 2008, the FASB deferred the
implementation of ASC 820 for certain non-financial assets and liabilities for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. The Company adopted the provisions of ASC 820 for financial assets and liabilities on January 1, 2008 and
adopted the provisions of ASC 820 for non-financial assets and liabilities on January 1, 2009. The adoption of ASC 820 did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations.

ASC 820 establishes a valuation hierarchy for disclosure of the inputs to valuation used to measure fair value. This hierarchy prioritizes
the inputs into three broad levels as follows. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liabilities, including interest
rates, yield curves and credit risks, or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data through correlation. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on our own assumptions used to measure assets and
liabilities at fair value. A financial asset or liability’s classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. As of December 31, 2009, the Company did not
have any financial assets or liabilities that were measured using unobservable (or Level 3) inputs.

As of December 31,
2009, the Company’s financial assets consist of cash and short-term financial instruments which are measured at fair value and are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.

10.

Income Taxes

The
Company’s income tax expenses are composed of domestic and foreign income taxes depending on the relevant tax jurisdiction.

Income tax expense consists of the following:

The following table reconciles the expected amount of income tax expense based on
consolidated statutory rates to the actual amount of taxes recorded by the Company:



Samsung Corning Precision Glass Co., Ltd.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

The statutory income tax rate of the Company, including tax surcharges, is 24.2%, 27.5%
and 27.5% for 2009, 2008 and 2007, but the effective income tax rate is 12.83%, 13.49% and 15.50% for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, primarily due to tax exemption benefits for a foreign invested company under the Korean Tax Preference Control
Law (“TPCL”). In accordance with the TPCL and the approval of the Korean government, the Company was fully exempt from the corporate income taxes on the taxable income arising from the sales of manufactured goods in proportion to the
percentage of qualified foreign shareholder’s equity until 2003 and 50% exemption for the subsequent two years. In 2006, the Company issued additional shares to extend the tax exemption period. As a result, the Company is fully exempt from
corporate income taxes until 2010, and thereafter is subject to a 50% tax exemption for a period of 2 years to 2012.

As a
result of the revision of the Korean Corporate Tax Law in 2008, the statutory tax rate had been reduced to 24.2% from 2009 and was scheduled to go further down to 22% from 2010. However, in 2009, due to the concern over declining tax revenues and
increasing budget deficit, the National Assembly decided to defer the proposed rate cut for two years. As a result, the statutory tax rate would remain at 24.2% until the end of 2011, and the reduced 22% rate will take effect on January 1,
2012. The Company recognized its deferred income tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2009 based on the enacted future tax rates and the expiration schedule of tax exemption for foreign investment.

The primary components of the temporary differences that gave rise to the Company’s deferred income tax assets and liabilities were as
follows:

A valuation allowance on deferred income tax assets is recognized when it is more
likely than not that the deferred income tax assets will be realized. Realization of the future tax benefit related to the deferred income tax assets is dependent on many factors, including the Company’s ability to generate taxable income
within the period during which the temporary differences reverse, the outlook for the economic environment in which the Company operates, and the overall future industry outlook. Based upon analysis of these factors, the Company has recorded a
valuation allowance of $4,253 thousand and $4,410 thousand on its consolidated net deferred income tax assets at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The valuation allowance is primarily attributable to the uncertainty regarding the
generation of sufficient future taxable income of SCM to allow the benefit of the deferred income tax assets.

On
January 1, 2007, the Company adopted the provisions of ASC 740,

Income taxes

(formerly referenced as FASB Financial Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes – an interpretation of SFAS
No. 109)

. The Company believes that it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits of a tax position, that the Company is entitled to economic benefits resulting from positions taken in its income tax returns.

The Company files income tax return in Korea and various other jurisdictions with varying statutes of limitations. Years open to examination
by tax authorities in major jurisdictions are 2008 tax year in both Korea and Malaysia.

resolution as a voluntary reserve. This reserve may be reversed and transferred to unappropriated retained earnings by the resolution of shareholders and may be distributed as dividends after reversal.

12.

Commitments and Contingencies

Credit Facilities

As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the credit line of outstanding contracts and
agreements the Company entered into are as follows:

Business and Credit Risk Concentration

The Company sells its products on a credit basis to its customers including certain related parties. Management estimates the collectibility
of accounts receivable based on the financial condition of the customers and prevailing economic trends. Based on management’s estimates, the Company established allowances for doubtful accounts receivable which management believes are
adequate. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited to the credit worthiness of the Company’s customers. Major customers of the Company are domestic TFT-LCD makers incorporated in Korea. Trade accounts
receivables from these five major customers are 83% and 90% of total trade accounts receivable of the Company as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and revenues from these five major customers constitute 93%, 93% and 99% of total
revenues of the Company for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Pending Litigation

Based on the agreement entered on August 24, 1999 with respect to Samsung Motor Inc.’s (“SMI”) bankruptcy
proceedings, Samsung Motor Inc.’s creditors (“the Creditors”) filed a civil action against Mr. Kun Hee Lee, former chairman of the Company, and 28 Samsung Group affiliates including the Company under joint and several liability
for failing to comply with such agreement. Under the suit, the Creditors have sought (Won)2,450 billion (approximately $1.95 billion) for loss of principal on loans extended to SMI, a separate amount for breach of the agreement, and an amount for
default interest.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

On January 31, 2008, Seoul Administrative Court made the ruling on this case. Under
the ruling, Samsung Group affiliates were ordered to pay approximately (Won)1,634 billion (approximately $1.30 billion) to the Creditors by disposing 2,334,045 shares of Samsung Life Insurance Co., Ltd. (“SLI”) donated by Mr. Lee,
excluding 1,165,955 shares already sold by the Creditors. If the proceeds from sale of SLI shares are not sufficient to satisfy their obligations, Samsung Group affiliates were obligated to satisfy the shortfall by either participating in the
Creditors’ equity offering or purchasing subordinated debentures issued by the Creditors. In addition, Samsung Group affiliates were ordered to pay default interest on (Won)1,634 billion (approximately $1.30 billion) at 6% per annum for
the period from January 1, 2001 to the date of settlement.

The Company, Samsung Group affiliates, Mr. Lee, and the
Creditors all have appealed the ruling. The second trial ended on December 29, 2009 and Seoul High Court made a compulsory mediation that ordered Samsung Group affiliates to pay approximately (Won)208.6 billion (approximately $ 0.18 billion) to
the Creditors in default interest while Mr. Lee was ordered to pay additional 500,000 SLI shares. The compulsory mediation was to have the same force as final ruling unless the parties to this case issued a formal objection within two weeks. On
January 14, 2010, by mutual consent, the parties to this case decided to reject the compulsory mediation and delay the start of the third trial until the completion of public offering of the SLI shares.

In connection with an investigation by the Commission of the European Communities, Competition DG, of alleged anticompetitive behavior
relating to the worldwide production of LCD glass, Corning and SCP received a request on March 30, 2009, for certain information from the Competition DG. Corning and SCP have responded to the request for information. On October 9, 2009, in
connection with its investigation, the Competition DG made a further request for information from both Corning and SCP to which each party is responding.

The Company accounts for loss contingencies in accordance with ASC 450, Contingencies (formerly referenced as SFAS No. 5

“Accounting for Contingencies”

) and therefore, records a
liability when it is both probable that a loss will occur and the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. Due to the uncertainties around the financial impact of the above matters, the Company is unable to reasonably estimate the amount of
potential loss, if any, associated with these cases, and therefore, no provision for such loss is reflected in the Company’s financial statements.

In the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to certain litigation and other claims. These matters, individually and in the aggregate, are not expected to have a significant impact on the
Company’s financial position or results of operations.
