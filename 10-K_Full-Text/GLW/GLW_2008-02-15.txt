Item 1.  Business

General

Corning traces its origins to a glass business
established in 1851. The present corporation was incorporated in the State of New York in December 1936. The Company’s name was changed from Corning Glass Works to Corning Incorporated on April 28, 1989.

Corning is a global, technology-based corporation that operates in four reportable business segments: Display Technologies, Telecommunications, Environmental
Technologies and Life Sciences.

Display Technologies Segment

Corning’s Display Technologies segment manufactures glass substrates for active matrix liquid crystal displays (LCDs), that are used primarily in notebook computers, flat panel desktop monitors, and LCD televisions. Corning’s
facilities in Kentucky, Japan, Taiwan, and China and those of Samsung Corning Precision Glass Co., Ltd. (Samsung Corning Precision, which is 50% owned by Corning) in South Korea develop, manufacture and supply high quality glass substrates using a
proprietary fusion manufacturing process and technology expertise. Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. has a 43% interest in Samsung Corning Precision, which sells glass to LCD panel manufacturers in Korea. Three other shareholders own the remaining 7%
interest in Samsung Corning Precision. Panel manufacturers in the other leading LCD-producing areas of the world, Japan, Taiwan, Singapore and China, are supplied by Corning.

Corning has been a leader to market with new large-generation sized glass substrates used by our customers in the production of larger LCDs for monitors and television. We are recognized for providing product
innovations that help our customers produce larger, lighter, thinner and higher-resolution displays more affordably. Glass substrates are currently available from Corning in sizes up to Generation 8 (2160mm x 2460mm), which was introduced by Corning
in late 2006. In the fourth quarter of 2007, Corning announced its agreement with Sharp Corporation to develop and produce Generation 10 (2850mm x 3050mm) substrates. Large substrates (Generation 5 and higher) allow LCD manufacturers to produce
larger and a greater number of panels from each substrate. The larger size leads to economies of scale for LCD manufacturers and is expected to enable lower display prices for consumers in the future. At the end of 2007, approximately 88% of Corning
and Samsung Corning Precision’s volume of LCD glass was Generation 5 (1100mm x 1250mm) and higher.

Corning invented its proprietary fusion manufacturing process which is the cornerstone of the Company’s technology leadership in the LCD industry. The automated process yields high quality glass substrates with excellent dimensional
stability and uniformity – essential attributes for the production of increasingly larger, high performance active matrix LCDs. Corning’s fusion process is scalable and has proven to be among the most effective processes in producing large
size substrates. In 2006, Corning launched EAGLE XG

™

, the industry’s first environmentally-friendly LCD glass substrate that is free of heavy metals.

LCD glass manufacturing is a highly capital intensive business. Corning continues to make significant investments to expand its LCD glass facilities in response to
anticipated customer demand. The environment is very competitive. Important success attributes include efficient manufacturing, access to capital, technology know-how, and patents.

Patent protection and proprietary trade secrets are important to the segment’s operations. Corning has a growing portfolio of patents relating to its products, technologies and manufacturing processes. Corning
licenses certain of its patents to Samsung Corning Precision and other third parties and generates revenue from these licenses. Refer to the material under the heading “Patents and Trademarks” for information relating to patents and
trademarks.

The Display Technologies segment represented 45% of Corning’s sales for 2007.


Telecommunications Segment

The Telecommunications segment produces optical fiber and cable, and hardware and equipment products for the
worldwide telecommunications industry. Corning invented the world’s first low-loss optical fiber more than 30 years ago. It offers a range of optical fiber technology products and enhancements for a variety of applications, including premises,
fiber-to-the-premises access, metropolitan, long-haul and submarine networks. Corning makes and sells InfiniCor

®

fibers for local area networks, data centers and central offices;
NexCor

®

fiber for converged services networks; SMF-28e

®

single mode optical fiber that provides additional transmission
wavelengths in metropolitan and access networks; MetroCor

®

fiber products for metropolitan networks; LEAF

®

optical fiber for
long-haul, regional and metropolitan networks; ClearCurve™ fiber for use in multiple dwelling units; and Vascade

®

submarine optical fibers for use in submarine networks. Corning has
two large optical fiber manufacturing facilities in North Carolina and another facility in China. As a result of lowered demand for optical fiber products, in 2002 Corning mothballed its optical fiber manufacturing facility in Concord, North
Carolina and transferred certain capabilities to its Wilmington, North Carolina facility. In April 2007, Corning announced plans to re-open a portion of the Concord, North Carolina facility primarily as a result of volume growth in the optical fiber
market.

A significant portion of Corning’s optical fiber is sold to subsidiaries such as Corning Cable Systems LLC (Corning Cable Systems), and
Corning Cable Systems Polska Sp. Z o.o. Optical fiber is cabled prior to being sold to end users in cabled form. Our remaining fiber production is sold directly to end users or third party cablers around the world. Corning’s cabling operations
include facilities in North Carolina, Poland, and Germany and smaller regional locations and equity affiliates.

Corning’s hardware and equipment
products include cable assemblies, fiber optic hardware, fiber optic connectors, optical components and couplers, closures and pedestals, splice and test equipment and other accessories for optical connectivity. For copper connectivity,
Corning’s products include subscriber demarcation, connection and protection devices, xDSL (different variations of digital subscriber lines) passive solutions and outside plant enclosures. Each of the product lines may be combined in
Corning’s fiber-to-the-premises solutions. Corning has manufacturing operations for hardware and equipment products in North Carolina, Arizona, and Texas, as well as Europe, Mexico, China, and the Dominican Republic. In addition, Corning offers
products for the cable television industry, including coaxial connectors and associated tools.

Patent protection is important to the segment’s
operations. The segment has an extensive portfolio of patents relating to its products, technologies and manufacturing processes. The segment licenses certain of its patents to third parties and generates revenue from these licenses, but the royalty
revenue is not currently material to the business. Corning is also licensed to use certain patents owned by others. These licenses are also important to the segment’s operations. Refer to the material under the heading “Patents and
Trademarks” for information relating to the Company’s patents and trademarks.

The Telecommunications segment represented 30% of Corning’s
sales for 2007.

Environmental Technologies Segment

Corning’s environmental products include ceramic technologies and solutions for emissions and pollution control in mobile and stationary applications around the world, including gasoline and diesel substrate and filter products. In the
early 1970’s, Corning developed an economical, high-performance cellular ceramic substrate that is now the standard for catalytic converters worldwide. In response to tightening emission control obligations around the world, Corning has
continued to develop more efficient substrate products with higher density and greater surface area. Corning manufactures these products in New York, Virginia, China, Germany and South Africa. Corning continues to invest in new ceramic substrate and
filter technologies for diesel emission control device products at its facility in New York. Corning sells its ceramic substrate and filter products worldwide to manufacturers of emission control systems who then sell to automotive and diesel engine
manufacturers. Although sales are made to the emission control systems manufacturers, the use of Corning substrates and filters is generally required by the specifications of the automotive and diesel engine manufacturers.

Patent protection is important to the segment’s operations. The segment has an extensive portfolio of patents relating to its products, technologies and
manufacturing processes. The segment is also licensed to use certain patents owned by others. These licenses are also important to the segment’s operations. Refer to the material under the heading “Patents and Trademarks” for
information relating to the Company’s patents and trademarks.

The Environmental Technologies segment represented 13% of Corning’s sales for
2007.


Life Sciences Segment

Life Sciences laboratory products include microplate products, coated slides, filter plates for genomics sample
preparation, plastic cell culture dishes, flasks, cryogenic vials, roller bottles, mass cell culture products, liquid handling instruments, Pyrex

®

glass beakers, pipettors, serological
pipettes, centrifuge tubes and laboratory filtration products. Corning sells products under three primary brands: Corning, Costar and Pyrex. Corning manufactures these products in Maine, New York, and Mexico and markets them worldwide, primarily
through distributors, to government entities, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, hospitals, universities and other research facilities. In 2006, Corning announced the commercial launch of the Epic™ system, a high-throughput label-free
screening platform based on optical biosensor technology. The system offers drug developers the ability to evaluate promising new drug targets through both biochemical and cell-based drug discovery applications.

Patent protection is important to the segment’s operations, particularly for some of its new products. The segment has a growing portfolio of patents relating to
its products, technologies and manufacturing processes. Brand recognition, through some well known trademarks, is important to the segment. Refer to the material under the heading “Patents and Trademarks” for information relating to the

Competition

Corning competes across all of its product lines with many large and varied manufacturers, both domestic and foreign. Some of these competitors are larger than Corning, and some have broader product lines. Corning strives to maintain its
position through technology and product innovation. For the future, Corning believes its competitive advantage lies in its commitment to research and development, and its commitment to quality. There is no assurance that Corning will be able to
maintain its market position or competitive advantage.

Display Technologies Segment

Corning, including Samsung Corning Precision, is the largest worldwide producer of glass substrates for active matrix LCD displays. That market position remained relatively stable over the past year. Corning believes
it has competitive advantages in LCD glass substrate products from investing in new technologies, providing a consistent and reliable supply and using its proprietary fusion manufacturing process. This process allows us to deliver glass that is
larger, thinner and lighter with exceptional surface quality and without heavy metals. Asahi Glass, Nippon Electric Glass and NH Techno are Corning’s principal competitors in display glass substrates.

Telecommunications Segment

Competition within the
telecommunications equipment industry is intense among several significant companies. Corning is a leading competitor in the segment’s principal product lines which include optical fiber and cable and hardware and equipment. Price and new
product innovations are significant competitive factors. The competitive landscape has experienced increasing competition causing price pressure in all regions. These competitive conditions are likely to persist.

Corning is the largest producer of optical fiber and cable products, but faces significant competition due to continued excess capacity in the market place, price
pressure and new product innovations. Corning believes its large scale manufacturing experience, fiber process, technology leadership and intellectual property assets yield cost advantages relative to several of its competitors. The primary
competing producers of optical fiber and cable products are Furukawa Electric/OFS, Fujikura Ltd., Sumitomo Electric, Prysmian Cables & Systems and Draka Comteq.

For hardware and equipment products, significant competitors are 3M Company (3M), Tyco Electronics, Furukawa OFS, CommScope, and ADC Communications.

Environmental Technologies Segment

For worldwide automotive ceramic substrate products, Corning has a leading
market position that has remained relatively stable over the past year. Corning believes its competitive advantage in automotive ceramic substrate products for catalytic converters is based upon global presence, customer service, engineering design
services and product innovation. Corning’s Environmental Technologies products face principal competition from NGK, Denso, Ibiden and Emitec.

Life
Sciences Segment

Corning is a leading supplier of glass and plastic science laboratory products, with a growing plastics products market presence in
North America and Europe, and a solid laboratory glass products market presence. Corning seeks to maintain competitive advantages by emphasizing product quality, product availability, supply chain efficiency, a wide product line and superior product
attributes. For laboratory products, Schott, Kimble, Greiner and Becton Dickinson are the principal worldwide competitors. Corning also faces increasing competition from large distributors that have backward integrated or introduced private label
products.

Other Products

Corning is a leading
supplier of materials and products for lithography optics in the semiconductor industry. The market position for Other Products remained relatively stable during the past year. Corning seeks to compete by providing superior optical quality, leading
optical designs and a local Corning presence supporting its customers. For Corning’s semiconductor optical material products, general specialty glass/glass ceramic products and ophthalmic products, Schott, Shin-Etsu Quartz Products, Asahi Fine
Glass, Carl Zeiss, Nikon, Transitions Optical, Oerlikon, Hoya and Heraeus are the main competitors.

Samsung Corning was a leading producer of cathode ray
tube glass products for conventional televisions. Its relative competitive position remained stable over the past year, although there has been a significant decline in the industry as end-market customers have turned to flat panel displays or
projection technologies. On December 31, 2007, Samsung Corning Precision acquired all of the outstanding shares of Samsung Corning. After the transaction, Corning retained its 50% interest in Samsung Corning Precision.


Raw Materials

Corning’s production of specialty glasses, ceramics, and related materials requires significant quantities of energy, uninterrupted power sources, certain precious metals, and various batch materials.

Although energy shortages and power interruptions have not been a problem recently, the cost of energy has increased. Corning has achieved flexibility through important
engineering changes to take advantage of low-cost energy sources in most significant processes. Specifically, many of Corning’s principal manufacturing processes can be operated with natural gas, propane, oil or electricity, or a combination of
these energy sources.

As to resources (ores, minerals, polymers, and processed chemicals) required in manufacturing operations, availability appears to be
adequate. Corning’s suppliers, from time to time, may experience capacity limitations in their own operations, or may eliminate certain product lines; nevertheless, Corning believes it has adequate programs to ensure a reliable supply of batch
materials and precious metals. For many products, Corning has alternate glass compositions that would allow operations to continue without interruption in the event of specific materials shortages.

Certain key materials and proprietary equipment used in the manufacturing of products are currently sole sourced or available only from a limited number of suppliers.
Any future difficulty in obtaining sufficient and timely delivery of components could result in delays or reductions in product shipments, or reduce Corning’s gross margins.

Patents and Trademarks

Inventions by members of Corning’s research and engineering staff have been, and
continue to be, important to the Company’s growth. Patents have been granted on many of these inventions in the United States and other countries. Some of these patents have been licensed to other manufacturers, including companies in which
Corning has equity investments. Many of the earlier patents have now expired, but Corning continues to seek and obtain patents protecting its newer innovations. In 2007, Corning was granted over 180 patents in the U.S. and over 350 patents in
countries outside the U.S.

Each business segment possesses its own patent portfolio that provides certain competitive advantages in protecting
Corning’s innovations. Corning has historically enforced, and will continue to enforce, its intellectual property rights. At the end of 2007, Corning and its wholly owned subsidiaries owned over 4,300 unexpired patents in various countries of
which about 2,300 were U.S. patents. Between 2008 and 2010, approximately 11% of these patents will expire, while at the same time Corning intends to seek patents protecting its newer innovations. Worldwide, Corning has over 4,000 patent
applications in process, with about 1,100 in process in the U.S. Corning believes that its patent portfolio will continue to provide a competitive advantage in protecting Corning’s innovation, although Corning’s competitors in each of its
businesses are actively seeking patent protection as well.

The Display Technologies segment has over 260 patents in various countries of which over 100
are U.S. patents. No one patent is considered material to this business segment. Some of the important issued U.S. patents in this segment include patents relating to glass compositions and methods for the use and manufacture of glass substrates for
display applications. There is no group of important Display Technology segment patents set to expire between 2008 and 2010.

The Telecommunications
segment has over 1,600 patents in various countries of which over 800 are U.S. patents. No one patent is considered material to this business segment. Some of the important issued U.S. patents in this segment include: (i) patents relating to
optical fiber products including dispersion compensating fiber, low loss optical fiber and high data rate optical fiber and processes and equipment for manufacturing optical fiber including methods for making optical fiber preforms and methods for
drawing, cooling and winding optical fiber; (ii) patents relating to optical fiber ribbons and methods for making such ribbon, fiber optic cable designs and methods for installing optical fiber cable; and (iii) patents relating to optical

Many of these patents are used in Corning’s operations or are licensed for use by others, and Corning is licensed to
use patents owned by others. Corning has entered into cross licensing arrangements with some major competitors, but the scope of such licenses has been limited to specific product areas or technologies.

Corning’s principal trademarks include the following: Corning, Celcor, DuraTrap, Eagle2000, EagleXG, Epic, Evolant, HPFS, Lanscape, Pyrex, ClearCurve, SMF-28e,
Jade, Vita, and Steuben.

Protection of the Environment

Corning has a program to ensure that its facilities are in compliance with state, federal and foreign pollution-control regulations. This program has resulted in capital and operating expenditures during the past several years. In order to
maintain compliance with such regulations, capital expenditures for pollution control in continuing operations were approximately $21 million in 2007 and are estimated to be $19 million in 2008.

Corning’s 2007 operating results from continuing operations were charged with approximately $51 million for depreciation, maintenance, waste disposal and other
operating expenses associated with pollution control. Corning believes that its compliance program will not place it at a competitive disadvantage.

Employees

At December 31, 2007, Corning had approximately 24,800 full-time employees, including approximately 10,400 employees
in the United States. From time to time, Corning also retains consultants, independent contractors, and temporary and part-time workers. Unions are certified as bargaining agents for approximately 30% of Corning’s United States employees.

Corning’s ten largest customers account for about 50% of our sales. No individual customer accounts for more than 10% of consolidated sales except for AU Optronics Corporation (AUO) which accounted for 12% of
consolidated sales in 2007.

In addition, a relatively small number of customers accounted for a high percentage of net sales in each of
our reportable operating segments. For 2007, three customers of the Display Technologies segment, which individually accounted for more than 10% of segment net sales, represented 62% of total segment sales when combined. In the Telecommunications
segment, two customers, which individually accounted for more than 10% of segment net sales, represented 25% of total segment sales when combined. In the Environmental Technologies segment, three customers, which individually accounted for more than
10% of segment net sales, represented 81% of total segment sales in aggregate. In the Life Sciences segment, one distributor accounted for 44% of this segment’s sales in 2007.

Samsung Corning Precision’s sales were also concentrated in 2007, with sales to two LCD panel makers located in South Korea accounting for
approximately 93% of total Samsung Corning Precision sales.

Although the sale of LCD glass substrates has increased in 2007, there can be
no assurance that positive trends will continue. Our customers are LCD panel and color filter makers. As they switch to larger size glass, the pace of their orders may be uneven while they adjust their manufacturing processes and facilities.
Additionally, consumer preferences for panels of differing sizes, price, or other seasonal factors, may lead to pauses in market growth from time to time. Our customers may not be able to maintain profitable operations or access sufficient capital
to fund ongoing and future planned expansions, which may limit their pace of orders to us. Emerging material technologies could replace our glass substrates for certain applications resulting in a decline in demand for our LCD products. Technologies
for displays in competition with LCD panels may reduce or eliminate the need for our glass substrate. These technologies may include organic light emitting diodes and plasma display panels. New process technologies developed by our competitors may
also place us at a cost or quality disadvantage in the workplace. Our inability to manufacture glass substrates in the sizes and quantities needed by our customers may result in loss of revenue, margins and profits or liabilities for failure to
supply. A scarcity of resources, limitations on technology, personnel or other factors resulting in a failure to produce commercial quantities of very large size glass substrates, particularly from new facilities being constructed at a major
customer in Japan, could have adverse financial consequences to us.

Our Telecommunications segment customers’ purchases of our
products are affected by their capital expansion plans, general market and economic uncertainty and regulatory changes, including broadband policy. Sales in the Telecommunications segment are expected to be impacted by the pace of Verizon
Communication Inc. (Verizon) fiber-to-the-premises deployments. Our sales will be dependent on Verizon’s planned targets for homes passed and connected. Changes in Verizon’s deployment plan could adversely affect future sales in any
quarter or for the full year.


In the Environmental Technologies segment, sales of our ceramic substrate and filter products for
automotive and diesel emissions and pollution control are expected to fluctuate with vehicle production. Changes in governmental laws and regulations for air quality and emission controls may also influence future sales. Sales in our Environmental
Technologies segment are to four catalyzers and emission system component manufacturers. Our customers sell these systems to automotive original equipment manufacturers and diesel engine manufacturers. Sales within this segment may be affected by
adverse developments in the U.S. vehicle or freight hauling industries or by such factors as higher fuel prices that may affect vehicle sales or downturns in freight traffic.

Sales in our Life Sciences segment were historically through two large distributors to government entities, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies,
hospitals, universities and other research facilities. During 2005, we did not renew the contract with one large distributor and transitioned the sales through this distributor to our remaining primary distributor and other existing and developing
channels. This change had an adverse impact on sales volumes. In 2007, our remaining primary distributor accounted for 44% of Life Sciences segment sales. Changes in our distribution arrangements in this segment may adversely affect this
segment’s financial results.

If the markets for our products do not develop and expand as we anticipate, demand for our products may decline,
which would negatively impact our results of operations and financial performance

The markets for our products are characterized by
rapidly changing technologies, evolving industry or government standards and new product introductions. Our success is expected to depend, in substantial part, on the successful introduction of new products, or upgrades of current products, and our
ability to compete with new technologies. The following factors related to our products and markets, if not achieved, could have an adverse impact on our results of operations:

•

our ability to introduce leading products such as glass substrates for liquid crystal displays, optical fiber and cable and hardware and equipment, and
environmental substrate and filter products that can command competitive prices;

•

our ability to manufacture adequate quantities of increasingly larger glass substrates to satisfy our customers requirements and our contractual obligations;

•

continued strong demand for notebook computers and LCD monitors;

•

growth in purchases of LCD televisions to replace other technologies;

•

screen size of LCD televisions, which affects glass demand;

•

our ability to develop new products in response to government regulations and laws, particularly diesel filter products in the Environmental Technologies segment;
and

•

growth of the fiber-to-the-premises build-out in North America.

We face pricing pressures in each of our leading businesses that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial performance

We face pricing pressure in each of our leading businesses as a result of intense competition, emerging new technologies, or over-capacity. While we will
work toward reducing our costs to offset pricing pressures, we may not be able to achieve proportionate reductions in costs or to sustain our current rate of cost reduction We anticipate pricing pressures will continue into 2008 and beyond on a
number of our products. Although we have reduced the rate of price decline in 2007 in our Display Technologies segment and plan to continue to do so in 2008, we cannot be assured of success. Our 2008 pricing strategy in our Display Technologies
segment may also result in lost market share and lower volumes.


We face risks related to our international operations and sales

We have customers and significant operations, including manufacturing and sales, located outside the U.S. We have large manufacturing operations for
liquid crystal display glass substrates in Taiwan and the Asia-Pacific region, including an equity investment in Samsung Corning Precision operating in South Korea that makes glass substrates for the LCD market. All of our Display segment customers
are located in the Asia-Pacific region. As a result of these and other international operations, we face a number of risks, including:

•

geographical concentration of our factories and operations;

•

periodic health epidemic concerns;

•

difficulty of managing global operations;

•

difficulty in protecting intellectual property;

•

tariffs, duties and other trade barriers including anti-dumping duties;

•

differing legal systems;

•

natural disasters;

•

potential power loss affecting glass production and equipment damage;

•

political and economic instability in foreign markets; and

•

foreign currency risk.

Any of these
items could cause our sales or profitability to be significantly reduced.

Additionally, because a significant amount of the specialized
manufacturing capacity for our Display Technologies segment is concentrated in Asia, it is at least reasonably possible that the use of a facility located outside of an entity’s home country could be disrupted. Due to the specialized nature of
the assets, it would not be possible to find replacement capacity quickly. Accordingly, loss of these facilities could produce a near-term severe impact to our display business and the Company as a whole.

We face risks due to foreign currency fluctuations

Because we have significant customers and operations outside the U.S., fluctuations in foreign currencies, especially the Japanese yen, the New Taiwan dollar, the Korean won, and the euro, affect our sales and profit levels. Foreign
exchange rates may make our products less competitive in countries where local currencies decline in value relative to the dollar and Japanese yen. Sales in our Display Technologies segment, representing 45% of Corning’s sales in 2007, are
denominated in Japanese yen. The expected sales growth of the Display Technologies segment will increase our exposure to currency fluctuations. Corning hedges significant transaction and balance sheet currency exposures and uses derivatives
instruments to limit exposure to foreign currency fluctuations associated with certain monetary assets and liabilities as well as operating results. Although we hedge these items, changes in exchange rates (especially the Japanese yen to U.S.
dollar) may significantly impact our reported revenues and results of operations.

If the financial condition of our customers declines, our credit
risks could increase

Although we have a rigorous process to administer credit and believe our reserve is adequate, we have
experienced, and in the future may experience, losses as a result of our inability to collect our accounts receivable. If our customers fail to meet their payment obligations to us, we could experience reduced cash flows and losses in excess of
amounts reserved. Some customers of our Display Technologies segment are thinly capitalized and/or marginally profitable. In our Environmental products segment, the U.S. auto customers and certain of their suppliers have encountered credit
downgrades. These factors may result in an inability to collect receivables or a possible loss in business. As of December 31, 2007, reserves and allowances for trade receivables totaled approximately $20 million.

If we do not successfully adjust our manufacturing volumes and fixed cost structure, or achieve manufacturing yields or sufficient product reliability, our operating
results could suffer, and we may not achieve anticipated profitability levels

We are investing heavily in additional manufacturing
capacity of certain businesses, including liquid crystal display glass and diesel emission substrates and filters. The speed of constructing the new facilities presents challenges. We may face technical and process issues in moving to commercial
production. There can be no assurance that Corning will be able to pace its capacity expansion to the actual demand. It is possible that manufacturing capacity may exceed or lag customer demand during certain periods.

The manufacturing of our products involves highly complex and precise processes, requiring production in highly controlled and dust-free environments.
Changes in our manufacturing processes could significantly reduce our manufacturing yields and product reliability. In some cases, existing manufacturing may be insufficient to achieve the requirements of our customers. We will need to develop new
manufacturing processes and techniques to achieve targeted volume, pricing and cost levels that will permit profitable operations. While we continue to fund projects to improve our manufacturing techniques and processes, we may not achieve
satisfactory cost levels in our manufacturing activities that will fully satisfy our profitability targets.


Our future operating results depend on our ability to purchase a sufficient amount of materials, parts, and
manufacturing equipment components to meet the demands of our customers

Our ability to meet customer demand depends, in part, on our
ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of materials, parts and components from our suppliers. We may experience shortages that could adversely affect our operations. Although we work closely with our suppliers to avoid shortages, there can
be no assurances that we will not encounter these problems in the future. Furthermore, certain manufacturing equipment, raw materials or components are available only from a single source or limited sources. We may not be able to find alternate
sources in a timely manner. A reduction, interruption or delay of supply, or a significant increase in the price for supplies, such as manufacturing equipment, raw materials or energy, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses.

We have incurred, and may in the future incur, restructuring and other charges, the amounts of which are difficult to predict accurately

We have recorded several charges for restructuring, impairment of assets, and the write-off of cost and equity based investments. It
is possible we may record additional charges for restructuring or other asset impairments if additional actions become necessary.

We have incurred, and
may in the future incur, goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges

At December 31, 2007, Corning had goodwill and
other intangible assets of $308 million. While we believe the estimates and judgments about future cash flows used in the goodwill impairment tests are reasonable, we cannot provide assurance that future impairment charges will not be required if
the expected cash flow estimates as projected by management do not occur.

If our products or materials purchased from our suppliers experience
performance issues, our business will suffer

Our business depends on the production of products of consistently high quality. Our
products, components and materials purchased from our suppliers, are typically tested for quality. These testing procedures are limited to evaluating our products under likely and foreseeable failure scenarios. For various reasons, our products,
including materials purchased from our suppliers, may fail to perform as expected. In some cases, product redesigns or additional expense may be required to correct a defect. A significant or systemic product failure could result in customer
relations problems, lost sales, and financial damages.

We face competition in most of our businesses

We expect that we will face additional competition from existing competitors, low cost manufacturers and new entrants. We must invest in research and
development, expand our engineering, manufacturing and marketing capabilities, and continue to improve customer service and support in order to remain competitive. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to maintain or improve our
competitive position.

Accounting and disclosure rules may affect financial results

Generally accepted accounting principles and accompanying accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines, and interpretations for many areas of our
business, such as revenue recognition, accounting for investments, and accounting for stock options, are very complex and involve significant and sometimes subjective judgments. Changes in these rules or their interpretation could significantly
impact our reported earnings and operating income and could add significant volatility to those measures in the future, without a corresponding change in our cash flows.

We rely on key personnel and the loss of their services or the inability to attract and retain them may negatively affect our businesses

Our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified research and development, engineering and operating personnel, generally and during
periods of rapid growth, especially in those of our businesses focused on new products and advanced manufacturing processes, is essential to our business success. We also depend on the services of experienced key senior management.

The loss of the services of any of our key research and development, engineering or operational personnel or senior management without adequate
replacement, or the inability to attract new qualified personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our operations.


We are subject to strict environmental regulations and regulatory changes that could result in fines or restrictions
that interrupt our operations

Our manufacturing process generates chemical waste, waste water and other industrial waste and various
green house gases at various stages in the manufacturing process, and we are currently or may be in the future subject to a variety of laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of such substances. We have installed
various types of anti-pollution equipment for the treatment of chemical waste and waste water at our various facilities. However, we cannot provide assurance that environmental claims will not be brought against us or that the local or national
governments will not take steps toward adopting more stringent environment standards.

Any failure on our part to comply with any present
or future environmental regulations could result in the assessment of damages or imposition of fines against us, suspension/cessation of production or operations. In addition, environmental regulations could require us to acquire costly equipment,
incur other significant compliance expenses or limit or restrict production or operations and thus materially and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Changes in regulations and the regulatory environment in the United States and other countries,
such as those resulting from the regulation and impact of global warming and CO


abatement, may affect our businesses and their results in adverse ways by,
among other things, substantially increasing manufacturing costs, limiting availability of scarce resources, especially energy, or requiring limitations on production and sale of our products or those of our customers.

We may experience difficulties in enforcing our intellectual property rights and we may be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of
others

We may encounter difficulties in protecting our intellectual property rights or obtaining rights to additional intellectual
property necessary to permit us to continue or expand our businesses. We cannot assure you that the patents that we hold or may obtain will provide meaningful protection against our competitors. Changes in law concerning intellectual property may
affect our ability to protect our intellectual property. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights. Litigation is inherently uncertain and the outcome is often unpredictable. Other companies hold patents on technologies
used in our industries and are aggressively seeking to expand, enforce and license their patent portfolios.

The intellectual property
rights of others could inhibit our ability to introduce new products. We are, and may in the future be, subject to claims of intellectual property infringement or misappropriation that may result in loss of revenue, require us to incur substantial
costs, or lead to monetary damages or injunctive relief against us. We cannot assure you as to the outcome of any such claims.

Current or future
litigation may harm our financial condition or results of operations

Pending, threatened or future litigation is subject to inherent
uncertainties. Our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected by unfavorable outcomes, expenses and costs exceeding amounts estimated or insured. In particular, we have been named as a defendant in numerous lawsuits
alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos. As described in Legal Proceedings, our negotiations with the representatives of asbestos claimants produced a tentative plan of settlement through a PCC Plan of Reorganization, but this Plan was
not confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court. The proponents of the Plan have moved for reconsideration of the order entered by the Court on December 21, 2006 denying Plan confirmation. It is reasonably possible that changes to the Plan will be
negotiated, but the elements of the Plan and final approval are subject to a number of contingencies. Total charges of $1 billion have been recorded through December 31, 2007; however, additional charges or credits are possible due to the
potential fluctuation in the price of our common stock, other adjustments in the proposed settlement, and other litigation factors.

We face risks
through our equity method investments in companies that we do not control

Corning’s net income includes significant equity in
earnings of associated companies. For the year ended December 31, 2007, we recognized $942 million of equity earnings, of which $927 million came from our two largest investments: Dow Corning Corporation (which makes silicone products) and
Samsung Corning Precision (which makes liquid crystal display glass). Samsung Corning Precision is located in the Asia-Pacific region and is subject to political and geographic risks mentioned above, as well as business and other risks within the
Display segment. Our equity investments may not continue to perform at the same levels as in recent years. In 2006 and 2007, we recognized equity losses associated with Samsung Corning Co., Ltd. (our 50% equity method investment that makes glass
panels and funnels for conventional televisions), which recorded fixed asset and other impairment charges.


We may not have adequate insurance coverage for claims against us

We face the risk of loss resulting from product liability, securities, fiduciary liability, intellectual property, antitrust, contractual, warranty,
environmental, fraud and other lawsuits, whether or not such claims are valid. In addition, our product liability, fiduciary, directors and officers, property, natural catastrophe and comprehensive general liability insurance may not be adequate to
cover such claims or may not be available to the extent we expect. Our insurance costs can be volatile and, at any time, can increase given changes in market supply and demand. We may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage in the future
at acceptable costs. A successful claim that exceeds or is not covered by our policies could require us to pay substantial sums. Some of the carriers in our excess insurance programs are in liquidation and may not be able to respond if we should
have claims reaching into excess layers. The financial health of other insurers may deteriorate. Several of our insurance carriers are litigating with us the extent, if any, of their obligation to provide insurance coverage for asbestosis
liabilities asserted against us. The results of that litigation may adversely affect our insurance coverage for those risks. In addition, we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage for certain risk such as political risk, terrorism or
war.


Other

Additional information in response to Item 1 is found in Note 18 (Operating Segments) to the consolidated financial statements and selected financial data.

Item 1B.   Unresolved Staff Comments

None.

Item 2.   Properties

We operate
approximately 48 manufacturing plants and processing facilities, of which approximately one half are located in the U.S. We own substantially all of our executive and corporate buildings, which are located in Corning, New York. We also own
substantially all of our manufacturing and research and development facilities and more than half of our sales and administrative facilities.

For the
years ended 2007, 2006 and 2005, we invested a total of $4 billion, primarily in facilities outside the U.S. in our Display Technologies segment. Of the $1.3 billion spent in 2007, $585 million was for facilities outside the U.S.

Manufacturing, sales and administrative, and research and development facilities have an aggregate floor space of approximately 24 million square feet. Distribution
of this total area follows:

Total assets and capital expenditures by operating segment are included in Note 18 (Operating Segments) to the
Consolidated Financial Statements. Information concerning lease commitments is included in Note 13 (Commitments, Contingencies, and Guarantees) to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

During 2007, we continued the restructuring program that closed or consolidated certain smaller manufacturing facilities. Throughout 2008, we expect to have excess manufacturing capacity in our Telecommunications
segment and will not utilize a portion of space in the facilities listed above. The largest unused portion is our optical fiber manufacturing facility in Concord, North Carolina that was mothballed in 2002 as a result of lowered demand of optical
fiber products. In April 2007, Corning announced plans to re-open a portion of the Concord, North Carolina facility as a result of volume growth in the optical fiber market.

Item 3.   Legal Proceedings

Environmental Litigation.

Corning has been named by the
Environmental Protection Agency (the Agency) under the Superfund Act, or by state governments under similar state laws, as a potentially responsible party at 20 active hazardous waste sites. Under the Superfund Act, all parties who may have
contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site, identified by the Agency, are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the Agency agrees otherwise. It is Corning’s policy to accrue for its estimated liability related to
Superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned by Corning based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants. Corning has accrued approximately $19 million (undiscounted) for
its estimated liability for environmental cleanup and litigation at December 31, 2007. Based upon the information developed to date, management believes that the accrued reserve is a reasonable estimate of the Company’s liability and that
the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote.

Dow Corning Bankruptcy.

Corning and Dow Chemical each
own 50% of the common stock of Dow Corning. In May 1995, Dow Corning filed for bankruptcy protection to address pending and claimed liabilities arising from many thousands of breast implant product lawsuits. On June 1, 2004, Dow Corning emerged
from Chapter 11 with a Plan of Reorganization (the Plan) which provided for the settlement or other resolution of implant claims. The Plan also includes releases for Corning and Dow Chemical as shareholders in exchange for contributions to the Plan.


Under the terms of the Plan, Dow Corning has established and is funding a Settlement Trust and a Litigation Facility to
provide a means for tort claimants to settle or litigate their claims. Inclusive of insurance, Dow Corning has paid approximately $1.5 billion to the Settlement Trust. As of December 31, 2007, Dow Corning had recorded a reserve for breast
implant litigation of $1.7 billion and anticipates insurance receivables of $131 million. As a separate matter arising from the bankruptcy proceedings, Dow Corning is defending claims asserted by a number of commercial creditors who claim additional
interest at default rates and enforcement costs, during the period from May 1995 through June 2004. On July 26, 2006, the U.S. Court of Appeals vacated the judgment of the District Court fixing the interest component, ruled that default
interest and enforcement costs may be awarded subject to equitable factors to be determined, and directed that the matter be remanded for further proceedings. Dow Corning’s petition for rehearing by the Court of Appeals and its petition for a
writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court were both denied. As of December 31, 2007, Dow Corning has estimated the interest payable to commercial creditors to be within the range of $71 million to $236 million. As Dow Corning management
believes no single amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other amount within the range, Dow Corning has recorded the minimum liability within the range. Should Dow Corning not prevail in this matter, Corning’s equity
earnings would be reduced by its 50% share of the amount in excess of $71 million, net of applicable tax benefits. There are a number of other claims in the bankruptcy proceedings against Dow Corning awaiting resolution by the U.S. District Court,
and it is reasonably possible that Dow Corning may record bankruptcy-related charges in the future. There are no remaining tort implant claims against Corning, other than those that will be channeled by the Plan into facilities established by the
Plan or otherwise defended by the Litigation Facility.

Pittsburgh Corning Corporation.

Corning and PPG Industries, Inc. (PPG) each own 50% of the
capital stock of Pittsburgh Corning Corporation (PCC). Over a period of more than two decades, PCC and several other defendants have been named in numerous lawsuits involving claims alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos. On
April 16, 2000, PCC filed for Chapter 11 reorganization in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. As a result of PCC’s bankruptcy filing, Corning recorded an after-tax charge of $36 million in 2001 to fully
impair its investment in PCC and discontinued recognition of equity earnings. At the time PCC filed for bankruptcy protection, there were approximately 12,400 claims pending against Corning in state court lawsuits alleging various theories of
liability based on exposure to PCC’s asbestos products and typically requesting monetary damages in excess of one million dollars per claim. Corning has defended those claims on the basis of the separate corporate status of PCC and the absence
of any facts supporting claims of direct liability arising from PCC’s asbestos products. Corning is also currently named in approximately 10,300 other cases (approximately 41,700 claims) alleging injuries from asbestos and similar amounts of
monetary damages per claim. Those cases have been subject to the preliminary injunction described below and prior to the injunction were covered by insurance without material impact to Corning to date. Asbestos litigation is inherently difficult,
and past trends in resolving these claims may not be indicators of future outcomes.

In the bankruptcy court in April 2000, PCC obtained a preliminary
injunction against the prosecution of asbestos actions arising from PCC’s products against its two shareholders to afford the parties a period of time in which to negotiate a plan of reorganization for PCC (the PCC Plan).

On May 14, 2002, PPG announced that it had agreed with certain of its insurance carriers and representatives of current and future asbestos claimants on the terms
of a settlement arrangement applicable to claims arising from PCC’s products.

On March 28, 2003, Corning announced that it had reached agreement
with the representatives of asbestos claimants for the settlement of all current and future asbestos claims against it and PCC, which might arise from PCC products or operations. The proposed settlement, if the PCC Plan is approved and becomes
effective, would require Corning to relinquish its equity interest in PCC, contribute its equity interest in Pittsburgh Corning Europe N.V. (PCE), a Belgian corporation, and contribute 25 million shares of Corning common stock. Corning would
also pay a total of $140 million in six annual installments (present value $131 million at March 2003), beginning one year after the PCC Plan becomes effective, with 5.5 percent interest from June 2004, and assign certain insurance policy proceeds
from its primary insurance and a portion of its excess insurance at the time of settlement.

The PCC Plan received a favorable vote from creditors in March
2004. Hearings to consider objections to the PCC Plan were held in the Bankruptcy Court in May 2004. In February 2006, the Bankruptcy Court requested that the PCC Plan proponents delete references to Section 105(a) of the Bankruptcy Code and
resubmit the PCC Plan. The final round of oral argument was held on July 21, 2006.

On December 21, 2006, the Bankruptcy Court issued an order
denying confirmation of the PCC Plan for reasons set out in a memorandum opinion. Several parties, including Corning, filed motions for reconsideration. These motions were argued on March 5, 2007, and the Bankruptcy Court reserved decision. On
January 10, 2008, some of the parties in the proceeding advised the Bankruptcy Court that they had made substantial progress on an Amended Plan of Reorganization that would make it unnecessary for the Bankruptcy Court to decide the motion for
reconsideration. If the Bankruptcy Court does not approve the PCC Plan in its current form or parties to the proceedings agree to amend the PCC Plan, changes to the PCC Plan are reasonably likely to occur that could significantly reduce the value
Corning would pay in such a changed plan.


The outcome of these proceedings is uncertain, and confirmation of the current PCC Plan or any amended PCC Plan is
subject to a number of contingencies. However, apart from the quarterly mark-to-market adjustment in the value of the components of the settlement, management believes that the likelihood of a material adverse impact to Corning’s financial
statements is remote.

Two of Corning’s primary insurers and several excess insurers have commenced litigation for a declaration of the rights and
obligations of the parties under insurance policies, including rights that may be affected by the settlement arrangement described above. Corning is vigorously contesting these cases. Management is unable to predict the outcome of this insurance
litigation.

Since March 31, 2003, we have recorded total net charges of $1 billion to reflect the agreed settlement contributions and subsequent
adjustments for the change in the settlement value of the components.

The liability expected to be settled by contribution of our investment in PCE,
assigned insurance proceeds, and the 25 million shares of our common stock, which totals $833 million at December 31, 2007, is recorded in the other accrued liabilities component in our consolidated balance sheets. This portion of the PCC
liability is considered a “due on demand” obligation. Accordingly, this portion of the obligation has been classified as a current liability even though it is possible that the contribution could be made beyond one year. The remaining
portion of the settlement liability, which totals $169 million at December 31, 2007, representing the net present value of the cash payments, is recorded in the other liabilities component in our consolidated balance sheets.

Seoul Guarantee Insurance Co. and other creditors against Samsung Group and affiliates.

Prior to their merger, Samsung Corning Precision Glass Co., Ltd. (Samsung
Corning Precision) and Samsung Corning Co. Ltd. (Samsung Corning) were two of approximately thirty co-defendants in a lawsuit filed by Seoul Guarantee Insurance Co. and fourteen other creditors (SGI and Creditors) for alleged breach of an agreement
that approximately thirty affiliates of the Samsung group entered into with SGI and Creditors in September 1999 (“the Agreement”). The lawsuit is pending in the courts of South Korea. According to the Agreement, the Samsung affiliates
agreed to sell 3.5 million shares of Samsung Life Insurance Co., Ltd. (SLI) by December 31, 2000, which were transferred to SGI and Creditors in connection with the petition for court receivership of Samsung Motor Inc. In the lawsuit, SGI
and Creditors allege that, in the event that the proceeds of sale of the SLI shares is less than 2.45 trillion Korean won (approximately $2.64 billion), the Samsung affiliates allegedly agreed to compensate SGI and Creditors for the shortfall, by
other means, including the sale of an additional 500,000 SLI shares and Samsung affiliates’ purchase of equity or subordinated debentures to be issued by SGI and Creditors. Any excess proceeds from the sale of the SLI shares are to be
distributed to the Samsung affiliates. The suit asks for total damages of 4.73 trillion Korean won (approximately $5.11 billion) plus penalty interest. On January, 31, 2008, the court in this case ruled that the Agreement was valid and that Samsung
affiliates have a joint and severable liability for the principal (less a proportion of that amount for any SLI shares sold by any of the SLI Creditors), plus interest at a rate of 6% per annum. The total amount payable under the court ruling
was $2.44 billion Korean won ($1.70 billion in principal and the remainder in interest). Due to the uncertainties around the financial impact to each of the respective Samsung affiliates, Samsung Corning Precision is unable to reasonably estimate
the amount of potential loss associated with this case and therefore no provision for such loss is reflected in its financial statements. Other than as described above, no claim in these matters has been asserted against Corning Incorporated or any
of its affiliates.

Ellsworth Industrial Park, Downers Grove, IL Environmental Litigation.

In August 2005, Corning was named as a fourth party
defendant in a class action, Ann Muniz v. Rexnord Corp, filed in the U.S. District Court for the N.D. Illinois, claiming an unspecified amount of damages and asserting various personal injury and property damage claims against a number of corporate
defendants. These claims allegedly arise from the release of solvents from the operations of several manufacturers at the Ellsworth Industrial Park into soil and ground water. On July 10, 2006, plaintiffs settled with a number of defendants and
third-party defendants for $15.75 million, and the settling defendants mediated allocation. In November 2006, Corning settled with three of the third-party defendants for a total of approximately $99,000. The trial of the claim of the remaining
third-party defendant has been scheduled for March 2008. Corning was also named as a third or fourth party defendant in two personal injury lawsuits and a cost-recovery action by the State of Illinois against a number of corporate defendants as a
result of an alleged groundwater contamination at this industrial park site. In February 2007, Corning settled all claims in one of the personal injury lawsuits for $60,000 and in July 2007 settled all claims in the second personal injury lawsuit
for $25,000. Corning has a number of defenses to the remaining cases, which management intends to contest vigorously. Management believes these matters are not likely to be material to the financial statements of Corning in any period.


Astrium Insurance Litigation.

In February 2007, American Motorists Insurance Company and Lumbermens Mutual
Casualty Company (collectively “AMICO”) filed a declaratory judgment action against Corning, Corning NetOptix, Inc., OFC Corporation, Optical Filter Corporation, Galileo Electro-Optics Corporation, Galileo Corporation and NetOptix
Corporation in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, seeking reimbursement for approximately $14 million in defense costs incurred to defend all defendants, except Corning, in an underlying lawsuit entitled

Astrium
S.A.S., et al. v. TRW, Inc., et al.

Defendants’ answers to the complaint were filed on March 5, 2007 and the parties have exchanged initial discovery disclosures. Mediation conducted on November 29, 2007 did not resolve the case,
and the parties are engaging in discovery. Management believes that there are strong defenses to these claims and that the claims are not likely to be material to the financial statements of Corning.

Bruce Technology LLC.

On January 23, 2008, Bruce Technology LLC and Richard Pitbladdo filed a complaint for patent infringement in the U.S. District Court
for the Central District of California against Corning Incorporated, Corning Display Technologies Taiwan Co., LTD, Corning Japan K.K., Sharp Corporation, Sharp Electronics Corporation, Sharp Electronica Mexico S.A. de C.V., LG Philips LCD Co., LTD.,
LG Philips LCD America, Inc., and additional defendants yet to be specifically named. The complaint alleges that two United States patents, concerning the manufacture of LCD display glass, are being infringed by the defendants’ manufacture, use
and sale of LCD display glass substrates and the products containing such substrates. The complaint seeks unspecified damages. Recognizing that the outcome of litigation is uncertain, management believes that these claims are without merit and are
not likely to have a material impact on the financial statements of Corning.

Item 7.   Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Overview

Our key priorities for 2007
remained unchanged from the previous three years: protect our financial health, improve our profitability, and invest in the future. We made significant progress on these in 2007.

Financial Health

In 2007, our balance sheet remained strong and we delivered strong cash flows from
operating activities. Significant items in 2007 included the following:

•

In the first quarter, we repurchased $223 million of our 6.25% Euro notes due in 2010.

•

In the second quarter, all three of our rating agencies upgraded our debt ratings to BBB+ or the equivalent.

•

Operating cash flow for the year was $2.1 billion which was significantly greater than our $1.3 billion of capital spending.

•

In the third quarter of 2007, we began paying dividends on the Company’s common stock.

•

We repurchased 10.5 million shares of common stock for $250 million as part of a repurchase program announced in the second quarter.

We ended 2007 with $3.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. This represents an increase of $349 million from
December 31, 2006.

Our revolving credit facility, amended in November 2006, provides committed access to a $1.1 billion unsecured multi-currency
revolving line of credit through March 2011. We believe we have sufficient liquidity for the next several years to fund operations, the asbestos settlement, research and development, capital expenditures, scheduled debt repayments, dividend
payments, and our stock repurchase program.

Profitability

For the year ended December 31, 2007, we generated net income of $2.2 billion or $1.34 per share compared to net income of $1.9 billion or $1.16 per share for 2006. The improvement in net income was due largely
to the following items:

•

Higher net income in the Display Technologies segment driven by strong sales volumes and an increase in equity earnings from Samsung Corning Precision when compared
to 2006.

•

Higher net income in the Telecommunications segment primarily due to market growth for telecommunications products and the absence of an impairment charge, which
totaled $44 million in 2006.

•

Higher net income in the Environmental Technologies segment due to strong sales of automotive and diesel products.

The increase in net income was offset by asbestos settlement expense of $185 million in 2007 compared to a credit of $2 million in 2006 reflecting the change in the
settlement value of Corning’s asbestos settlement liability. The change in the settlement value of this liability was primarily attributable to the change in the value of 25 million shares of Corning’s common stock to be contributed
to the proposed settlement. Net income was also negatively impacted by restructuring, impairment, and other charges at Samsung Corning. Our share of these charges in 2007 was $40 million. Refer to Note 7 (Investments) to the consolidated financial
statements for additional information about these items.

Investing in our future

We continue to focus on the future and on what we do best – creating and making keystone components that enable high-technology systems. We remain committed to
investing in research, development, and engineering to drive innovation. In 2007, approximately one-third of our total research, development and engineering expenditures were for research. This spending related to our existing businesses, new
business development, exploratory research, and early stage marketing. We continue to work on technologies for glass substrates for active matrix LCDs, diesel filters and substrates in response to tightening emissions control standards, and the
optical fiber and cable and hardware and equipment that will enable fiber-to-the-premises. We are also making increased investments in new technologies such as the Epic™ system, synthetic green lasers, silicon-on-glass, and microreactors.

Our research, development and engineering expenditures increased by $48 million in 2007 when compared to 2006 but remained fairly constant as a percentage
of net sales. We believe our spending levels are adequate to support our technology and innovation strategies.


We also remain committed to investing in manufacturing capacity to match increased demand in our businesses. Our capital
expenditures were primarily focused on expanding manufacturing capacity for LCD glass substrates in the Display Technologies segment and diesel products in the Environmental Technologies segment. Total capital expenditures for 2007 were $1.3
billion, of which $883 million was directed toward our Display Technologies segment and $67 million was invested in our Environmental Technologies segment. In addition, in April 2007, we announced a $300 million facility improvement plan for the
Company’s Sullivan Park Research and Development campus near Corning, New York. The expansion is expected to be completed over a six-year period.

We
expect our 2008 capital spending to be in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion, of which approximately $800 million to $1.0 billion will be directed toward our Display Technologies segment. In December 2007, we announced a 5-year capital
expenditure plan of $795 million to locate a glass manufacturing facility at Sharp Corporation’s plant in Sakai City, Japan. Production from this new facility is expected to meet Sharp Corporation’s plan to begin production of LCD panels
for large televisions by March 2010. In February 2008, we announced a $453 million expansion of our LCD manufacturing facility in Taichung, Taiwan. The range provided for 2008 for our Display Technologies segment includes some spending for recently
announced projects.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Selected
highlights from our continuing operations follow (dollars in millions):

Net Sales

The net sales increase in 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily the result of increased volumes in the Display Technologies, Environmental Technologies, and Telecommunications segments. For those three segments, sales volume increases were
offset somewhat by price declines. Movements in foreign exchange rates did not have a significant impact on 2007 net sales when compared with last year.


The net sales increase in 2006 compared to 2005 was the result of increased demand for LCD glass substrates in our
Display Technologies segment and year-over-year increased volume in the Telecommunications segment. Net sales for all other segments were comparable to the prior year. Movements in foreign exchange rates negatively impacted 2006 net sales by
approximately $125 million (or 3%) when compared with 2005.

Reflecting the growth in our Display Technologies segment, net sales into international
markets continued to surpass those into the U.S. market. For 2007, sales into international markets accounted for 72% of net sales. For 2006 and 2005, sales into international markets accounted for 71% of net sales.

Cost of Sales

The types of expenses included in the cost of
sales line item are: raw materials consumption, including direct and indirect materials; salaries, wages and benefits; depreciation and amortization; production utilities; production-related purchasing; warehousing (including receiving and
inspection); repairs and maintenance; inter-location inventory transfer costs; production and warehousing facility property insurance; rent for production facilities; and other production overhead.

Gross Margin

For 2007, gross margin improved both in dollars
and as a percentage of net sales when compared to 2006. Improvements were driven primarily by strong sales volumes in the Display Technologies, Telecommunications, and Environmental Technologies segments. Cost reduction efforts and manufacturing
efficiencies in these segments also drove gross margin improvements in 2007 when compared to 2006.

As a percentage of net sales, 2006 gross margin was up
slightly from 2005 driven primarily by our Display Technologies segment. Gross margins for this segment were essentially even with 2005 reflecting the negative impact of price declines offset by higher volumes and cost reductions. Display
Technologies segment sales increased from 38% of total Corning’s sales in 2005 to 41% of Corning’s sales in 2006. As Display Technologies has a higher gross margin than our consolidated gross margin, the added concentration in Display
Technologies in 2006 caused Corning’s gross margin percentage to increase from 43% in 2005 to 44% in 2006.

Selling, General, and Administrative
Expenses

The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for 2007 when compared to 2006, in dollars, was largely due to an increase
in compensation-related expenses. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general, and administrative expense in 2007 declined slightly when compared to last year due to cost control efforts.

The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for 2006 compared to 2005, in dollars, was primarily due to an increase in stock-based compensation expense
as a result of the Company’s adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004) Share-Based Payment (SFAS 123(R)), effective January 1, 2006. As a percent of net sales, selling, general, and
administrative expenses in 2006 and 2005 were comparable.

The types of expenses included in the selling, general and administrative expenses line item
are: salaries, wages and benefits; travel; sales commissions; professional fees; and depreciation and amortization, utilities, and rent for administrative facilities.

Share-Based Compensation

Prior to January 1, 2006, the Company accounted for share-based awards granted
under the Company’s stock compensation programs using the intrinsic value method in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” (APB 25) and SFAS No. 123,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” (SFAS 123). Under the intrinsic value method, no share-based compensation cost related to stock options had been recognized in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations, because the
exercise price was at least equal to the market value of the common stock on the grant date. As a result, the recognition of share-based compensation cost was generally limited to the expense attributed to restricted stock awards, and stock option
modifications. As permitted under SFAS 123, the Company reported pro-forma disclosures presenting results and earnings per share as if we had used the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123 in the notes to the Company’s consolidated
financial statements.


Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 123(R) using the modified prospective
application method. Under the modified prospective application method, compensation cost recognized in 2006 includes: (a) compensation cost for all share-based awards granted prior to, but not yet vested as of January 1, 2006 based on the
grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS 123, and (b) compensation cost for all share-based awards granted subsequent to January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance
with the provisions of SFAS 123(R). Compensation cost is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. In accordance with the modified
prospective application method, results for prior periods have not been restated. The adoption of SFAS 123(R) resulted in a decrease of $0.05 in basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2006. See Note 17 (Share-based
Compensation) to the consolidated financial statements for further detail on the impact of SFAS 123(R).

Research, Development, and Engineering
Expenses

Research, development, and engineering expenditures for 2007 and 2006 increased by $48 million and $74 million, respectively, when
compared to the previous year but remained even as a percentage of net sales. In 2007, approximately one-third of total research, development, and engineering expenditures were for research spending related to our existing businesses, new business
development, exploratory research, and early stage marketing. Expenditures for the past three years have been focused on our Display Technologies, Environmental Technologies and Telecommunications segments as we looked to capitalize on market
opportunities in those segments. Expenses in each year also reflect costs associated with later stage development projects to support future growth. These projects include investments in new technologies such as synthetic green lasers,
silicon-on-glass, and microreactors.

Restructuring, Impairment and Other Charges and (Credits)

Corning recorded restructuring, impairment, and other charges and credits in 2006 and 2005 which affect the comparability of our results for the periods presented. A
description of those charges follows:

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Other Than Goodwill

2006 Impairment Charge for Assets Held for Use

In 2006, we recorded an asset held for use impairment charge of $44 million to impair certain long-lived assets of our Telecommunications segment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” (SFAS 144). Due to our lowered long-term outlook for this business

,

we determined that an event of impairment, as defined by SFAS 144, had occurred in that business, which further required us
to test this asset group for impairment. We assess recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. We
estimated the fair value of the long-lived assets for this business using a discounted expected cash flow approach as a measure of fair value. As a result of our impairment evaluation, we recorded an impairment charge to write-down the asset group
to its estimated fair value.

Other Credits

2005 Reversal of Currency Translation Adjustment

In 2003, Corning sold its photonic business
operations to Avanex. The photonics business was the sole operation of Corning O.T.I. S.r.l. (OTI), a wholly-owned Italian subsidiary of Corning, whose results were included in Corning’s Telecommunications segment. Subsequent to the sale of the
operating assets of OTI to Avanex, Corning began liquidating OTI. In October 2005, the assets of OTI were determined to be substantially liquidated. As a result of the substantial liquidation, OTI’s cumulative translation account was reversed,
resulting in a gain of $84 million in the fourth quarter.

Impairment of Available for Sale Securities

2005 Impairment Charge

In
2005, we recorded impairment charges of $25 million for an other than temporary decline in the fair value of our investment in Avanex Corporation (Avanex) below its adjusted cost basis. Our investment in Avanex was accounted for as an
available-for-sale security under SFAS No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities” (SFAS 115). In the fourth quarter of 2005, we completed the sale of our shares of Avanex.


Restructuring Actions

2005 Restructuring Actions

Corning recorded net restructuring charges of $15 million in 2005 which included the following:

•

A charge of $30 million comprising severance costs for a restructuring plan in the Telecommunications segment to continue to reduce costs in this segment.

•

Net credits to prior year restructuring plans totaling $15 million primarily for revisions to plans related to the shutdown of Corning Asahi Video Products and to
our specialty materials business.

Legal Settlement - Asbestos

On March 28, 2003, Corning announced that it had reached agreement (the PCC Plan) with the representatives of asbestos claimants for the settlement of all current
and future asbestos claims against it and Pittsburgh Corning Corporation (PCC), which might arise from PCC products or operations. The proposed settlement, if the PCC Plan is approved and becomes effective, will require Corning to relinquish its
equity interest in PCC, contribute its equity interest in Pittsburgh Corning Europe N.V. (PCE), a Belgian corporation, and contribute 25 million shares of Corning common stock. Corning also agreed to pay a total of $140 million in six annual
installments (present value $131 million at March 2003), beginning one year after the PCC Plan becomes effective, with 5.5 percent interest from June 2004, and to assign certain insurance policy proceeds from its primary insurance and a portion of
its excess insurance at the time of settlement.

The PCC Plan received a favorable vote from creditors in March 2004. Hearings to consider objections to
the PCC Plan were held in the Bankruptcy Court in May 2004. In February 2006, the Bankruptcy Court requested that the PCC Plan proponents delete references to Section 105(a) of the Bankruptcy Code and resubmit the PCC Plan. The final round of
oral argument was held on July 21, 2006.

On December 21, 2006, the Bankruptcy Court issued an order denying confirmation of the PCC Plan for
reasons set out in a memorandum opinion. Several parties, including Corning, filed motions for reconsideration. These motions were argued on March 5, 2007, and the Bankruptcy Court reserved decision. On January 10, 2008, some of the
parties in the proceeding advised the Bankruptcy Court that they had made substantial progress on an Amended Plan of Reorganization that would make it unnecessary for the Bankruptcy Court to decide the motion for reconsideration. If the Bankruptcy
Court does not approve the PCC Plan in its current form or parties to the proceeding agree to amend the PCC Plan, changes to the PCC Plan are reasonably likely to occur that could significantly reduce the value Corning would pay in such a changed
plan.

The outcome of these proceedings is uncertain, and confirmation of the current PCC Plan or any amended PCC Plan is subject to a number of
contingencies. However, apart from the quarterly mark-to-market adjustment in the value of the components of the settlement, management believes that the likelihood of a material adverse impact to Corning’s financial statements is remote.

Two of Corning’s primary insurers and several excess insurers have commenced litigation for a declaration of the rights and obligations of the
parties under insurance policies, including rights that may be affected by the settlement arrangement described above. Corning is vigorously contesting these cases. Management is unable to predict the outcome of this insurance litigation.

Since March 28, 2003, we have recorded total net charges of $1.0 billion to reflect the initial settlement liability and subsequent adjustments for
the change in the settlement value of the components of the liability.

The following summarizes the charges and credits we have recorded for the proposed
asbestos settlement (in millions):

If the book value of the assets to be contributed in the asbestos settlement remains lower than the carrying value
of the settlement liability, a gain would be recognized at the time of settlement.


The liability expected to be settled by contribution of our investment in PCE, assigned insurance proceeds, and the
25 million shares of our common stock, which totals $833 million at December 31, 2007, is recorded in the other accrued liabilities component in our consolidated balance sheets. This portion of the PCC liability is considered a “due
on demand” obligation. Accordingly, this portion of the obligation has been classified as a current liability even though it is possible that the contribution could be made beyond one year. The remaining portion of the settlement liability,
which totals $169 million at December 31, 2007, representing the net present value of the cash payments, is recorded in the other liabilities component in our consolidated balance sheets.

See Legal Proceedings for additional information about this matter.

Other Income, Net

For 2007 and 2006, other income, net increased by $78 million and $54 million, respectively, when compared to the
previous year. The increase in both periods reflected an increase in royalty income from Samsung Corning Precision. Corning licenses certain of its patents and know-how to Samsung Corning Precision, as well as to third parties, which generate
royalty income. Refer to Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Income Before Income Taxes

In addition to the items identified under Gross Margin, Restructuring, Impairment and Other Charges and
(Credits) and Asbestos Settlement, the items below had an impact on Income Before Income Taxes as follows:

Provision for Income Taxes

Our provision for income taxes and the related effective income tax rates were as follows (in millions):

The effective income tax rates for 2007 and 2006 differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the
following items:

•

The impact of not recording net tax expense on income generated in the U.S.;

•

The release of valuation allowances on foreign deferred tax assets; and

•

The benefit of tax holidays in foreign jurisdictions.

The effective income tax rate for 2005 differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the following items:

•

The impact of our inability to record tax benefits on net operating losses generated in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions;

•

The increase of our U.S. valuation allowance of $525 million; and

•

The benefit of tax holidays and investment credits in foreign jurisdictions.

SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes” (SFAS No. 109), provides that deferred tax assets are to be reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more
likely than not (a likelihood of greater than 50 percent) that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The valuation allowance should be sufficient to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than
not to be realized.

SFAS No. 109 further requires that in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, objective evidence (e.g. actual,
historical information) should be given greater weight than subjective evidence (e.g. the outlook for future profitability).

In 2005 and 2004 we recorded
valuation allowances against our entire U.S. deferred tax assets as a result of significant losses in the U.S. in recent years. In doing so, we recorded valuation allowances against our U.S. deferred tax assets that existed at December 31,
2003, as well as against additional U.S. deferred tax assets generated in 2005 and 2004 due to losses in those years.

In both 2007 and 2006, we generated
income from continuing operations in the U.S. The tax expense on such income was fully offset by the tax benefit of releasing a portion of the valuation allowance to reflect the realization of deferred taxes resulting from the generation of U.S.
income. The impact of the release of valuation allowances and, thus, not recording tax expense on income generated in the U.S. is a reduction in our effective tax rate of 14.2% for both 2007 and 2006.


We continue to provide a full valuation allowance against our entire U.S. deferred tax assets as of December 31,
2007 because we do not believe it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate in the future sufficient levels of profitability in the U.S. to realize some or all of the deferred tax assets. U.S. profits of approximately $8.3 billion
dollars would be required to fully realize the deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2007. Of that amount, $4.2 billion of U.S. profits would be required over the next 19 years to fully realize the deferred tax assets associated with federal
net operating loss carry forwards. Our evaluation of the realizability of our deferred tax assets is inherently subjective and is based on our analysis and weighting of all positive and negative evidence available to us. This evaluation includes
estimates and assumptions about a number of market, execution and economic variables. Our judgment as of December 31, 2007 has been formed based on these variables which include:

•

We had a taxable loss in the U.S. in 2005 and, absent nonrecurring items, we would have also had a taxable loss in the U.S. in 2006. 2007 is the only year in the
last three years in which we have generated income in the U.S. when considering only recurring items.

•

Although our consolidated net income has reached record levels, we have continued to incur losses or have generated only marginal profitability in the U.S. because
(a) Display Technologies, the key driver of our consolidated profitability, is largely a foreign-based business with only net royalty income occurring in the U.S.; (b) our Environmental and Life Sciences segments have lost money or have
been only marginally profitable due to very significant U.S.-based factory start-up costs and developmental spending; and (c) improvement in our Telecommunications segment has been more than offset by higher U.S.-based research, development,
and engineering, stock and incentive compensation and other administrative expenses.

•

A significant factor in our forecasts of future U.S. taxable profitability is the amount of assumed royalties to be paid by our Display Technologies businesses to
the U.S. The amount of such royalties could decline if our sales of LCD glass are impacted by:

Ÿ

manufacturing capacity constraints;

Ÿ

(a) reduced demand due to the slowing of corporate information technology and consumer spending or (b) challenges to pricing, both of which may arise from global economic
pressures; or

Ÿ

shifts in the global market share of our customers which manufacture flat panel TV and computer monitors.

Additionally, a change in our judgment regarding the sustainability of the level of these royalties in accordance with the principles of FIN 48,
“Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes” (FIN 48) may also impact our forecasts of U.S. profitability.

Although we remain optimistic about
our consolidated outlook for 2008 and beyond, as of December 31, 2007, we are sufficiently uncertain about our U.S.-based results primarily due to the current economic uncertainty but also due to a number of market and execution risks in our
operating segments, particularly those pertaining to Display Technologies, as noted above that we have concluded that the positive evidence supporting realization of our U.S deferred tax assets does not sufficiently outweigh the negative evidence
that we may not realize our U.S. deferred tax assets.

We will update our assessment of the realizability of our U.S. deferred tax assets on a quarterly
basis in 2008, taking into account year-to-date actual as well as forecasted U.S. results. If, after considering the actual results and the potential impact of the economic uncertainties and business risks considered in our 2007 year-end assessment
as well as our FIN 48 assessment of the Display Technologies U.S. royalties, we conclude that it is more likely than not that we will be profitable in the U.S. in 2008 and future years, we will quantify the portion of our U.S. deferred tax assets we
believe to be realizable and reduce our valuation allowance accordingly. Until that time, we will continue to adjust the valuation allowance to offset the current U.S. income tax expense (or benefit) that would otherwise be recorded on income (or
losses) in the U.S. and, therefore, reflect no net U.S. income tax expense.

In 2004, we recorded valuation allowances against our entire German and
Australian deferred tax assets due to losses in recent years. In 2007, due to sustained profitability and positive earnings projections for our overall German operations, we have concluded that it is more likely than not that the German national
deferred tax assets are realizable and that the related valuation allowance is no longer required. In 2006, due to sustained profitability and positive earnings projections in Australia and at certain of our German operations, we concluded that it
was more likely than not that a portion of the German local and the entire Australian deferred tax assets were realizable and that the related valuation allowances were no longer required. The impact of the releases of the valuation allowances on
our effective rate is a reduction in the rate of 12.4% and 8.7% for 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Certain foreign subsidiaries in China, South Africa and
Taiwan are or were operating under tax holiday arrangements. The nature and extent of such arrangements vary, and the benefits of such arrangements phase out in years (2006 to 2011) according to the specific terms and schedules of the relevant
taxing jurisdictions. The impact of the tax holidays on our effective rate is a reduction in the rate of 12.1%, 10.1%, and 8.9%, for 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.

In addition to the aforementioned benefit of tax holidays, the effective income tax rate for 2005 differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to increasing the valuation allowance against our U.S.
deferred tax assets.


In 2004, significant events occurred which required us to increase the valuation allowance against our U.S. deferred tax
assets. At that time, we believed that it was more likely than not that we could realize the remaining net U.S. deferred tax assets of approximately $525 million through a tax planning strategy involving the sale of our investment in Dow Corning, a
non-strategic appreciated asset, if we were faced with expiring net operating loss carryforwards.

During 2005, Dow Corning’s performance was much
stronger than expected and Dow Corning resumed paying a dividend; both of which are expected to continue in the future. Due to this improved performance, we concluded that Dow Corning provides strong financial, geographic and market balance to
Corning’s portfolio of businesses, the profitability of which has become more concentrated due to the success of the display operating segment. As a result, we considered Dow Corning to be a strategic investment and could no longer assert that
a potential tax planning strategy involving the sale of Dow Corning would be prudent, as required by SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes” (SFAS 109). Therefore, we no longer believed, in the fourth quarter of 2005, that it was
more likely than not that we would realize the remaining net deferred tax assets. Accordingly, we increased our valuation allowance by $525 million to fully reserve our net U.S. deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of 2005, which increased our
effective tax rate by 94%.

See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding income tax matters.

Equity in Earnings of Affiliated Companies, Net of Impairments

The following provides a summary of equity earnings of affiliated companies, net of impairments (in millions):

The 2007 and 2006 increases in equity earnings of affiliated companies, net of impairments, are primarily due to
strong sales and earnings performance at Samsung Corning Precision and at Dow Corning when compared to the previous years. Additional information about the change in equity earnings from Samsung Corning Precision is explained in the discussion of
the performance of the Display Technologies segment.

Dow Corning performance was driven by sales growth in their traditional silicone product lines and in
polysilicones for the semiconductor and solar energy industries. Dow Corning sales grew approximately 12% in 2007. Approximately 80% of Dow Corning’s sales were in their traditional silicone product lines. The remaining sales were from
polysilicone products. Net income at Dow Corning, and Corning’s resulting equity earnings from Dow Corning, increased 3% in 2007 when compared to 2006, reflecting the growth in net sales offset in part by the non-repeat of a $33 million
favorable IRS settlement in 2006 described below.

Sales at Dow Corning are expected to grow between 10% and 12% in 2008 when compared to 2007, driven by
increasing worldwide demand for silicone products and polysilicone products. Growth in net income, and thus in Corning’s equity in earnings from Dow Corning, is expected to be greater than 12%.

In addition to the above, equity in earnings of affiliated companies, net of impairments, included the following restructuring and impairment charges and other credits:

•

In 2007, equity earnings from Samsung Corning were reduced by $40 million primarily due to restructuring and impairment charges.

•

In 2006, Dow Corning reached a settlement with the IRS regarding liabilities for tax years 1992 to 2003. Equity earnings reflected a $33 million gain as a result of
the settlement which resolved all Federal tax issues related to Dow Corning’s implant settlement.

•

In 2006, Samsung Corning recorded the following items which increased Corning’s equity earnings by $2 million, net: a gain on the sale of land which increased
Corning’s equity earnings by $61 million; an impairment charge on certain long-lived assets which reduced Corning’s equity earnings by $46 million; and the establishment of a valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets which
reduced Corning’s equity earnings by $13 million.

•

In 2005, Samsung Corning incurred impairment and other charges as a result of a decline in the projected operating results for its cathode ray tube (CRT) glass
business. The charge, which included certain manufacturing assets and severance and exit costs, reduced Corning’s equity earnings by $106 million in the third quarter.

•

In 2005, Dow Corning recorded a gain on the issuance of subsidiary stock. Corning’s equity earnings included $11 million related to this gain.


Until December 31, 2007, Corning had a 50% interest in Samsung Corning. Samsung Electronics Company, Ltd. and
affiliates owned the remaining 50% interest in Samsung Corning. On December 31, 2007, Samsung Corning Precision, acquired all of the outstanding shares of Samsung Corning. After the transaction, Corning retained its 50% interest in Samsung
Corning Precision.

Net Income

As a result of
the items discussed above, net income and per share data was as follows (in millions, except per share amounts):

OPERATING SEGMENTS

Our reportable operating segments include Display Technologies, Telecommunications, Environmental Technologies, and Life Sciences. The Environmental Technologies reportable segment is an aggregation of our Automotive and Diesel operating
segments, as these two segments share similar economic characteristics, products, customer types, production processes and distribution methods. The following provides a brief description of the products and markets served by each reportable
segment:

•

Display Technologies - manufactures glass substrates for use in liquid crystal flat panel displays;

•

Telecommunications - manufactures optical fiber and cable, and hardware and equipment components for the telecommunications industry;

•

Environmental Technologies - manufactures ceramic substrates and filters for automobile and diesel applications; and

•

Life Sciences - manufactures glass and plastic consumables for pharmaceutical and scientific applications.

All other operating segments that do not meet the quantitative threshold for separate reporting have been grouped as “All Other.”

We prepared the financial results for our reportable segments on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information to
assist in making internal operating decisions. We include the earnings of equity affiliates that are closely associated with our operating segments in the respective segment’s net income. We have allocated certain common expenses among segments
differently than we would for stand-alone financial information prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Segment net income may not be consistent with measures used by other
companies. The accounting policies of our reportable segments are the same as those applied in the consolidated financial statements.

Display
Technologies

The following table provides net sales and other data for the Display Technologies segment (dollars in millions):

2007 vs. 2006

The net sales increase for 2007 reflected volume gains of 38% (measured in square feet of glass sold) offset somewhat by price declines of 11% when compared to 2006. Volume gains were driven by increased LCD monitor demand, continued demand
for glass for notebook computers, and LCD TV market growth. LCD TV market growth has resulted from both an increase in market penetration and an increase in the demand for larger size LCD glass substrates (generation 5 and above). Large-size glass
substrates, which carry a slightly higher selling price per square foot, continued to account for a significant portion of total sales volumes and were approximately 85% and 82% of sales volumes for 2007 and 2006, respectively. Net sales of the
Display Technologies segment are denominated in Japanese yen and, as a result, are susceptible to movements in the U.S. dollar – Japanese yen exchange rate. The impact of foreign exchange rate movements on this segment’s net sales was not
material in 2007 when compared with last year.


When compared to 2006, income before equity earnings for 2007 was up significantly due to higher net sales, lower
manufacturing costs, and an increase in royalty income from Samsung Corning Precision. Corning licenses certain of its patents and know-how to Samsung Corning Precision, as well as to third parties, which generate royalty income. Refer to Note 7
(Investments) to the consolidated financial statements for more information about related party transactions.

Equity earnings for 2007 increased by 5%
when compared to 2006 due to volume gains of 39% at Samsung Corning Precision offset by price declines of 15% and increased operating and royalty expenses. The impact of foreign exchange rate movements on equity earnings was not material in 2007
when compared with 2006.

The Display Technologies segment has a concentrated customer base comprised of LCD panel and color filter makers primarily
located in Japan and Taiwan. For 2007, AUO, Chi Mei Optoelectronics Corporation, and Sharp Corporation, which individually accounted for more than 10% of segment net sales, accounted for 62% of total segment sales when combined.

In addition, Samsung Corning Precision’s sales are concentrated across a small number of its customers. In 2007, sales to two LCD panel makers located in Korea,
Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. and LG Phillips LCD Co., Ltd. accounted for approximately 93% of total Samsung Corning Precision sales.

Corning continues to
invest heavily to expand capacity to meet the demand for LCD glass substrates. In 2007 and 2006, capital spending in this segment was $883 million and $829 million, respectively. We expect capital spending for 2008 to be in the range of $800 million
to $1.0 billion. In December 2007, we announced a 5-year capital expenditure plan of $795 million to locate a glass manufacturing facility at Sharp Corporation’s plant in Sakai City, Japan. Production from this new facility is expected to meet
Sharp Corporation’s plan to begin production of LCD panels for large televisions by March 2010. In February 2008, we announced a $453 million expansion of our LCD manufacturing facility in Taichung, Taiwan. The range provided for 2008 segment
capital spending includes some spending for recently announced projects.

2006 vs. 2005

The net sales increase for 2006 reflected overall LCD glass market growth. During 2006, glass substrate volumes increased 52% compared with 2005, driven by the same
factors described in 2007. Sales of large-size glass substrates accounted for 69% of total sales volumes in 2005. The growth in volume was partially offset by declines in weighted average selling prices of approximately 16%. Movements in the U.S.
dollar – Japanese yen exchange rate negatively impacted 2006 sales by approximately $122 million (or 7%) when compared with 2005.

In the second
quarter of 2006, the Display Technologies segment reported its first quarterly sequential decline in volume since the third quarter of 2001. The lower volume was the result of a number of our customers, primarily in Taiwan, idling part of their
facilities and thus reducing their demand for glass, as a result of a build-up of panel inventory in the supply chain. Both volume and sales increased in the third quarter of 2006 when our customers reduced their inventories and began ramping up LCD
panel production to meet seasonally stronger demand.

For 2006, the increase in income before equity earnings was primarily the result of higher volumes
and manufacturing cost reductions, offset somewhat by lower prices and the impact of exchange rates. Movements in currency exchange rates negatively impacted 2006 income before equity earnings by approximately 5% when compared with 2005.

The increase in our 2006 equity earnings, primarily from Samsung Corning Precision, was largely driven by the same market factors identified for our wholly owned
business. In 2006, Samsung Corning Precision’s earnings were negatively impacted by approximately 8% from movements in exchange rates compared to 2005. Equity earnings from Samsung Corning Precision are susceptible to movements in the U.S.
dollar–Japanese yen and U.S. dollar–Korean won exchange rates.

In 2005 and 2004, Corning and several customers entered into long-term purchase
and supply agreements in which the Display Technologies segment agreed to supply large-size glass substrates to the customers over periods of up to six years. As part of the agreements, these customers agreed to make advance cash deposits to Corning
for a portion of the contracted glass to be purchased. In 2007 and 2006, Corning received $105 million and $171 million, respectively, of customer deposits and issued $231 million and $126 million, respectively in credit memoranda. We do not expect
to receive additional deposits related to these agreements. Refer to Note 10 (Other Liabilities) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

In the event customers elect not to purchase the agreed upon quantities of product, subject to specific conditions outlined in the agreements, Corning may retain certain amounts of the customer deposits. If Corning
does not deliver agreed upon product quantities, subject to specific conditions outlined in the agreements, Corning may be required to return certain amounts of the customer deposits.


Outlook:

We expect
to see a continuation of the overall industry growth and the trend toward large size substrates driven by increased end market demand for LCD televisions. Absent the impact of an economic slowdown, we anticipate the volume growth in the LCD glass
market to be between 25% and 30% in 2008. The expected market volume growth, measured in square feet, for the year should be equal to the volume growth in the market in 2007. Corning’s LCD glass volume is expected to grow at the lower end of
this range, while Samsung Corning Precision’s volume growth should be higher than the range. Growth rates by region for the industry generally, and thus for Corning’s wholly owned business and Samsung Corning Precision, may be different
based on market dynamics.

We expect sales volume in the first quarter of 2008 to be consistent with the fourth quarter of 2007, as LCD glass is in short
supply. We expect price declines in the first quarter of 2008 to be similar to the fourth quarter of 2007.

Although end market demand for LCD televisions,
monitors and notebooks currently remains strong, we are cautious about the potential negative impact that economic conditions, particularly the slowing U.S. economy, and political tensions could have on consumer demand. There is no assurance that
the end-market rates of growth will continue at the rates experienced in recent years, that we will be able to pace our capacity expansions to actual demand, or that the rate of cost declines will offset price declines in any given period. While the
industry has grown rapidly, consumer preferences for panels of differing sizes; prices; or other factors may lead to pauses in market growth. Therefore, it is possible that glass manufacturing capacity may exceed demand from time to time. In
addition, changes in foreign exchange rates, principally the Japanese yen, will continue to impact the sales and profitability of this segment.

Telecommunications

The following table provides net sales and other data for the Telecommunications segment (dollars in millions):

2007 vs. 2006

Segment net sales continue to be favorably impacted by growth in the Telecommunications industry and in the private
network market. Approximately 75% of segment net sales were sold into the public network market. Growth in the public network market was driven by favorable public policy, especially in the U.S., which fosters facilities-based competition and by
strong financial health of service providers worldwide. Financially sound service providers have the ability to maintain or increase capital spending on network investments. During the year, there was a broadening of worldwide access construction
projects such as fiber-to-the-premises and fiber-to-the-node. Approximately 54% of the world’s largest access service providers had some activity related to access construction, which was up from 46% in 2006. The remaining 25% of this
segment’s net sales were sold into the private network market. Demand in the private network market was driven, in particular, by growth in data centers. Growth in the public and private markets had a favorable impact on both optical fiber and
cable and hardware and equipment product sales. In 2007, Corning introduced the ClearCurve

™

ultra-bendable optical fiber-based suite of products that enable fiber deployments to
multi-dwelling units. We expect to begin shipments of ClearCurve

™

products in early 2008.

Effective April 30, 2007, Corning sold its European submarine cabling business and recorded a gain of $19 million on the sale. Effective April 1, 2006, Advance Cable Systems (ACS), currently an equity company affiliate, assumed
responsibility for optical cable and hardware and equipment sales in Japan. As a result of these two transactions, sales for 2007 are not comparable to sales for the same period last year.


Telecommunications segment net sales, excluding the impact of sales of submarine cabling products and sales of optical
cable in Japan, increased 10 percent in 2007. This is a non-GAAP financial measure which management believes is useful to investors to understand the 2007 year-over-year growth of this segment’s net sales. The following is a reconciliation of
this non-GAAP measure to the related GAAP measure:

In 2007, optical fiber market volume exceeded the previous market peak which occurred in 2001, confirming a
recovery from the 2002 global telecommunications market downturn. Volume increases in 2007 were offset somewhat by price declines when compared to the previous year. In addition, 2007 net sales were positively impacted by $37 million due to
movements in foreign exchange rates, primarily the Euro, when compared to 2006.

Net income in 2007 increased when compared to 2006 due to improvements in
segment sales, cost reductions, the impact of the $19 million gain on the sale of the European submarine cabling business, and the absence of an impairment charge which totaled $44 million in 2006. A favorable mix for optical fiber and cable
products also contributed to improvements in segment net income. In 2007, net income of this segment was positively impacted by $3 million due to movements in foreign exchange rates when compared with 2006.

The Telecommunications segment has a concentrated customer base. In 2007, two customers of the Telecommunications segment, which individually accounted for more than 10%
of total segment net sales, accounted for 25% of total segment sales when combined.

2006 vs. 2005

Increases in 2006 segment net sales were driven by improved sales in North America, Europe and China. The increase was driven by a broader recovery in the
Telecommunications industry and growth in the private network market. Volume increases were offset somewhat by continued price declines when compared to 2005. Movements in foreign exchange rates which can affect this segment’s net sales,
primarily the Euro and Japanese yen, did not have a significant impact on sales in 2006 when compared to the previous year.

As noted above, sales of this
segment in 2006 were negatively impacted when ACS assumed responsibility for optical cable and hardware and equipment sales in Japan. Sales of optical cable and hardware and equipment in Japan, which are now recorded by an equity affiliate, were $23
million in 2006 and $75 million in 2005.

For the Telecommunications segment, net income in 2006 and 2005 was impacted by restructuring, impairment, and
other charges and credits. In 2006, we recorded an after-tax impairment charge of $44 million. In 2005, we recorded net after-tax credits of $47 million. Refer to Results of Operations for a discussion of these items. The decline in net income for
this segment in 2006, when compared to 2005, was primarily the result of the 2006 impairment charge described above and the absence of net after-tax credits of $47 million that were recorded in 2005. In 2006, movements in exchange rates did not
significantly impact the results for this operating segment.

Outlook:

For the Telecommunications segment, we expect sales and earnings to increase in 2008, reflecting continued strength in public and private network demand when compared to the last two years. Growth in the public
network market is expected to benefit from increasing access construction activity. Private network growth is expected to result from data centers, internet protocol networks, and increased network speed which favors optical fiber products over
copper. We expect sales in the first quarter of 2008 to increase by approximately 5% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2007. Sales will continue to be impacted by the seasonal buying patterns of our largest customer. We expect manufacturing
efficiencies will offset price declines. Changes in our customer’s expected deployment plan, or additional reductions in their inventory levels of fiber-to-the-premises products, could also affect the sales level. Should these plans not occur
at the pace anticipated, our sales and earnings would be adversely affected.


Environmental Technologies

The following table provides net sales and other data for the Environmental Technologies segment (dollars in millions):

2007 vs. 2006

Sales of the Environmental Technologies segment in 2007 were higher when compared to 2006 due to increased sales from the diesel product lines and strong demand for automotive substrates. Diesel sales in 2007 reflected increased sales of
heavy duty diesel products to meet the U.S. emission regulations which went into effect on January 2, 2007. Sales of automotive products also improved when compared to last year due to an increase in sales to European and Asian customers. Net
sales of this segment were positively impacted by $23 million due to movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to last year.

Net income of this
segment was up when compared to last year due to higher sales, manufacturing efficiencies, and the impact of favorable movements in foreign exchange rates offset slightly by modest price declines. Improved utilization of our diesel manufacturing
capacity also contributed to increased net income in this segment. Net income was positively impacted by $5 million due to movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to last year.

The Environmental Technologies segment sells to a concentrated customer base of manufacturers of catalyzers and emission control systems, who then sell to automotive and diesel engine manufacturers. Although our sales
are to the emission control systems manufacturers, the use of substrates and filters is generally required by the specifications of the automotive and diesel engine manufacturers. In 2007, three customers of the Environmental Technologies segment,
which individually accounted for more than 10% of segment net sales, accounted for 81% of total segment sales.

2006 vs. 2005

Sales of this segment in 2006 were somewhat higher than last year due to improvements in Diesel products sales, primarily for light-duty diesel vehicle applications.
However, this increase was offset by a decline in automotive product sales due to lower volumes. As end customers shift demand toward smaller, more energy efficient vehicles, demand for larger automobiles has declined. This shift in demand has
caused our automotive substrate volumes to decline because our market share is relatively higher for manufacturers of larger vehicles. In addition, volumes have been negatively impacted because smaller vehicles require proportionately smaller
substrates. Movements in exchange rates did not have a significant impact on sales for this segment.

The decrease in net income in 2006 versus 2005 was
due primarily to increased research, development, and engineering spending in preparation for the growth in sales of heavy duty and light duty diesel products.

Outlook:

We expect both sales and earnings improvements in the Environmental Technologies segment in 2008. Automotive substrate sales are
expected to remain even with 2007 levels. Diesel products sales are expected to increase more than 25% in 2008 as regulations that require heavy duty diesel filters such as ours to meet tighter emission standards continue to drive sales
improvements. Heavy duty diesel sales have been impacted by the weak freight market in the U.S. The pace of recovery in that market will influence the rate of growth in sales of diesel products. Segment profitability is expected to increase due to
higher diesel volumes and manufacturing cost reductions. We expect sales in the first quarter to increase by approximately 5% when compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Changes in automotive and diesel vehicle production could adversely
impact sales and net income of this segment.


Life Sciences

The
following table provides net sales and other data for the Life Sciences segment (dollars in millions):

2007 vs. 2006

Net sales of the Life Sciences segment were up when compared to last year driven by market growth and higher prices. Government and private spending for drug development, discovery, and production, continue to drive market growth in this
segment. Movements in foreign exchange rates did not have a significant impact on the comparability of sales for the periods presented.

Improved
profitability of this segment in 2007 resulted from higher sales, movements in foreign exchange rates, manufacturing efficiencies, and the absence of restructuring charges. Segment profitability in all years was impacted by development spending for
new products. Movements in foreign exchange rates had a $4 million favorable impact on results of this segment for 2007 when compared with 2006.

In the
Life Sciences segment, one customer accounted for approximately 44% of this segment’s net sales in 2007.

2006 vs. 2005

Net sales of the Life Sciences segment were up slightly in 2006 when compared to 2005 due to increased prices offset by volume declines in the U.S. Movements in foreign
exchange rates did not have a significant impact on the comparability of sales.

The segment
operated at a loss due to significant research, development, and engineering spending related to the Epic

®

System, a high-throughput label-free screening platform based on optical biosensor
technology, which had its market launch in 2006. The segment loss also includes $5 million of severance, curtailment, and asset impairment costs related to the shutdown of a facility in the United Kingdom.

Outlook:

Sales for 2008 are expected to increase over 2007 driven by market growth, price increases, and sales of Epic

®

System products. We expect sales in the first quarter of 2008 to be
up slightly versus the fourth quarter of 2007.

All Other

The following table provides net sales and other data (dollars in millions):

All Other includes all other operating segments that do not meet the quantitative threshold for separate
reporting.

Sales in this segment for 2007 were lower than 2006 due to a decline in sales of the Specialty Materials business. Sales in 2006 reflected
stronger sales of the Specialty Materials business when compared to 2005. Net income for each period presented reflected the impact of impairment and other charges and credits recorded by Samsung Corning Co. Ltd. In 2007, 2006, and 2005,
Corning’s share of these items was a charge of $40 million, a credit of $2 million, and a charge of $106 million, respectively. Refer to Note 7 (Investments) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.


LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Financing and Capital Structure

The following items were significant to Corning’s financing and capital
structure during 2007:

•

In the first quarter, we repurchased $223 million of our 6.25% Euro notes due in 2010. We recognized a $15 million loss upon the early redemption of these notes.

•

In the second quarter, all three of our rating agencies upgraded our debt ratings to BBB+ or the equivalent.

•

Operating cash flow for the year was $2.1 billion which was considerably greater than our $1.3 billion of capital spending.

•

In the third quarter of 2007, we began paying a quarterly dividend of $0.05 on the Company’s common stock. Dividend payments of $79 million were made in both
the third and fourth quarter of 2007.

•

On July 18, 2007, Corning’s Board of Directors approved the repurchase of $500 million of common stock between the date of the announcement and
December 31, 2008. We repurchased 10.5 million shares of common stock for $250 million as part of this repurchase program.

Refer to Note 11 (Debt) to the consolidated financial statements for further information.

In November 2006, we amended our revolving credit
facility so that it now provides us access to a $1.1 billion unsecured multi-currency revolving line of credit through March 2011. The facility includes two financial covenants: a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio. At December 31,
2007, we were in compliance with both financial covenants.

Capital Spending

Capital spending totaled $1.3 billion, $1.2 billion and $1.6 billion in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. Capital spending activity in all three years primarily included expansion of LCD glass capacity in the
Display Technologies segment and new capacity for diesel products in the Environmental Technologies segment. Our 2008 capital spending program is expected to be in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion, with approximately $800 million to $1.0
billion used to expand manufacturing capacity for LCD glass substrates in the Display Technologies segment. Additionally, approximately $200 million will be directed toward our Environmental Technologies segment to support the emerging diesel
emissions control products and approximately $70 million will be spent on the expansion of the Company’s Sullivan Park Research and Development campus.

Short-Term Investments

Included in our $1.3 billion short-term investments at December 31, 2007, were $301 million of
asset-backed securities. Asset-backed securities are collateralized by credit card loans, auto loans, mortgages, and student loans. At December 31, 2007, our exposure to sub-prime mortgages was $17 million. Unrealized losses on securities
backed by sub-prime mortgages, which are rated as investment grade, were approximately $1 million at December 31, 2007, and are expected to recover in the short-term. Realized losses on these items amounted to $6 million in 2007.

Defined Benefit Pension Plans

We have defined benefit
pension plans covering certain domestic and international employees. Our funding policy has been to contribute, as necessary, an amount in excess of the minimum requirements in order to achieve the company’s long-term funding targets. In 2007,
we made voluntary cash contributions of $131 million to our domestic defined benefit pension plan and $18 million to our international pension plans. In 2006, we made an incremental cash contribution of $15 million to our domestic and international
pension plans.

Customer Deposits

Certain
customers of our Display Technologies segment have entered into long-term supply agreements and agreed to make advance cash deposits to secure supply of large-size glass substrates. The deposits will be reduced through future product purchases, thus
reducing operating cash flows in later periods as credits are applied for cash deposits received in earlier periods.

Customer deposits have been received
in the following periods (in millions):

We do not expect to receive additional deposits related to these agreements.


In 2007 and 2006, we issued $231 million and $126 million, respectively, in credit memoranda. These credit amounts are
not included in the above amounts and were applied against customer receivables. Customer deposit liabilities were $531 million and $633 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. In 2008, we expect to issue approximately $190 million
in credit memoranda.

Restructuring

During
2007, 2006, and 2005, we made payments of $39 million, $15 million, and $25 million, respectively, related to employee severance and other exit costs resulting from restructuring actions. Cash payments for employee-related costs will be
substantially completed by the end of 2008, while payments for exit activities will be substantially completed by the end of 2010.

Key Balance Sheet
Data

At December 31, 2007, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $3.5 billion, compared with $3.2 billion at
December 31, 2006. The increase from December 31, 2006, was primarily due to an increase in operating cash flows.

Balance sheet and working
capital measures are provided in the following table (dollars in millions):

Includes trade payables only.

Credit Ratings

As of February 15, 2008, our credit ratings were as follows:

Management Assessment of Liquidity

Our major source of funding for 2008 and beyond will be our operating cash flow, and our existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and short term investments. From time to time, we may issue debt securities to
refinance debt securities maturing in the next few years. We believe we have sufficient liquidity for the next several years to fund operations, the asbestos settlement, research and development, capital expenditures, scheduled debt repayments,
dividend payments, and our stock repurchase program.


Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

Off balance sheet arrangements are transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which Corning has an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated
financial statements.

Corning’s off balance sheet arrangements include the following:

•

Guarantee contracts that require applying the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 45, “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for
Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others” (FIN 45).

•

Variable interests held in certain unconsolidated entities.

FIN 45 requires a company, at the time a guarantee is issued, to recognize a liability for the fair value or market value of the obligation it assumes. In the normal course of our business, we do not routinely provide significant
third-party guarantees. Generally, third-party guarantees provided by Corning are limited to certain financial guarantees, including stand-by letters of credit and performance bonds, and the incurrence of contingent liabilities in the form of
purchase price adjustments related to attainment of milestones. These guarantees have various terms, and none of these guarantees are individually significant.

Refer to Note 13 (Commitments, Contingencies, and Guarantees) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Corning leases
certain transportation equipment from three Trusts that qualify as variable interest entities under FASB Interpretation 46R, “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51” (FIN
46R). The sole purpose of these entities is to lease transportation equipment to Corning.

For variable interest entities, we assess the terms of our
interest in each entity to determine if we are the primary beneficiary as prescribed by FIN 46R. The primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is the party that absorbs a majority of the entity’s expected losses, receives a majority of
its expected residual returns, or both, as a result of holding variable interests, which are the ownership, contractual, or other pecuniary interests in an entity that change with changes in the fair value of the entity’s net assets excluding
variable interests.

Corning is the primary beneficiary of one of the three entities, and as required by FIN 46R the financial statements of the entity are
included in Corning’s consolidated financial statements. Corning is not the primary beneficiary of two of the three variable interest entities and as such, FIN 46R does not require Corning to include them in it’s consolidated financial
statements.

Refer to Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Corning does not have retained interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serve as credit, liquidity or market risk support to that entity.

In 2005 and prior to adopting SFAS 123(R), Corning had employee compensation awards (stock options) that were excluded from the balance sheet. SFAS
No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (SFAS 133), requires all derivative instruments to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value. Paragraph 11(a) of SFAS 133 provides an exception to
this requirement for contracts that are indexed to an entity’s own stock and classified in the shareholders’ equity section of the consolidated financial statements. Therefore, prior to adopting SFAS 123(R), employee stock option awards
were excluded from the balance sheet because they met the paragraph 11(a) criteria. In 2007 and 2006, those options were recorded in the equity section of the consolidated balance sheet. In 2005 and in the first quarter of 2006, we had other
non-employee contracts that did not meet the criteria in paragraph 11(a). Those contracts were considered derivative instruments and were accounted for as such in the respective reporting periods.


Contractual Obligations

The amounts of our obligations follow (in millions):

(1)

At December 31, 2007, $38 million of the $68 million was included in other accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.

(2)

Capital expenditure obligations, primarily related to our Display Technologies segment expansions, are included on our balance sheet.

(3)

At December 31, 2007, $1,537 million was included on our balance sheet. Amounts above are stated at their maturity value.

(4)

At December 31, 2007, $19 million of the $97 million represents imputed interest.

(5)

The estimate of interest payments assumes interest is paid through the date of maturity/expiration of the related debt, based upon stated rates in the respective debt instruments.

(6)

At December 31, 2007, $25 million was included on our balance sheet related to uncertain tax positions. Of this amount, we are unable to estimate when $5 million of that amount
will become payable.

We have provided financial guarantees and contingent liabilities in the form of stand-by letters of credit and
performance bonds, some of which do not have fixed or scheduled expiration dates. We have agreed to provide a credit facility related to Dow Corning discussed in Note 7 (Investments) and Note 13 (Commitments, Contingencies, and Guarantees) to the
consolidated financial statements. The funding of the Dow Corning credit facility will be required only if Dow Corning is not otherwise able to meet its scheduled funding obligations in its confirmed Bankruptcy Plan. We believe the significant
majority of these guarantees and contingent liabilities will expire without being funded.

Pensions

We have a number of defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic and international employees. Our largest single pension plan is Corning’s U.S. qualified
plan. At December 31, 2007, this plan accounted for 80% of our consolidated defined benefit pension plans’ projected benefit obligation and 90% of the related plans’ assets.

At December 31, 2006, Corning adopted SFAS 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans-an amendment of FASB
Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)” (SFAS 158). SFAS 158 requires employers to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its balance sheet and to recognize
changes in that funded status in other comprehensive income in the year in which the changes occur. The impact of adopting SFAS 158 resulted in a reduction to stockholders’ equity of $669 million after tax. Dow Corning’s adoption of this
standard resulted in a reduction to our investment in Dow Corning and a decrease to stockholders’ equity of $94 million after tax.

Refer to Note 12
(Employee Retirement Plans) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

We have traditionally contributed to the U.S. qualified
pension plan on an annual basis in excess of the IRS minimum requirements, and as a result, mandatory contributions are not expected to be required for this plan until at least 2009. For 2007, we made voluntary cash contributions of $149 million to
our domestic and international pension plans. For 2006, we made an incremental contribution of $15 million to our domestic and international pension plans. We anticipate making voluntary cash contributions of approximately $50 million to
our domestic and international pension plans in 2008.


ENVIRONMENT

We have
been named by the Environmental Protection Agency under the Superfund Act, or by state governments under similar state laws, as a potentially responsible party for 20 active hazardous waste sites. Under the Superfund Act, all parties who may have
contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site, identified by such Agency, are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the Agency agrees otherwise. It is our policy to accrue for the estimated liability related to Superfund
sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned and operated by us based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, we had accrued approximately $19
million (undiscounted) and $16 million (undiscounted), respectively, for the estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation. Based upon the information developed to date, we believe that the accrued amount is a reasonable
estimate of our liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING
ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein. The estimates,
including future projections of performance and relevant discount rates, that required us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments follow.

Impairment of assets held for use

SFAS 144 requires us to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets when
an event of impairment has occurred. We must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event of impairment has occurred. For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss, a long-lived asset or assets is grouped with other assets and
liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. We must exercise judgment in assessing the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely
independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. In certain circumstances, we concluded that locations or businesses which share production along the supply chain must be combined in order to appropriately identify cash flows that are
largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.

Once it has been determined that an impairment has occurred, an impairment
assessment requires the exercise of judgment in assessing the future use of and projected value to be derived from the impaired assets to be held and used. This may require judgment in estimating future cash flows and relevant discount rates and
terminal values in estimating the current fair value of the impaired assets to be held and used.

Restructuring charges and impairments resulting
from restructuring actions

SFAS No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities,” requires us to assess
whether and when a restructuring event has occurred and in which periods charges related to such events should be recognized. We must estimate costs of plans to restructure including, for example, employee termination costs. Restructuring charges
require us to exercise judgment about the expected future of our businesses, of portions thereof, their profitability, cash flows and in certain instances eventual outcome. The judgment involved can be difficult, subjective and complex in a number
of areas including assumptions and estimates used in estimating the future profitability and cash flows of our businesses.

Restructuring events often give
rise to decisions to dispose of or abandon certain assets or asset groups which, as a result, require impairment in accordance with SFAS 144. SFAS 144 requires us to carry assets to be sold or abandoned at the lower of cost or fair value. We must
exercise judgment in assessing the fair value of the assets to be sold or abandoned.

Valuation allowances for deferred income taxes

SFAS 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes” (SFAS 109) requires us to exercise judgment about our future results in assessing the
realizability of our deferred tax assets. Inherent in this estimation process is the requirement for us to estimate future book taxable income and possible tax planning strategies. These estimates require us to exercise judgment about our future
results, the prudence and feasibility of possible tax planning strategies, and the economic environments in which we do business. It is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to allowances. If we sustain an
appropriate level of profitability, primarily in the U.S., or if we are able to develop tax planning strategies, adjustments to current allowances will be required and may affect future net income. Refer to Note 6 (Income Taxes) to the consolidated
financial statements.


Probability of litigation outcomes

SFAS No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies,” (SFAS 5) requires us to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain. In making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters,
we consider the evaluation of legal counsel knowledgeable about each matter, case law, and other case-specific issues. See Legal Proceedings for a discussion of the material litigation matters we face. The most significant matter involving judgment
is the PCC asbestos liability. There are a number of factors bearing upon our potential liability, including the inherent complexity of a Chapter 11 filing, our history of success in defending asbestos claims, our assessment of the strength of our
corporate veil defenses, our continuing dialogue with our insurance carriers and the claimants’ representatives. We have reached a tentative plan of settlement on PCC as disclosed in Legal Proceedings and Note 7 (Investments) to the
Consolidated Financial Statements. The settlement is subject to a number of contingencies, including approval by the bankruptcy court and resolution of any appeals. On December 21, 2006, the bankruptcy court denied confirmation of the PCC Plan
of Reorganization due to the scope of the channeling injunction proposed of the two shareholders with respect to other asbestos claims not deriving directly from PCC’s products or operations. Several parties, including Corning, have moved for
reconsideration of the ruling. We continue to exercise judgment in assessing the likelihood that reconsideration will lead to a revised ruling, or that an alternative plan of reorganization will emerge to address the claims deriving from PCC. It is
possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to accruals.

Other possible liabilities

SFAS 5 and other similarly focused accounting literature require us to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain. In making determinations of
likely outcomes of certain matters, including certain tax planning matters and environmental matters, these judgments require us to consider events and actions that are outside our control in determining whether probable or possible liabilities
require accrual or disclosure. It is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to accruals.

Pension and
other postretirement employee benefits (OPEB)

Pension and OPEB costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such
amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trend rates, benefits earned, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, and other factors. In accordance with GAAP, actual results that differ from the
assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods. While management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in
actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect Corning’s pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense.

As of
December 31, 2007, the Projected Benefit Obligation (PBO) for U.S. pension plans was $2,246 million.

The following information illustrates the
sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for U.S. pension plans:

The above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time. Note that economic factors and
conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear. These changes in assumptions would have no effect on Corning’s funding requirements.

In addition, at December 31, 2007, a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would decrease stockholders’ equity by $79 million before tax, a 25 basis
point increase in the discount rate would increase stockholders’ equity by $81 million. In addition, the impact of greater than a 25 basis point decrease in discount rate would not be proportional to the first 25 basis point decrease in the
discount rate.


The following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in the discount rate assumption related to Corning’s
U.S. OPEB plans:

The above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time. Note that economic factors and
conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear.

Revenue
Recognition

In certain instances, revenue recognition is based on estimates of fair value of deliverables as well as estimates of product returns,
allowances, discounts, and other factors. These estimates are supported by historical data. While management believes that the estimates used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in estimates may affect Corning’s future
results.

Stock Compensation

Stock based
compensation expense and disclosures are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts. These assumptions include risk-free discount rates, expected term of the stock based compensation instrument granted, volatility of stock and option
prices, expected time between grant date and date of exercise, attrition, performance, and other factors. These assumptions require us to exercise judgment. Our estimates of these assumptions typically are based upon our historical experience and
currently available market place data. While management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect Corning’s future stock based compensation expense and disclosures.

Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks

We operate and conduct business in many foreign countries and as a result are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Our exposure to exchange rates
have the following effects:

•

exchange rate movements on financial instruments and transactions denominated in foreign currencies which impact earnings, and

•

exchange rate movements upon conversion of net assets and net income of foreign subsidiaries for which the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, which impact
our net equity.

Our most significant foreign currency exposure is the Japanese yen and to a much lesser extent the Korean won, the
Taiwan dollar, and the Euro. We selectively enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts with durations generally 18 months or less to hedge our exposure to exchange rate risk on foreign source income and purchases. These hedges are
scheduled to mature coincident with the timing of the underlying foreign currency commitments and transactions. The objective of these contracts is to neutralize the impact of exchange rate movements on our operating results. We also enter into
foreign exchange forward contracts when situations arise where our foreign subsidiaries or Corning enter into lending situations, generally on an intercompany basis, denominated in currencies other than their local currency. We do not hold or issue
derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Corning uses derivative instruments (forwards) to limit the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations associated with certain monetary assets and liabilities. These derivative instruments are
not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes and, as such, are referred to as undesignated hedges. Changes in the fair value of undesignated hedges, along with foreign currency gains and losses arising from the underlying monetary
assets or liabilities, are recorded in current period earnings in the other income, net component in the consolidated statement of operations.

Equity in
earnings of affiliated companies has historically contributed a significant amount to our income from continuing operations. Equity in earnings of affiliated companies, net of impairments was $942 million in 2007 and $960 million in 2006 with
foreign-based affiliates comprising over 63% of this amount in 2007. Equity earnings from Samsung Corning and Samsung Corning Precision totaled $532 million for 2007 and $555 million for 2006. Exchange rate fluctuations and actions taken by
management of these entities can affect the earnings of these companies.

We use a sensitivity analysis to assess the market risk associated with our
foreign currency exchange risk. Market risk is defined as the potential change in fair value of assets and liabilities resulting from an adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates. At December 31, 2007, we had open forward contracts,
and foreign denominated debt with values exposed to exchange rate movements, all of which were designated as hedges at December 31, 2007. A 10% adverse movement in quoted foreign currency exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of
these instruments of $239 million. Specific to the Japanese yen, a 10% adverse movement in quoted yen exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of $146 million.

As we derive approximately 70% of our net sales from outside the U.S., our sales and net income could be affected if the U.S. dollar significantly strengthens or weakens
against foreign currencies, most notably the Japanese yen and Euro. Our outlooks included in Management’s Discussion and Analysis assume exchange rates during 2008 remain constant at January 2008 levels. A plus or minus 10 point movement in the
U.S. dollar - Japanese yen exchange rate would result in a change to 2008 net sales of approximately $239 million and net income of approximately $220 million. A plus or minus 10 point movement in the U.S. dollar - Euro exchange rate would result in
a change to 2008 net sales of approximately $61 million and net income of approximately $12 million.

Interest Rate Risk Management

It is our policy to conservatively manage our exposure to changes in interest rates. At December 31, 2007, our consolidated debt portfolio
contained less than 34% of variable rate instruments.

Item 9A.  Controls and Procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our principal executive and
principal financial officers, after evaluating the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this
report, have concluded that based on the evaluation of these controls and procedures required by paragraph (b) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15, that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

(a)

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate disclosure controls and procedures and adequate internal control over financial reporting for Corning. Management is also responsible for the
assessment of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.

Disclosure controls and procedures means controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Corning’s disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by Corning in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to Corning’s management, including Corning’s principal executive and principal financial
officers, or other persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Corning’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Corning’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of Corning’s assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that Corning’s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of Corning’s management and directors; and (iii) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of Corning’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.

Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the
system of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management
concluded that Corning’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2007. The effectiveness of Corning’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, has been audited by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

2007 Annual Report

Index to Financial Statements and Financial Statement Schedules


Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Corning Incorporated:

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under
Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Corning Incorporated and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended December 31, 2007 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under
Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting, included in “Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting,” appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial
statement schedule, and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

As discussed in Notes 1, 12, and 17 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company
changed the manner in which it accounts for share-based compensation and employee benefit plans in 2006.

A company’s internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures
of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of
the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

expenses of all majority-owned subsidiaries over which Corning exercises control and, when applicable, entities for which Corning has a controlling financial interest.

For variable interest entities, we assess the terms of our interest in the entity to determine if we are the primary beneficiary as prescribed by FASB Interpretation 46R, “Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities, an Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51” (FIN 46R). The primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is the party that absorbs a majority of the entity’s expected losses, receives a majority of its
expected residual returns, or both, as a result of holding variable interests. Variable interests are the ownership, contractual, or other pecuniary interests in an entity that change with changes in the fair value of the entity’s net assets
excluding variable interests. We consolidate one variable interest entity in which we are the primary beneficiary.

The equity method of accounting is used
for investments in affiliated companies which are not controlled by Corning and in which our interest is generally between 20% and 50% and we have significant influence over the entity. Our share of earnings or losses of affiliated companies, in
which at least 20% of the voting securities is owned and we have significant influence but not control over the entity, is included in consolidated operating results.

We use the cost method to account for our investments in companies that we do not control and for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies. In accordance
with the cost method, these investments are recorded at cost or fair value, as appropriate.

All material intercompany accounts, transactions and profits
are eliminated in consolidation.

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current-year presentation. These reclassifications
had no impact on our results of operations or changes in shareholders’ equity.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated
financial statements and related notes. Significant estimates and assumptions in these consolidated financial statements include restructuring and other charges and credits, allowances for doubtful accounts receivable, estimates of fair value
associated with goodwill and long-lived asset impairment tests, estimates of the fair value of assets held for disposal, estimates of fair value of investments, environmental and legal liabilities, warranty liabilities, income taxes and deferred tax
valuation allowances, the determination of discount and other rate assumptions for pension and other postretirement employee benefit expenses and the determination of the fair value of stock based compensation involving assumptions about termination
rates, stock volatility, discount rates, and expected time to exercise. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results reported in future periods may be different from these estimates.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue for sales of goods is recognized
when a firm sales agreement is in place, delivery has occurred and sales price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. If customer acceptance of products is not reasonably assured, sales are recorded only upon formal
customer acceptance. Sales of goods typically do not include multiple product and/or service elements.


1.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

At the
time revenue is recognized, allowances are recorded, with the related reduction to revenue, for estimated product returns, allowances and price discounts based upon historical experience and related terms of customer arrangements. Where we have
offered product warranties, we also establish liabilities for estimated warranty costs based upon historical experience and specific warranty provisions. Warranty liabilities are adjusted when experience indicates the expected outcome will differ
from initial estimates of the liability.

Other Income, Net

Royalty income from the licensing of technology is reported as other non-operating income and is recognized as it is earned. For all periods presented, royalty income represents the largest item included in
“Other income, net” in Corning’s consolidated statements of operations. For 2007, 2006, and 2005, royalty income was $168 million, $110 million, and $81 million.

Research and Development Costs

Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred. Research
and development costs totaled $446 million in 2007, $409 million in 2006, and $348 million in 2005.

Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions

The determination of the functional currency for Corning’s foreign subsidiaries is made based on the appropriate economic factors. For most
foreign operations, the local currencies are generally considered to be the functional currencies. Corning’s most significant exception is our Taiwanese subsidiary which uses the Japanese yen as its functional currency. For all transactions
denominated in a currency other than a subsidiary’s functional currency, exchange rate gains and losses are included in income for the period in which the exchange rates changed.

Foreign subsidiary functional currency balance sheet accounts are translated at current exchange rates, and statement of operations accounts are translated at average exchange rates for the year. Translation gains and
losses are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders’ equity. The effects of remeasuring non-functional currency assets and liabilities into the functional currency are included in current
earnings.

Stock-Based Compensation

Corning
implemented the provisions of SFAS 123(R) on January 1, 2006, following the “prospective adoption” transition method and accordingly began expensing share-based payments in the first quarter of 2006. Following the prospective adoption
transition method prior periods were not restated.

Corning grants restricted shares and stock options that are subject to specific vesting conditions (for
example, three-year graded vesting). For stock options granted prior to January 1, 2006, Corning specified that the employee will continue to vest in the award after retirement without providing any additional services. Corning accounted for
this type of arrangement by recognizing compensation cost on a pro forma disclosure basis over the requisite vesting period (the “stated vesting period approach”). For time-based and performance-based restricted shares granted prior to
January 1, 2006, Corning specified that the employee will vest in the award after retirement without providing any additional services. Corning accounted for this type of arrangement by recognizing compensation cost over the nominal vesting
period and, if the employee retires before the end of the vesting period, recognizing any remaining unrecognized compensation cost at the date of retirement (the “nominal vesting period approach”).

SFAS 123(R) specifies that an award is vested when the employee’s retention of the award is no longer contingent on providing subsequent service (the
“non-substantive vesting period approach”). That would be the case for Corning awards that vest when employees retire and are granted to retirement eligible employees. Effective January 1, 2006, related compensation cost must be
recognized immediately for awards granted to retirement eligible employees or over the period from the grant date to the date retirement eligibility is achieved, if that is expected to occur during the nominal vesting period.

We continue to follow the stated and nominal vesting period approaches for any share-based awards granted prior to adopting SFAS 123(R) and will continue to do so for
the remaining portion of such unvested outstanding awards after adopting SFAS 123(R). Effective with the adoption of SFAS 123(R), on January 1, 2006, we now apply the non-substantive vesting period approach to new grants that have retirement
eligibility provisions.

Refer to Note 17 (Share-based Compensation) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Cash
and Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash. We consider securities with
contractual maturities of three months or less, when purchased, to be cash equivalents. The carrying amount of these securities approximates fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments.

Supplemental disclosure of cash flow information follows (in millions):

(1)

Included in this amount is approximately $19 million, $37 million, and $27 million of interest costs that were capitalized as part of property, net in 2007, 2006, and 2005,
respectively.

Short-Term Investments

Our short-term investments consist of debt securities classified as available-for-sale, which are stated at fair value. These debt securities may include U.S. treasury notes, state and municipal bonds, asset-backed securities, auction rate
securities, corporate bonds, commercial paper and certificates of deposit. These investments are on deposit with a major financial institution. Unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, are computed on the first-in first-out basis and are reported as
a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders’ equity until realized. Realized gains and losses are recorded in other income (expense), net.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts is determined based on a
variety of factors that affect the potential collectibility of the related receivables, including length of time receivables are past due, customer credit ratings, financial stability of customers, specific one-time events and past customer history.
In addition, in circumstances where the Company is made aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations, a specific allowance is established. The majority of accounts are individually evaluated on a regular basis and
appropriate reserves are established as deemed appropriate based on the above criteria. The remainder of the reserve is based on management’s estimates and takes into consideration historical trends, market conditions and the composition of the
Company’s customer base.

Environmental Liabilities

The Company accrues for its environmental investigation, remediation, operating, and maintenance costs when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. For
environmental matters, the most likely cost to be incurred is accrued based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site, current laws and regulations and prior remediation experience. For sites with multiple
potential responsible parties (PRP’s), the Company considers its likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation costs and the ability of the other parties to fulfill their obligations in establishing a provision for those costs.
Where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely to occur than another, the minimum is accrued. When future liabilities are determined to be reimbursable by insurance coverage, an accrual is recorded for the potential liability and a
receivable is recorded related to the insurance reimbursement when reimbursement is virtually certain. The uncertain nature inherent in such remediation and the possibility that initial estimates may not reflect the final outcome could result in
additional costs.

Inventories

Inventories are
stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out basis) or market.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Property, Net of Accumulated Depreciation

Land, buildings, and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is based on estimated
useful lives of properties using the straight-line method. Except as described in Note 2 (Restructuring, Impairment and Other Charges and (Credits)) related to accelerated depreciation arising from restructuring programs, the estimated useful lives
range from 20 to 40 years for buildings and 3 to 20 years for equipment.

Included in the subcategory of equipment are the following types of assets:

Included in manufacturing equipment are certain components of production equipment that are coated with or
constructed of precious metals. These metals have an indefinite useful life because they will be returned to their elemental state and reused or sold.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill is the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to assets
acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter, and will be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that more likely than not
would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. Impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level. Reporting units are either one level below the operating segment level or an aggregation of two or more reporting units within the
same operating segment if such reporting units share similar economic characteristics. Goodwill relates and is assigned directly to a specific reporting unit. An impairment loss generally would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting
unit’s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. Refer to Note 2 (Restructuring, Impairment and Other Charges and
(Credits)) and Note 9 (Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets) for additional information.

Other intangible assets include patents, trademarks, and other
intangible assets acquired from an independent party. Such intangible assets have a definite life and are amortized on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives ranging from 5 to 20 years.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

We review the recoverability
of our long-lived assets, such as plant and equipment and intangible assets, when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable. The assessment of possible
impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of the asset or asset group from the expected future pre-tax cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) of the related operations. We assess the recoverability of the
carrying value of long-lived assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. If these cash flows are less than the carrying value of such asset or asset group,
an impairment loss is measured based on the difference between estimated fair value and carrying value. Assets to be disposed are written-down to the greater of their fair value or salvage value. Fair values are determined using a discounted cash
flow analysis.

Treasury Stock

Shares of
common stock repurchased by us are recorded at cost as treasury stock and result in a reduction of shareholders’ equity in the consolidated balance sheets. From time to time, treasury shares may be reissued as contributions to our employee
benefit plans and for the retirement or conversion of certain debt instruments. When shares are reissued, we use an average cost method for determining cost. The difference between the cost of the shares and the reissuance price is added to or
deducted from additional paid-in capital.


1.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method prescribed by SFAS 109. Under this method,
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to operating loss and tax credit carry forwards and for differences between the carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective
tax bases. The effect of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period of enactment. Valuation allowances are established when management is unable to conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred
tax asset will ultimately be realized.

The Company is subject to income taxes in the United States and in numerous foreign jurisdictions. No provision is
made for U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of wholly owned foreign subsidiaries because substantially all such earnings are indefinitely reinvested in those companies. Provision for the tax consequences of distributions, if any, from
consolidated foreign subsidiaries is recorded in the year the distribution is declared. Significant judgment is required in determining the Company’s worldwide income tax position as well as the effective tax rate.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Management believes that
the carrying values of financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximate fair value as a result of the short-term maturities of these
instruments.

Derivative Instruments

We
participate in a variety of foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign exchange option contracts and interest rate swaps entered into in connection with the management of our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates. These
financial exposures are managed in accordance with corporate policies and procedures.

All derivatives are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and hedges of net investments in foreign operations are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Amounts, related to cash flow hedges are reclassified from
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) when the underlying hedged item impacts earnings. This reclassification is recorded in the same line item of the consolidated statement of operations as where the effects of the hedged item are recorded,
typically sales or cost of sales. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recorded currently in earnings offset to the extent the derivative was effective, by the change in the fair value of the hedged item.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are recorded currently in earnings in the other income line of the consolidated statement of operations.

We have issued foreign currency denominated debt that has been designated as a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation. The effective portion of the changes in fair value of the debt is reflected as a
component of other comprehensive income (loss) as part of the foreign currency translation adjustment.

Variable Interest Entities

For variable interest entities, we assess the terms of our interest in each entity to determine if we are the primary beneficiary as prescribed by
FIN 46R. The primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is the party that absorbs a majority of the entity’s expected losses, receives a majority of its expected residual returns, or both, as a result of holding variable interests, which
are the ownership, contractual, or other pecuniary interests in an entity that change with changes in the fair value of the entity’s net assets excluding variable interests.

Corning leases certain transportation equipment from a Trust that qualifies as a variable interest entity under FIN 46R. The sole purpose of this entity is leasing transportation equipment to Corning. Since Corning is
the primary beneficiary of this entity, the financial statements of the entity are included in Corning’s consolidated financial statements. The entity’s assets are primarily comprised of fixed assets which are collateral for the
entity’s borrowings. These assets, amounting to approximately $28 million and $29 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, are classified as long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheet.

Corning leases certain transportation equipment from two additional Trusts that qualify as variable interest entities under FIN 46R. Corning is not the primary
beneficiary of these entities. The sole purpose of the entities is leasing transportation equipment to Corning. Corning has been involved with these entities as lessee since the inception of the Trusts. Lease revenue generated by these Trusts was $2
million for each of the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Corning’s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with the Trusts is estimated at approximately $14 million and $16 million at
December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

New
Accounting Standards

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS)
No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in applying generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
SFAS 157 applies whenever an entity is measuring fair value under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurement. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15,
2007, however the FASB provided a one year deferral for implementation of the standard for non-financial assets and liabilities. Corning does not expect the adoption of SFAS 157 to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations and
financial condition.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115” (SFAS 159). SFAS 159 allows all entities a one-time election to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at
fair value (the “fair value option”). SFAS 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. Corning has not elected the fair value option for any assets or liabilities under SFAS 159.

In March 2007, the FASB ratified Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 06-10 “Accounting for Deferred Compensation and Postretirement Benefit Aspects of
Collateral Assignment Split-Dollar Life Insurance Arrangements” (EITF 06-10). EITF 06-10 requires that an employer recognize a liability for the postretirement benefit obligation related to a collateral assignment arrangement in accordance with
SFAS 106 (if deemed part of a postretirement plan) or APB 12 (if not part of such a plan). Corning is required to adopt EITF 06-10 effective January 1, 2008. Corning does not expect the adoption of EITF 06-10 to have a material impact on its
consolidated results of operations and financial condition.

In April 2007, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position FIN 39-1, “Amendment of FASB
Interpretation No. 39” (FSP FIN 39-1). FSP FIN 39-1 amends FASB Interpretation (FIN) 39 “Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Contracts - an interpretation of APB Opinion No. 10 and FASB Statement No. 105,” (FIN 39)
to replace the terms “conditional contracts” and “exchange contracts” with the term “derivative instruments.” It also amends FIN 39 to permit a reporting entity to offset certain fair value amounts. Corning is required
to adopt FSP FIN 39-1 effective January 1, 2008. Corning does not expect the adoption of FSP FIN 39-1 to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition.

In June 2007, the FASB issued EITF Issue No. 06-11 “Accounting for Income Tax Benefits of Dividends on Share-Based Payment Awards” (EITF 06-11). EITF
06-11 relates to the accounting for income tax benefits related to the payment of dividends on equity-classified employee share-based payment awards. Corning is required to adopt EITF 06-11 effective January 1, 2008. Corning does not expect the
adoption of EITF 06-11 to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition.

In June 2007, the FASB issued EITF
Issue 07-3 “Accounting for Advance Payments for Goods or Services to Be Used in Future Research and Development Activities” (EITF 07-3). The scope of EITF 07-3 is limited to nonrefundable advance payments for goods and services related to
research and development activities. EITF 07-3 requires that advanced payments be capitalized and subsequently expensed as the goods are delivered or services performed. Corning is required to adopt EITF 07-3 effective January 1, 2008. Corning
does not expect the adoption of EITF 07-3 to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition.

In December 2007,
the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), “Business Combinations (revised - 2007)” (SFAS 141(R)). SFAS 141(R) is a revision to previously existing guidance on accounting for business combinations. The statement retains the fundamental concept
of the purchase method of accounting, and introduces new requirements for the recognition and measurement of assets acquired, liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests. The statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2008. Corning does not expect adoption of this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements” (SFAS 160). The Statement requires that noncontrolling interests be reported as
stockholders equity, a change that will affect Corning’s financial statement presentation of minority interests in its consolidated subsidiaries. The Statement also establishes a single method of accounting for changes in a parent’s
ownership interest in a subsidiary as long as that ownership change does not result in deconsolidation. SFAS 160 is required to be applied prospectively in 2009, except for the presentation and disclosure requirements which are to be applied
retrospectively. The statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. Corning is currently evaluating the impact of SFAS 160 and, except for certain reclassifications required upon adoption of this standard, does not
expect a material impact to its consolidated results of operations and financial condition.


1.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

In
December 2007, the FASB issued EITF Issue 07-1 “Accounting for Collaborative Arrangements” (EITF 07-1). Collaborative arrangements are agreements between parties to participate in some type of joint operating activity. The task force
provided indicators to help identify collaborative arrangements and provides for reporting of such arrangements on a gross or net basis pursuant to guidance in existing authoritative literature. The task force also expanded disclosure requirements
about collaborative arrangements. Conclusions within EITF 07-1 are to be applied retrospectively. Corning is required to adopt EITF 07-1 effective January 1, 2008. The adoption of EITF 07-1 is not expected to have a material impact on
Corning’s consolidated results of operations and financial condition.

Restructuring, Impairment and Other Charges and (Credits)

2007 Actions

In 2007, Corning recorded net credit adjustments of $4 million for revisions to existing restructuring plans.

The following table summarizes the restructuring, impairment, and other charges and (credits) as of and for the year ended December 31, 2007 (in
millions):

Cash payments for employee-related costs will be substantially completed by the end of 2008, while payments for
exit activities will be substantially completed by the end of 2010.

2006 Actions

Corning recorded net charges of $54 million in 2006. A summary of the charges and credits follows:

•

We recorded a $44 million asset impairment charge in accordance with SFAS 144 for certain assets in our Telecommunications segment.

•

We recorded a charge of $5 million for severance and curtailment costs and a $6 million impairment charge related to certain manufacturing operations of our Life
Sciences segment and Specialty Materials business in the U.K.

•

We recorded a $7 million charge for a revision to an existing restructuring plan for a German location in our Telecommunications segment.

•

We recorded various credits related to existing restructuring plans and for previously impaired assets.

Restructuring, Impairment and Other Charges and (Credits) (continued)

The following table summarizes the restructuring, impairment, and other charges and (credits) as of and for the year ended December 31, 2006 (in millions):

2005 Actions

Corning recorded net credits of $38 million in 2005. A summary of the charges and credits follows:

•

We recorded a credit of $84 million for the reversal of the cumulative translation account of O.T.I. S.r.l. (OTI), a wholly-owned foreign subsidiary of Corning,
upon OTI’s substantial liquidation. The photonics business in Milan, Italy, was the sole operation of OTI, whose results were included in Telecommunications segment. Subsequent to Corning’s agreement to sell its photonics business
operations to Avanex Corporation (Avanex) in 2003, Corning began liquidating OTI. In October 2005, the assets were substantially liquidated and OTI’s cumulative translation account was reversed.

•

We recorded a charge of $30 million which was comprised of severance costs for a restructuring plan in the Telecommunications segment to continue to reduce costs in
this segment.

•

We recorded net credit adjustments of $9 million to prior year restructuring plans which included charges of $8 million related to our Telecommunications segment
and credits of $17 million for businesses in our All Other segment.

•

We recorded impairment charges of $25 million in the Telecommunications segment for an other than temporary decline in the fair value of our investment in Avanex
below its adjusted cost basis. Our investment in Avanex was accounted for as an available-for-sale security under SFAS No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities” (SFAS 115). In the fourth quarter of
2005, we completed the sale of our remaining shares of Avanex.

Restructuring, Impairment and Other Charges and (Credits) (continued)

The following table summarizes the charges, credits and balances of the restructuring liabilities as of and for the year ended December 31, 2005 (in millions):

In 2005, net charges (credits) for restructuring, impairment, and other actions included a credit of $47 million
for the Telecommunications segment and charges of $9 million for the other segments.

Short-Term Investments

The following is a summary of the fair
value of available-for-sale securities (in millions):

Gross unrealized gains and losses were insignificant at December 31, 2007 and 2006. Asset-backed securities
are collateralized by credit card loans, auto loans, mortgages and student loans. At December 31, 2007, our exposure to sub-prime mortgages was $17 million. Unrealized losses on securities backed by sub-prime mortgages which are rated as
investment grade, were approximately $1 million at December 31, 2007, and are expected to recover in the short-term. Losses realized in 2007 for these types of securities amounted to $6 million.

The following table summarizes the contractual maturities of available-for-sale securities at December 31, 2007 (in millions):

Less than one year

Income Taxes (continued)

Reconciliation of the U.S. statutory
income tax rate to our effective tax rate for continuing operations follows:

Significant items that cause our effective tax rate to vary from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% are as follows:

(1)

In 2004, significant events occurred which required us to increase our valuation allowance against our U.S. deferred tax assets. At that time, we believed that it was more likely
than not that we could realize the remaining net U.S. deferred tax assets of approximately $525 million through a tax planning strategy involving the sale of our investment in Dow Corning, a non-strategic appreciated asset, if we were faced with
expiring net operating loss carryforwards. During 2005, Dow Corning’s performance was much stronger than expected and Dow Corning resumed paying a dividend; both of which are expected to continue in the future. Due to this improved performance,
we concluded that Dow Corning provides strong financial, geographic and market balance to Corning’s portfolio of businesses, the profitability of which has become more concentrated due to the success of the display operating segment. As a
result, we considered Dow Corning to be a strategic investment and could no longer assert that a potential tax planning strategy involving the sale of Dow Corning would be prudent, as required by FAS 109. Therefore, we no longer believed, in the
fourth quarter of 2005, that it was more likely than not that we would realize the remaining net deferred tax assets. Accordingly, we increased our valuation allowance by $525 million to fully reserve our net U.S. deferred tax assets in the fourth
quarter of 2005, which increased our effective tax rate by 94%.

(2)

During the third quarter of 2005, Corning filed its 2004 consolidated U.S. Federal income tax return, which included a $3.9 billion worthless stock deduction for the loss on our
investment in the photonic technologies business associated with the Pirelli acquisition. This acquisition was completed in December 2000 and was substantially impaired in the second quarter of 2001. Prior to the third quarter of 2005, we did not
record a deferred tax asset for this item as the ultimate realization of such deduction was uncertain, and consistent with the requirements of SFAS 5, recognition of an asset prior to the time management determines the realization of the asset is
probable is prohibited. On September 2, 2005, Corning and the Commissioner of the IRS entered into a closing agreement under section 7121 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 which provides that Corning is entitled to this worthless stock
deduction. We recorded a $1.5 billion deferred tax asset for this item in the third quarter, which was concurrently offset by a valuation allowance of an equal amount due to our inability to record tax benefits for U.S. net operating losses. The net
result had no impact of our effective tax rate for 2005.

(3)

We were unable to record tax benefits on net operating losses generated in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, resulting in an increase in the effective tax rate of 7.3% for
2005.

(4)

In both 2007 and 2006, we generated income from continuing operations in the U.S. The tax expense on such income was fully offset by the tax benefit of releasing a portion of the
valuation allowance to reflect the realization of deferred taxes resulting from the generation of U.S. income. The impact of the release of valuation allowance and, thus, not recording tax expense on income generated in the U.S. is a reduction in
the rate of 14.2% for both 2007 and 2006, respectively.

(5)

In 2004, we recorded valuation allowances against our entire German and Australian deferred tax assets due to losses in recent years. In 2007, due to sustained profitability and
positive earnings projections for our overall German operations, we have concluded that it is more likely than not that the German national deferred tax assets are realizable and that the related valuation allowance is no longer required. In 2006,
due to sustained profitability and positive earnings projections in Australia and at certain of our German operations, we concluded that it was more likely than not that a portion of the German local and the entire Australian deferred tax assets
were realizable and that the related valuation allowances were no longer required. The impact of the release of the valuation allowances on our effective rate is a reduction in the rate of 12.4% and 8.7% for 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Certain foreign subsidiaries in China, South Africa and Taiwan are operating under tax holiday arrangements. The nature and extent of such arrangements vary, and the benefits of
existing arrangements phase out in future years (through 2011) according to the specific terms and schedules of the relevant taxing jurisdictions. The impact of the tax holidays on our effective rate is a reduction in the rate of 12.1%, 10.1% and
8.9% for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Taiwan grants investment tax credits for investments in qualifying machinery and equipment. The impact of such credits on our effective tax rate is a reduction in the rate of 0.4%,
3.1%, and 12.3%, for 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.

The elimination of our minimum pension liability for the domestic qualified plan in 2005 resulted in a decrease in the effective tax rate of 14.6%.

In 2007, U.S. and German deferred taxes were revised for enacted law changes. The impact on the effective rate is an increase of 13.2%.

Income Taxes (continued)

SFAS No. 109 provides that deferred
tax assets are to be reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available positive and negative evidence, it is more likely than not (a likelihood of greater than 50 percent) that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will
not be realized. SFAS No. 109 further requires that in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, objective evidence (e.g. actual, historical information) should be given greater weight than subjective evidence (e.g. the outlook for
future profitability). The valuation allowance should be sufficient to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.

In both 2006 and 2007, we generated income from continuing operations in the U.S. The tax expense on such income was fully offset by the tax benefit of releasing a portion of the valuation allowance to reflect the realization of deferred
taxes resulting from the generation of U.S. income. The impact of the release of the valuation allowances, and thus not recording tax expense on income generated in the U.S., is a reduction in our effective tax rate of 14.2% for both 2007 and 2006.

We continue to provide a full valuation allowance against all of our U.S. deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2007 because we do not believe it is
more likely than not that we will be able to generate in the future sufficient levels of profitability in the U.S. to realize some or all of the deferred tax assets. U.S. profits of approximately $8.3 billion dollars would be required to fully
realize the deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2007. Of that amount, $4.2 billion of U.S. profits would be required over the next 19 years to fully realize the deferred tax assets associated with federal net operating loss carry forwards.
Our evaluation of the realizability of our deferred tax assets is inherently subjective and is based on our analysis and weighting of all positive and negative evidence available to us. This evaluation includes estimates and assumptions about a
number of market, execution and economic variables. Our judgment as of December 31, 2007 has been formed based on these variables which include:

•

We had a taxable loss in the U.S. in 2005 and, absent nonrecurring items, we would have also had a taxable loss in the U.S. in 2006. 2007 is the only year in the
last three years in which we have generated income in the U.S. when considering only recurring items.

•

Although our consolidated net income has reached record levels, we have continued to incur losses or have generated only marginal profitability in the U.S. because
(a) Display Technologies, the key driver of our consolidated profitability, is largely a foreign-based business with only net royalty income occurring in the U.S.; (b) our Environmental and Life Sciences segments have lost money or have
been only marginally profitable due to very significant U.S.-based factory start-up costs and developmental spending; and (c) improvement in our Telecommunications segment has been more than offset by higher U.S.-based research, development,
and engineering, stock and incentive compensation and other administrative expenses.

•

A significant factor in our forecasts of future U.S. taxable profitability is the amount of assumed royalties to be paid by our Display Technologies businesses to
the U.S. The amount of such royalties could decline if our sales of LCD glass are impacted by:

•

manufacturing capacity constraints;

•

(a) reduced demand due to the slowing of corporate information technology and consumer spending or (b) challenges to pricing, both of which may arise from
global economic pressures; or

•

shifts in the global market share of our customers which manufacture flat panel TV and computer monitors.

Additionally, a change in our judgment regarding the sustainability of the level of these royalties in accordance with the principles of FIN 48,
“Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes” may also impact our forecasts of U.S. profitability.

Although we remain optimistic about our
consolidated outlook for 2008 and beyond, as of December 31, 2007, we are sufficiently uncertain about our U.S.-based results, primarily due to the current economic uncertainty, but also due to a number of market and execution risks in our
operating segments, particularly those pertaining to Display Technologies, as noted above that we have concluded that the positive evidence supporting realization of our U.S. deferred tax assets does not sufficiently outweigh the negative evidence
that we will not realize our U.S. deferred tax assets.

We will update our assessment of the realizability of our U.S. deferred tax assets on a quarterly
basis in 2008, taking into account year-to-date actual as well as forecasted U.S. results. If, after considering the actual results and the potential impact of the economic uncertainties and business risks considered in our 2007 year-end assessment
as well as our FIN 48 assessment of the Display Technologies U.S. royalties we conclude that it is more likely than not that we will be profitable in the U.S. in 2008 and future years, we will quantify the portion of our U.S. deferred tax assets we
believe to be realizable and reduce our valuation allowance accordingly. Until that time, we will continue to adjust the valuation allowance to offset the current U.S. income tax expense (or benefit) that would otherwise be recorded on income (or
losses) in the U.S. and, therefore, reflect no net U.S. income tax expense.

Income Taxes (continued)

We do not provide income taxes on the
post-1992 earnings of domestic subsidiaries that we expect to recover tax-free without significant cost. Income taxes have been provided for post-1992 unremitted earnings of domestic corporate joint ventures that we do not expect to recover
tax-free. Unremitted earnings of domestic subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures that arose in fiscal years beginning on or before December 31, 1992 have been indefinitely reinvested. We currently provide income taxes on the earnings of
foreign subsidiaries and affiliated companies to the extent these earnings are currently taxable or expected to be remitted. As of December 31, 2007, taxes have not been provided on approximately $4.0 billion of accumulated foreign unremitted
earnings which are expected to remain invested indefinitely.

We adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, “Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes,” (FIN 48) effective January 1, 2007. As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, we recognized a $25 million increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and a decrease to the January 1, 2007,
balance of retained earnings of $4 million. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in millions):

Included in the balance at December 31, 2007 is $25 million of unrecognized tax benefits which would impact
our effective tax rate if recognized.

We recognize accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of tax expense. During
the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, we recognized approximately $1 million of interest expense, $0.5 million and $2.6 million in interest income, respectively. We had approximately $7.1 million and $4.1 million accrued at
December 31 2007 and 2006, respectively, for the payment of interest and penalties.

Corning Incorporated, as the common parent company, and all
80%-or-more-owned U.S. subsidiaries join in the filing of consolidated U.S. federal income tax returns. All such returns for periods ended through December 31, 2004, have been audited by and settled with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). We
expect the IRS to begin the examination of our consolidated U.S. federal income tax returns for the years ended December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2006 in the first quarter of 2008.

Corning Incorporated and U.S. subsidiaries file income tax returns on a combined, unitary or stand-alone basis in multiple state and local jurisdictions, which generally
have statutes of limitations ranging from 3 to 5 years. Various state income tax returns are currently in the process of examination or administrative appeal.

Our foreign subsidiaries file income tax returns in the countries in which they have operations. Generally, these countries have statutes of limitations ranging from 3 to 7 years. Years still open to examination by foreign tax authorities
in major jurisdictions include Japan (2000 onward) and Taiwan (2004 onward).

While we expect the amount of unrecognized tax benefits to change in the next
12 months, we do not expect the change to have a significant impact on the results of operations or our financial position.

Amounts include the following restructuring, impairment and other charges and (credits):

•

In 2007, equity earnings from Samsung Corning were reduced by $40 million primarily due to restructuring and impairment charges.

•

In 2006, Dow Corning reached settlement with the IRS regarding liabilities for tax years 1992 to 2003. Equity earnings reflected a $33 million gain as a result of the settlement
which resolved all Federal tax issues related to Dow Corning’s implant settlement.

•

In 2006, Samsung Corning recorded the following items which increased Corning’s equity earnings by $2 million, net: a gain on the sale of land which increased Corning’s
equity earnings by $61 million; an impairment charge for certain long-lived assets which reduced Corning’s equity earnings by $46 million; and the establishment of a valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets which reduced
Corning’s equity earnings by $13 million.

•

In 2005, Samsung Corning incurred impairment and other charges as a result of a decline in the projected operating results for its cathode ray tube (CRT) glass business. The charge,
which included certain manufacturing assets and severance and exit costs, reduced Corning’s equity earnings by $106 million in the third quarter.

•

In 2005, Dow Corning recorded a gain on the issuance of subsidiary stock. Our equity earnings included $11 million related to this gain.

We have contractual agreements with several of our equity investees which include sales, purchasing, licensing and technology agreements.

At December 31, 2007, approximately $2.7 billion of equity in undistributed earnings of equity companies was included in our accumulated deficit.

Investments (continued)

A discussion and summarized results of
Corning’s significant investees at December 31, 2007 follows:

Samsung Corning Precision Glass Co., Ltd. (Samsung Corning Precision)

Samsung Corning Precision is a South Korea-based manufacturer of liquid crystal display glass for flat panel displays. Samsung Corning Precision’s
financial position and results of operations follow (in millions):

(1)

Corning purchases machinery and equipment on behalf of Samsung Corning Precision to support its capital expansion initiatives. The machinery and equipment are transferred to Samsung
Corning Precision at our cost basis, resulting in no revenue or gain being recognized on the transaction.

Balances due to and from Samsung
Corning Precision were $6 million and $31 million, respectively, at December 31, 2007 and $2 million and $19 million, respectively, at December 31, 2006.

In February 2006, Corning made a capital contribution to Samsung Corning Precision in the amount of 75 billion Korean won (approximately $77 million USD).

On December 31, 2007, Samsung Corning Precision acquired all of the outstanding shares of Samsung Corning. After the transaction, Corning retained its 50% interest in Samsung Corning Precision. As a result of this transaction, a
difference now exists between the carrying amount of Corning’s investment in Samsung Corning Precision and 50% of the net assets of Samsung Corning Precision because Samsung Corning Precision accounted for the transaction at fair value while
Corning accounted for the transaction at historical cost.

As of December 31, 2007, Samsung Corning Precision was one of approximately thirty
co-defendants in a lawsuit filed by Seoul Guarantee Insurance Co. and 13 other creditors. Refer to Samsung Corning Co., Ltd. Section of this note for additional information.

Investments (continued)

In February 2006, Corning made a capital
contribution to Samsung Corning Precision in the amount of 75 billion Korean won (approximately 77 million USD).

Samsung Corning Co., Ltd.
(Samsung Corning)

Samsung Corning was a South Korea-based manufacturer of glass panels and funnels for cathode ray tube (CRT) television and display
monitors.

In the fourth quarter of 2007, Samsung Corning recorded a gain of approximately $17 million on metal and scrap sales which increased
Corning’s equity earnings by approximately $8 million in the fourth quarter. Samsung Corning also recorded asset impairment and restructuring charges of $28 million. This charge reduced Corning’s equity earnings by approximately $14
million in the fourth quarter.

During 2007, Samsung Corning incurred impairment and other charges totaling $94 million as a result of a decline in the
projected operating results for certain display businesses. These charges reduced Corning’s equity earnings by $47 million. Also in 2007, Samsung Corning recorded gains of approximately $30 million on the sale of precious metals which increased
Corning’s equity earnings by $15 million.

In the fourth quarter of 2006, Samsung Corning recorded a gain on the sale of land totaling $122 million,
which increased Corning’s equity earnings by $61 million. Samsung Corning also recorded a charge of $25 million for the establishment of a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets. This charge reduced Corning’s equity
earnings by approximately $13 million in the fourth quarter. During 2006, Samsung Corning incurred impairment and other charges totaling $93 million as a result of a decline in the projected operating results for certain display businesses. These
charges reduced Corning’s equity earnings by $46 million.

In 2005, Samsung Corning incurred impairment and other charges of $212 million as a result
of decline in the projected operating results of its CRT glass business. The charge, which included certain manufacturing assets and severance and exit costs, reduced Corning’s equity earnings by $106 million.

On December 31, 2007, Samsung Corning Precision, a South Korean manufacturer of glass substrates for use in liquid crystal displays, which is 50%-owned by Corning,
acquired all of the outstanding shares of Samsung Corning in a transaction accounted for by Samsung Corning Precision as a purchase. After the transaction, Corning retained its 50% interest in Samsung Corning Precision.

Samsung Corning’s financial position and results of operations follow (in millions):


7.

Investments (continued)

Prior to their merger, Samsung Corning
Precision Glass Co., Ltd. (Samsung Corning Precision) and Samsung Corning Co. Ltd. (Samsung Corning) were two of approximately thirty co-defendants in a lawsuit filed by Seoul Guarantee Insurance Co. and fourteen other creditors (SGI and Creditors)
for alleged breach of an agreement that approximately thirty affiliates of the Samsung group entered into with SGI and Creditors in September 1999 (“the Agreement”). The lawsuit is pending in the courts of South Korea. According to the
Agreement, the Samsung affiliates agreed to sell 3.5 million shares of Samsung Life Insurance Co., Ltd. (SLI) by December 31, 2000, which were transferred to SGI and Creditors in connection with the petition for court receivership of
Samsung Motor Inc. In the lawsuit, SGI and Creditors allege that, in the event that the proceeds of sale of the SLI shares is less than 2.45 trillion Korean won (approximately $2.64 billion), the Samsung affiliates allegedly agreed to compensate SGI
and Creditors for the shortfall, by other means, including the sale of an additional 500,000 SLI shares and Samsung affiliates’ purchase of equity or subordinated debentures to be issued by SGI and Creditors. Any excess proceeds from the sale
of the SLI shares are to be distributed to the Samsung affiliates. The suit asks for total damages of 4.73 trillion Korean won (approximately $5.11 billion) plus penalty interest. On January, 31, 2008, the court in this case ruled that the Agreement
was valid and that Samsung affiliates have a joint and severable liability for the principal (less a proportion of that amount for any SLI shares sold by any of the SLI Creditors), plus interest at a rate of 6% per annum. The total amount
payable under the court ruling was $2.44 billion Korean won ($1.70 billion in principal and the remainder in interest). Due to the uncertainties around the financial impact to each of the respective Samsung affiliates, Samsung Corning Precision is
unable to reasonably estimate the amount of potential loss associated with this case and therefore no provision for such loss is reflected in its financial statements. Other than as described above, no claim in these matters has been asserted
against Corning Incorporated or any of its affiliates.

Dow Corning Corporation (Dow Corning)

Dow Corning is a U.S.-based manufacturer of silicone products. In 1995, Corning fully impaired its investment of Dow Corning upon its entry into bankruptcy proceedings
and did not recognize net equity earnings from the second quarter of 1995 through the end of 2002. Corning began recognizing equity earnings in the first quarter of 2003 when management concluded that Dow Corning’s emergence from bankruptcy
protection was probable. Dow Corning emerged from bankruptcy in 2004. See discussion below for additional information and for a history of this matter. Corning considers the $249 million difference between the carrying value of its investment in Dow
Corning and its 50% share of Dow Corning’s equity to be permanent.

Dow Corning’s financial position and results of operations follow (in
millions):

In 2006, Dow Corning recorded a gain related to their settlement with the IRS regarding liabilities for tax years
1992 to 2003. This settlement resolves all federal tax issues related to Dow Corning’s implant settlement. Corning’s equity earnings included $33 million related to this gain.


7.

Investments (continued)

Corning and Dow Chemical each own 50% of
the common stock of Dow Corning. In May 1995, Dow Corning filed for bankruptcy protection to address pending and claimed liabilities arising from many thousands of breast implant product lawsuits. On June 1, 2004, Dow Corning emerged from
Chapter 11 with a Plan of Reorganization (the Plan) which provided for the settlement or other resolution of implant claims. The Plan also includes releases for Corning and Dow Chemical as shareholders in exchange for contributions to the Plan.

Under the terms of the Plan, Dow Corning has established and is funding a Settlement Trust and a Litigation Facility to provide a means for tort claimants
to settle or litigate their claims. Inclusive of insurance, Dow Corning has paid approximately $1.5 billion to the Settlement Trust. As of December 31, 2007, Dow Corning had recorded a reserve for breast implant litigation of $1.7 billion and
anticipates insurance receivables of $131 million. As a separate matter arising from the bankruptcy proceedings, Dow Corning is defending claims asserted by a number of commercial creditors who claim additional interest at default rates and
enforcement costs, during the period from May 1995 through June 2004. On July 26, 2006, the U.S. Court of Appeals vacated the judgment of the District Court fixing the interest component, ruled that default interest and enforcement costs may be
awarded subject to equitable factors to be determined, and directed that the matter be remanded for further proceedings. Dow Corning’s petition for rehearing by the Court of Appeals and its petition for a writ of certiorari with the U.S.
Supreme Court were both denied. As of December 31, 2007, Dow Corning has estimated the interest payable to commercial creditors to be within the range of $71 million to $236 million. As Dow Corning management believes no single amount within
the range appears to be a better estimate than any other amount within the range, Dow Corning has recorded the minimum liability within the range. Should Dow Corning not prevail in this matter, Corning’s equity earnings would be reduced by its
50% share of the amount in excess of $71 million, net of applicable tax benefits. There are a number of other claims in the bankruptcy proceedings against Dow Corning awaiting resolution by the U.S. District Court, and it is reasonably possible that
Dow Corning may record bankruptcy-related charges in the future. There are no remaining tort implant claims against Corning, other than those that will be channeled by the Plan into facilities established by the Plan or otherwise defended by the
Litigation Facility.

Pittsburgh Corning Corporation (PCC)

Corning and PPG Industries, Inc. (PPG) each own 50% of the capital stock of Pittsburgh Corning Corporation (PCC). Over a period of more than two decades, PCC and several other defendants have been named in numerous lawsuits involving claims
alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos. On April 16, 2000, PCC filed for Chapter 11 reorganization in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. As a result of PCC’s bankruptcy filing, Corning recorded
an after-tax charge of $36 million in 2001 to fully impair its investment in PCC and discontinued recognition of equity earnings. At the time PCC filed for bankruptcy protection, there were approximately 12,400 claims pending against Corning in
state court lawsuits alleging various theories of liability based on exposure to PCC’s asbestos products and typically requesting monetary damages in excess of one million dollars per claim. Corning has defended those claims on the basis of the
separate corporate status of PCC and the absence of any facts supporting claims of direct liability arising from PCC’s asbestos products. Corning is also currently named in approximately 10,300 other cases (approximately 41,700 claims) alleging
injuries from asbestos and similar amounts of monetary damages per claim. Those cases have been covered by insurance without material impact to Corning to date. Asbestos litigation is inherently difficult, and past trends in resolving these claims
may not be indicators of future outcomes.

In the bankruptcy court in April 2000, PCC obtained a preliminary injunction against the prosecution of asbestos
actions arising from PCC’s products against its two shareholders to afford the parties a period of time in which to negotiate a plan of reorganization for PCC (the PCC Plan).

On May 14, 2002, PPG announced that it had agreed with certain of its insurance carriers and representatives of current and future asbestos claimants on the terms of a settlement arrangement applicable to claims
arising from PCC’s products.

On March 28, 2003, Corning announced that it had reached agreement with the representatives of asbestos claimants
for the settlement of all current and future asbestos claims against it and PCC, which might arise from PCC products or operations. The proposed settlement, if the PCC Plan is approved and becomes effective, would require Corning to relinquish its
equity interest in PCC, contribute its equity interest in Pittsburgh Corning Europe N.V. (PCE), a Belgian corporation, and contribute 25 million shares of Corning common stock. Corning would also pay a total of $140 million in six annual
installments (present value $131 million at March 2003), beginning one year after the PCC Plan becomes effective, with 5.5 percent interest from June 2004, and assign certain insurance policy proceeds from its primary insurance and a portion of its
excess insurance at the time of settlement.

The PCC Plan received a favorable vote from creditors in March 2004. Hearings to consider objections to the
PCC Plan were held in the Bankruptcy Court in May 2004. In February 2006, the Bankruptcy Court requested that the PCC Plan proponents delete references to Section 105(a) of the Bankruptcy Code and resubmit the PCC Plan. The final round of oral
argument was held on July 21, 2006.


7.

Investments (continued)

On December 21, 2006, the Bankruptcy
Court issued an order denying confirmation of the PCC Plan for reasons set out in a memorandum opinion. Several parties, including Corning, filed motions for reconsideration. These motions were argued on March 5, 2007, and the Bankruptcy Court
reserved decision. On January 10, 2008, some of the parties in the proceeding advised the Bankruptcy Court that they had made substantial progress on an Amended Plan of Reorganization that would make it unnecessary for the Bankruptcy Court to
decide the motion for reconsideration. If the Bankruptcy Court does not approve the PCC Plan in its current form, or parties to the proceedings agree to amend the PCC Plan, changes to the PCC Plan are reasonably likely to occur that could
significantly reduce the value Corning would pay in such a changed plan.

The outcome of these proceedings is uncertain, and confirmation of the current
PCC Plan or any amended PCC Plan is subject to a number of contingencies. However, apart from the quarterly mark-to-market adjustment in the value of the components of the settlement, management believes that the likelihood of a material adverse
impact to Corning’s financial statements is remote.

Two of Corning’s primary insurers and several excess insurers have commenced litigation for
a declaration of the rights and obligations of the parties under insurance policies, including rights that may be affected by the settlement arrangement described above. Corning is vigorously contesting these cases. Management is unable to predict
the outcome of this insurance litigation.

Since March 31, 2003, we have recorded total net charges of $1.0 billion to reflect the agreed settlement
contributions and subsequent adjustments for the change in the settlement value of the components.

The liability expected to be settled by contribution of
our investment in PCE, assigned insurance proceeds, and the 25 million shares of our common stock, which totals $833 million at December 31, 2007, is recorded in the other accrued liabilities component in our consolidated balance sheets.
This portion of the PCC liability is considered a “due on demand” obligation. Accordingly, this portion of the obligation has been classified as a current liability even though it is possible that the contribution could be made beyond one
year. The remaining portion of the settlement liability, which totals $169 million at December 31, 2007, representing the net present value of the cash payments, is recorded in the other liabilities component in our consolidated balance sheets.

Other Liabilities

Other accrued liabilities follow (in millions):

Asbestos Settlement

The current liability is expected to be settled by contribution of our investment in PCE, assigned insurance proceeds, and 25 million shares of Corning common stock, if and when the PCC Plan becomes effective. As
the timing of the settlement of the obligation under this portion of the PCC liability is outside of Corning’s control, this liability is considered a “due on demand” obligation. Accordingly, this portion of the obligation has been
classified as a current liability, even though it is possible that the contribution could be made in 2009 or later. The non-current liability represents the net present value of cash payments which will be contributed to the PCC Plan in six
installments beginning one year after the PCC Plan is effective. Refer to Note 7 (Investments) for additional information on the asbestos settlement.


10.

Other Liabilities (continued)

Customer Deposits

In 2005 and 2004, several of Corning’s customers entered into long-term purchase and supply agreements in which Corning’s Display Technologies
segment will supply large-size glass substrates to these customers over periods of up to six years. As part of the agreements, these customers agreed to make advance cash deposits to Corning for a portion of the contracted glass to be purchased.

Upon receipt of the cash deposits made by customers, we recorded a customer deposit liability. This liability is reduced at the time of future product
sales over the life of the agreements. As product is shipped to a customer, Corning recognizes revenue at the selling price and issues credit memoranda for an agreed amount of the customer deposit liability. The credit memoranda are applied against
customer receivables resulting from the sale of product, thus reducing operating cash flows in later periods as these credits are applied for cash deposits received in earlier periods.

Customer deposits have been received in the following periods (in millions):

We do not expect to receive additional deposits related to these agreements.

In 2007 and 2006, we issued credit memoranda which totaled $231 million and $126 million for the years, respectively. These credits are not included in the above table.
Customer deposit liabilities were $531 million and $633 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, of which $222 million and $213 million, were recorded in the current portion of other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance
sheets.

In the event customers elect not to purchase the agreed upon quantities of product, subject to specific conditions outlined in the agreements,
Corning may retain certain amounts of the customer deposits. If Corning does not deliver agreed upon product quantities, subject to specific conditions outlined in the agreements, Corning may be required to return certain amounts of customer
deposits.

four quarters). As of December 31, 2007, we were in compliance with these covenants.

Debt Retirements

During the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, we retired a significant portion of our outstanding notes and debentures as part of a debt reduction
program. The debt was retired through a combination of cash repurchases and exchanges for Corning common stock. The following table summarizes the activities related to our debt retirements (in millions):

(1)

Book value includes a deferred gain related to an interest rate swap on the 8.3% coupon medium-term notes due April 4, 2025 of $5 million.

(2)

The zero coupon convertible debentures cash payment includes $23 million of interest.

Issuance of Long-Term Debt

At December 31, 2006, our remaining capacity under the shelf registration
statement was approximately $1.8 billion. In the third quarter of 2006, we issued $250 million of 7.25% senior unsecured notes for net proceeds of approximately $246 million. The notes mature on August 15, 2036. We can redeem or repurchase the
debentures at any time.

In the second quarter of 2005, we issued $100 million of 6.05% senior unsecured notes for net proceeds of approximately $99
million. The notes mature on June 15, 2015. We may redeem the debentures at any time. The $100 million debt issuance, along with a common stock offering of 20 million shares for net proceeds of approximately $323 million, were issued under
our existing $5 billion universal shelf registration statement that became effective in March 2001.

Employee Retirement Plans

Defined Benefit Plans

We have defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic and international employees. Our funding policy has been to contribute, as necessary, an
amount in excess of the minimum requirements in order to achieve the company’s long-term funding targets. In 2007, we made a voluntary contribution of $149 million to our domestic and international pension plans. In 2006, we made an incremental
contribution of $15 million to our domestic and international pension plans.

We use a December 31 measurement date for our domestic defined benefit
plans. The measurement dates for our foreign defined benefit pension plans are September 30.

In 2000, we amended our U.S. pension plan to include a
cash balance pension feature. Certain salaried and non-union hourly employees remain in the traditional defined benefit plan. All salaried and non-union hourly employees hired after July 1, 2000, are automatically participants in the new cash
balance plan. Under the cash balance plan, employee accounts are credited monthly with a percentage of eligible pay based on age and years of service. Benefits are 100% vested after five years of service. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 requires
vesting after three years for cash balance plans by January 1, 2008. Corning will adopt this measure on January 1, 2008.

Corning offers
postretirement plans that provide health care and life insurance benefits for retirees and eligible dependents. Certain employees may become eligible for such postretirement benefits upon reaching retirement age. Prior to January 1, 2003, our
principal retiree medical plans required retiree contributions each year equal to the excess of medical cost increases over general inflation rates. For current retirees (including surviving spouses) and active employees eligible for the salaried
retiree medical program, we have placed a “cap” on the amount we will contribute toward retiree medical coverage in the future. The cap will equal 120% of our 2005 contributions toward retiree medical benefits. Once our contributions
toward salaried retiree medical costs reach this cap, impacted retirees will have to pay the excess amount in addition to their regular contributions for coverage.

The components of net periodic benefit expense for our employee retirement plans follow (in millions):

The Company expects to recognize $14 million of net loss and $10 million of net prior service cost as a component
of net periodic pension cost in 2008 for its defined benefit pension plans. The Company expects to recognize $9 million of net loss and $3 million of net prior service credit as a component of net periodic postretirement benefit cost in 2008.

Corning uses a specific bond matching/spot rate yield curve model for estimating the appropriate discount rate for pension and postretirement benefit
assumptions. This model develops a hypothetical yield curve and associated spot rate curve to discount the plan’s projected benefit payments and match payment durations. Once the present value of projected benefit payments is calculated, the
suggested discount rate is equal to the level rate that results in the same present value. The yield curve is based on actual high-quality corporate bonds across the full maturity spectrum. The curve is developed from yields on approximately 550-600
Moody’s Aa-graded, non-callable bonds. The highest and lowest 10th percentile yields are excluded from the curve in order to eliminate outliers in the bond population.

Measurement of postretirement benefit expense is based on assumptions used to value the postretirement benefit obligation at the beginning of the year.

The total fair value of domestic plan assets at December 31, 2007 was $2,338 million and the expected
long-term rate of return on these assets was 8%.


12.

Employee Retirement Plans (continued)

We have an investment
policy for domestic and international pension plans with a primary objective to adequately provide for both the growth and liquidity needed to support all current and future benefit payment obligations. For domestic plans, the investment strategy is
to invest in a diversified portfolio of assets which are expected to satisfy the above objective and produce both absolute and risk adjusted returns competitive with a benchmark that for domestic plans is 60% Russell 3000 Index, 20% Lehman Long
Government/Credit Index and 20% Lehman Long Credit Index. For international plans, the investment strategy is the same as for domestic plans and the benchmark is a composite of 50% equities and 50% fixed income indexes. The strategy includes the
following target asset allocation:

A tactical allocation mandate, which is part of the domestic asset investment strategy, allows the actual domestic
allocation in equity securities to be reduced by a maximum of 6% relative to the total domestic assets based on market valuations.

Equity securities
include Corning common stock in the amount of $2.5 million (0.11% of total domestic plan assets) and $10 million (0.5% of total domestic plan assets) at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Cash Flow Data

We anticipate making voluntary cash contributions of
approximately $50 million to our domestic plans in 2008.

The following reflects the gross benefit payments which are expected to be paid for the domestic
and international plans and the gross amount of annual Medicare Part D federal subsidy expected to be received (in millions):

Other Benefit Plans

We offer defined contribution plans covering employees meeting certain eligibility requirements. Total consolidated defined contribution plan expense was $39 million, $34 million and $34 million for the years ended
December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.


13.

Commitments, Contingencies, and Guarantees

The amounts of our
obligations follow (in millions):

(1)

At December 31, 2007, $38 million of the $68 million was included in other accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.

(2)

Capital expenditure obligations, primarily related to our Display Technologies segment expansions, are included on our balance sheet.

(3)

At December 31, 2007, $1,537 million was included on our balance sheet. Amounts above are stated at their maturity value.

(4)

At December 31, 2007, $19 million of the $97 million represents imputed interest.

(5)

The estimate of interest payments assumes interest is paid through the date of maturity/expiration of the related debt, based upon stated rates in the respective debt instruments.

(6)

At December 31, 2007, $25 million was included on our balance sheet related to uncertain tax positions. Of this amount, we are unable to estimate when $5 million of that amount
will become payable.

FASB Interpretation No. 45, “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees,
Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others” (FIN 45), requires a company, at the time a guarantee is issued, to recognize a liability for the fair value or market value of the obligation it assumes. In the normal course of our
business, we do not routinely provide significant third-party guarantees. Generally, third-party guarantees provided by Corning are limited to certain financial guarantees, including stand-by letters of credit and performance bonds, and the
incurrence of contingent liabilities in the form of purchase price adjustments related to attainment of milestones. These guarantees have various terms, and none of these guarantees are individually significant.

We have agreed to provide a credit facility related to Dow Corning. The funding of the Dow Corning credit facility will be required only if Dow Corning is not otherwise
able to meet its scheduled funding obligations in its confirmed Bankruptcy Plan. The purchase obligations primarily represent raw material and energy-related take-or-pay contracts. We believe a significant majority of these guarantees and contingent
liabilities will expire without being funded.

13.

Commitments, Contingencies, and Guarantees (continued)

Corning is
a defendant in various lawsuits, including environmental, product-related suits, the Dow Corning and PCC matters discussed in Note 7 (Investments), and is subject to various claims which arise in the normal course of business. In the opinion of
management, the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on Corning’s consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of operations.

We have been named by the Environmental Protection Agency under the Superfund Act, or by state governments under similar state laws, as a potentially responsible party for 20 active hazardous waste sites. Under the
Superfund Act, all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site, identified by such Agency, are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the Agency agrees otherwise. It is our policy to accrue for the
estimated liability related to Superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned and operated by us based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants. At December 31, 2007
and 2006, we had accrued approximately $19 million (undiscounted) and $16 million (undiscounted), respectively, for the estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation. Based upon the information developed to date, we believe
that the accrued amount is a reasonable estimate of our liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote.

The ability of certain subsidiaries and affiliated companies to transfer funds is limited by provisions of foreign government regulations, affiliate agreements and certain loan agreements. At December 31, 2007,
the amount of equity subject to such restrictions for consolidated subsidiaries totaled $1 billion. While this amount is legally restricted, it does not result in operational difficulties since we have generally permitted subsidiaries to retain a
majority of equity to support their growth programs.

14.

Hedging Activities

We operate and conduct business in many
foreign countries and as a result are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Our exposure to exchange rate effects includes:

•

exchange rate movements on financial instruments and transactions denominated in foreign currencies that impact earnings, and

•

exchange rate movements upon translation of net assets in foreign subsidiaries for which the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar that impact our net equity.

Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and western European countries. We selectively enter
into foreign exchange forward and option contracts with durations generally 18 months or less to hedge our exposure to exchange rate risk on foreign source income and purchases. The hedges are scheduled to mature coincident with the timing of the
underlying foreign currency commitments and transactions. The objective of these contracts is to neutralize the impact of exchange rate movements on our operating results.

We engage in foreign currency hedging activities to reduce the risk that changes in exchange rates will adversely affect the eventual net cash flows resulting from the sale of products to foreign customers and
purchases from foreign suppliers. The hedge contracts reduce the exposure to fluctuations in exchange rate movements because the gains and losses associated with foreign currency balances and transactions are generally offset with gains and losses
of the hedge contracts. Because the impact of movements in foreign exchange rates on the value of hedge contracts offsets the related impact on the underlying items being hedged, these financial instruments help alleviate the risk that might
otherwise result from currency exchange rate fluctuations.

The following table summarizes the notional amounts and respective fair values of
Corning’s derivative financial instruments, which mature at varying dates, at December 31 (in millions):

The forward and option contracts we use in managing our foreign currency exposures contain an element of risk in
that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements. However, we minimize this risk by limiting the counterparties to a diverse group of highly-rated major domestic and international financial institutions with which we have
other financial relationships. We are exposed to potential losses in the event of non-performance by these counterparties; however, we do not expect to record any losses as a result of counterparty default. We do not require and are not required to
place collateral for these financial instruments.


14.

Hedging Activities (continued)

Corning uses derivative
instruments (forwards) to limit the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations associated with certain monetary assets and liabilities. These derivative instruments are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes and, as such, are
referred to as undesignated hedges. Changes in the fair value of undesignated hedges are recorded in current period earnings in the other income, net component, along with the foreign currency gains and losses arising from the underlying monetary
assets or liabilities in the consolidated statement of operations. The notional amount of the undesignated derivatives at December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006 was $717 million and $836 million, respectively.

Cash Flow Hedges

Corning typically has cash flow hedges that are
comprised of foreign exchange forward and option contracts. The critical terms of each cash flow hedge are identical to the critical terms of the hedged item. Therefore, Corning utilizes the critical terms test under SFAS 133, “Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (SFAS 133), and the presumption is that there is no hedge ineffectiveness as long as the critical terms of the hedge and the hedged item do not change.

Corning defers net gains and losses from cash flow hedges into accumulated other comprehensive income on the consolidated balance sheet until such time as the hedged
item impacts earnings. At that time, Corning reclassifies net gains and losses from cash flow hedges into the same line item of the consolidated statement of operations as where the effects of the hedged item are recorded, typically sales, cost of
sales, or royalty income. Amounts are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income when the underlying hedged item impacts earnings. At December 31, 2007, the amount of net losses expected to be reclassified into earnings within the
next 12 months is $23 million.

During the third quarter of 2006, Corning determined that 2,174 million Japanese yen (20 million U.S. dollar
equivalent) of anticipated sales transactions would not occur as originally specified. The hedges on these anticipated sales transactions were considered to be ineffective as the critical terms of the hedges and hedged items no longer matched. These
derivative financial instruments were de-designated as cash flow hedges, and the gain was recorded immediately in other income, net, in the consolidated statement of operations. The notional amount of the hedges that were de-designated was $20
million; a corresponding gain of $1.0 million resulted from this ineffectiveness.

Fair Value Hedges

In October of 2007, we entered into four interest rate swaps that are designated as fair value hedges and economically exchange a notional amount of $500 million of
previously issued fixed rate long-term debt to floating rate debt. Under the terms of the swap agreements, we pay the counterparty a floating rate that is indexed to the three-month LIBOR rate.

No net gains and losses were recorded in the consolidated statement of operations related to the Company’s underlying debt and interest rate swap agreements. At
December 31, 2007, the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements recorded in the other liabilities line item and offset in the long-term debt line item of the consolidated balance sheet, was $13 million.

Each fair value hedge (swap) was entered into subsequent to the initial recognition of the hedged item; therefore these swaps do not meet the criteria to qualify for the
shortcut method. Therefore, Corning utilizes the long haul method for effectiveness analysis, both retrospectively and prospectively. The analysis excludes the impact of credit risk from the assessment of hedge ineffectiveness. The amount recorded
in current period earnings in the other income, net component, relative to ineffectiveness, is nominal for the year ended December 31, 2007. There were no outstanding fair value hedges in 2006.

Corning records net gains and losses from fair value hedges into the same line item of the consolidated statement of operations as where the effects of the hedged item
are recorded.

Net Investment in Foreign Operations

We have issued foreign currency denominated debt that has been designated as a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation. The effective portion of the changes in fair value of the debt is reflected as a component of other
accumulated comprehensive income (loss) as part of the foreign currency translation adjustment. Net losses related to this investment included in the cumulative translation adjustment at December 31, 2007 and 2006, were $143 million and $139
million, respectively.


15.

Shareholders’ Equity

The following table presents changes in
capital stock for the period from January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2007 (in millions):

Preferred Stock

We have designated 2.4 million shares as Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock for which no shares have been issued. In June 1996, the Board of Directors approved the renewal of the Preferred Share
Purchase Right Plan, which entitles shareholders to purchase 0.01 of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock upon the occurrence of certain events. In addition, the rights entitle shareholders to purchase shares of common stock at a
50% discount in the event a person or group acquires 20% or more of our outstanding common stock. The preferred share purchase rights became effective July 15, 1996 and expired July 15, 2006.

In 2002, Corning issued 5.75 million shares of 7.00% Series C Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock. On the mandatory conversion date of August 15, 2005, the
remaining outstanding shares were converted into Corning common stock at a conversion rate of 50,813 shares of common stock for each preferred share. Upon conversion of the preferred shares, we issued 31 million shares of Corning common stock
resulting in an increase to equity of $62 million. The Series C mandatory convertible preferred stock had a liquidation preference of $100 per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends. At December 31, 2007 and 2006 there were no outstanding
shares of Series C Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock.

(5)

Net of tax effect of $(8) million and $10 million for years 2007 and 2006, respectively.


16.

Earnings Per Common Share

Basic earnings per common share is
computed by dividing income attributable to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per common share assumes the issuance of common shares for all potentially dilutive
securities outstanding.

The reconciliation of the amounts used to compute basic and diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations follows
(in millions, except per share amounts):

(1)

On the mandatory conversion date of August 16, 2005, the remaining shares of our 7.00% Series C Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock were converted into Corning common stock
at a conversion rate of 50,813 shares of common stock for each preferred share. Upon conversion of the preferred shares, we issued 31 million shares of Corning common stock resulting in an increase to equity of $62 million.

The following potential common shares were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per common share because their inclusion would
have been anti-dilutive. In addition, the following performance-based restricted stock awards have been excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per common share because the number of shares ultimately issued is contingent on our
performance against certain targets established for the performance period (in millions):

(1)

In the third quarter of 2005, substantially all holders of our $96 million outstanding Oak 4 7/8% subordinated notes elected to convert their notes into Corning common stock. The
conversion ratio was 64.41381 shares of Corning common stock for each $1,000 principal amount of notes. Upon the conversion of these notes, we issued 6 million shares of Corning common stock resulting in an increase to equity of $95 million.


17.

Share-based Compensation

Stock Compensation Plans

Corning’s share-based compensation programs include the following: employee stock options, time-based restricted stock, performance-based
restricted stock, and the Worldwide Employee Stock Purchase Plan (WESPP). At December 31, 2007, our stock compensation programs were in accordance with the 2005 Employee Equity Participation Program and the 2003 Equity Plan for Non-Employee
Directors Program. Any ungranted shares from prior years will be available for grant in the current year. Any remaining shares available for grant, but not yet granted, will be carried over and used in the following year. At December 31, 2007,
there were approximately 90 million shares available for grant.

On January 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS 123(R). SFAS 123(R) requires the
measurement and recognition of compensation cost for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors, including grants of employee stock options and employee stock purchases related to the WESPP, based on estimated fair values. Prior
to the adoption of SFAS 123(R), the Company accounted for share-based awards to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method in accordance with APB 25 as allowed under SFAS 123. Under the intrinsic value method, no share-based
compensation cost related to stock options had been recognized in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations, because the exercise price was at least equal to the market value of the common stock on the grant date. As a result, the
recognition of share-based compensation cost was generally limited to the expense attributed to restricted stock awards and stock option modifications. SFAS 123(R) is a revision of SFAS 123 and supercedes APB 25.

The Company elected to use the modified prospective transition method upon adoption of SFAS 123(R), which requires the application of the accounting standard as of
January 1, 2006, the first day of the Company’s fiscal year 2006. In accordance with the modified prospective transition method, the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect, and
do not include, the impact of SFAS 123(R).

For share-based payment grants on or after December 1, 2005, the Company estimated the fair value of such
grants using a lattice-based option valuation model. Prior to December 1, 2005, the Company estimated the fair value of share-based payment awards using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Prior to January 1, 2006, these fair values
were utilized in developing the Company’s pro forma disclosure information required under SFAS 123.

Under SFAS 123(R), for share-based payment awards
granted subsequent to January 1, 2006, the fair value of awards that are expected to ultimately vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods. SFAS 123(R) requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of the grant in order
to estimate the amount of share-based payment awards that will ultimately vest. Forfeiture rates are based on historical rates. The estimated forfeiture rate will be adjusted if actual forfeitures differ significantly from the original estimates.
The effect of any change in estimated forfeitures would be recognized through a cumulative catch-up adjustment that would be included in compensation cost in the period of the change in estimate. For share-based payment awards granted prior to
January 1, 2006, the Company will recognize the remaining unvested SFAS 123 pro forma expense according to their remaining vesting conditions.

Total
share-based compensation cost of $138 million and $127 million was disclosed in operating activities on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2007, and 2006, respectively. For the year ended
December 31, 2006, $81 million in compensation cost was attributed to the effect of the change from applying the original provisions of SFAS 123 to the adoption of SFAS 123(R). Share-based compensation recognized under APB 25 for the year ended
December 31, 2005 was $37 million and included (1) time-based restricted stock and (2) performance-based restricted stock. No tax benefits were realized on the share-based compensation cost because a valuation allowance was maintained
for substantially all net deferred tax assets.

On November 10, 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. SFAS 123(R)-3, “Transition
Election Related to Accounting for Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards.” This FSP provides an elective alternative transition method related to accounting for the tax effects of share-based payments to employees which is different from
the transition method prescribed by SFAS 123R. The alternative method includes simplified methods to establish the beginning balance of additional paid-in capital related to the tax effects of employee share-based compensation (the APIC pool), and
to determine the subsequent impact on the APIC pool and the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows of the tax effects of employee share-based compensation awards that were outstanding upon adoption of SFAS 123(R). Corning has elected
to adopt the alternative transition method provided in this FSP for calculating the tax effects of share-based compensation pursuant to SFAS 123(R).

Share-based Compensation (continued)

The following table
illustrates the effect of the change from applying the original provisions of SFAS 123 to the adoption of SFAS 123(R) on 2006 net income and earnings per share (in millions, except per share amounts):

The following table illustrates the effect on 2005 net income and earnings per share as if the Company had applied
the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, as amended by SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation – Transition and Disclosure.” This standard preceded SFAS 123(R) and required different measurement
criteria (in millions, except per share amounts):

Stock Options

Our stock option plans provide non-qualified and incentive stock options to purchase authorized but unissued or treasury shares at the market price on the grant date and generally become exercisable in installments from one to five years
from the grant date. The maximum term of non-qualified and incentive stock options is 10 years from the grant date.

The following table summarizes
information concerning options outstanding including the related transactions under the options plans for the year ended December 31, 2007:

The aggregate intrinsic value (market value of stock less option exercise price) in the preceding table represents
the total pretax intrinsic value, based on the Company’s closing stock price on December 31, 2007, which would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options as of that date. The total number of
in-the-money options exercisable on December 31, 2007, was approximately 48 million.

The weighted-average grant-date fair value for options granted
for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005 was $9.65, $9.42, and $6.18, respectively. The total fair value of options that vested during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005 was approximately $58 million, $74
million, and $72 million, respectively. Compensation cost related to stock options for the years ended December 31, 2007, and 2006, was approximately $69 million and $76 million, respectively, and there was zero cost for the year ended
December 31, 2005.


17.

Share-based Compensation (continued)

As of December 31,
2007, there was approximately $50 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options granted under the Plan. The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.54 years.

Proceeds received from the exercise of stock options were $109 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, which was included in financing activities on the
Company’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The total intrinsic value of options exercised for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005 was approximately $221 million, $374 million, and $216 million, respectively, which is
currently deductible for tax purposes. However, these tax benefits were not realized due to net operating loss carryforwards available to the Company. Refer to Note 6 (Income Taxes) to the consolidated financial statements.

For stock options granted prior to January 1, 2006, Corning specified that the employee will continue to vest in the award after retirement without providing any
additional services. Corning accounted for this type of arrangement by recognizing compensation cost on a pro forma disclosure basis over the requisite vesting period (the “stated vesting period approach”). For time-based and
performance-based restricted stock granted prior to January 1, 2006, Corning specified that the employee will vest in the award after retirement without providing any additional services. Corning accounted for this type of arrangement by
recognizing compensation cost over the nominal vesting period and, if the employee retires before the end of the vesting period, recognizing any remaining unrecognized compensation cost at the date of retirement (the “nominal vesting period
approach”). SFAS 123(R) specifies that an award is vested when the employee’s retention of the award is no longer contingent on providing subsequent service (the “non-substantive vesting period approach”). That would be the case
for Corning awards that vest when employees retire and are granted to retirement eligible employees. Effective January 1, 2006, related compensation cost must be recognized immediately for awards granted to retirement eligible employees or over
the period from the grant date to the date retirement eligibility is achieved, if that is expected to occur during the stated or nominal vesting period. For those share-based awards granted during the year ended December 31, 2006, Corning
recognized approximately $11 million in additional compensation cost in applying the non-substantive vesting period approach versus the stated and nominal period approaches.

For stock options granted prior to December 1, 2005, the fair value of stock options was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The following are weighted-average inputs for the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model used for grants under our stock plans through November 2005:

The lattice-based valuation model, used to estimate the fair values of option and restricted stock grants after
November 30, 2005, incorporates the assumptions (including ranges of assumptions) noted in the table below. Expected volatility is based on the blended short-term volatility (the arithmetic average of the implied volatility and the short-term
historical volatility), long-term historical volatility of Corning’s stock, and other factors.

Corning also uses historical data as well as forward
looking explanatory variables, to estimate future option exercises and employee termination within the valuation model. Separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. The
expected time to exercise of options granted is derived using a regression model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The range given below results from certain groups of employees exhibiting
different behavior. The risk-free rates used in the lattice model are derived from the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect from the grant date to the option’s expiration date. Since period-by-period calculations are employed in the lattice
model, Corning uses risk-free rates that apply from one period to the next, generally quarter to quarter. Such rates are typically referred to as “forward” rates. Being essentially marginal rates, forward rates both vary during the
contractual term of the option and exhibit greater variation than the yield curve from which they are derived.

The following inputs for the lattice-based
valuation model were used for option grants under our Stock Option Plans since December 1, 2005:

Share-based Compensation (continued)

Incentive Stock Plans

The Corning Incentive Stock Plan permits stock grants, either determined by specific performance goals or issued directly, in most instances,
subject to the possibility of forfeiture and without cash consideration. Shares under the Incentive Stock Plan are generally granted at-the-money, contingently vest over a period of 1 to 10 years, and have contractual lives of 1 to 10 years.

The fair value of each restricted stock grant under the Incentive Stock Plans was estimated on the date of grant for performance based grants assuming
that performance goals will be achieved. The expected term for grants under the Incentive Stock Plans is 1 to 10 years.

Time-Based Restricted Stock:

Time-based restricted stock is issued by the Company on a discretionary basis, and is payable in shares of the Company’s common stock upon
vesting. The fair value is based on the market price of the Company’s stock on the grant date. Compensation cost is recognized over the requisite vesting period and adjusted for actual forfeitures before vesting.

The following table represents a summary of the status of the Company’s nonvested time-based restricted stock as of December 31, 2006, and changes during the
year ended December 31, 2007:

As of December 31, 2007, there was approximately $8 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to
nonvested time-based restricted stock compensation arrangements granted under the Plan. The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.90 years. The total fair value of time-based restricted stock that vested during the
years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005 was approximately $1 million, $2 million, and $3 million, respectively. Compensation cost related to time-based restricted stock was approximately $5 million, $3 million, and $2 million for the
years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.

Performance-Based Restricted Stock:

Performance-based restricted stock is earned upon the achievement of certain targets, and is payable in shares of the Company’s common stock upon vesting typically
over a three-year period. The fair value is based on the market price of the Company’s stock on the grant date and assumes that the target payout level will be achieved. Compensation cost is recognized over the requisite vesting period and
adjusted for actual forfeitures before vesting. During the performance period, compensation cost may be adjusted based on changes in the expected outcome of the performance-related target.

The following table represents a summary of the status of the Company’s nonvested performance-based restricted stock units as of December 31, 2006, and changes
during the year ended December 31, 2007:

As of December 31, 2007, there was approximately $83 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to
nonvested performance-based restricted stock compensation arrangements granted under the Plan. The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.21 years. The total fair value of performance-based restricted stock that vested
during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, was approximately $27 million and $9 million, and no performance-based restricted stock vested during the year ended December 31, 2005. Compensation cost related to performance-based
restricted stock was approximately $60 million, $43 million, and $35 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.

Share-based Compensation (continued)

Worldwide Employee Stock
Purchase Plan

In addition to the Stock Option Plan and Incentive Stock Plans, we have a Worldwide Employee Share Purchase Plan (WESPP). Under the
WESPP, substantially all employees can elect to have up to 10% of their annual wages withheld to purchase our common stock. The purchase price of the stock was 85% of the lower of the beginning-of-quarter or end-of-quarter closing market price
through September 30, 2006. Effective October 1, 2006, the purchase price of the stock is 85% of the end-of-quarter closing market price. Compensation cost related to the WESPP for all periods presented is immaterial.

Operating Segments

Corning conducts its worldwide operations
through operating segments, which are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision making group, in deciding how to
allocate resources and in assessing performance. Our Chief Operating Decision Making group (CODM) is comprised of the chairman and chief executive officer, vice chairman and chief financial officer, president and chief operating officer, executive
vice president-chief administrative officer, executive vice president-chief technology officer, and senior vice president and operations chief of staff.

We prepared the financial results for our reportable segments on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information to assist in making internal operating decisions. We include the earnings
of equity affiliates that are closely associated with our operating segments in the respective segment’s net income. Segment net income may not be consistent with measures used by other companies. The accounting policies of our reportable
segments are the same as those applied in the consolidated financial statements. Revenue attributed to geographic areas is based on the location of the customer.

Our reportable operating segments follow:

•

Display Technologies - manufactures liquid crystal display glass for flat panel displays;

•

Telecommunications - manufactures optical fiber and cable and hardware and equipment components for the telecommunications industry;

•

Environmental Technologies - manufactures ceramic substrates and filters for automobile and diesel applications; and

•

Life Sciences - manufactures glass and plastic consumables for scientific applications.

The Environmental Technologies reportable segment is an aggregation of our Automotive and Diesel operating segments, as these two segments share similar economic
characteristics, products, customer types, production processes and distribution methods.

All other operating segments that do not meet the quantitative
threshold for separate reporting have been grouped as “All Other”

Operating Segments (continued)

The following provides historical
segment information as described above:

Segment Information

(in millions)

(1)

Depreciation expense for Corning’s reportable segments includes an allocation of depreciation of corporate property not specifically identifiable to a segment.

(2)

Research, development, and engineering expenses includes direct project spending which is identifiable to a segment.

(3)

In 2006, restructuring, impairment and other charges and (credits) includes a charge of $44 million for certain assets in our Telecommunications segment. In 2005, restructuring,
impairment and other charges and (credits) includes a gain of $84 million for the reversal of the cumulative translation account of a wholly-owned subsidiary that was substantially liquidated. Amounts for 2005, also include a charge of $28 million
for a restructuring plan in the Telecommunications segment.

(4)

Many of Corning’s administrative and staff functions are performed on a centralized basis. Where practicable, Corning charges these expenses to segments based upon the extent
to which each business uses a centralized function. Other staff functions, such as corporate finance, human resources and legal are allocated to segments, primarily as a percentage of sales.

(5)

Equity in earnings of affiliated companies, net of impairments includes the following restructuring and impairment charges:

•

In 2007, $40 million related to related to impairments and other charges and credits for Samsung Corning is included in All Other.

•

In 2006, gains of $2 million related to impairments and other charges and credits for Samsung Corning is included in All Other.

•

In 2005, $106 million to reflect our share of Samsung Corning Co., Ltd.’s asset impairment charges is included in All Other.

(6)

Segment assets include inventory, accounts receivable, property and associated equity companies and cost investments.

For the year ended December 31, 2007, the following number of customers, which individually accounted for 10% or more of each segment’s sales, represented the
following concentration of segment sales:

•

In the Display segment, three customers accounted for 62% of total segment sales.

•

In the Telecommunications segment, two customers accounted for 25% of total segment sales.

•

In the Environmental Technologies segment, three customers accounted for 81% of total segment sales.

•

In the Life Sciences segment, one customer accounted for 44% of segment sales.


18.

Operating Segments (continued)

A significant amount of
specialized manufacturing capacity for our Display Technologies segment is concentrated in Asia. It is at least reasonably possible that the use of a facility located outside of an entity’s home country could be disrupted. Due to the
specialized nature of the assets, it would not be possible to find replacement capacity quickly. Accordingly, loss of these facilities could produce a near-term severe impact to our display business and the Company as a whole.

A reconciliation of reportable segment net income (loss) to consolidated net income (loss) follows (in millions):

(1)

Net financing costs include interest expense, interest income, and interest costs and investment gains associated with benefit plans.

(2)

Exploratory research includes $49 million, $22 million, and $17 million of spending in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively, on development programs such as silicon on glass, green
lasers, and microreactors.

(3)

Equity in earnings of affiliated companies, net of impairments represents equity in earnings of Dow Corning Corporation which includes the following items:

•

In 2006, a $33 million gain representing our share of a tax settlement relating to an IRS examination at Dow Corning.

•

In 2005, a gain of $11 million which represents our share of Dow Corning’s gain on the issuance of subsidiary stock.

(4)

In 2007, 2006, and 2005, the asbestos settlement includes a charge of 132 million, a credit of $24 million and a charge of $197 million, respectively, to reflect the movement
in Corning’s common stock price in each year and $53 million, $22 million and $21 million, respectively, to adjust the estimated settlement value of the other components of the proposed asbestos settlement. See Note 7 (Investments) to the
consolidated financial statements.

(5)

Other corporate items include the tax impact of the unallocated amounts and the following significant items:

•

In 2007, a loss of $15 million from the repurchase of $223 million principal amount of our 6.25% Euro notes due 2010 and a credit of $103 million from the release
of a valuation allowance on German tax benefits.

•

In 2006, tax benefits of $83 million from the release of valuation allowances for certain foreign locations.

•

In 2005, an impairment charge of $25 million for the other-than-temporary decline in our investment in Avanex below its cost basis; a loss of $16 million associated
with the redemption or retirement of debt; a net $443 million charge to tax expense which included a $525 million increase to our valuation allowance against deferred tax assets resulting from our conclusion that the sale of an appreciated asset no
longer met the criteria established by SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes” (SFAS No. 109) for a viable tax planning strategy offset by an $82 million credit to tax expense primarily related to the tax impact of
eliminating the minimum pension liability associated with our domestic defined benefit plan.

A reconciliation of reportable segment net
assets to consolidated net assets follows (in millions):

(1)

Includes current corporate assets, primarily cash, short-term investments and deferred taxes.

INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


Report of Independent Auditors

To the Stockholders and

Board of Directors of

Dow Corning Corporation

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows, stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of Dow Corning Corporation and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007 in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria
established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards as established by the Auditing Standards Board (United States) and in accordance with the auditing standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements
included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTE 1 – BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

Dow Corning Corporation (“Dow Corning”) was
incorporated in 1943 by Corning Glass Works, now Corning Incorporated (“Corning”), and The Dow Chemical Company (“Dow Chemical”) for the purpose of developing and producing polymers and other materials based on silicon chemistry.
Dow Corning operates in various countries around the world through numerous wholly owned or majority owned subsidiary corporations (hereinafter, the consolidated operations of Dow Corning and its subsidiaries will be referred to as the
“Company”).

Dow Corning built its business based on silicon chemistry. Silicon is one of the most abundant elements in the
world. Most of Dow Corning’s products are based on polymers known as silicones, which have a silicon-oxygen-silicon backbone. Through various chemical processes, Dow Corning manufactures silicones that have an extremely wide variety of
characteristics, in forms ranging from fluids, gels, greases and elastomeric materials to resins and other rigid materials. Silicones combine the temperature and chemical resistance of glass with the versatility of plastics. Regardless of form or
application, silicones generally possess such qualities as electrical resistance, resistance to extreme temperatures, resistance to deterioration from aging, water repellency, lubricating characteristics, relative chemical and physiological
inertness and resistance to ultraviolet radiation.

The Company engages primarily in the discovery, development, manufacturing, marketing
and distribution of silicon-based materials and offers related services. Since its inception, Dow Corning has been engaged in a continuous program of basic and applied research on silicon-based materials to develop new products and processes, to
improve and refine existing products and processes and to develop new applications for existing products. The Company manufactures over 7,000 products and serves approximately 25,000 customers worldwide, with no single customer accounting for more
than five percent of the Company’s sales in any of the past three years. Principal United States manufacturing plants are located in Kentucky and Michigan. Principal foreign manufacturing plants are located in Belgium, China, France, Germany,
Japan, South Korea and the United Kingdom. The Company operates research and development facilities in the United States, Belgium, China, Germany, Ireland, Japan, South Korea and the United Kingdom. The Company also operates technical service
centers in the United States, Belgium, Brazil, China, Germany, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the United Kingdom.

The consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. Certain prior year items have been reclassified to conform to the 2007 presentation.

Bankruptcy Proceedings

On May 15, 1995, the Company voluntarily filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, Northern Division in order to resolve the Company’s breast implant liabilities and related matters. The Company emerged from its Chapter 11 proceeding on
June 1, 2004. Upon emergence from the Company’s Chapter 11 proceeding, the Company was not subject to “fresh start” reporting as defined in American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position
(“SOP”) No. 90-7. See Note 14 for further information on this matter.

NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Dow Corning and all of its wholly owned and majority owned domestic and foreign
subsidiaries. The Company’s interests in 20% to 50% owned subsidiaries are carried on the equity basis and are included in “Other Assets - Other” in the consolidated balance sheets. Intercompany transactions and balances have been
eliminated in consolidation. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation “FIN” No. 46 (Revised),

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities

, the Company’s policy is to include
the accounts of entities in which the Company holds a controlling interest based on exposure to economic risks and potential rewards (variable interests), and for which it is the primary beneficiary, in the Company’s consolidated financial
statements.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of ninety days or less. The carrying amounts for cash equivalents approximate their fair values.


NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

(Continued)

Inventories

The value of inventories is determined
using lower of cost or market as the basis. Produced goods are valued using a first-in, first-out cost flow methodology, while purchased materials and supplies are valued using an average cost flow methodology. See Note 5 for further information.

Property and Depreciation

Property,
plant and equipment is carried at cost less any impairment and is depreciated over estimated useful lives principally using accelerated methods through December 31, 2007. Engineering and other costs directly related to the construction of
property, plant and equipment are capitalized as construction in progress until construction is complete and such property, plant and equipment is ready and available to perform its specifically assigned function. Upon retirement or other disposal,
the asset cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the net amount, less any proceeds, is charged or credited to income. If an asset is determined to be impaired, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its
fair value and the difference is charged to income in the period incurred.

Effective January 1, 2008, the Company will change its
deprecation method for its property, plant and equipment from accelerated methods to straight-line. The change will be applied prospectively and accounted for as a change in estimate effected by a change in accounting policy in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 154,

Accounting Changes and Error Corrections.

The straight-line method is preferable because it will better allocate the cost of assets to the pattern of consumption due
to technological advances and improved maintenance processes which have occurred over time. This change had no impact on current year earnings.

The Company capitalizes the costs of internal-use software in accordance with SOP No. 98-1,

Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use

. Amounts capitalized during the years ended
December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $11.5 and $7.8, respectively. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, unamortized software costs were $11.0 and $5.5, respectively. Amortization expense of $7.4, $6.9 and $5.8 was recognized during the years ended
December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, related to such capitalized software costs.

Expenditures for maintenance and repairs
are charged against income as incurred. Expenditures that significantly increase asset value, extend useful asset lives or adapt property to a new or different use are capitalized.

The Company follows the policy of capitalizing interest as a component of the cost of capital assets constructed for its own use. See Note 8 for further
information.

The Company accounts for asset retirement obligations in accordance with SFAS No. 143,

Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations

and FIN No. 47,

Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations

. SFAS No. 143 requires companies to record an asset and related liability for the costs associated with the retirement of long-lived
tangible assets when a legal liability to retire the assets exists. These obligations may result from acquisition, construction, or the normal operation of a long-lived asset. The Company records asset retirement obligations at fair value in the
period in which they are incurred. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company had noncurrent liabilities of $7.0 and $6.4, respectively, for asset retirement obligations primarily related to landfill closure costs recorded in the
consolidated balance sheets as “Other noncurrent liabilities.”

In addition, the Company has identified conditional asset
retirement obligations, such as for the removal of asbestos, and records such obligations when there are plans in place to undertake major renovations or plans to exit a facility. Due to the nature of the Company’s operations, the Company has
determined that there is an indeterminate settlement date for the existing conditional asset retirement obligations as the range of time over which the Company may settle the obligation is unknown or cannot be estimated. Therefore, the Company
cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the liability.

Marketable Securities

The Company accounts for investments in debt and equity securities in conformity with SFAS No. 115,

Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt
and Equity Securities

. SFAS No. 115 requires the use of fair value accounting for trading or available-for-sale securities, while retaining the use of the amortized cost method for investments in debt securities that the Company has the
positive intent and ability to hold to maturity. Investments in debt and equity securities are included in “Marketable securities” in the consolidated balance sheets. All such investments are considered to be available for sale. If the
decline in fair value of an investment in debt or equity securities is determined to be other than temporary, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its fair value, and the difference is charged to income in the period incurred. The Company
does not invest in securities that are below investment grade. See Note 4 for further information.


NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

(Continued)

Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially
subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash, investments, derivative financial instruments and trade receivables. The Company’s policies limit the amount of credit exposure to any single counterparty for
cash and investments. The Company uses major financial institutions with high credit ratings to engage in transactions involving investments and derivative instruments. The Company minimizes credit risk in its receivables from customers through its
sale of products to a wide variety of customers and markets in locations throughout the world. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not require collateral. The Company maintains reserves for potential
credit losses, and historically such losses have been within expectations. Management believes the risk of incurring material losses related to credit risk is remote, and any losses would be immaterial to consolidated financial results.

Intangibles

Intangible assets of the Company
include goodwill, patents and licenses, and other assets acquired by the Company that are separable and measurable apart from goodwill. Goodwill, representing the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets of businesses acquired, is tested for
impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

. The Company tests the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually, as required by SFAS No. 142. The Company completed its tests for impairment
of goodwill during the three month period ended September 30, 2007. Other intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. See Note 9 for further information.

Revenue

The Company recognizes revenue only when
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the price to the customer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. Revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss
transfer to the customer for products and as work is performed for professional services. Amounts billed to a customer in a sale transaction related to shipping costs are classified as revenue. The Company reduces revenue for product returns,
allowances and price discounts. Amounts billed to customers in excess of amounts recognized as revenue are reported as deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheets. See Note 11 for further information. The Company’s revenue recognition
policies comply with the interpretative guidance in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 104,

Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements

.

Shipping Costs

Shipping costs are primarily
comprised of payments to third party shippers. The Company records shipping costs incurred as a component of “Cost of sales” in the consolidated statements of income. Shipping costs totaled $134.3, $117.1 and $113.9 for the years ended
December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Research and Development Costs

Research and development costs are charged to operations when incurred and are included in “Cost of sales” in the consolidated statements of
income. These costs totaled $229.5 in 2007, $197.7 in 2006 and $182.3 in 2005, and were comprised primarily of labor costs, outside services and depreciation.

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes in conformity with the provisions of SFAS No. 109,

Accounting
for Income Taxes

. SFAS No. 109 requires a company to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in a company’s financial statements or tax returns. Under
this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences
are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets when appropriate to reflect the expected future tax benefits to be realized. In determining the appropriate valuation allowance, certain judgments are made
relating to recoverability of deferred tax assets, use of tax loss carryforwards, level of expected future taxable income and available tax planning strategies. Further, the Company recognizes tax liabilities stemming from uncertain tax positions in
accordance with FIN No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes–an interpretation of SFAS No. 109.

These judgments are routinely reviewed by management. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company had net deferred
tax asset balances of $902.6 and $909.0, respectively, after valuation allowances of $30.0 and $16.8, respectively. For additional information, see Note 6.


NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

(Continued)

Currency Translation

The value of the U.S. dollar
fluctuates against foreign currencies. Since the Company does business in many countries, these fluctuations affect the Company’s consolidated financial position and results of operations. The Company accounts for these fluctuations in
accordance with SFAS No. 52,

Foreign Currency Translation

.

Subsidiaries in Europe, Japan and China translate their assets and
liabilities, stated in their functional currency, into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates, that is, the rates in effect at the end of the period. The resulting gains or losses are reflected in “Cumulative translation adjustment” in the
stockholders’ equity section of the consolidated balance sheets. Changes in the functional currency value of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognized in “Other nonoperating income, net” in the
consolidated statements of income. The revenues and expenses of these non-U.S. subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates that prevailed during the period. Therefore, the reported U.S. dollar results included in the
consolidated statements of income fluctuate from period to period, depending on the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies.

For non-U.S. subsidiaries outside of Europe, Japan and China, where the U.S. dollar is the functional currency, inventories, property, plant and equipment and other non-monetary assets, together with their related elements of expense, are
translated at historical rates of exchange. All other assets and liabilities are translated at current exchange rates. All other revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates. Translation gains and losses for these subsidiaries are
recognized in “Other nonoperating income, net” in the consolidated statements of income.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on its earnings, cash flows and fair values
of assets and liabilities. In addition, the Company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce the impact of changes in natural gas and other commodity prices on its earnings and cash flows. The Company enters into derivative financial
contracts based on analysis of specific and known economic exposures. The Company’s policy prohibits holding or issuing derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The types of instruments typically used are forward
contracts, but may also include option combinations and purchased option contracts.

The Company recognizes all derivatives as “Other
current assets” or “Other current liabilities” in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. On the date the derivative instrument is entered into, if the Company is designating the instrument as a hedge, the Company designates
the derivative as either (1) a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment (fair value hedge), (2) a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows of a
forecasted transaction (cash flow hedge), or (3) a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as and meets all the required criteria for a fair
value hedge, along with the gain or loss on the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk are recorded in current period earnings. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as and meets all the required
criteria for a cash flow hedge are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings as the underlying hedged item affects earnings. Changes in the fair value of a derivative or non-derivative that is designated as
and meets all the required criteria for a hedge of a net investment are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is not designated as a hedge are recorded immediately in earnings. Cash flows
from derivatives designated as hedges are classified in the same category of the consolidated statements of cash flows as the items being hedged. Cash flows from derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are classified in the investing
activities section of the consolidated statements of cash flows.

The majority of currency derivative instruments entered into by the
Company are not designated as hedging instruments. Contracts used to hedge the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations associated with certain monetary assets and liabilities are not designated as hedging instruments. Net foreign currency gains
and losses recognized in income, which include changes in the fair value of such currency derivatives as well as foreign exchange gains and losses on monetary assets and liabilities of the Company, amounted to gains of $9.3, losses of $0.4 and gains
of $1.5, in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.

Where an instrument is designated as a hedge, the Company formally documents all
relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. This process includes relating all derivatives that are designated as fair value or
cash flow hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions. The Company also formally assesses, both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether each
derivative is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge, or if a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge, the Company
will discontinue hedge accounting with respect to that derivative prospectively.


NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

(Continued)

Litigation

The Company is subject to legal
proceedings and claims arising out of the normal course of business. The Company routinely assesses the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters, as well as ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of the
reserves required, if any, for these contingencies is made after analysis of each known issue and an analysis of historical claims experience for incurred but not reported matters. The Company expenses legal costs, including those expected to be
incurred in connection with a loss contingency, as incurred. The Company has an active risk management program consisting of numerous insurance policies secured from many carriers. These policies provide coverage that is utilized to mitigate the
impact, if any, of certain of the legal proceedings. The required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. See Notes 14 and 15 for further information.

Environmental Matters

The Company determines the costs of environmental remediation for its
facilities, facilities formerly owned by the Company and third party waste disposal facilities based on evaluations of current law and existing technologies. Inherent uncertainties exist in these evaluations primarily due to unknown conditions,
changing governmental regulations and legal standards regarding liability, and evolving technologies. The Company records a charge to earnings for environmental matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the Company’s
costs can be reasonably estimated. The recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically, as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical or legal information become available. See Note 15 for further information.

Issuance of Shares by Subsidiaries

Gains or losses
arising from the issuance of shares by subsidiaries due to changes in the Company’s proportionate share of the value of the issuing subsidiary’s equity are recorded in the consolidated statements of income as “Other nonoperating
income, net” pursuant to SAB Topic 5-H,

Accounting for Sales of Stock by a Subsidiary

.

New Accounting Standards

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), Business Combinations. SFAS No. 141(R) changes the way assets and liabilities, including
contingent liabilities, acquired in a business combination are valued. SFAS No. 141 (R) is effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or
after December 15, 2008. The Company will adopt SFAS No. 141(R) for all business combinations entered into after January 1, 2009.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements. SFAS No. 160 changes the classification of ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent to
a separate component of equity. SFAS No. 160 requires retrospective adoption of the presentation and disclosure requirements for existing noncontrolling interests. SFAS No. 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after
December 15, 2008. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of SFAS No. 160 on the Company’s consolidated statement of financial position and results of operations.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Liabilities including an Amendment of FASB Statement
No. 115. SFAS No. 159 provides an option for valuing many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. SFAS No. 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company expects the adoption
of SFAS No. 159 to have an immaterial impact on the Company’s consolidated statement of financial position and results of operations.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. SFAS No. 157 addresses how companies should measure fair value when use of a fair value measure for recognition or disclosure purposes is required by
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company expects the adoption of SFAS No. 157 to have an
immaterial impact on the Company’s consolidated statement of financial position and results of operations.


NOTE 2 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

(Continued)

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158,

Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans—an
amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)

. SFAS No. 158 requires a company with defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans to recognize the funded status of the benefit plan in its statement of financial
position. The funded status is measured, on a plan by plan basis, as the difference between plan assets at fair value and the benefit obligation. For defined benefit pension plans, the benefit obligation is defined by SFAS No. 158 to be the
projected benefit obligation and for other postretirement benefit plans the benefit obligation is defined to be the accumulated benefit obligation. SFAS No. 158 also requires the recognition of gains or losses and prior service costs or credits
that arise during the period but which have not been recognized as components of net periodic pension cost as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Under SFAS No. 158, companies are required to measure the plan assets and
obligations as of the companies’ year end date. SFAS No. 158 is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2006 for companies with publicly traded equity securities and for fiscal years ending after June 15, 2007 for
all other companies. The Company adopted SFAS No. 158 effective December 31, 2006. See Note 13 for further details.

In September
2006, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (“FSP”) No. AUG AIR-1,

Accounting for Planned Major Maintenance Activities

. FSP No. AUG AIR-1 prohibits companies from accruing the cost of planned major maintenance in advance of the
activities actually occurring. This FSP is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 16, 2006. The Company recognizes all maintenance expenses in the period in which the maintenance activity occurs, and as such, the adoption of FSP
No. AUG AIR-1 did not have any impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position and results of operations.

In September 2006,
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) issued SAB No. 108, Topic 1-N,

Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements

. SAB No. 108
requires companies to evaluate the materiality of current year misstatements using both the rollover approach and the iron curtain approach. SAB No. 108 is effective for statements covering the first fiscal year ending after November 15,
2006. The adoption of SAB No. 108 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position and results of operations.

In July 2006, the FASB issued FIN No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

. The Company adopted FIN No. 48 on January 1, 2007.
Previously, the Company accounted for uncertain income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 5,

Accounting for Contingencies

. Under the new standard, the Company recognizes tax liabilities stemming from uncertain income tax positions by
applying a revised measurement threshold. In addition, the Company records any associated interest and penalties that may reasonably be assessed by various taxing authorities. Under FIN No. 48, interest and penalties may be classified as income
tax expense or separately disclosed; the Company has aggregated these charges within income tax expense. The implementation of FIN No. 48 resulted in a credit of $0.3 to retained earnings as of January 1, 2007. See Note 6 for further
details.

On September 15, 2005, the Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) of the FASB reached a consensus on Issue 04-13,

Accounting for Purchases and Sales of Inventory with the Same Counterparty

. EITF 04-13 describes the circumstances under which two or more inventory transactions with the same counterparty should be viewed as a single nonmonetary transaction,
and describes the circumstances under which nonmonetary exchanges of inventory within the same line of business should be recognized at fair value. EITF 04-13 is effective for transactions completed in reporting periods beginning after
March 15, 2006. The Company adopted the provisions of EITF 04-13 during the three months ended June 30, 2006. The adoption of EITF 04-13 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position or
results of operations.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.


NOTE 3 – ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES

On December 31, 2006, the Company, through its wholly
owned subsidiary, Dow Corning Enterprises, Inc. (“DCEI”), sold its 60% ownership interest in DC Dongjue Silicone Group Co., Ltd for $6.1. Goodwill of $4.6 was disposed of as part of this sale. The Company recognized a loss of $2.9 on the
divestiture of DC Dongjue Silicone Group Co., Ltd, which has been reported as “Other nonoperating income, net” in the consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2006.

On April 1, 2005, the Company consolidated its Japanese operations in a transaction involving Dow Corning Asia Ltd. (“DCAL”), a
wholly-owned subsidiary, Dow Corning Toray Silicone Co. Ltd. (“DCTS”), a subsidiary owned 65% by the Company, and Toray Industries, Inc. (“TI”), an independent company that owns the 35% minority interest in DCTS. The Company
contributed property, plant, and equipment, working capital, and other net assets of DCAL valued at $90.0 to DCTS in exchange for additional shares of DCTS. DCTS recorded the contribution of assets at the Company’s historical carrying value. In
addition, TI contributed cash of $48.6 to DCTS in exchange for additional shares of DCTS. Upon completion of the transaction, DCTS was renamed Dow Corning Toray Company Ltd. (“DCT”), and the Company retained a 65% ownership interest in
DCT. However, because the fair value per share issued to TI exceeded the value per share issued to the Company based upon the carrying value of the assets contributed by DCAL, the Company recognized a pre-tax gain of $21.2. This gain was reported in
the “Gain on issuance of subsidiary stock” line in the Company’s consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2005.

NOTE 4 – INVESTMENTS

Investments reflected in “Marketable securities” in the current and
noncurrent sections of the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $1,567.5 and $1,318.8, respectively. The amounts classified as current of $1,487.2 and $1,308.3 as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively,
consist principally of auction rate securities backed by the U. S. Government or one of its agencies and corporate and municipal issue bonds. These investments are of high credit quality with credit ratings of AA or higher. Auction rate securities
are variable rate debt instruments whose interest rates are reset every 7 to 35 days through an auction process, with the underlying securities that have contractual maturities that range from 1 to 35 years. At December 31, 2007, the Company
also had $76.7 of debt securities with maturities that range from 1 to 3 years.

These investments have been classified as
“available for sale” in conformity with SFAS No. 115. Fair values are determined based on quoted market prices or, if quoted market prices are not available, on market prices of comparable instruments. For purposes of computing
realized gain or loss on the disposition of investments, the specific identification method is used.

The Company reviews all
marketable securities to determine if any decline in value is other than temporary. The analysis includes a review of the amount and duration of the decline in value of a security in comparison to that of similar securities in the same market
sector. The Company’s investments had no other than temporary impairments as of December 31, 2007.

The amortized cost, gross
unrealized gains, gross unrealized losses, and market value of the investments consisted of the following as of December 31, 2007 and 2006:


NOTE 4 – INVESTMENTS

(Continued)

NOTE 5 – INVENTORIES

The value of inventories is determined using lower of cost or market as the
basis. Produced goods are valued using a first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost flow methodology, while purchased materials and supplies are valued using an average cost flow methodology.

The following table provides a breakdown of inventories at December 31, 2007 and 2006.

Produced goods include both work-in-process and finished goods. Due to the nature of the
Company’s operations, it is impractical to classify inventory between work-in-process and finished goods as such classifications can be interchangeable for certain inventoriable items. Purchased materials primarily consist of the Company’s
raw material inventories. Maintenance and supplies included in inventory primarily represent spare component parts that are critical to the Company’s manufacturing processes.

NOTE 6 – INCOME TAXES

The components of income before income taxes and minority interests as of
December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005 are as follows:


NOTE 6 – INCOME TAXES

(Continued)

The components of the income tax provision as of December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 are as follows:

The tax effects of the principal temporary differences as of December 31, 2007 and 2006
giving rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows:

Management believes that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will be
realized. This belief is based on criteria established in SFAS No. 109. The criteria that management considered in making this determination were historical and projected operating results, the ability to utilize tax planning strategies and the
period of time over which the tax benefits can be utilized.


NOTE 6 – INCOME TAXES

(Continued)

Tax effected operating loss carryforwards at December 31, 2007 amounted to $154.8 compared to $166.1 at the end of 2006. Substantially all of the
tax effected operating loss carryforwards are subject to an indefinite carryforward period. Substantially all tax effected operating loss carryforwards were generated by the Company’s subsidiary in the United Kingdom. There is an unlimited
carryforward of net operating losses in the United Kingdom and management has determined that no valuation allowance is needed for these net operating losses.

Of the valuation allowance of $30.0 at December 31, 2007, $5.1 is attributable to the inability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards from the Company’s subsidiaries of $2.5 in Ireland, $1.7 in China,
$0.6 in France and $0.3 in the Netherlands. The operating loss carryforwards in Ireland, France, and the Netherlands have indefinite carryforward periods. The operating loss carryforward period in China is five years. The majority of the remaining
valuation allowance of $24.9 is attributable to non-realizable timing benefits in Chinese subsidiaries that are in the initial start-up operations

Cash paid during the year for income taxes, net of refunds received, was $360.7 in 2007, $316.2 in 2006 and $156.8 in 2005.

The
income tax provision at the effective rate differs from the income tax provision at the United States federal statutory tax rate in effect during December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 for the reasons illustrated in the following table:

As of December 31, 2007, income and remittance taxes have not been recorded on $362.6 of
undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, either because any taxes on dividends would be offset substantially by foreign tax credits or because the Company intends to reinvest those earnings indefinitely.

The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various state, local, and foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the
Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state, local, or non-U.S. income tax examination by tax authorities for years before 2004. The following table indicates, for each significant jurisdiction, the earliest tax year that remains subject to
examination:


NOTE 6 – INCOME TAXES

(Continued)

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) commenced an examination of the Company’s U.S. income tax returns for 2004 and 2005 in the third quarter of 2006.
In the third quarter of 2007 the IRS commenced an examination of the 2005 U.S. income tax return of one of the Company’s consolidated subsidiaries. In addition, certain foreign jurisdictions, including Germany and Belgium, and certain states,
have commenced examinations of returns filed by the Company and some of its foreign subsidiaries. Management anticipates that all audits currently underway will be closed during 2008. As of December 31, 2007, no jurisdiction has proposed any
significant adjustments to the Company’s tax returns that would materially affect the Company’s financial position. In addition, the effect of any proposed adjustment would be offset by overpayments currently on deposit with the
appropriate jurisdictions. The Company anticipates, therefore, that no additional payments will be made during 2008 related to any audit activity, and that any changes to its liability for unrecognized tax benefits would be immaterial.

The Company adopted the provisions of FIN No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,

on January 1, 2007. As a result of the
implementation of FIN No. 48, the Company recognized approximately a $0.3 decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, which was accounted for as an addition to the January 1, 2007 balance of retained earnings. A reconciliation
of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits follows:

Including the cumulative effect decrease, at the beginning and end of 2007, the Company had
approximately $9.8 and $18.8 of total gross unrecognized tax benefits, respectively. Of these totals, $7.6 and $15.1 (net of the federal benefit on state issues) represents the amounts of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect
the effective income tax rate in any future periods. The Company recognizes interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits and penalties in income tax expense. During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company recognized approximately
$0.6 in interest and penalties. The Company had approximately $3.1 for the payment of interest and penalties accrued as of December 31, 2007.

NOTE 7 – DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

The Company uses forward exchange contracts
and options to hedge the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations associated with certain monetary assets and liabilities. Changes in the fair value of these items are recorded in earnings to offset the foreign exchange gains and losses of the
monetary assets and liabilities. The maturities of these contracts and options do not exceed one year. The carrying amounts, which represent fair values, of these forward contracts and options were net unrealized losses of $3.4 at December 31,
2007 and $4.5 at December 31, 2006. The fair value of the Company’s forward exchange contracts and options is based principally on quoted market prices. The results of these hedges are reflected in the consolidated statements of income as
“Other nonoperating income, net.” Cash flows from such derivatives are a component of cash flows from investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.

The Company also uses forward contracts and options to hedge the exposure to changes in the prices of commodities, primarily natural gas. The carrying
amounts, which represent fair values, of these forward contracts and options were net unrealized losses of $0.7 and $14.1 at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The forward contracts and options outstanding at December 31, 2007 hedge
forecasted transactions expected to occur within the next 27 months. Net unrealized gains and losses on these contracts are recorded as a component of “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets
until the underlying hedged item impacts earnings. Cash flows from such derivatives are a component of cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Net losses of $2.5 ($1.7 after tax) are expected to be
reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to the consolidated statements of income and included as part of cost of sales in the next twelve months.

Forward exchange options are also used to hedge specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions by locking in exchange rates for such anticipated cash flows. Gains and losses on these instruments are recorded as
a component of “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” in the consolidated balance sheets until the forecasted transaction occurs. The carrying amounts, which represent fair values, of these options were net unrealized losses of $3.4 and
$0.6 at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The options outstanding at December 31, 2007 hedge forecasted transactions expected to occur within the next 12 months. Cash flows from such derivatives are a component of cash flows from
operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Net losses of $3.4 ($2.3 after tax) are expected to be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to the consolidated statements of income and included as part of other
nonoperating income, net during the next twelve months.


NOTE 8 – PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

The following table provides a breakdown of property, plant
and equipment balances at December 31, 2007 and 2006:

The Company recorded depreciation expense of $240.2, $213.2 and $206.2 for the years ended
December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

The amount of interest capitalized as a component of the cost of capital assets
constructed for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $8.6 ($5.8 after tax), $7.6 ($4.8 after tax) and $4.3 ($2.7 after tax), respectively. The Company includes interest expense incurred on all liabilities, including interest
related to commercial creditor obligations, in the amount of interest expense subject to capitalization. See Note 14 for additional details on interest payable to the Company’s commercial creditors.

NOTE 9 – GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the gross and
net amounts of intangible assets, excluding goodwill were:

The Company recorded amortization expense related to these intangible assets of $4.6, $4.7 and
$5.4 for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The estimated aggregate amortization expense to be recorded in each of the next five succeeding years is as follows:

NOTE 9 – GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

(Continued)

The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 are as follows:

NOTE 10 – NOTES PAYABLE AND CREDIT FACILITIES

Notes payable include amounts outstanding under
short-term lines of credit and were $22.0 and $39.8 at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The carrying amounts of these short-term borrowings approximated their fair value. The weighted average interest rate on short-term borrowings
outstanding at December 31, 2007 and 2006 was 5.25% and 4.90%, respectively.

In December 2004, the Company entered into a $500.0
unsecured revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of commercial banks, which would have expired in December 2009. During the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company exchanged this revolving credit arrangement for a new $500.0 revolving
credit arrangement with expiration in 2011. The revolving credit agreement allows for borrowing in various currencies for general corporate purposes of the Company and its subsidiaries and requires the payment of commitment fees. As of
December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, this credit line was unused.

In addition, the Company had unused and committed credit
facilities for use by foreign subsidiaries at December 31, 2007 and 2006 with various U.S. and foreign banks totaling $75.5 and $114.4, respectively. These credit facilities require the payment of commitment fees. The Company intends to renew
these facilities at their respective maturities. These facilities are available in support of working capital requirements.

DCT maintains
an accounts receivable securitization facility with its primary bank. The discount rate under this facility is TIBOR plus 0.15%. DCT sold accounts receivable in the amount of $154.3 to such bank in exchange for $154.1 during 2007. Under the
facility, DCT retains no interest in the accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2007, $25.7 remained outstanding under the facility.

NOTE 11 – DEFERRED REVENUE

The Company enters into long-term product sales agreements with certain
customers. Under certain agreements, customers are obligated to purchase minimum quantities of product and make specified payments. The product sales agreements extend over various periods (5 or 10 years) and the revenue associated with the
agreements is recognized using the average sales price over the life of the agreements. Differences between amounts invoiced to customers under the agreements and amounts recognized using the average price methodology are included as deferred
revenue in the consolidated balance sheets.

Under certain agreements, customers were required to make initial non-refundable advanced cash
payments. During the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, advanced payments of $554.8 and $226.9, respectively, were received by the Company. These amounts are recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized as income ratably on a per
kilogram basis as products are shipped over the life of the agreements. The Company expects to receive advanced payments of $622.5 in the next twelve months, and $420.4 in periods thereafter. In the event that certain product delivery timelines are
not met, subject to specific conditions outlined in the agreements, customers may be entitled to damages up to the amount of the advanced cash payments.

Deferred revenue included in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $893.7 and $350.6, respectively. The current portion of $72.2 and $25.2 was recorded as “Other current
liabilities” in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The remaining amounts were included in the consolidated balance sheets as “Deferred revenue” in noncurrent liabilities. The advanced
payments received are reported as cash flows from operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows.


NOTE 12 – LONG-TERM DEBT

Long-term debt at December 31, 2007 and 2006 consisted of the
following:

The fair value of the Company’s long-term debt, including the portion due within one year,
approximated its book value of $45.6 at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2006, the fair value of the long-term debt, including the portion due within one year, approximated the book value of $42.9.

Annual aggregate maturities of the long-term debt of the Company are: $2.3 in 2008, $0.1 in 2009, $1.2 in 2010, $1.6 in 2011, $1.8 in 2012 and $17.3
thereafter.

Cash paid during the year for interest was $4.7 in 2007, $5.7 in 2006 and $5.1 in 2005.


NOTE 13 – PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

Defined Benefit Pension Plans

The Company maintains defined benefit employee retirement plans covering most domestic and certain non-U.S. employees. The components of pension expense
for the Company’s domestic and foreign plans are set forth below for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005:

Other changes in plan assets and benefit obligations that were recognized in or reclassified from
other comprehensive income during the year ended December 31, 2007:


NOTE 13 – PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

(Continued)

The Company’s defined benefit employee retirement plans have a measurement date of
December 31 of the applicable year. The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation, and fair value of plan assets for defined benefit plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets for the years ended
December 31, 2007 and 2006 are as follows:


NOTE 13 – PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

(Continued)

The following table provides a reconciliation of beginning and ending balances of the projected benefit obligation, beginning and ending balances of the
fair value of plan assets, and the funded status of the plans as of December 31, 2007 and 2006:


NOTE 13 – PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

(Continued)

The following table represents amount recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31 2007 and 2006.

The Company expects to recognize $17.2 of net loss, $5.3 of net prior service cost, and $0.3 of
net transition obligation as a component of net periodic pension cost in 2008 for its defined benefit pension plans.

For the United States
defined benefit plan, as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the fair value of plan assets included 65% of equity securities and 35% of debt securities. The plan targets an asset allocation of 65% equity securities and 35% debt securities. The
plan’s expected long-term rate of return is primarily based on historical returns of similarly diversified passive portfolios and expected results from active investment management.

Given the relatively long horizon of the Company’s aggregate obligation, its investment strategy is to improve and maintain the funded status of its
U.S. and non-U.S. plans over time without exposure to excessive asset value volatility. The Company manages this risk primarily by maintaining actual asset allocations between equity and fixed income securities for the plans within a specified range
of its target asset allocation. In addition, the Company ensures that diversification across various investment subcategories within each plan are also maintained within specified ranges.

All of the Company’s pension assets are managed by outside investment managers and held in trust by third-party custodians. The selection and
oversight of these outside service providers is the responsibility of investment committees and their advisors. The selection of specific securities is at the discretion of the investment manager and is subject to the provisions set forth by written
investment management agreements and related policy guidelines regarding permissible investments and risk control practices.

The
Company’s funding policy is to contribute to defined benefit plans when pension laws and economics either require or encourage funding. Contributions to the U.S. defined benefit plans for the year ended December 31, 2007 totaled $121.5.
Contributions of approximately $28.8 are planned for the U.S. plans in 2008. Contributions to the non-U.S. plans totaled $38.0 for the year ended December 31, 2007. Contributions of approximately $37.5 are planned for non-U.S. plans in 2008.


NOTE 13 – PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

(Continued)

The weighted-average assumptions used to determine the benefit obligation and to determine the net benefit costs are shown in the following table.
Discount rates and rates of increase in future compensation are weighted based upon the projected benefit obligations of the respective plans. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is weighted based on total plan assets for each plan
at year end. The long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption is determined considering historical returns and expected future asset allocation and returns for each plan.

The Company uses the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve and matches points along the curve to the
estimated future benefit payments of the U.S. defined benefit plans to arrive at an effective discount rate. The discount rates for non-U.S. defined benefit plans are based on benchmark rate indices specific to the respective countries and durations
similar to those of the plans’ liabilities.

The Company expects to pay benefits under its defined benefit plans in future periods as
detailed in the following table. The expected benefits have been estimated based on the same assumptions used to measure the Company’s benefit obligation as of December 31, 2007 and include benefits attributable to future employee service.


NOTE 13 – PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

(Continued)

Other Postretirement Plans

In addition to providing
pension benefits, the Company, primarily in the United States, provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for most retired employees. The cost of providing these benefits to retirees outside the United States is not significant. Net
periodic postretirement benefit cost includes the following components for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005:

Other changes in benefit obligations that were recognized in or reclassified from other
comprehensive income during the year ended December 31, 2007 included $11.6 of new prior service costs, $7.2 of actuarial losses, $8.0 of amortization of prior service credits and $1.0 of amortization of net losses.

The following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 of the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation.


NOTE 13 – PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

(Continued)

The Company expects to recognize $1.4 of net loss and $6.2 of net prior service credit as a component of net periodic postretirement benefit cost in
2008.

The health care cost trend rate used in measuring the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was 9.0% in 2007 and was assumed
to decrease gradually to 5.0% in 2012 and remain at that level thereafter. The health care cost trend rate assumption has an effect on the amounts reported, but is offset by plan provisions that limit the Company’s share of the total
postretirement health care benefits cost for the vast majority of participants. The company’s portion of the total annual health care benefits cost is capped at specified dollar amounts for participants who retired in 1994 or later, and such
limits are expected to be reached in 2008 and all subsequent years. Increasing the assumed health care cost trend rate by one percentage point in each year would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by 2.7% and the aggregate of
the service and interest cost components of net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 2007 by 1.9%. Decreasing the assumed health care cost trend rates by one percentage point in each year would decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation by 2.3% and the aggregate of the service and interest cost components of net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 2007 by 3.1%.

The discount rate used in determining the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was 6.25% and 6.0% at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The Company uses the Citigroup Pension Discount Curve and matches points along the
curve to the estimated future benefit payments of the U.S. postretirement health care benefit plans to arrive at an effective discount rate.

The Company funds most of the cost of the postretirement health care and life insurance benefits as incurred. Benefit payments to retirees totaled $15.7 for the year ended December 31, 2007. Reimbursements received under Medicare Part
D totaled $2.2 for the year ended December 31, 2007. The Company expects to pay future benefits under its postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plan, and expects to receive reimbursements from annual Medicare Part D subsidy as
detailed in the following table. The expected payments have been estimated based on the same assumptions used to measure the Company’s postretirement benefit obligations as of December 31, 2007.

Defined Contribution Plans

The Company has various defined contribution and savings plans covering certain employees. The Company made matching contributions under defined contribution plans of $16.2, $16.2 and $16.8 for the years ended
December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Of the defined contribution and savings plans maintained by the Company, the U.S. plan covering the parent company is the largest plan. Employer matching contributions for the U.S. defined
contribution plan for the year ended December 31, 2007 totaled $13.3. The Company expects to make contributions of approximately $16.0 during 2008.

NOTE 14 – PROCEEDING UNDER CHAPTER 11

Prior to 1992, the Company was engaged in the manufacture and
sale of silicone gel breast implants and the raw material components of those products. In January 1992, the Company ceased production of these products following a request by the United States Food and Drug Administration that breast implant
producers voluntarily halt the sale of silicone gel breast implants. Between 1991 and 1995, the Company experienced a substantial increase in the number of lawsuits against the Company relating to breast implants.

By May 1995, the Company was named in thousands of lawsuits filed by, or on behalf of, individuals who claim to have, or have had, breast implants. As a
result, on May 15, 1995 (the “Filing Date”), the Company voluntarily filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”) with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of
Michigan, Northern Division (the “Bankruptcy Court”) in order to resolve the Company’s breast implant liabilities and related matters (the “Chapter 11 Proceeding”). The Company emerged from the Chapter 11 Proceeding on
June 1, 2004 (the “Effective Date”) and is currently in the process of implementing its plan of reorganization.


NOTE 14 – PROCEEDING UNDER CHAPTER 11

(Continued)

Plan of Reorganization

In 1999, the Company, with
the Committee of Tort Claimants, a committee appointed in the Chapter 11 Proceeding to represent products liability claimants, filed a joint plan of reorganization (the “Joint Plan of Reorganization”) and a related disclosure statement. In
November 1999, the Bankruptcy Court issued an order confirming the Joint Plan of Reorganization. The Joint Plan of Reorganization became effective on the Effective Date. The Joint Plan of Reorganization provides funding for the resolution of breast
implant and other products liability litigation covered by the Chapter 11 Proceeding through several settlement options or through litigation and for the satisfaction of commercial creditor claims.

Breast Implant and Other Products Liability Claims

Products liability claims to be resolved by settlement are administered by a settlement facility (the “Settlement Facility”), and products liability claims to be resolved by litigation are defended by a litigation facility (the
“Litigation Facility”). Products liability claimants choosing to litigate their claims are required to pursue their claims through litigation against the Litigation Facility. Under the Joint Plan of Reorganization, the total amount of
payments by the Company committed to resolve products liability claims will not exceed a present value of $2.35 billion determined as of the Effective Date using a discount rate of 7%. Of this amount, no more than a present value of $400.0
determined as of the Effective Date will be used to fund the Litigation Facility. Payments made by the Company will be placed in a trust and withdrawn by the Settlement Facility to pay eligible settling claimants and to cover the Settlement
Facility’s operating expenses. Amounts will also be withdrawn from the trust as necessary to fund the resolution of claims via the Litigation Facility and the operational expenses of the Litigation Facility.

Funding the Settlement and Litigation Facilities

The Company has an obligation to fund the Settlement Facility and the Litigation Facility (collectively, the “Facilities”) over a 16-year period, commencing at the Effective Date. The Company anticipates that it will be able to
meet its remaining payment obligations to the Facilities utilizing cash flow from operations, insurance proceeds and/or prospective borrowings. Under certain circumstances, the Company will also have access to a ten-year unsecured revolving credit
commitment, established by Dow Chemical and Corning, to assist in the timely funding of the Facilities. During the first five years after the Effective Date, the maximum aggregate amount available to the Company under this revolving credit
commitment is $300.0. After the expiration of the five year period, the amount available will decrease by $50.0 per year. Borrowings under this revolving credit commitment will only be permitted in the event that the Company is unable to meet its
remaining obligations to fund the Facilities. As of December 31, 2007, the Company had not drawn any amounts against the revolving credit commitment.

Funds are paid by the Company (a) to the Settlement Facility with respect to products liability claims, as such claims are processed and allowed by the Settlement Facility, and (b) via the Settlement
Facility with respect to products liability claims processed through the Litigation Facility, as such claims are resolved. Insurance settlements are paid by the Company’s insurers directly to the Settlement Facility on behalf of the Company.
The amount of funds paid by or on behalf of the Company is subject to annual and aggregate funding limits. The Company has made payments of $1,538.7 to the Settlement Facility through December 31, 2007.

Based on funding agreements relating to the amount and timing of the Company’s remaining payment obligations to the Settlement Facility, future
payments to the Settlement Facility will be made on a periodic basis until such payment obligations are met. Based on these funding agreements, the recorded liability is adjusted to maintain the present value of $2.35 billion determined as of the
Effective Date using a discount rate of 7% (“Time Value Adjustments”). The Company has made early payments to the Settlement Facility in advance of their due dates and has recognized Time Value Adjustments for certain of those early
payments consisting primarily of insurance proceeds. The actual amounts payable and the timing of payments by the Company to the Settlement Facility are uncertain and will be affected by, among other things, the rate at which claims are resolved by
the Facilities, the rate at which insurance proceeds are received by the Company from its insurers and the degree to which Time Value Adjustments are recognized.

Insurance

The Company had a substantial amount of unexhausted products liability insurance coverage with respect to breast
implant lawsuits and claims. Many of the Company’s insurers reserved the right to deny coverage, in whole or in part. Litigation between the Company and its insurers (“Litigating Insurers”) regarding coverage for products liability
was conducted between 1993 and 1999, and resulted in judicial rulings substantially in favor of the Company’s position (the “Insurance Litigation”). A majority of the Litigating Insurers have reached settlements with the Company. The
Company is continuing settlement negotiations with the remaining Litigating Insurers and other insurers that were not involved in the Insurance Litigation. In addition, certain previously settling insurers have claimed a reimbursement right with
respect to a portion of previously paid insurance proceeds.


NOTE 14 – PROCEEDING UNDER CHAPTER 11

(Continued)

Insurance Allocation Agreement between the Company and Dow Chemical

A number of the products liability insurance policies relevant to claims against the Company name the Company and Dow Chemical as co-insureds (the “Shared Insurance Assets”). A portion of the Shared
Insurance Assets may, under certain conditions, become payable by the Company to Dow Chemical under an insurance allocation agreement between the Company and Dow Chemical originally entered into on February 17, 1998 (the “Insurance
Allocation Agreement”), and amended on November 9, 1998 and on October 19, 2001 (the “Insurance Allocation Agreement Amendments”). The Insurance Allocation Agreement was reached between Dow Chemical and the Company in order
to resolve issues related to the amount of the Shared Insurance Assets that would be available to the Company for resolution of its products liability claims. Under the Insurance Allocation Agreement, 25% of certain of the Shared Insurance Assets
will be paid by the Company to Dow Chemical subsequent to the Effective Date. However, the amount of Shared Insurance Assets that will be payable to Dow Chemical by the Company under the Insurance Allocation Agreement will not exceed approximately
$285.0. In addition, a portion of any such amounts paid to Dow Chemical, to the extent not used by Dow Chemical to pay certain products liability claims, will be paid over to the Company after the expiration of a 17.5-year period commencing on the
Effective Date. Furthermore, the Company recognized an obligation of $35.0 to Dow Chemical related to additional insurance coverage under which the Company and Dow Chemical are co-insureds. The Company previously recorded the maximum amount of
insurance proceeds payable to Dow Chemical pursuant to the Insurance Allocation Agreement (the “Co-insurance payable”). As a result of the Insurance Allocation Agreement Amendments and settlements entered into between the Company and
certain of its insurers, the Co-insurance payable has been reduced to $25.4 as of December 31, 2007.

Commercial Creditor Issues

The Joint Plan of Reorganization provides funding to satisfy commercial creditor claims, including accrued interest. The Joint Plan of Reorganization, as
amended pursuant to a May 2004 ruling of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan (the “District Court”), provides that each of the Company’s commercial creditors (the “Commercial Creditors”) would
receive in cash the sum of (a) an amount equal to the principal amount of their claims and (b) interest on such claims. The actual amount of interest that will ultimately be paid to these Commercial Creditors is uncertain due to pending
litigation between the Company and the Commercial Creditors. As previously reported between 1999 and 2004, there have been a number of Bankruptcy Court and District Court rulings related to the interest rate that should be applied to claims of the
Commercial Creditors from the Filing Date through the Effective Date (“Pendency Interest”). The Commercial Creditors and the Company disagree on the interpretation and application of these rulings to determine the amount of Pendency
Interest.

The Company’s position is that (a) Pendency Interest should be (i) an amount determined by applying non-default
rates of interest for floating rate obligations in accordance with the formulas in the relevant contracts, except that the aggregate amount of interest cannot be less than that resulting from the application of a fixed rate of 6.28% through the
Effective Date and (ii) the higher of the relevant contract rates or 6.28% for all other obligations to the Commercial Creditors through the Effective Date, (b) interest payable to the Commercial Creditors for periods following the
Effective Date should be computed at five percent (5%) and (c) default interest rates should not apply (the “Company’s Position”). The Commercial Creditors’ position is that (a) Pendency Interest should be an
amount determined by applying default rates of interest with respect to amounts overdue under the terms of the relevant debt and commercial agreements until the Effective Date, (b) interest payable to the Commercial Creditors for periods
following the Effective Date should be computed at five percent (5%) and (c) certain of the Commercial Creditors are entitled to unspecified fees, costs and expenses (the “Commercial Creditors Position”). The Company has paid to
the Commercial Creditors an amount of interest that the Company considers to be undisputed, which was calculated by application of the Company’s Position (the “Undisputed Portion”).

In July 2006, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit (the “Court of Appeals”) issued a ruling reversing the District Court’s
previous ruling regarding Pendency Interest that interest on unpaid amounts was to be determined by the higher of fixing the interest rate for floating rate debt at the actual contractual non-default rates in effect when the Company commenced its
Chapter 11 Proceeding or 6.28%, and that higher default rates of interest were not to be applied. The Court of Appeals concluded that there is a presumption that contractually specified default interest should be paid by a solvent debtor to
unsecured creditors (the “Interest Rate Presumption”) and permitting the Company’s Commercial Creditors to recover fees, costs and expenses where permitted by relevant loan agreements and state law. The Court of Appeals remanded the
matter to the District Court for further proceedings to determine (a) whether the Interest Rate Presumption, when considered with countervailing equitable considerations, should be applied to the Company’s debt obligations to its
Commercial Creditors and (b) the amount, if any, of additional interest and the amount, if any, of fees, costs and expenses to be paid by the Company to its Commercial Creditors (the “Court of Appeals decision”). In August 2006, the
Company filed a petition for rehearing

en banc

with the Court of Appeals requesting that the Court of Appeals reconsider the issues previously addressed regarding Pendency Interest and fees, costs and expenses. In November 2006, the Court of
Appeals denied this petition and the Company filed a petition for a writ of certiorari requesting the Supreme Court of the United States to review the Court of Appeals decision. In March 2007, the Supreme Court denied the petition for the writ of
certiorari.

The Pendency Interest matter is remanded back to the District Court for determination of the presence of equitable
considerations that would preclude the application of the “Interest Rate Presumption” or, in the absence of equitable considerations, what the default rates of interest will be, along with any recoverable fees, costs, and expenses.


NOTE 14 – PROCEEDING UNDER CHAPTER 11

(Continued)

As of December 31, 2007, the Company has paid approximately $1.5 billion to the Commercial Creditors, representing principal and the Undisputed
Portion. As of December 31, 2007, the Company has estimated its interest liability payable to the Commercial Creditors to be within a range of $71.5 and $235.8. However, no single amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than any
other amount within the range. Therefore, the Company has recorded the minimum liability within the range. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the amount of interest included in “Accrued interest” recorded in the consolidated balance
sheets related to the Company’s potential obligation to pay additional interest to its Commercial Creditors in the Chapter 11 Proceeding was $71.5 and $68.3, respectively. These amounts are substantially comprised of (a) interest on the
principal portion of Commercial Creditor claims relating to floating rate debt during the Chapter 11 Proceeding until the Effective Date determined by fixing the interest rate for floating rate debt at the contractual non-default rates in effect
when the Company commenced its Chapter 11 Proceeding

plus

(b) interest on such amount of interest for periods following the Effective Date determined by applying a five percent (5%) interest rate

less

(c) the Undisputed
Portion.

Reorganization Costs

The
Company has incurred and will continue to incur costs associated with (a) the matters related to the Chapter 11 Proceeding that will be resolved by the District Court and the Court of Appeals, and (b) the implementation of the Joint
Plan of Reorganization. The aggregate amount of these costs, which are being expensed as incurred, are recorded in “Other nonoperating income, net” in the consolidated statements of income. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006
and 2005, the Company’s reorganization costs included legal expenses of $2.4, $1.3 and $2.0, respectively, and administrative expenses of $0.7, $1.5 and $1.4, respectively.

NOTE 15 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Chapter 11 Related Matters

Insurance Receivable

The total “Anticipated
implant insurance receivable” of $131.0 as of December 31, 2007 and $184.8 as of December 31, 2006 represents amounts to be received by the Company pursuant to settlements with the Company’s insurance carriers. The principal
uncertainties that exist with respect to the realization of the “Anticipated implant insurance receivable” include the ultimate cost of resolving implant litigation and claims, the results of settlement negotiations with insurers, and the
extent to which insurers may become insolvent in the future. Management believes that, while uncertainties regarding this asset continue to exist, these uncertainties are not reasonably likely to result in a material adverse change to the
Company’s financial position or results of operations, and that it is probable that this asset will ultimately be realized. This belief is further supported by the fact that the Company received insurance recoveries of $1,445.2 from
September 1, 1994 through December 31, 2007, and entered into settlements with certain insurers for future reimbursement.

Implant Reserve

As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company’s “Implant reserve” recorded in the consolidated balance sheets was
$1,658.2 and $1,719.3, respectively, to reflect the Company’s estimated remaining obligation to fund the resolution of breast implant claims pursuant to the Company’s Chapter 11 plan of reorganization and other breast implant litigation
related matters (see Note 14 for further discussion). During the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company recorded $10.5, $21.7 and $21.0, respectively, in “Other nonoperating income, net” to reflect Time Value
Adjustments.

Accrued Interest

As of
December 31, 2007 and 2006, the amount of interest included in “Accrued interest” recorded in the consolidated balance sheets related to the Company’s potential obligation to pay interest to the Commercial Creditors in the
Chapter 11 Proceeding was $71.5 and $68.3, respectively. The actual amount of interest that will be paid to these creditors is uncertain and will ultimately be resolved through continued proceedings in the District Court (see Note 14 for further
discussion).

Co-Insurance Payable

As
of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the amount payable pursuant to the “Insurance Allocation Agreement” recorded in the consolidated balance sheets was $25.4 and $32.9, respectively. Of the total amount payable, $15.5 and $13.0 were
recorded as “Other current liabilities” in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, $9.9 and $19.9, respectively, were included in “Co-insurance
payable” in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets (see Note 14 for further discussion).


NOTE 15 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

(Continued)

Risks and Uncertainties

While the Company does not
anticipate a need to further revise amounts recorded in its consolidated financial statements for these Chapter 11 related matters, as additional facts and circumstances develop, it is at least reasonably possible that amounts recorded in the
Company’s consolidated financial statements may be revised. Future revisions, if required, could have a material effect on the Company’s financial position or results of operations in the period or periods in which such revisions are
recorded. Since any specific future developments, and the impact such developments might have on amounts recorded in the Company’s consolidated financial statements, are unknown at this time, an estimate of possible future adjustments cannot be
made.

Tax Matters

The IRS
commenced an examination of the Company’s U.S. income tax returns for 2004 and 2005 in the third quarter of 2006. In addition, certain foreign jurisdictions including Germany and Belgium, and certain states have commenced examinations of
returns filed by some of the Company and some of its foreign subsidiaries. Management anticipates that all audits currently underway will be closed during 2008. As of December 31, 2007, neither the IRS nor any of the foreign jurisdictions has
proposed any significant adjustments to the Company’s tax returns that would materially affect the Company’s financial position. See Note 6 for further information.

In May 1999, the Company received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (the “Notice”) from the IRS. The Notice asserted tax deficiencies totaling
approximately $65.3 relating to the Company’s consolidated federal income tax returns for the 1995 and 1996 calendar years. In August 2004, the Company received a Notice of Proposed Adjustment (the “Adjustment Notice”) from the IRS
related to the Company’s consolidated federal income tax returns for the 1997, 1998, and 1999 calendar years. The Adjustment Notice asserted tax deficiencies totaling approximately $116.9. The issues addressed in the Notice and the Adjustment
Notice, along with related issues for the periods 2000 through 2003, were settled with the IRS during the year ended December 31, 2006 for approximately $13.5 in conjunction with the completion of the IRS audit covering the periods 1992 through
2003 (the “IRS Audit”). Based upon established reserves, the resolution of the IRS Audit resulted in a $66.6 reduction in “Income tax provision” as reported in the consolidated statements of income for the period ended
June 30, 2006.

Environmental Matters

The Company had been advised by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) or by similar state and non-U.S. national regulatory agencies that the Company, together with others, is a
Potentially Responsible Party (“PRP”) with respect to a portion of the cleanup costs and other related matters involving a number of abandoned hazardous waste disposal sites. Management believes that there are 17 sites at which the Company
may have some liability, although management expects to settle the Company’s liability for eight of these sites for de minimis amounts.

Based upon preliminary estimates by the EPA or the PRP groups formed with respect to these sites, the aggregate liabilities for all PRP’s at those sites at which management believes the Company may have more than a de minimis liability
is $35.4. Management cannot estimate the aggregate liability for all PRP’s at all of the sites at which management expects the Company has a de minimis liability. The Company records accruals for environmental matters when it is probable that a
liability has been incurred and the Company’s costs can be reasonably estimated. The amount accrued for environmental matters as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $4.4 and $2.4, respectively.

As additional facts and circumstances develop, it is at least reasonably possible that either the accrued liability or the recorded receivable related to
environmental matters may be revised. While there are a number of uncertainties with respect to the Company’s estimate of its ultimate liability for cleanup costs at these hazardous waste disposal sites, management believes that any costs
incurred in excess of those accrued will not have a material adverse impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations. This opinion is based upon the number of identified PRP’s at each site, the number of
such PRP’s that are believed by management to be financially capable of paying their share of the ultimate liability, and the portion of waste sent to the sites for which management believes the Company might be held responsible based on
available records.

Other Regulatory Matters

Companies that manufacture and sell chemical products may experience risks under current or future laws and regulations which may result in significant costs and liabilities. The Company routinely conducts health,
toxicological and environmental tests of its products. The Company cannot predict what future legal, regulatory or other actions, if any, may be taken regarding the Company’s products or the consequences of their production and sale. Such
actions could result in significant losses, and there can be no assurance that significant losses would not be incurred. However, based on currently available information, the Company’s management does not believe that any such actions would
have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations.


NOTE 15 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

(Continued)

Leases

The Company leases certain real and
personal property under agreements that generally require the Company to pay for maintenance, insurance and taxes. Lease expense was $40.8 in 2007, $39.1 in 2006 and $34.3 in 2005. The minimum future lease payments required under noncancellable
operating leases at December 31, 2007, in the aggregate, are $214.2 including the following amounts due in each of the next five years: 2008 - $43.6, 2009 - $31.2, 2010 - $23.0, 2011 - $15.5 and 2012 - $15.4.

Guarantees and Letters of Credit

Guarantees
arise during the ordinary course of business from relationships with customers, employees and nonconsolidated affiliates when the Company undertakes an obligation to guarantee the performance of others (via delivery of cash or other assets) if
specified triggering events occur. Non-performance under a contract by the guaranteed party triggers the obligation of the Company. The maximum amount of potential future payments under such guarantees of the Company was $5.6 at December 31,
2007 and 2006, primarily related to guarantees of housing loan obligations of certain employees of the Company’s subsidiaries in Japan. Such guarantees have various expiration dates and typically span approximately 20 years. The Company’s
estimated potential obligation under these guarantees is not material to the consolidated financial statements and no liability has been recorded on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006.

The Company also has guarantees related to its performance under certain operating lease arrangements and the residual value of leased
assets. If certain operating leases are terminated by the Company, it guarantees a portion of the residual value loss, if any, incurred by the lessors in disposing of the related assets. Expiration dates vary, and certain leases contain renewal
options. The maximum amount of future payments the Company was potentially obligated to make for guarantees of residual values of leased assets was $4.2 and $4.6 at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Management believes that, based on
facts and circumstances, the Company’s estimated potential obligation under its residual value lease guarantees is not material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements and as such, no liability has been recorded on the
Company’s consolidated balance sheets for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006.

The Company had outstanding Letters of
Credit of $21.6 at December 31, 2007 and $19.9 at December 31, 2006. These Letters of Credit related primarily to the Company’s wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary.

Warranties

In the normal course of business to facilitate sales of its products, the Company
has issued product warranties, and it has entered into contracts and purchase orders that often contain standard terms and conditions that typically include a warranty. The Company’s warranty activities do not have a material impact on the
Company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations.

NOTE 16 – RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

The Company has transactions in the normal course of business
with its shareholders, Dow Chemical and Corning, and their affiliates. The following tables summarize related party transactions and balances with the Company’s shareholders.


NOTE 16 – RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

(Continued)

In addition, non-wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries of the Company have transactions in the normal course of business with their minority
shareholders. The following tables summarize related party transactions and balances between these non-wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries and their minority owners.

Management believes the costs of such purchases and the prices for such sales were competitive
with purchases from other suppliers and sales to other customers.

In addition, DCT loans excess funds to its minority shareholder Toray
Industries, Inc. The amount of loans receivable at December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $25.7 and $31.9, respectively. These balances are included in “Notes and other receivables” in the consolidated balance sheets. Management believes that
interest earned from this loan arrangement is at rates commensurate with market rates for companies of similar credit standing.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The accounting records of the Company are expressed in Korean Won and
are maintained in accordance with the laws and regulations of the Republic of Korea. Significant accounting policies followed by the Company in the preparation of the accompanying financial statements are summarized below.

Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries in which a controlling interest is held. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation. Equity investments in which the Company exercises significant influence but do not control are accounted for using the equity method.

Foreign Currencies

The Company operates primarily in Korean Won, its local and functional currency.
The Company has chosen the U.S. dollar as its reporting currency. In accordance with the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 52,

Foreign Currency Translation

, revenues and expenses have been translated into
U.S. dollars at average exchange rates prevailing during the period. Assets and liabilities have been translated at the exchange rates on the balance sheet date. Equity accounts have been translated at historical rates. The resulting translation
gain or loss adjustments are recorded directly as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity. Transaction gains or losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a
currency other than the functional currency are included in the income statement as incurred. Assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date and the
related exchange gains or losses are recorded in the statement of income.

Translation of Foreign Currency Financial Statements of
subsidiaries

The financial position and results of operations of SCM are measured using its functional currency of the U.S. dollar. All
other subsidiaries use their local currency as their functional currency. The financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated into Korean won, the Korean parent company’s functional currency, using the current exchange rate method.
Income and expenses have been translated into U.S. dollars at average exchange rates prevailing during the period. Assets and liabilities have been translated into U.S. dollars using the exchange rates at the balance sheet date. Equity accounts have
been translated at historical rates. The resulting translation gain or loss adjustments are recorded directly in accumulated other comprehensive income as a component of shareholder’s equity.

Revenue Recognition

The Company
derives its revenue from the sale of precision flat glass substrates to its customers, primarily located in Korea. The Company recognizes its revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the products or the services have been delivered
and all risks of ownership have been transferred to the customer, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. This typically occurs upon delivery of the products to the customers, as the majority of the
customers are large Korean manufacturers of LCD panels who enter into general supply agreements with the Company and place large orders of products for delivery on a regular basis. Sales revenue is recorded net of discounts and rebates.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Use of Estimates

The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and
disclosures. The most significant estimates and assumptions relate to the useful life of property, plant and equipment, allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable, contingent liabilities, inventory valuation, impairment of long-lived assets and
allocated expenses. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions that the Company may undertake in the future, actual results may be different from those estimates.

Financial Instruments

The amounts
for cash and cash equivalents, short-term financial instruments, accounts receivable, certain other assets, accounts payable, certain accrued and other liabilities, short-term loan and long-term debt are reported at their fair value due to their
short maturities or market interest rates. Obligations due to or receivables from related parties have no ascertainable fair value as no market exists for such instruments.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and
cash equivalents include cash, demand deposits and short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the time of acquisition.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost being determined by the
weighted-average method, which approximates the first-in, first-out method.

Property and Depreciation

Property, plant and equipment (“PP&E”) are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line
method based on the following estimated useful lives:

Buildings

20–40 years

Machinery and equipment

1.5–8 years

Vehicle, tools, furniture and fixtures

2–8 years

Expenditures that enhance the value or materially extend the useful life of the facilities are
capitalized as additions to property, plant and equipment. Costs of normal, recurring or periodic repairs and maintenance activities are charged to expense as incurred.

Intangible assets

Intangible assets consist of patents acquired in a business combination. Such
intangible assets have a definite life and are amortized on a straight-line basis over five years, which approximate its estimated useful life.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset or asset group against future undiscounted cash flows expected to be
generated from the asset or asset group. If the sum of the expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group, an impairment loss is measured as the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying
value.

Accrued Severance Benefits

Employees and directors with at least one year of service are entitled to receive a lump

-

sum payment upon termination of their employment with the Company, based on their length of service and rate of pay at
the time of termination. Accrued severance benefits represent the amount which would be payable assuming all employees and directors were to terminate their employment with the Company as of the balance sheet date.

The Company has funds deposited at the Korean National Pension Fund in accordance with National Pension Funds Law. The use of the deposit is restricted
to the payment of severance benefits. Accordingly, accrued severance benefits in the accompanying balance sheets are presented net of this deposit.

In addition, accrued severance benefits are funded at approximately 65% and 60% as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, through a group severance insurance plan and are presented as a deduction from accrued severance benefits.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Research and Development Costs

Research and development expenditures which include costs in relation to new product, development, research, process improvement and product use
technology are expensed as incurred and included in operating expenses.

Income Taxes and Investment Tax Credit

The Company recognizes deferred income taxes for anticipated future tax consequences resulting from temporary differences between amounts reported for
financial reporting and income tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed on the said temporary differences by applying the enacted statutory tax rates applicable to the years when such differences are expected to reverse.
Deferred tax assets are recognized when it is more likely than not that they will be realized. The total income tax provision includes the current tax expense under the applicable tax regulations and the change in the balance of deferred tax assets
and liabilities during the year.

The Company is eligible to use investment tax credits that are temporarily allowed for qualified plant
and equipment expenditures. The investment tax credit is recognized as a reduction of tax expense in the year in which the qualified plant and equipment expenditure is incurred.

On January 1, 2007, the Company adopted the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) interpretation No. 48
(“FIN 48”),

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

-

an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in
a tax return. This interpretation also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The evaluation of a tax position in accordance with this interpretation is
a two-step process. In the first step, recognition, the Company determines whether it is more-likely-than-not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the
technical merits of the position. The second step addresses measurement of a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not criteria. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being
realized upon ultimate settlement.

The Company’s policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits
within income tax expense line item in the consolidated statements of income. This classification has not changed as a result of implementing the provisions of FIN 48.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2007, FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007),

“Business Combinations”

(“FAS 141R”), which replaces FASB Statement No. 141. FAS 141R establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the
identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired. This Statement also establishes disclosure requirements which will enable users to evaluate the nature and financial
effects of the business combination. FAS 141R is effective as of the beginning of an entity’s fiscal year that begins after December 15, 2008. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact, if any, of the adoption of FAS 141R on
the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,

“Non-controlling
Interests in Consolidated Financial Statement—amendments of ARB No. 51

(“FAS 160”).

”

FAS 160 states that accounting and reporting for minority interests will be recharacterized as non-controlling interests and
classified as a component of equity. This Statement also establishes reporting requirements that provide sufficient disclosures that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the non-controlling
owners. FAS 160 applies to all entities that prepare consolidated financial statements, except not-for-profit organizations, but will affect only those entities that have an outstanding non-controlling interest in one or more subsidiaries or that
deconsolidate a subsidiary. This Statement is effective as of the beginning of an entity’s first fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2008. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact, if any, of the adoption of FAS 160 on
the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,

“The Fair Value Option
for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities,”

which provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value in an attempt to reduce both complexity in accounting for financial instruments and
the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently. This Statement is effective as of the beginning of an entity’s first fiscal year beginning after November 15, 2007. The Company is currently
evaluating the impact that the adoption may have on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.


Samsung Corning Precision Glass Co., Ltd.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157

, “Fair Value Measurements”.

This Statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires enhanced disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 requires companies to disclose the fair value of its financial instruments
according to a fair value hierarchy, as defined and may be required to provide additional disclosures based on that hierarchy. SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption may have on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Company acquired all of the outstanding securities of SSC in exchange for 217,462 shares of the Company’s common stock and 107 shares of the Company’s preferred stock (the Acquisition”). The transaction was accounted for as a business
combination. The value assigned to the stock issued for the purchase consideration was $1,445 per share based on the estimated fair value of the Company’s stock as at December 31, 2007. The Company believes that combining SSC would enable
the Company to strengthen its competitiveness and improve efficiency in management by maximizing synergy effects.

A summary of the purchase
price for the acquisition is as follows:

The aggregate purchase consideration has been allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired,
including identifiable intangible assets, based on their respective estimated fair values. The respective estimated fair values were determined by a third-party appraisal at the acquisition date, and resulted in excess fair value of the net assets
acquired over the purchase consideration of $33,763 thousand. The negative goodwill of $33,763 thousand was allocated on a pro rata basis to all of the acquired assets except financial assets, assets to be disposed of by sale, deferred tax assets
and other current assets.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Business and Credit Risk Concentration

The Company sells its products on a credit basis to its customers including certain related parties. Management estimates the collectibility of accounts
receivable based on the financial condition of the customers and prevailing economic trends. Based on management’s estimates, the Company established allowances for doubtful accounts receivable which management believes are adequate.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited to the credit worthiness of the Company’s customers. Four of the five major customers of the Company are domestic TFT-LCD makers incorporated in Korea and another is
a domestic Color-Filter maker incorporated in Korea. Trade accounts receivables from these five major customers are 68% and 98% of total trade accounts receivable of the Company as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and revenues from
these five major customers constitute 99%, 98% and 94% of total revenues of the Company for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Pending Litigation

On December 9, 2005, Seoul Guarantee Insurance Co. and 14 other creditors
(the “Creditors”) filed a lawsuit against the Company and 27 other Samsung affiliates (collectively “Samsung affiliates”) for alleged breach of an agreement that entered into with the Creditors in September 1999. According to the
Agreement, Samsung affiliates agreed to sell 3.5 million shares of Samsung Life Insurance Co., Ltd. (“SLI”) by December 31, 2000, which were transferred to the Creditors in connection with the petition for court receivership of
Samsung Motor Inc. (“SMI”). In the event that the sales proceeds fall short of $2.64 billion, Samsung affiliates have agreed to compensate the Creditors for the shortfall, by other means, including Samsung affiliates’ participation in
any equity offering or subordinated debentures to be issued by the Creditors. Any excess proceeds over $2.64 billion are to be distributed to Samsung affiliates. As of December 31, 2007, the shares of SLI have not been sold. The suit asked for
actual and punitive damages of $5.11 billion plus penalty interest.

On January 31, 2008, the court ruled that the Agreement was
valid, and that Samsung affiliates have a joint and severable liability for the principal (less a proportion relating to SLI shares that one of the creditors had sold of 1.16 million shares), plus interest at a rate of 6% per annum. The
total amount payable as per the court ruling was $2.44 billion ($1.70 billion in principal and the remainder in interest).

The Company
accounts for loss contingencies in accordance with SFAS No. 5

“Accounting for Contingencies”

and therefore, records a liability when it is both probable that a loss will occur and the amount of such loss can be reasonably
estimated. Due to the uncertainties around the financial impact to each of the respective Samsung affiliates, the Company is unable to reasonably estimate the amount of potential loss associated with this case, and therefore, no provision for such
loss is reflected in the accompanying financial statements.
