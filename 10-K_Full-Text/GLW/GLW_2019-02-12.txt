Corporate Investments

﻿

Dow Corning Corporation and Hemlock Semiconductor Group (“HSG”).

Prior to May 31, 2016, Corning and The Dow Chemical Company (“Dow Chemical”) each owned half of Dow Corning Corporation (“Dow Corning”), an equity company headquartered in Michigan that manufactures silicone products worldwide.  Dow Corning was the majority-owner of HSG, a market leader in the production of high purity polycrystalline silicon for the semiconductor and solar energy industries.

﻿

On May 31, 2016, Corning completed the strategic realignment of its equity investment in Dow Corning pursuant to the Transaction Agreement announced in December 2015.  Under the terms of the Transaction Agreement, Corning exchanged with Dow Corning its 50% stock interest in Dow Corning for 100% of the stock of a newly formed entity, which

held

an equity interest in HSG and approximately $4.8 billion in cash.

© 2019 Corning Incorporated. All Rights Reserved.


Index

Prior to realignment, HSG, a consolidated subsidiary of Dow Corning, was an indirect equity investment of Corning.  Upon completion of the exchange, Corning now has a direct equity investment in HSG.  Because our ownership percentage in HSG did not change as a result of the realignment, the investment in HSG is recorded at its carrying value, which had a negative carrying value of $383 million at the transaction date.  The negative carrying value resulted from a one-time charge to this entity in 2014 for the permanent abandonment of certain assets.  Excluding this charge, the entity is profitable and recovered its equity during 2018.

﻿

Pittsburgh Corning Corporation.

Prior to the second quarter of 2016, Corning and PPG Industries, Inc. each owned 50% of the capital stock of Pittsburgh Corning Corporation (“PCC”).  PCC filed for Chapter 11 reorganization in 2000 and the Modified Third Amended Plan of Reorganization for PCC (the “Plan”) became effective in April 2016.  In the second quarter of 2016, Corning contributed its equity interests in PCC and Pittsburgh Corning Europe N.V. as required by the Plan and recognized a gain of $56 million for the difference between the fair value of the asbestos litigation liability and carrying value of the investment.

﻿

Additional information about corporate investments is presented in Note 5 (Investments) to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

﻿

Additional information in response to Item 1 is found in Note 17 (Reportable Segments) to the Consolidated Financial Statements and in Item 6 (Selected Financial Data).

Item 1A.  Risk Factors

﻿

We operate in rapidly changing economic, political, and technological environments that present numerous risks.  Our operations and financial results are subject to risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, our ability to successfully execute our strategy and capital allocation framework, and the trading price of our common stock or debt.  The following discussion identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business, operations, financial position or future financial performance.  This information should be read in conjunction with our MD&A and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated by reference into this report.  The following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider, as these factors could cause our future results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements and from historical trends.

﻿

As a global company, we face many risks which could adversely impact our operations and financial results

﻿

We are a global company and derive a substantial portion of our revenues from, and have significant operations, outside of the United States.  Our international operations include manufacturing, assembly, sales, research and development, customer support, and shared administrative service centers.  Additionally, we rely on a global supply chain for key components and capabilities that are central to our ability to invent, make and sell products.

﻿

Compliance with laws and regulations increases our costs.  We are subject to both U.S. laws and local laws which, among other things, include data privacy requirements, employment and labor laws, tax laws, anti-competition regulations, prohibitions on payments to governmental officials, import and trade restrictions and export requirements.  Non-compliance or violations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or employees, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business.  Such violations could result in prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries and could also materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and operating results.  Our success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate and manage these risks.

Index

We are also subject to a variety of other risks in managing a global organization, including those related to:

﻿

·

The economic and political conditions in each country or region;

·

Complex regulatory requirements affecting international trade and investment, including anti-dumping laws, export controls, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local laws prohibiting improper payments.  Our operations may be adversely affected by changes in the substance or enforcement of these regulatory requirements, and by actual or alleged violations of them;

·

Fluctuations in currency exchange rates, convertibility of currencies and restrictions involving the movement of funds between jurisdictions and countries;

·

Governmental protectionist policies and sovereign and political risks that may adversely affect Corning’s profitability and assets;

·

Tariffs, trade duties and other trade barriers including anti-dumping duties;

·

Geographical concentration of our factories and operations, and regional shifts in our customer base;

·

Periodic health epidemic concerns;

·

Political unrest, confiscation or expropriation of assets by foreign governments, terrorism and the potential for other hostilities;

·

Difficulty in protecting intellectual property, sensitive commercial and operations data, and information technology systems;

·

Differing legal systems, including protection and treatment of intellectual property and patents;

·

Complex, or competing tax regimes;

·

Difficulty in collecting obligations owed to us;

·

Natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes, tsunamis and windstorms; and

·

Potential loss of utilities or other disruption affecting manufacturing.

﻿

Corning’s Display Technologies segment generates a significant amount of the Company’s profits and cash flow.  Any significant decrease in display glass pricing could have a material and negative impact on our financial results

﻿

Corning’s ability to generate profits and operating cash flow depends largely on the profitability of our

display glass business, which is subject to continuous

pricing pressure due to industry competition, potential over-capacity, and development of new technologies.  If we are not able to achieve proportionate reductions in costs and increases in volume to offset potential pricing pressures it

could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.

﻿

Because we have a concentrated customer base in each of our businesses, our sales could be negatively impacted by the actions or insolvency of one or more key customers, as well as our ability to retain these customers

﻿

A relatively small number of end-customers accounted for a high percentage of net sales in each of our reportable segments.  Mergers and consolidations between customers could result in further concentration of Corning’s customer base.  Further concentration, or the loss or insolvency of a key customer, could result in a substantial loss of sales and reduction in anticipated in cash flows.

﻿

The following table details the number of combined customers of our segments that accounted for a large percentage of segment net sales:

Business disruptions could affect our operating results

﻿

A major earthquake, fire or other catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical facilities could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our future financial results could be materially and adversely affected.  For example, certain manufacturing sites require high quality, continuous, and uninterrupted power and access to industrial water.  Unplanned outages could have a material negative impact on our operations and ability to supply our customers.

﻿

Additionally, a significant amount of the specialized manufacturing capacity for our reportable segments is concentrated in single-site locations.  Due to the specialized nature of the assets, in the event such a location experiences disruption, it may not be possible to find replacement capacity quickly or substitute production from other facilities.  Accordingly, disruption at a single-site manufacturing operation could significantly impact Corning’s ability to supply its customers and could produce a near-term severe impact on our individual businesses and the Company as a whole.

﻿

Geopolitical events, as well as other events outside of Corning’s control, could cause a disruption to our manufacturing operations and adversely impact our customers, resulting in a negative impact to Corning’s net sales, net income, asset values and liquidity

﻿

A natural disaster, epidemic, labor strike, war or political unrest in regions where we operate could adversely affect Corning’s ability to supply our customers and impact the value of our assets.  Such events may also impact our customers’ facilities and reduce our sales to such customers.

For example, a sizeable portion of Corning’s glass manufacturing capacity is in South Korea and we generate a significant

portion of our sales through two South Korean customers.  Deterioration of the geopolitical climate in such a region could cause a disruption to our manufacturing operations and adversely impact our customers, resulting in a negative impact to Corning’s net sales, net income, asset values and liquidity.

﻿

We may experience difficulties in enforcing our intellectual property rights, which could result in loss of market share, and we may be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others

﻿

We rely on patent and trade secret laws, copyright, trademark, confidentiality procedures, controls and contractual commitments to protect our intellectual property rights.  Despite our efforts, these protections may be limited and we may encounter difficulties in protecting our intellectual property rights or obtaining rights to additional intellectual property necessary to permit us to continue or expand our businesses.  We cannot provide assurance that the patents that we hold or may obtain will provide meaningful protection against our competitors.  Changes in or enforcement of laws concerning intellectual property may affect our ability to prevent or address the misappropriation of, or the unauthorized use of, our intellectual property, potentially resulting in loss of market share.  Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights.  Litigation is inherently uncertain and outcomes are often unpredictable.  If we cannot protect our intellectual property rights against unauthorized copying or use, or other misappropriation, we may not remain competitive.

﻿

The intellectual property rights of others could inhibit our ability to introduce new products.  Other companies hold patents on technologies used in our industries and are aggressively seeking to expand, enforce and license their patent portfolios.  We periodically receive notices from, or have lawsuits filed against us by third parties claiming infringement, misappropriation or other misuse of their intellectual property rights and/or breach of our agreements with them.  These third parties often include entities that do not have the capabilities to design, manufacture, or distribute products or that acquire intellectual property like patents for the sole purpose of monetizing their acquired intellectual property through asserting claims of infringement and misuse.  Such claims of infringement or misappropriation may result in loss of revenue, substantial costs, or lead to monetary damages or injunctive relief against us.

Information technology dependency and cyber security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, liability claims, or competitive harm

﻿

The Company is dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure, including cloud-based services, (“IT systems”) to conduct its business.  Our IT systems may be vulnerable to disruptions from human error, outdated applications, computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access, cyber-attack and other similar disruptions.  Any significant disruption, breakdown, intrusion, interruption or corruption of these systems or data breaches could cause the loss of data or intellectual property, equipment damage, downtime, and/or safety related issues and could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Like other global companies, we have, from time to time, experienced incidents related to our IT systems, and expect that such incidents will continue, including malware and computer virus outbreaks, unauthorized access, systems failures and disruptions.  We have measures and defenses in place against such events, but we may not be able to prevent, immediately detect, or remediate all instances of such events.  A material security breach or disruption of our IT systems could result in theft, unauthorized use, or publication of our intellectual property and/or confidential business information, harm our competitive position, disrupt our manufacturing, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives, impair our ability to access vendors, suppliers and cloud-based services, or otherwise adversely affect our business.

﻿

Additionally, we believe that utilities and other operators of critical infrastructure that serve our facilities face heightened security risks, including cyber-attack.  In the event of such an attack, disruption in service from our utility providers could disrupt our manufacturing operations which rely on a continuous source of power (electrical, gas, etc.).

﻿

We may not earn a positive return from our research, development and engineering investments

﻿

Developing our products through our innovation model of research and development is expensive and often involves a long investment cycle.  We make significant expenditu

res and investments in research,

development and engineering that may

not

earn an economic return.  If our investments do not provide a pipeline of products or technologies that our customers demand or lower our manufacturing costs, it could negatively impact our revenues and operating margins both near- and long-term.

﻿

We have significant exposure to foreign currency movements

﻿

A large portion of our sales, profit and cash flows are transacted in non-U.S. dollar currencies and we expect that we will continue to experience fluctuations in the US Dollar value of these activities if it is not possible or cost effective to hedge our currency exposures or should we elect not to hedge certain currency exposures.  Alternatively, we may experience gains or losses if the underlying exposure which we have hedged changes (increases or decreases) and we are unable to reverse, unwind, or terminate the hedges concurrent with changes in the underlying notional exposure.

﻿

Our ultimate realized loss or gain with respect to currency fluctuations will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency exposures that we have, the exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, whether we have entered into foreign currency contracts to offset these exposures and other factors.

﻿

Our hedge portfolio may reduce our ability to respond to price moves by our Display Technologies segment competitors.  Foreign currency movements may impact our competitive cost position relative to our largest, Japan-based competitors in the Display Technologies segment.  The profitability of customers may also be impacted as they typically purchase from us in Japanese yen and they sell in various currencies.

﻿

These factors could materially impact our results of operations, anticipated future results, financial position and cash flows, the timing of which is variable and generally outside of our control.

Index

We may have significant exposure to counterparties of our related derivatives portfolio

﻿

We maintain a significant portfolio of over the counter derivatives to hedge our projected currency exposure to the Japanese yen, New Taiwan dollar, South Korean won, Chinese yuan and euro.  We are exposed to potential losses in the event of non-performance by our counterparties to these derivative contracts.  Any failure of a counterparty to pay on such a contract when due could materially impact our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

﻿

If we are unable to obtain certain specialized equipment, raw and batch materials or natural resources required in our products or processes, our business will suffer

﻿

Our ability to meet customer demand depends, in part, on our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of equipment, parts, components and raw materials from our suppliers.  We may experience shortages that could adversely affect our operations.  Certain manufacturing equipment, components and raw materials are available only from single or limited sources, and we may not be able to find alternate sources in a timely manner.  A reduction, interruption or delay of supply, or a significant increase in the price for supplies, such as manufacturing equipment, precious metals, raw materials, utilities including energy and industrial water, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses.

﻿

We use specialized raw materials from single-source suppliers (e.g., specific mines or quarries) and natural resources (e.g., helium) in certain products and processes.  If a supplier is unable to provide the required raw materials or the natural resource is in scarce supply or not readily available, we may be unable to change our product composition or manufacturing process to prevent disruption to our business.

﻿

We have incurred, and may in the future incur, goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges

﻿

At December 31, 2018, Corning had goodwill and other intangible assets of approximately $3.2 billion.  While we believe the estimates and judgments about future cash flows used in the goodwill impairment tests are reasonable, we cannot provide assurance that additional impairment charges in the future will not be required if the expected cash flow as projected by management do not occur, especially if an economic downturn occurs and continues for a lengthy period or becomes severe, or if the Company’s acquisitions and investments fail to achieve expected returns.

﻿

Changes in our effective tax rate or tax liability may have an adverse effect on our results of operations

﻿

Our effective tax rate could be adversely impacted by several factors, including:

﻿

·

Changes in the relative amounts of income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate;

·

Changes in tax laws, tax treaties and regulations or the interpretation of them, including the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “2017 Tax Act”) which was passed by the U.S. Congress and signed into law on December 22, 2017;

·

Changes to our assessment about the realizability of our deferred tax assets that are based on estimates of our future results, the prudence and feasibility of possible tax planning strategies, and the economic and political environments in which we do business;

·

The outcome of current and future tax audits, examinations, or administrative appeals;

·

Changes in generally accepted accounting principles that affect the accounting for taxes; and

·

Limitations or adverse findings regarding our ability to do business in some jurisdictions.

We may have additional tax liabilities

﻿

We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions, and are commonly audited by various tax authorities.  In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.  Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes.  Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.  The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made.

﻿

The 2017 Tax Act significantly impacted how U.S. global corporations are taxed.

Among other things, the 2017 Tax Act required companies to pay a one-time mandatory tax on unrepatriated earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred (the “toll charge”) and created new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings.

Significant guidance has been issued with the intention of clarifying

the

new tax provisions.

To date, a considerable amount of this guidance has been issued in the form of proposed regulations.

The volume and complexity of the proposed regulations

as well as the impact of final regulations which were recently issued,

has resulted in many questions regarding how the effect of such regulations should be considered.

We continue to evaluate the impact of this legislation and certain changes could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flow.

﻿

Our innovation model depends on our ability to attract and retain specialized experts in our core technologies

﻿

Our innovation model requires us to employ highly specialized experts in glass science, ceramic science, and optical physics to conduct our research and development and engineer our products and design our manufacturing facilities.  The loss of the services of any member of our key research and development or engineering team without adequate replacement, or the inability to attract new qualified personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance.

﻿

We are subject to strict environmental regulations and regulatory changes that could result in fines or restrictions that interrupt our operations

﻿

Some of our manufacturing processes generate chemical waste, waste water, other industrial waste or greenhouse gases, and we are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of such substances.  We have installed anti-pollution equipment for the treatment of chemical waste and waste water at our facilities.  We have taken steps to control the amount of greenhouse gases created by our manufacturing operations.  However, we cannot provide assurance that environmental claims will not be brought against us or that government regulators will not take steps to adopt more stringent environmental standards.

﻿

Any failure on our part to comply with any present or future environmental regulations could result in the assessment of damages or imposition of fines against us, or the suspension/cessation of production or operations.  In addition, environmental regulations could require us to acquire costly equipment, incur other significant compliance expenses or limit or restrict production or operations and thus materially and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.

﻿

Changes in regulations and the regulatory environment in the U.S. and other countries, such as those resulting from the regulation and impact of global warming and CO


abatement, may affect our businesses and their results in adverse ways by, among other things, substantially increasing manufacturing costs, limiting availability of scarce resources, especially energy, or requiring limitations on production and sale of our products or those of our customers.

Index

Current or future litigation or regulatory investigations may harm our financial condition or results of operations

﻿

As a global technology and manufacturing company, we are engaged in various litigation and regulatory matters.  Litigation and regulatory proceedings may be uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, resulting in significant liabilities, penalties or damages.  Such current or future substantial legal liabilities or regulatory actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and reputation.

﻿

Our global operations are subject to extensive trade and anti-corruption laws and regulations

Due to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of import- and export-related laws and regulations, including U.S. regulations issued by Customs and Border Protection, the Bureau of Industry and Security, the Office of Anti-boycott Compliance, the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls and the Office of Foreign Assets Control, as well as the counterparts of these agencies in other countries.  Any alleged or actual violation by an employee or the Company may subject us to government scrutiny, investigation and civil and criminal penalties, and may limit our ability to import or export our products or to provide services outside the United States.  We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the way existing laws might be administered or interpreted.

﻿

In addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, or obtaining an unfair advantage.  Recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws.  Our continued operation and expansion outside the United States, including in developing countries, could increase the risk of alleged violations.  Violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our business, and result in an adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition.

﻿

Moreover, several of our related partners are domiciled in areas of the world with laws, rules and business practices that differ from those in the United States, and we face the reputational and legal risk that our related partners may violate applicable laws, rules and business practices.

﻿

International trade policies may negatively impact our ability to sell and manufacture our products outside of the U.S.

Government policies on international trade and investment such as import quotas, tariffs, and capital controls, whether adopted by individual governments or addressed by regional trade blocs, can affect the demand for our products and services, impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us (including our equity affiliates/joint ventures) from being able to sell and/or manufacture products in certain countries.  The implementation of more restrictive trade policies, such as higher tariffs or new barriers to entry, in countries in which we sell large quantities of products and services could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.  For example, a government’s adoption of “buy national” policies or retaliation by another government against such policies could have a negative impact on our results of operations.  These policies also affect our equity companies.

Item 2.  Properties

﻿

Corning operates 108 manufacturing plants and processing facilities in 15 countries, of which approximately 35% are in the U.S.  We own 64% of our executive and corporate buildings of which 80% are located in and around Corning, New York.  The Company also owns over 68% of our sales and administrative office square footage, 86% of our research and development square footage, 72% of our manufacturing square footage, and over 10% of our warehousing square footage.

﻿

For the years ended 2018, 2017 and 2016, we invested a total of $5.2 billion, primarily in facilities outside of the United States.

﻿

Manufacturing, sales and administrative, and research and development facilities have an aggregate floor space of approximately 43.2 million square feet.  Distribution of this total area follows:

﻿

﻿

Total assets and capital expenditures by operating segment are included in Note 17 (Reportable Segments) to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  Information concerning lease commitments is included in Note 12 (Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees) to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Item 3.  Legal Proceedings

﻿

Corning is a defendant in various lawsuits and is subject to various claims that arise in the normal course of business, the most significant of which are summarized in Note 12 (Commitments and Contingencies) to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  In the opinion of management, the likelihood that the ultimate disposition of these matters will have a material adverse effect on Corning’s consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of operations, is remote.

﻿

Environmental Litigation.

Corning has been named by the Environmental Protection Agency (the Agency) under the Superfund Act, or by state governments under similar state laws, as a potentially responsible party for 15 active hazardous waste sites.  Under the Superfund Act, all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site, identified by the Agency, are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the Agency agrees otherwise.  It is Corning’s policy to accrue for its estimated liability related to Superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned by Corning based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants.  At December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, Corning had accrued approximately $30 million (undiscounted) and $38 million (undiscounted), respectively, for the estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation.  Based upon the information developed to date, management believes that the accrued reserve is a reasonable estimate of the Company’s liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote.

OVERVIEW

﻿

Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework

﻿

In October 2015, Corning announced a strategy and capital allocation framework (the “Framework”) that reflects the Company’s financial and operational strengths, as well as its ongoing commitment to increasing shareholder value.  The Framework outlines our leadership priorities, and articulates the opportunities we see across our businesses.  We designed the Framework to create significant value for shareholders by focusing our portfolio and leveraging our financial strength.  Under the Framework we target generating $26 billion to $30 billion of cash through 2019, returning more than $12.5 billion to shareholders and investing $10 billion to extend our leadership positions and deliver growth.

﻿

Our probability of success increases as we invest in our world-class capabilities.  Corning is concentrating approximately 80% of its research, development and engineering investment and capital spending on a cohesive set of three core technologies, four manufacturing and engineering platforms, and five market-access platforms.  This strategy will allow us to quickly apply our talents and repurpose our assets as needed.

﻿

Performance against the Framework

﻿

Since introducing the Framework, we have distributed $11.8 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, and increased the annual dividend by 11.1% in 2019, 16.1% in 2018, 14.8% in 2017 and 12.5% in 2016 as part of our ongoing commitment to return cash to our investors.

﻿

Highlights of progress in Corning’s market-access platforms include:

﻿

·

Securing contracts with industry leaders in the carrier and data center segments that will add significant sales in 2019 and beyond, and completing the acquisition of CMD in Optical Communications;

·

Extending the company’s leadership in mobile consumer electronics with the launch and adoption of Gorilla Glass 6 as well as other cover glass and sensing technology innovations;

·

Gaining significant new sales and platforms for gasoline particulate filters and strong pull for Gorilla Glass for Automotive solutions, particularly the industry’s first AutoGrade Glass Solutions for automotive interiors, reaching more than 55 platforms to date;

·

Increasing our shipments of Valor Glass by four times year

-over-

year, indicating progress toward certification across more pharmaceutical companies in Life Sciences Vessels; and

·

Reaching stable returns in Display Technologies as the glass pricing environment continued to improve and Corning extended global leadership by successfully ramping the world’s first Gen 10.5 LCD glass plant.

2018 Results

﻿

Net sales in the year ended December 31, 2018 were $11.3 billion, an increase of $1.2 billion, or 12%, when compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, driven by sales increases across all segments.

﻿

For the year ended December 31, 2018, we generated net income of $1.1 billion, or $1.13 per share, compared to a net loss of $0.5 billion, or $(0.66) per share, for 2017.  When compared to 2017, the $1.6 billion increase in net income was primarily due to the following items (amounts presented after tax):

﻿

·

The absence of $1.5 billion in tax reform adjustments related to the 2017 Tax Act;

·

Higher segment net income in our Optical Communications, Environmental Technologies, Specialty Materials and Life Sciences segments, up $123 million, $43 million, $12 million and $22 million, respectively; and

·

The positive impact of $48 million in tax adjustments,

primarily related to changes in the valuation allowances on deferred tax assets

offset by the preliminary

2013-2014 IRS audit settlement

.

﻿

Partially offsetting these events were the following items:

﻿

·

An increase of $105 million in legal expenses, driven by a ruling in an intellectual property lawsuit and developments in civil litigation matters;

·

An impact of $99 million resulting from an increase of mark-to-market loss for our defined benefit pension plans; and

·

Lower segment net income in our Display Technologies and All Other segments in the amount of $53 million and $22 million, respectively.

﻿

Diluted earnings per share increased by $1.79 per share, or 271%, when compared to 2017, driven by the increase in net income described above,

coupled with the repurchase of 74.8 million shares of common stock over the last twelve months.

﻿

The translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including the impact of hedges realized in 2018, did not materially impact Corning’s consolidated net income in the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.

﻿

2019 Corporate Outlook

We believe 2019

will be another year of strong growth and investment, consistent with our Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework.

In our Display Technologies segment, we expect full year 2019 price declines to improve further to a mid-single digit percentage.  We anticipate Corning’s display glass volume will grow faster than the expected display glass market growth of mid-single digits, driven by television screen size growth and the ramp of our Gen 10.5 facility in China.

In the Optical Communications segment, we expect sales to increase by low-teens in percentage terms, including the impact of a full year of sales from the acquisition of 3M’s Communication Markets Division.

We expect high-single digit sales growth in our Environmental Technologies segment.

We expect growth in the Specialty Materials segment, the rate of which will depend on the adoption of our innovations.

We anticipate low to mid-single digit percentage growth in sales for the Life Sciences segment.

Index

For the year ended December 31, 2018, segment net sales increased by $1.1 billion, or 11%, when compared to the same period in 2017.  The primary sales drivers by segment were as follows:

﻿

·

Display Technologies segment net sales increased $139 million compared to the prior year.

Total display glass market volume was up in 2018.  Our volume growth in this market more than offset price declines on a year-over-year basis.  2018 was the best pricing environment in more than a decade, achieving the important milestone of mid-single digit year-over-year declines during the second half of the year;

·

An increase of $647 million in the Optical Communications segment, due to higher sales of carrier and enterprise network products, up $364 million and $283 million, respectively.  The acquisition of CMD driving $200 million of the increase in sales;

·

An increase of $76 million in the Specialty Materials segment driven by higher net sales of Gorilla Glass products, advanced optics and other specialty glass;

·

An increase of $183 million in the Environmental Technologies segment, driven by sales growth in all categories including sales of gas particulate filters; and

·

An increase of $67 million in the Life Sciences segment, as the business continued to outpace the market.

﻿

Movements in foreign exchange rates did not materially impact Corning’s consolidated net sales in the year ended December 31, 2018, respectively, when compared to the same period in 2017.

﻿

For the year ended December 31, 2017, net sales increased by $818 million, or 9%, when compared to the same period in 2016.  The primary sales drivers by segment were as follows:

﻿

·

A decrease of $151 million in the Display Technologies segment, driven by price declines of approximately 10%, partially offset by an increase in volume in the mid-single digits in percentage terms;

·

An increase of $540 million in the Optical Communications segment, due to higher sales of carrier and enterprise network products, up $446 million and $94 million, respectively, combined with the absence of production issues related to the implementation of new manufacturing software in the first quarter of 2016.  Strong growth in the North American market drove the increase in carrier network products;

·

An increase of $279 million in the Specialty Materials segment, driven by strong growth in segment net sales of Corning Gorilla Glass products, combined with an increase of $4


million in advanced optics products;

·

An increase of $74 million in the Environmental Technologies segment, driven by higher net sales of automotive products, up $42 million, due to market strength in Europe, China and Asia, and initial commercial sales of gas particulate filters.  Diesel product sales increased $32 million with higher demand for heavy-duty diesel products in North America and Asia;

·

An increase of $40 million in the Life Sciences segment, driven by higher sales in North America and China; and

·

An increase of $36 million in the All Other segment, driven by an increase in sales in our emerging businesses.

﻿

Movements in foreign exchange rates did not materially impact Corning’s consolidated net sales in the year ended December 31, 2017, respectively, when compared to the same period in 2016.

﻿

In 2018, 2017 and 2016, sales in international markets accounted for 69%, 69% and 72%, respectively, of total net sales.

﻿

Cost of Sales

﻿

The types of expenses included in the cost of sales line item are: raw materials consumption, including direct and indirect materials; salaries, wages and benefits; depreciation and amortization; production utilities; production-related purchasing; warehousing (including receiving and inspection); repairs and maintenance; inter-location inventory transfer costs; production and warehousing facility property insurance; rent for production facilities; and other production overhead.

Gross Margin

﻿

In the year ended December 31, 2018, gross margin dollars increased by $441 million, or 11%, and gross margin as a percentage of net sales was consistent when compared to the same period last year.  The increase in gross margin dollars was primarily driven by the following items:

﻿

·

Higher sales in the Optical Communications segment, driven by growth in Carrier and Enterprise products, resulting in increased gross margin of $291 million;

·

An increase in Gorilla Glass and advanced optics product volume which contributed $


million to gross margin; and

·

Higher sales in the Environmental technologies segment drove an $85 million increase.

﻿

Gross margin increases were partially offset by higher costs related to capacity expansions across multiple business segments and display glass price declines.

﻿

Movements in foreign exchange rates did not materially impact Corning’s consolidated gross margin in the year ended December 31, 2018, respectively, when compared to the same period in 2017.

﻿

In the year ended December 31, 2017, gross margin dollars increased by $257 million, or 7%, and gross margin as a percentage of net sales remained consistent at 40%, when compared to the same period last year.  The increase in gross margin dollars was primarily driven by the following items:

﻿

·

Higher volume in the Display Technologies segment, offset by higher costs related to capacity expansion;

·

Higher volume in the Optical Communications segment, driven by growth in North America and Europe, partially offset by higher manufacturing expenses related to capacity expansion;

·

An increase in Gorilla Glass and advanced optics product volume, slightly offset by higher raw materials costs; and

·

Higher light-duty substrate demand in Europe, China and Asia, offset somewhat by lower North America demand, as well as an increase in demand for heavy-duty diesel products in North America and Asia.  Partially offsetting the increase in demand was a decline in manufacturing efficiency due to the use of higher-cost manufacturing facilities and sales of lower margin products.

﻿

Display glass price declines of approximately 10% and the negative impact of movements in the Japanese yen and South Korean won in the amount of $73 million, which primarily impacted the Display Technologies segment, partially offset the increase.

﻿

Movements in foreign exchange rates did not materially impact Corning’s consolidated net sales in the year ended December 31, 2017, respectively, when compared to the same period in 2016.

﻿

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

﻿

When compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $326 million, or 22%, in the year ended December 31, 2018.  Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 1% as a percentage of sales.

The increase was primarily driven by the following items:

﻿

·

An increase of $137 million in litigation and other legal expenses, driven by a ruling in an intellectual property lawsuit and developments in commercial litigation matters;

·

An increase in the Optical Communications segment, up $65 million, largely driven by the acquisition of CMD;

·

Increased corporate expenses of $55 million;

·

Increased acquisition related costs of $25 million; and

·

Increased costs in our emerging businesses, up $


million, driven by investments in new customers and new business growth.

Index

When compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $11 million in the year ended December 31, 2017.

The increase was due to the following items:

﻿

·

A decrease of $52 million in acquisition-related costs, driven by the absence of costs related to the realignment of our equity interests in Dow Corning completed in the second quarter of 2016, offset slightly by several small acquisitions occurring in 2017;

·

A decrease of $64 million in litigation, regulatory and other legal costs, primarily driven by the absence of events occurring in the second quarter of 2016.  In this period, we recorded litigation and other expenses related to the resolution of an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice and an environmental matter in the amount of $98 million, offset somewhat by the gain on the contribution of our equity interests in PCC and PCE as partial settlement of the asbestos litigation in the amount of $56 million; and

·

A decrease of $46 million in the mark-to-market of our defined benefit pension plans.

﻿

Offsetting these events were the following items:

﻿

·

A decrease of $32 million in gains from the contingent consideration fair value adjustment;

·

An increase of $51 million in the Optical Communications segment due to costs associated with acquisitions and growth initiatives; and

·

An increase of $24 million in the Specialty Materials segment in support of new product launches.

﻿

The types of expenses included in the selling, general and administrative expenses line item are: salaries, wages and benefits; travel; professional fees; and depreciation and amortization, utilities, and rent for administrative facilities.

﻿

Research, Development and Engineering Expenses

﻿

For year ended December 31, 2018, research, development and engineering expenses increased by $129 million, or 15%, when compared to 2017, driven by

higher costs associated with new product launches and our emerging businesses.  As a percentage of sales, these expenses were flat when compared to the same period last year.

﻿

In the year ended December 31, 2017, research, development and engineering expenses increased by $128 million, or 17%, when compared to the same period last year,

driven by the absence of the impact of a 2016 joint development agreement in the Display Technologies segment, as well as higher costs associated with new product launches in the Optical Communications, Specialty Materials and Environmental Technologies segments, up $20 million, $11 million and $7 million, respectively.  As a percentage of sales, these expenses decreased one percent when compared to the same period last year.

Index

On May 31, 2016, Corning completed the strategic realignment of its equity investment in Dow Corning Corporation (“Dow Corning”) pursuant to the Transaction Agreement announced on December 10, 2015.  Under the terms of the Transaction Agreement, Corning exchanged with Dow Corning its 50% stock interest in Dow Corning for 100% of the stock o

f a newly formed entity, which held

an equity interest in Hemlock Semiconductor Group (HSG) and approximately $4.8 billion in cash.

﻿

The equity in earnings line on our income statement for the year ended December 31, 2016 reflects both the equity earnings from the silicones and polysilicones (HSG) businesses of Dow Corning from January 1, 2016 through May 31, 2016.  Prior to the realignment of Dow Corning, equity earnings from the HSG business were reported on the equity in earnings line in Corning’s income statement, net of Dow Corning’s 35% U.S. tax.  Additionally, Corning reported its tax on equity earnings from Dow Corning on the tax provision line on its income statement at a U.S. tax provision rate of 7%.  As part of the realignment, HSG was converted to a partnership.  Each of the partners is responsible for the taxes on their portion of equity earnings.  Therefore, post-realignment, HSG’s equity earnings is reported before tax on the equity in earnings line and Corning’s tax is reported on the tax provision line.

﻿

﻿

Income Before Income Taxes

﻿

The translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including the impact of hedges realized in 2018, did not impact Corning’s income before income taxes in the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, when compared to the same period in the prior year.

﻿

(Provision) Benefit for Income Taxes

﻿

Our (provision) benefit for income taxes and the related effective income tax rates were as follows (dollars in millions):

﻿

﻿

For the year ended December 31, 2018, the effective income tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the following:

﻿

·

Additional taxes of $55 million related primarily to the global intangible low

-taxed

income (“GILTI”) provisions of the 2017 Tax Act; and

·

Incremental tax expense of $172 million related to a preliminary agreement with the IRS for the income tax audit of years 2013 and 2014.

﻿

These items were partially offset by the following:

﻿

·

A benefit of $35 million related to the finalization of the one-time toll charge recorded in 2017; and

·

An $82 million benefit from the release of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets that are now considered realizable.

﻿

For the year ended December 31, 2017, the effective income tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the following:

﻿

·

As a result of the 2017 Tax Act, a provisional tax expense of $1.1 billion for the one-time toll charge on unrepatriated earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously deferred;

·

The result of a provisional tax expense of $347 million recorded for the U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities re-measured at the reduced rate of 21%; and

·

Rate differences on income (loss) of consolidated foreign companies

.

Index

The effective income tax rate for 2016 differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the following items:

﻿

·

Rate differences on income (loss) of consolidated foreign companies, including the benefit of excess foreign tax credits resulting from the inclusion of foreign earnings in U.S. income; and

·

The tax-free nature of the realignment of our equity interest in Dow Corning during the period, as well as the release of the deferred tax liability related to Corning’s tax on Dow Corning’s undistributed earnings as of the date of the transaction.

﻿

In December 2017, the U.S. enacted the 2017 Tax Act which resulted in significant changes for our financial results, including, but not limited to, (1) reducing the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate to 21%, and (2) imposing a one-time toll charge tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies that had not been previously taxed in the U.S.

﻿

Given the significant complexity of the 2017 Tax Act and the lack of clear tax and accounting regulatory guidance for this new law, the Securities Exchange Commission issued its Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 (“SAB 118”) to provide registrants additional time to analyze and report the effects of tax reform during the “measurement period”.  Under SAB 118, the registrant was required to record those items where ASC 740 analysis was complete; include reasonable estimates and label them as provisional where ASC 740 analysis was incomplete; and if reasonable estimates could not be made, record items under the previous tax law.  The measurement period, not to exceed one year, ended on the date the entity had obtained, prepared, and analyzed the information that was needed to complete the accounting requirements under ASC Topic 740.

﻿

The 2017 Tax Act also established new tax provisions affecting our 2018 results, including, but not limited to: (1) Creating a new provision to tax

global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI); (2) generally eliminating U.S. federal taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries; (3) eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax (“AMT”); (4) creating the base erosion anti-abuse tax (“BEAT”); (5) establishing a deduction for foreign derived intangible income (“FDII”); (6) establishing new limitations on deductible interest expense; and (7) establishing new limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation.

﻿

For the year ended December 31, 2018, Corning’s results included

a worldwide tax provision of $437 million

, inclusive of tax on ongoing operations of $412 million and the impacts of the 2017 Tax Act of $25 million.  The impacts of the 2017 Tax Act include: GILTI tax of $55 million, FDII

benefit of $10 million, and a

$20 million benefit related to truing up the toll charge and our measurement of U.S. deferred

taxe

s, offset by the recording

of

a provision related to lifting our assertion of indefinite reinvestment on certain foreign earnings.

As of December 31, 2018, Corning has completed its analysis of the impact of the 2017 Tax Act as required by SAB 118.  The GILTI tax of $55 million was largely driven by the receipt of customer deposits.

See Note


(

Revenue

) to these Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.

﻿

Corning has completed its analysis on the impact of the 2017 Tax Act on its assertion regarding its indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings.  Corning

has determined that it will no longer assert indefinite asset reinvestment

on $15.4 billion of unremitted foreign earnings accumulated prior to 2018.  This represents approximately 94% of Corning’s unremitted foreign earnings as of the end of 2017.  Corning will continue to indefinitely reinvest the remaining 6% of historic foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017.

﻿

Beginning in 2018, Corning will indefinitely reinvest the foreign earnings of: (1) any of its subsidiaries located in jurisdictions where Corning lacks the ability to repatriate its earnings, (2) any of its subsidiaries where Corning’s intention is to reinvest those earnings in operations, (3) legal entities for which Corning holds a non-controlling interest, (4) any subsidiaries with an accumulated deficit in earnings and profits and (5) any subsidiaries which have a positive earnings and profits balance but for which the entity lacks sufficient local statutory earnings or stock basis from which to make a distribution.

Index

During 2018, the Company distributed approximately $4.2 billion from foreign subsidiaries to their respective U.S. parent companies.  There are no incremental taxes beyond the toll charge due with respect to these distributions.  As of December 31, 2018, Corning has approximately $1.5 billion of

indefinitely

reinvested foreign earnings

.  It remains impracticable to calculate the tax cost of repatriating our unremitted earnings which are considered indefinitely reinvested.

Comprehensive Income

﻿

﻿

﻿

2018 vs. 2017

For the year ended December 31, 2018, comprehensive income increased by $0.6 billion, when compared to the same period in 2017, driven by an increase in net income of $1.6 billion largely driven by the absence of $1.5 billion in tax reform adjustments related to the 2017 Tax Act.

© 2019 Corning Incorporated. All Rights Reserved.


Index

﻿

Partially offsetting

this increase

was a decrease in the gain on foreign currency translation adjustments in the amount of $


.9 billion (after-tax), largely driven by the strengthening of foreign currencies, most significantly the South Korean won, euro and the Chinese yuan, which impacted comprehensive income in the amounts of $556 million, $


million and $


million, respectively.

﻿

2017 vs. 2016

For the year ended December 31, 2017, comprehensive income decreased by $3.5 billion, when compared to the same period in 2016, driven by a decrease in net income of $4.2 billion and a decrease in unamortized actuarial gains for postretirement benefit plans.  The significant decrease in net income was largely driven by the absence of a $2.7 billion non-taxable gain and a $105 million positive tax adjustment on the strategic realignment of our ownership interest in Dow Corning recorded in the second quarter of 2016, combined with the impact of the passage of the

2017 Tax Act, which included a provisional toll charge of $1.1 billion and a provisional charge of $347 million as a result of the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities.  Our unamortized actuarial gains decreased driven by a decrease in the discount rates used to value our postretirement benefit obligations.

﻿

Partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in the gain on foreign currency translation adjustments in the amount of $850 million (after-tax), largely driven by the weakening of foreign currencies, most significantly the South Korean won, Japanese yen and the euro, which impacted comprehensive income in the amounts of $420 million, $164 million and $115 million, respectively.

﻿

See Note 11 (Employee Retirement Plans) and Note 15 (Shareholders’ Equity) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details.

CORE PERFORMANCE MEASURES

﻿

In managing the Company and assessing our financial performance, we adjust certain measures provided by our consolidated financial statements to exclude specific items to arrive at core performance measures.  These items include gains and losses on our translated earnings contracts, acquisition-related costs, certain discrete tax items, restructuring and restructuring-related charges, certain litigation-related expenses, pension mark-to-market adjustments and other items which do not reflect on-going operating results of the Company or our equity affiliates.  Additionally, Corning has adopted the use of constant currency reporting for our Display Technologies and Specialty Materials segments for the Japanese yen, South Korean won, Chinese yuan and New Taiwan dollar currencies.  The Company believes that the use of constant currency reporting allows investors to understand our results without the volatility of currency fluctuations, and reflects the underlying economics of the translated earnings contracts used to mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on our earnings and cash flows.  Corning also believes that reporting core performance measures provides investors greater transparency to the information used by our management team to make financial and operational decisions.

﻿

Core performance measures are not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States (“GAAP”).  We believe investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in evaluating our results as they are more indicative of our core operating performance and how management evaluates our operational results and trends.  These measures are not, and should not be viewed as a substitute for, GAAP reporting measures.  With respect to the Company’s outlook for future periods, it is not possible to provide reconciliations for these non-GAAP measures because the Company does not forecast the movement of the Japanese yen, South Korean won, Chinese yuan or New Taiwan dollar against the U.S. dollar, or other items that do not reflect ongoing operations, nor does it forecast items that have not yet occurred or are out of the Company’s control.  As a result, the Company is unable to provide outlook information on a GAAP basis.

﻿

For a reconciliation of non-GAAP performance measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, please see “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures” below.

Core Earnings

﻿

2018 vs. 2017

In the year ended December 31, 2018, we generated core earnings of $1,673 million or $1.78 per share, compared to core earnings generated in the year ended December 31, 2017 of $1,634 million, or $1.60 per share.  The increase in core earnings of $39 million was driven by the following items:

﻿

·

An increase in the Optical Communications segment of $123 million, driven by higher sales of carrier and enterprise network products;

·

An increase in the Environmental Technologies segment of $43 million resulting from sales growth across all product lines;

·

An increase of $22 million in the Life Sciences segment resulting from higher sales, as well as improved manufacturing efficiencies; and

·

An increase of $12 million in the Specialty Materials segment driven by higher sales of Gorilla Glass, advanced optics and other specialty glass.

﻿

Partially offsetting these increases in earnings were the following:

﻿

·

A decrease in the Display Technologies segment of $53 million, with the costs of expanding Gen 10.5 capacity, ramping production and rebuilding tanks for fleet optimization during the first half of the year more than offsetting increased sales;

·

A decrease of $22 million in the All Other segment resulting from increased investment in development projects;

·

Increased

financing expenses of $


million

; and

·

Increased

corporate

project expenses

$


million

.

﻿

Core earnings per share increased in the year ended December 31, 2018 to $1.78 per share, driven by the increase in core income and lower weighted average shares outstanding due to repurchases of our common stock during 2018.

﻿

2017 vs. 2016

In the year ended December 31, 2017, we generated core earnings of $1,634 million or $1.60 per share, compared to core earnings generated in the year ended December 31, 2016 of $1,651million, or $1.44 per share.  The decrease in core earnings of $17 million was driven by the following items:

﻿

·

The absence of equity earnings of $


million from Dow Corning’s silicones business due to our 2016 realignment of our ownership interest in Dow Corning;

·

A decrease of $6


million in the Display Technologies segment, driven by display glass price declines of approximately 10%, partially offset by an increase in volume in the mid-single digits in percentage terms; and

·

An increase in corporate project expenses and variable compensation of $29 million and $25 million, respectively.

﻿

The decline was offset by an increase in core earnings in the Optical Communications segment of $118 million, due to higher sales of carrier and enterprise network products, combined with the absence of the production issues in the first half of 2016 related to the implementation of new software and an increase in the Specialty Materials segment of $73 million, driven by an increase in Corning Gorilla Glass and advanced optics products.

﻿

Although core net earnings decreased in the year ended December 31, 2017, core earnings per share increased $0.16 per share, driven by lower weighted average shares outstanding due to repurchases of our common stock in 2017.

﻿

Included in core earnings for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 is net periodic pension expense in the amount of $52 million, $49 million and $51 million, respectively, which excludes the annual pension mark-to-market adjustments.  In the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the mark-to-market adjustments pre-tax losses of

$145 million,

$21 million and $67 million, respectively.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures

We utilize certain financial measures and key performance indicators that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP to assess our financial and operating performance.  A non-GAAP financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of a company’s financial performance that (i) excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of income or statement of cash flows, or (ii) includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the comparable measure as calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of income or statement of cash flows.

﻿

Core net sales, core equity in earnings of affiliated companies and core earnings are non-GAAP financial measures utilized by our management to analyze financial performance without the impact of items that are driven by general economic conditions and events that do not reflect the underlying fundamentals and trends in the Company’s operations.

REPORTABLE SEGMENTS

﻿

Our reportable segments are as follows:

﻿

·

Display Technologies – manufactures glass substrates primarily for flat panel liquid crystal displays.

·

Optical Communications – manufactures carrier and enterprise network components for the telecommunications industry.

·

Environmental Technologies – manufactures ceramic substrates and filters for automotive and diesel emission control applications.

·

Specialty Materials – manufactures products that provide more than 150 material formulations for glass, glass ceramics and fluoride crystals to meet demand for unique customer needs.

·

Life Sciences – manufactures glass and plastic labware, equipment, media and reagents enabling workflow solutions for scientific applications.

﻿

All other segments that do not meet the quantitative threshold for separate reporting have been grouped as “All Other.”  This group is primarily comprised of the results of pharmaceutical technologies, auto glass, new product lines and development projects, as well as certain corporate investments such as Eurokera and Keraglass equity affiliates.

﻿

We prepared the financial results for our reportable segments on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information to assist in making internal operating decisions.  We included the earnings of equity affiliates that are closely associated with our reportable segments in the respective segment’s net income.  We have allocated certain common expenses among our reportable segments differently than we would for stand-alone financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.  Our reportable segments include non-GAAP measures which are not prepared in accordance with GAAP.  We believe investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in evaluating our results as they are more indicative of our core operating performance and how management evaluates our operational results and trends.  These measures are not, and should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP reporting measures.  For a reconciliation of non-GAAP performance measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, please see “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures” above.  Segment net income may not be consistent with measures used by other companies.  The accounting policies of our reportable segments are the same as those applied in the consolidated financial statements.

﻿

Display Technologies

﻿

The following table provides net sales and net income for the Display Technologies segment:

﻿

﻿

2018 vs. 2017

Display Technologies segment net sales increased $139 million compared to the prior year.  Total display glass market volume was up in 2018.  Our volume growth in this market more than offset price declines on a year-over-year basis.  2018 was the best pricing environment in more than a decade, achieving the important milestone of mid-single digit year-over-year declines during the second half of the year.

﻿

Net income decreased by $53 million, or 6%, mainly driven by the costs of expanding Gen 10.5 capacity, ramping production and rebuilding tanks for fleet optimization during the first half of the year.

Index

2017 vs. 2016

Net sales decreased by $151 million, or 5%, in the year ended December 31, 2017, when compared to the same period in 2016, driven by price declines of approximately 10%, partially offset by an increase in volume in the mid-single digits in percentage terms.

﻿

Net income decreased by $65 million, or 7%, driven by the following items:

﻿

·

The impact of price declines of approximately 10%; and

·

An increase of $40 million in research, development and engineering expenses, primarily

driven by the absence of the impact of a 2016 joint development agreement.

﻿

The decrease in net income was partially offset by the following items:

﻿

·

A mid-single digit percentage increase in volume; and

·

Improvements in manufacturing efficiency, which added $68 million.

﻿

Outlook:

For full-year 2019, Corning expects the display glass market to grow by

a

mid-single digit percentage, consistent with 2018.  The Company expects Corning’s volume to grow faster than the market due to expansion of our Gen 10.5 manufacturing capacity in China.  2018 was the best pricing environment in more than a decade achieving the important milestone of mid

-single digit

year

-o

ver

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

﻿

Financing and Capital Structure

﻿

The following items discuss Corning’s financing and changes in capital structure during 2018 and 2017:

﻿


In the second quarter of 2018, Corning issued ¥65.5 billion Japanese yen-denominated debt securities in tranches of 7, 10 and 12 years.  The proceeds from these notes were received in Japanese yen and immediately converted to U.S. dollars on the date of issuance.  The net proceeds received in U.S. dollars, after deducting offering expenses, was $596 million.  Payments of principal and interest on the notes will be in Japanese yen, or should yen be unavailable due to circumstances beyond Corning’s control, a U.S. dollar equivalent.  The net proceeds of $596 million will be used for general corporate purposes.

﻿

In the third quarter of 2018, Corning amended and restated its revolving credit agreement (the “Revolving Credit Agreement”).  The Revolving Credit Agreement provides a $1.5 billion unsecured multi-currency line of credit and expires August 15, 2023.  The Revolving Credit Agreement includes affirmative and negative covenants with which Corning must comply, including a leverage (debt to capital ratio) financial covenant.  The required leverage ratio is a maximum of 60%.

Index

In the fourth quarter of 2018, Corning issued $900 million U.S. dollar-denominated unsecured long-term notes in tranches of 19, 30, and 50 years.  The net proceeds of $889 million will be used for general corporate purposes.  We can redeem these notes at any time, subject to certain terms and conditions.

﻿

In the fourth quarter of 2018, Corning redeemed $250 million of 6.625% Notes due 2019, paying

a nominal

call premium.  The bond redemption incurred an insignificant loss during

the fourth quarter of 2018

.

﻿


In the third quarter of 2017, Corning issued ¥78 billion Japanese yen-denominated debt securities in tranches of 7, 10 and 20 years.  The proceeds from these notes were received in Japanese yen and immediately converted to U.S. dollars on the date of issuance.  The net proceeds received in U.S. dollars, after deducting offering expenses, was approximately $700 million.  Payments of principal and interest on the notes will be in Japanese yen, or should yen be unavailable due to circumstances beyond Corning’s control, a U.S. dollar equivalent.  The net proceeds of $700 million were made available for general corporate purposes.

﻿

In the fourth quarter of 2017, Corning issued $750 million of 4.375% senior unsecured notes that mature on November 15, 2057.  The net proceeds of $743 million will be used for general corporate purposes.  We can redeem these notes at any time, subject to certain terms and conditions.

﻿

On a quarterly basis, Corning will recognize the transaction gains and losses resulting from changes in the JPY/USD exchange rate in the Other expense, net line of the Consolidated Statements of Income.  Cash proceeds from the offerings and payments for debt issuance costs are disclosed as financing activities, and cash payments to bondholders for interest will be disclosed as operating activities, in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

﻿

Common Stock Dividends

﻿

On February 1, 2017, Corning’s Board of Directors declared a 14.8% increase in the Company’s quarterly common stock dividend, which increased the quarterly dividend from $0.135 to $0.155 per share of common stock, beginning with the dividend to be paid in the first quarter of 2017.

﻿

On February 6, 2018, Corning’s Board of Directors declared a 16.1% increase in the Company’s quarterly common stock dividend, which increased the quarterly dividend from $0.155 to $0.18 per share of common stock, beginning with the dividend to be paid in the first quarter of 2018.

﻿

On February 6, 2019, Corning’s Board of Directors declared an 11.1% increase in the Company’s quarterly common stock dividend, which increased the quarterly dividend from $0.18 to $0.20 per share of common stock, beginning with the dividend paid in the first quarter of 2019.  This increase marks the eighth dividend increase since October 2011.

﻿

Fixed Rate Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, Series A

﻿

Corning has 2,300 outstanding shares of Fixed Rate Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, Series A.  The preferred stock is convertible at the option of the holder and the Company upon certain events, at a conversion rate of 50,000 shares of Corning’s common stock per one share of preferred stock, subject to certain anti-dilution provisions.

Index

Customer Deposits

﻿

As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, Corning had customer deposits of approximately $1.0 billion and $0.4 billion, respectively.  The majority of these represent non-refundable cash deposits for customers to secure rights to an amount of glass produced by Corning under long-term supply agreements.  The duration of these long-term supply agreements ranges up to ten years.  As glass is shipped to customers, Corning will recognize revenue and issue credit memoranda to reduce the amount of the customer deposit liability, which are applied against customer receivables resulting from the sale of glass.  No credit memoranda were issued in 2018 and 2017.

﻿

Capital Spending

﻿

Capital spending totaled $2.2 billion in 2018, an increase of approximately $0.4 billion when compared to 2017, driven by expansions related to the Gen 10.5 glass manufacturing facilities in China, the addition of capacity to support the new gas

particulate filters business in the Environmental Technologies segment, fiber and cable capacity in the Optical Communications segment and general business growth in the Specialty Materials segment.  We expect our 2019 capital expenditures to be slightly more than $2.0 billion.

﻿

Cash Flows

﻿

Summary of cash flow data (in millions):

﻿

﻿

2018 vs. 2017

Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $915 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 when compared to the same period last year, primarily driven by an increase in customer incentives and deposits of $600 million

.  Favorable movements of $189 million in accounts payable and other current liabilities were driven largely by an increase in accounts payable in the Optical Communications segment and higher current liabilities in the Specialty Materials segment.  Cash received

of $104 million, which represents the excess of the fair value of the contingent consideration asset related to the acquisition of Samsung Corning Precision Materials

(refer to Note 14 (Fair Value Measurements) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information)

, also increased cash provided by operating activities.

﻿

Net cash used in investing activities increased by $1,177 million

in the year ended December 31, 2018,

when compared to the

same period last year, driven by increased capital expenditures of $438 million due to capacity expansions, increased acquisition spending of $671million and lower gains realized on translated earnings contracts of $162 million.  Cash received

of $196 million, which represents the original fair value of the contingent consideration asset related to the acquisition of Samsun

g Corning Precision Materials (refer to

Note 14

(Fair Value Measurements) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information

), partially offset the net cash used in investing activities.

﻿

Net cash used in financing activities

in the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $371 million

when compared to the same period last year, driven by higher debt repayments, up $377 million and a decrease of $228 million for proceeds from the exercise of stock options.  A decrease of $225 million in share repurchases partially offset the negative cash impact of these items.

Index

﻿

2017 vs. 2016

Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $533 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 when compared to the same period last year, driven by $501 million of unfavorable movements in working capital.  The negative impact of working capital changes was largely driven by an increase of $143 million in VAT receivables in Asia, a payment of $70 million related to our obligation under the plan of reorganization for PCC (refer to Note 12 (Commitments, Contin

gencies and Guarantees) to the C

o

nsolidated Financial S

tatements for additional information), an increase in accounts receivable and inventory to support growth in the Optical Communications, Environmental Technologies and Specialty Materials segments.

﻿

Net cash used in investing activities increased by $5.4 billion

in the year ended December 31, 2017,

when compared to the

same period last year, driven by the absence of $4.8 billion of cash received in the second quarter of 2016 on the realignment of Dow Corning, coupled with an increase of $674 million in capital expenditures largely due to capacity expansions and a decline of $92 million in liquidations of short-term investments.  A decline of $162 million in acquisition spending partially offset these events.

﻿

Net cash used in financing activities

in the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by $3.7 billion

when compared to the same period last year, driven by lower share repurchases, down $1.8 billion, proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $1.4 billion, the absence of $481 million of commercial paper repayments made in 2016 and an increase of $171 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options.

﻿

Defined Benefit Pension Plans

﻿

We have defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic and international employees.  Our largest single pension plan is Corning’s U.S. qualified plan.  At December 31, 2018, this plan accounted for 76% of our

c

onsolidated defined benefit pension plans’ projected benefit obligation and 85% of the related plans’ assets.

﻿

In 2018, we made voluntary cash contributions of $105 million to our domestic defined benefit pension plan and $12 million to our international pension plans.  In 2017, we made no voluntary cash contributions to our domestic defined benefit pension plan and $29 million to our international pension plans.  During 2019, we anticipate making cash contributions of $75 million to our U.S. qualified pension plan and $31 million to our international pension plans.

Management Assessment of Liquidity

﻿

We ended the fourth quarter of 2018 with approximately $2.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents.  Our cash and cash equivalents are held in various locations throughout the world and are generally unrestricted.  We utilize a variety of strategies to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed.  At December 31, 2018, approximately

56% of

the consolidated amount was held outside of the United States

.  During 2018,

the Company distributed approximately $2.2 billion

in cash

from foreign subsidiaries to

the U.S. parent

.

There were no incremental taxes beyond the toll charge due with respect to this distribution of cash.

﻿

To manage interest rate exposure, the Company, from time to time, enters into interest rate swap agreements.  As of December 31, 2018, there are no interest rate swaps outstanding.

﻿

Corning also has a commercial paper program pursuant to which we may issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding at any one time of $1.5 billion.  Under this program, the Company may issue the paper from time to time and will use the proceeds for general corporate purposes.  The Company’s Revolving Credit Agreement is available to support obligations under the commercial paper program, if needed.  At December 31, 2018 Corning did not have outstanding commercial paper.

﻿

Share Repurchases

﻿

During 2016, Corning repurchased 197.1 million shares for approximately $4.2 billion through an accelerated share repurchase agreement and open market repurchases

as part of the 2015 Repurchase Programs.  In December 2016, Corning’s Board of Directors approved a $4 billion share repurchase program with no expiration (the “2016 Repurchase Program”).

During 2017, Corning repurchased 84.4 million shares for approximately $2.4 billion through accelerated share repurchase agreements and open market repurchases

under the 2016 Repurchase Program.

﻿

During 2018, Corning repurchased 74.8 million shares for approximately $2.2 billion through open market repurchases

under the 2016 and 2018 Repurchase Programs.

﻿

We complete comprehensive reviews of our significant customers and their creditworthiness by analyzing their financial strength at least annually or more frequently for customers where we have identified a measure of increased risk.  We closely monitor payments and developments which may signal possible customer credit issues.  We currently have not identified any potential material impact on our liquidity resulting from customer credit issues.

﻿

Our major source of funding for 2019 and beyond will be our operating cash flow, our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents and proceeds from any issuances of debt.  We believe we have sufficient liquidity to fund operations, acquisitions, capital expenditures, scheduled debt repayments, dividend payments and share repurchase programs.

﻿

Our Revolving Credit Agreement includes affirmative and negative covenants with which we must comply, including a leverage (debt to capital ratio) financial covenant.  The required leverage ratio is a maximum of 60%.  At December 31, 2018, our leverage using this measure was approximately 30%.  As of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with this financial covenant.

Our debt instruments contain customary event of default provisions, which allow the lenders the option of accelerating all obligations upon the occurrence of certain events.  In addition, some of our debt instruments contain a cross default provision, whereby an uncured default in excess of a specified amount on one debt obligation of the Company, also would be considered a default under the terms of another debt instrument.  As of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all such provisions.

﻿

Management is not aware of any known trends or any known demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in a material decrease in our liquidity.  In addition, other than items discussed, there are no known material trends, favorable or unfavorable, in our capital resources and no expected material changes in the mix and relative cost of such resources.

﻿

Translated Earnings Contracts

﻿

Corning has hedged a significant portion of its projected yen exposure for the period 2018 through 2022, with average rate forwards, collars and puts.  In the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we recorded pre-tax net losses of $96 million, $201 million and $459 million related to changes in the fair value of these instruments.  Included in these amounts are realized gains of $64 million, $268 million and $207 million, respectively.  The gross notional value outstanding for these instruments which hedge our exposure to the Japanese yen at December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $11.6 billion, $13 billion and $14.9 billion, respectively.

﻿

We have entered into zero-cost collars and average rate forwards to hedge our translation exposure resulting from movements in the South Korean won and its impact on our net income.  In the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a pre-tax net loss of $26 million, and in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we recorded pre-tax net gains of $95 million and $7 million, respectively, related to changes in the fair value of these instruments.  Included in these amounts is a realized gain of $46 million, and realized losses of $1 million and $7 million, respectively.  These instruments had a gross notional value outstanding at December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 of $0.1 billion, $0.8 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively.

﻿

We have entered into a portfolio average rate forwards to hedge against our euro translation exposure.  In the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $43 million, a net pre-tax loss of $40 million, and a net pre-tax gain of $15 million, respectively

.  Included in these amounts are realized losses of $14 million and $2 million, and a realized gain of $1 million, respectively.  At Dec

ember 31, 2018, the euro-denominated average rate instruments had a gross notional amount of $1.2 billion, and at 2017 and 2016, a gross notional amount of $0.3 billion.

﻿

These derivative instruments are not designated as accounting hedges, and changes in fair value are recorded in earnings in the translated earnings contract loss, net line of the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss).

﻿

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

﻿

Off balance sheet arrangements are transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which Corning has an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements.

﻿

Corning’s off balance sheet arrangements include guarantee contracts.  At the time a guarantee is issued, the Company is required to recognize a liability for the fair value or market value of the obligation it assumes.  In the normal course of our business, we do not routinely provide significant third-party guarantees.  Generally, third-party guarantees provided by Corning are limited to certain financial guarantees, including stand-by letters of credit and performance bonds, and the incurrence of contingent liabilities in the form of purchase price adjustments related to attainment of milestones.  These guarantees have various terms, and none of these guarantees are individually significant.

﻿

Refer to Note 12 (Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Index

For variable interest entities, we assess the terms of our interest in each entity to determine if we are the primary beneficiary.  The primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is the party that absorbs a majority of the entity’s expected losses, receives a majority of its expected residual returns, or both, as a result of holding variable interests, which are the ownership, contractual, or other pecuniary interests in an entity that change with changes in the fair value of the entity’s net assets excluding variable interests.

﻿

Corning has identified ten entities that qualify as a variable interest entity and are not consolidated.  These entities are not considered to be significant to Corning’s consolidated statements of position.

﻿

Corning does not have retained interests in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serve as credit, liquidity or market risk support to that entity.

﻿

Contractual Obligations

﻿

The amounts of our obligations follow (in millions):

﻿

﻿

﻿

(1)

At December 31, 2018, $39 million of the $84 million was included in other accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.

(2)

Purchase obligations are enforceable and legally binding obligations which primarily consist of raw material and energy-related take-or-pay contracts.

(3)

Capital expenditure obligations primarily reflect amounts associated with our capital expansion activities.

(4)

Total debt above is stated at maturity value, and excludes interest rate swap gains/losses and bond discounts.

(5)

The estimate of interest payments assumes interest is paid through the date of maturity or expiration of the related debt, based upon stated rates in the respective debt instruments.

(6)

At December 31, 2018, $


million was included on our balance sheet related to uncertain tax positions.

﻿

We believe a significant majority of these guarantees and contingent liabilities will expire without being funded.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

﻿

The preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein.  The estimates that required us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments, including future projections of performance and relevant discount rates, are set forth below.

﻿

Acquired assets and liabilities

﻿

We account for the acquisition of a business using the purchase method of accounting, which requires us to estimate the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.  This includes acquired intangible assets such as customer-related intangibles and patents, fixed assets and inventories.  Liabilities assumed may include litigation and other contingency reserves existing at the time of acquisition and require judgment in ascertaining the related fair values.  Independent appraisals may be used to assist in the determination of the fair value of certain assets and liabilities.  Such appraisals are based on significant estimates provided by us, such as forecasted revenues and profits utilized in determining the fair value of contract-related acquired intangible assets or liabilities.  Significant changes in assumptions and estimates subsequent to completing the allocation of the purchase price to the assets and liabilities acquired, as well as differences in actual and estimated results could result in impacts to our financial results.  Additional information related to the acquisition date fair value of acquired assets and liabilities obtained during the allocation period, not to exceed one year, may result in changes to the recorded values of acquired assets and liabilities, resulting in an offsetting adjustment to the goodwill associated with the business acquired.

﻿

In 2018 we acquired CMD fro

m 3M in a business combination.  Included in the acquisition were o

ther intangible assets consist

ing

primarily of

$434

million of customer relationships and

$91

million of other intangibles that are amortized over

the weighted average useful life of approximately 14 and 11 years, respectively

.

The customer relationship intangible asset was valued using the Multi-Period Excess Earnings Valuation Method, which is an income approach method

that estimates fair value

of revenue

based upon the present value of cash flows that

are

expected to be generated from the acquired customer base

.  Key assumptions used in this valuation include a discount rate of 12.5%, revenue growth rates in the range of 0% to 3% and a customer attrition rate of 6%.

﻿

Impairment of assets held for use

﻿

We are required to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets when an indicator of impairment has been identified.  We review our long-lived assets in each quarter to assess whether impairment indicators are present.  We must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event of impairment has occurred.

﻿

Manufacturing equipment includes certain components of production equipment that are constructed of precious metals, primarily platinum and rhodium.  These metals are not depreciated because they have very low physical losses and are repeatedly reclaimed and reused in our manufacturing process over a very long useful life.  Precious metals are reviewed for impairment as part of our assessment of long-lived assets.  This review considers all the Company’s precious metals that are either in place in the production process; in reclamation, fabrication, or refinement in anticipation of re-use; or awaiting use to support increased capacity.  Precious metals are only acquired to support our operations and are not held for trading or other non-manufacturing related purposes.

﻿

Index

Examples of events or circumstances that may be indicative of impairments include, but are not limited to:

﻿

·

A significant decrease in the market price of an asset;

·

A significant change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset is being used or in its physical condition;

·

A significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the asset, including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator;

·

An accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of an asset;

·

A current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of an asset; and

·

A current expectation that, more likely than not, an asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life.

﻿

For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss, a long-lived asset or assets is grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.  We must exercise judgment in assessing the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.  Our assessment is performed at the reportable segment level.  For the majority of our reportable segments, we concluded that locations or businesses within these segments which share production along the supply chain must be combined to appropriately identify cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.

﻿

For long-lived assets, when impairment indicators are present, we compare estimated undiscounted future cash flows, including the eventual disposition of the asset group at market value, to the assets’ carrying value to determine if the asset group is recoverable.  This assessment requires the exercise of judgment in assessing the future use of and projected value to be derived from the assets to be held and used.  Assessments also consider changes in asset utilization, including the temporary idling of capacity and the expected timing for placing this capacity back into production.  If there is an impairment, a loss is recorded to reflect the difference between the assets’ fair value and carrying value.  This may require judgment in estimating future cash flows and relevant discount rates and residual values in estimating the current fair value of the impaired assets to be held and used.

﻿

For an asset group that fails the test of recoverability, the estimated fair value of long-lived assets is determined using an “income approach” that starts with the forecast of all the expected future net cash flows including the eventual disposition at market value of long-lived assets, and considers the fair market value of all precious metals.  We assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.  If there is an impairment, a loss is recorded to reflect the difference between the assets’ fair value and carrying value.  Our estimates are based upon our historical experience, our commercial relationships, and available external information about future trends.  We believe fair value assessments are most sensitive to market growth and the corresponding impact on volume and selling prices and that these are also more subjective than manufacturing cost and other assumptions.  The Company believes its current assumptions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate.

﻿

At December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the carrying value of precious metals was higher than the fair market value by $719 million and $711 million, respectively.  The majority of these precious metals are utilized by the Display Technologies and Specialty Materials segments.  Corning believes these precious metal assets to be recoverable due to the significant positive cash flow in both segments.  The potential for impairment exists in the future if negative events significantly decrease the cash flow of these segments.  Such events include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in demand for products or a significant decrease in profitability in our Display Technologies or Specialty Materials segments.

Impairment of Goodwill

﻿

We are required to make certain subjective and complex judgments in assessing whether an event of impairment of goodwill has occurred, including assumptions and estimates used to determine the fair value of our reporting units. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level.

A reporting unit is equivalent to an operating segment or a component of an operating segment which constitutes a business and for which discrete financial information is regularly reviewed by segment management.

An impairment loss generally would be recognized when the carrying amount of a reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit.

﻿

Corning has recorded goodwill in the Display Technologies, Optical Communications, Specialty Materials, Life Sciences and All Other operating segments.

Each of these operating segments is a separate reporting unit; however, Specialty Materials and All Other are each made up of two separate reporting units.

On a quarterly basis, or if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying amount may be impaired, management performs a qualitative assessment of factors in each reporting unit within these operating segments to determine if there have been any triggering events.

We also perform a detailed quantitative impairment test every three years if no indicators suggest a test should be performed in the interim.

We use this calculation as a quantitative validation of the qualitative process; this process does not represent an election to perform the quantitative impairment test in place of the qualitative review.

﻿

The qualitative assessment is performed by assessing various factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.

These factors include, but are not limited to, changes in macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, other relevant entity-specific events, or a sustained decrease in share price.

﻿

In 2018, we performed a quantitative goodwill impairment assessment in addition to assessing the qualitative factors each quarter.

Our assessment is based on our annual strategic planning process.

This process includes an extensive review of expectations for the long-term growth of our businesses and forecasted future cash flows. Our valuation method is an “income approach” using a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods, plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon, are discounted to present value using an appropriate

discount rate

.

Our estimates are based upon our historical experience, our current knowledge from our commercial relationships, and available external information about future trends.

The quantitative assessment requires the e

xercise of significant judgment

, including judgment about appropriate discount rates, growth rates and the timing of expected future cash flows of the respective reporting unit.

﻿

The

quantitative

assessment

of goodwill

resulted in fair values significantly exceeding the carrying values for all of our reporting units.  We also performed a sensitivity analysis, using a range between 7-10% for the discount rate and 0%-3% for the growth rate, which had no material impact on our results.

Based on the quantitative test performed in 2018, no goodwill impairment was required.

﻿

Income taxes

﻿

We are required to exercise judgment about our future results in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets.  Inherent in this estimation process is the requirement for us to estimate future book and taxable income and possible tax planning strategies.  These estimates require us to exercise judgment about our future results, the prudence and feasibility of possible tax planning strategies, and the economic environments in which we do business.  It is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to allowances.

Index

Corning accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, which requires that companies only record tax benefits for technical positions that are believed to have a greater than 50% likelihood of being sustained on their technical merits and then only to the extent of the amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement.  In estimating these amounts, we must exercise judgment around factors such as the weighting of the tax law in our favor, the willingness of a tax authority to aggressively pursue a particular position, or alternatively, consider a negotiated compromise, and our willingness to dispute a tax authorities’ assertion to the level of appeal we believe is required to sustain our position.  As a result, it is possible that our estimate of the benefits we will realize for uncertain tax positions may change when we become aware of new information affecting these judgments and estimates.

﻿

As of December 31, 2018, Corning has completed its analysis of the impact of the 2017 Tax Act as required by SAB 118

.

﻿

Beginning in 2018, Corning will indefinitely reinvest the foreign earnings of: (1) any of its subsidiaries located in jurisdictions where Corning lacks the ability to repatriate its earnings, (2) any of its subsidiaries where Corning’s intention is to reinvest

those earnings in operations,

(3) legal entities for which Corning holds a non-controlling interest, (4) any subsidiaries with an accumulated deficit in earnings and profits and (5) any subsidiaries which have a positive earnings and profits balance but for which the entity lacks sufficient local statutory earnings or stock basis from which to make a distribution.

﻿

Under the 2017 Tax Act, a company can make a policy election to account for

the tax on GILTI as a period cost

or to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities when basis differences exist that are expected to affect the amount of GILTI inclusion upon reversal.

Corning has elected to account for the GI

LTI provisions as a period cost.

﻿

Fair value measures

﻿

As required, Corning uses two kinds of inputs to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities: observable and unobservable.  Observable inputs are based on market data or independent sources, while unobservable inputs are based on the Company’s own market assumptions.  Once inputs have been characterized, we prioritize the inputs used to measure fair value into one of three broad levels.  Characterization of fair value inputs is required for those accounting pronouncements that prescribe or permit fair value measurement.  In addition, observable market data must be used when available and the highest-and-best-use measure should be applied to non-financial assets.  Corning’s major categories of financial assets and liabilities required to be measured at fair value are short-term and long-term investments, certain pension asset investments and derivatives.  These categories use observable inputs only and are measured using a market approach based on quoted prices in markets considered active or in markets in which there are few transactions.

﻿

Derivative assets and liabilities may include interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts that are measured using observable quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities.  Included in our forward exchange contracts are foreign currency hedges that hedge our translation exposure resulting from movements in the Japanese yen, South Korean won, euro, New Taiwan dollar, Chinese yuan and British pound.  These contracts are not designated as accounting hedges, and changes in fair value are recorded in earnings in the translated earnings contract loss, net line of the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss).  In arriving at the fair value of Corning’s derivative assets and liabilities, we have considered the appropriate valuation and risk criteria, including such factors as credit risk of the relevant party to the transaction.  Amounts related to credit risk are not material.

Probability of litigation outcomes

﻿

We are required to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain.  In making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters, we consider the evaluation of legal counsel knowledgeable about each matter, case law, and other case-specific issues.  See Part II – Item 3. Legal Proceedings for a discussion of Corning’s material litigation matters.

﻿

Other possible liabilities

﻿

We are required to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain.  In making determinations of likely outcomes of certain matters, including certain tax planning and environmental matters, these judgments require us to consider events and actions that are outside our control in determining whether probable or possible liabilities require accrual or disclosure.  It is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to accruals.

﻿

Pension and other postretirement employee benefits (OPEB)

﻿

Corning offers employee retirement plans consisting of defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic and international employees and postretirement plans that provide health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retirees and dependents.  The costs and obligations related to these benefits reflect the Company’s assumptions related to general economic conditions (particularly interest rates), expected return on plan assets, rate of compensation increase for employees and health care trend rates.  The cost of providing plan benefits depends on demographic assumptions including retirements, mortality, turnover and plan participation.  While management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect Corning’s employee pension and other postretirement obligations, and current and future expense.

﻿

Costs for our defined benefit pension plans consist of two elements:  1) on-going costs recognized quarterly, which are comprised of service and interest costs, expected return on plan assets and amortization of prior service costs; and 2) mark-to-market gains and losses outside of the corridor, where the corridor is equal to 10% of the greater of the benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets at the beginning of the year, which are recognized annually in the fourth quarter of each year.  These gains and losses result from changes in actuarial assumptions and the differences between actual and expected return on plan assets.  Any interim remeasurements triggered by a curtailment, settlement or significant plan changes, as well as any true-up to the annual valuation, are recognized as a mark-to-market adjustment in the quarter in which such event occurs.

﻿

Costs for our OPEB plans consist of on-going costs recognized quarterly, and are comprised of service and interest costs, amortization of prior service costs and amortization of actuarial gains and losses.  We recognize the actuarial gains and losses resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions as a component of Stockholders’ Equity on our consolidated balance sheets on an annual basis and amortize them into our operating results over the average remaining service period of employees expected to receive benefits under the plans, to the extent such gains and losses are outside of the corridor.

﻿

On January 1, 2018, Corning adopted ASU No. 2017-07, Compensation Retirement Benefits (Topic 715):  Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Post-Retirement Benefit Cost, which presents the service cost component with other current compensation costs in operating income.  The remaining components are included in the line item Other expense, net, in the Consolidated Statements of Income

(Loss)

.  Corning applied the practical expedient as the estimation basis for applying the retrospective presentation requirements.

In addition, at December 31, 2018, a 25 basis point decrease in each spot rate would decrease stockholders’ equity by $112 million before tax, and a 25 basis point increase in each spot rate would increase stockholders’ equity by $107 million.  In addition, the impact of greater than a 25 basis point decrease in each spot rate would not be proportional to the first 25 basis point decrease in each spot rate.

Revenue recognition

﻿

The Company recognizes revenue when all performance obligations under the terms of a contract with our customer are satisfied, and control of the product has been transferred to the customer.  If customer acceptance clauses are present and it cannot be objectively determined that control has been transferred, revenue is only recorded when customer acceptance is received and all performance obligations have been satisfied.  Sales of goods typically do not include multiple product and/or service elements.  Corning also has contractual arrangements with certain customers in which we recognize revenue over time.  The performance obligations under these contracts generally require services to be performed over time, resulting in either a straight-line amortization method or an input method using incurred and forecasted expense to predict revenue recognition patterns which follows satisfaction of the performance obligation.

﻿

On January 1, 2018, we adopted

Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09

ASC (Topic 606), Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and applied the modified retrospective method of accounting to those contracts which were not completed as of January 1, 2018.  Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting under ASC Topic 605 “Revenue Recognition”.

Because the impact of adopting the standard on Corning’s financial statements was immaterial,

we have not made an adjustment to opening retained earnings.

Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks

﻿

We operate and conduct business in many foreign countries and as a result are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates.  Our exposure to exchange rates has the following effects:

﻿

·

Exchange rate movements on financial instruments and transactions denominated in foreign currencies that impact earnings; and

·

Exchange rate movements upon conversion of net assets and net income of foreign subsidiaries for which the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, which impact our net equity.

﻿

Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the Japanese yen, South Korean won, New Taiwan dollar, Chinese yuan, and the euro.  We seek to mitigate the impact of exchange rate movements in our income statement by using over-the-counter (OTC) derivative instruments including foreign exchange forward and option contracts.  In general, these hedges expire coincident with the timing of the underlying foreign currency commitments and transactions.

﻿

We are exposed to potential losses in the event of non-performance by our counterparties to these derivative contracts.  However, we minimize this risk by maintaining a diverse group of highly-rated major financial institutions as our counterparties.  We do not expect to record any losses as a result of such counterparty default.  Neither we nor our counterparties are required to post collateral for these financial instruments.

﻿

Our cash flow hedging activities utilize OTC foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that movements in exchange rates will adversely affect the net cash flows resulting from the sale of products to foreign customers and purchases from foreign suppliers.  We also use OTC foreign exchange forward and option contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes.  The undesignated hedges limit exposures to foreign functional currency fluctuations related to certain subsidiaries’ monetary assets, monetary liabilities and net earnings in foreign currencies.  A significant portion of the Company’s non-U.S. revenues are denominated in Japanese yen.  When these revenues are translated back to U.S. dollars, the Company is exposed to foreign exchange rate movements in the Japanese yen.  To protect translated earnings against movements in the Japanese yen, the Company has entered into a series of average rate forwards and other derivative instruments.

﻿

We use a sensitivity analysis to assess the market risk associated with our foreign currency exchange risk.  Market risk is defined as the potential change in fair value of assets and liabilities resulting from an adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates.  At December 31, 2018, with respect to open foreign exchange forward and option contracts, and foreign denominated debt with values exposed to exchange rate movements, a 10% adverse movement in quoted foreign currency exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of $1.1 billion compared to $1.4 billion at December 31, 2017.  Specific to the Japanese yen, a 10% adverse movement in quoted yen exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of

$1.0 billion

compared to $1

.3 b

illion at December 31, 2017.  The Company expects that these hypothetical losses from a 10% adverse movement in quoted foreign currency exchange rates on the derivative financial instruments should largely offset gains on the assets, liabilities and future transactions being hedged.

﻿

Interest Rate Risk Management

﻿

To manage interest rate exposure, the Company, from time to time, enters into interest rate derivatives agreements.

In the second quarter of 2018, the Company entered into Treasury rate lock agreements with notional amounts of $300 million to hedge against the variability in cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate related to an anticipated debt issuance.  The instruments were designated as cash flow hedges, and were settled with $16 million received on October 31, 2018 concurrent with the debt issuance.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our principal executive and principal financial officers, after evaluating the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this report, have concluded that based on the evaluation of these controls and procedures required by paragraph (b) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15, that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

﻿

(a)

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

﻿

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate disclosure controls and procedures and adequate internal control over financial reporting for Corning.  Management is also responsible for the assessment of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.

﻿

Disclosure controls and procedures mean controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms.  Corning’s disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by Corning in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to Corning’s management, including Corning’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or other persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

﻿

Corning’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Corning’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of Corning’s assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that Corning’s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of Corning’s management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of Corning’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.

﻿

Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the system of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

(2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  Management’s assessment of internal control over financial reporting includes controls over recognition of equity earnings and equity investments by Corning.  Internal control over financial reporting for Hemlock Semiconductor Group is the responsibility of its management.

Corning acquired

substantially all of

CMD

during 2018, and management excluded CMD from its assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018.

CMD’s internal control over financial reporting is associated with less than 1% of total assets and 2% of net sales included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018.

﻿

Based on this evaluation, management concluded that Corning’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2018.  The effectiveness of Corning’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report

which is included herein.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

﻿

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Corning Incorporated:

﻿

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting

﻿

We have audited the accompanying

consolidated

balance sheets of Corning Incorporated and its subsidiaries

as of December 31, 2018

and 2017

,

and the related

consolidated

statements of income (loss), comprehensive income, changes in shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, including the related notes and schedule of valuation and qualifying accounts for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018 appearing under Item 15 (a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”).

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

(2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

﻿

In our opinion, the consolidated

financial statements referred

to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2018

and 2017

, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018

in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

(2013)

issued by the COSO.

﻿

Basis for Opinions

﻿

The Company's management is responsible for these

consolidated

financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting

, included in Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A

.  Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s

consolidated

financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our

audits.  We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

﻿

We conducted our

audits i

n accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the

consolidated

financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

﻿

Our audits of the

consolidated

financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the

consolidated

financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.  Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the

consolidated

financial statements.  Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the

consolidated

financial statements.  Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.  Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.

We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

﻿

As described in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has excluded

CMD

from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination during 2018.  We have also excluded CMD

from our audit of internal control over financial reporting.

CMD

is a wholly-owned business whose total assets and net sales excluded from management’s assessment and our audit of internal control over financial reporting represent less than 1% and 2%,

respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018.

﻿

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

﻿

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

﻿

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Summary of Signif

icant Accounting Policies

﻿

Organization

﻿

Corning Incorporated is a provider of high-performance glass for notebook computers, flat panel desktop monitors, display televisions, and other information display applications; carrier network and enterprise network products for the telecommunications industry; ceramic substrates for gasoline and diesel engines in automotive and heavy duty vehicle markets; laboratory products for the scientific community and specialized polymer products for biotechnology applications; advanced optical materials for the semiconductor industry and the scientific community; and other technologies.  In these notes, the terms “Corning,” “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our” mean Corning Incorporated and subsidiary companies.

﻿

Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation

﻿

Our consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. and include the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of all majority-owned subsidiaries over which Corning exercises control.

﻿

The equity method of accounting is used for investments in affiliated companies that are not controlled by Corning and in which our interest is generally between

20%

and

50%

and we have significant influence over the entity.  Our share of earnings or losses of affiliated companies, in which at least

20%

of the voting securities is owned and we have significant influence but not control over the entity, is included in consolidated operating results.

﻿

For our investments in companies that we do not control and for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies, we use the fair value method to account for the investments if readily determinable fair values are available.  For the investments without readily determinable fair values, we measure them at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment.

﻿

All material intercompany accounts, transactions and profits are eliminated in consolidation.

﻿

On January 1, 2018, we adopted

Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09

ASC (Topic 606), Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and applied the modified retrospective method of accounting to those contracts which were not completed as of January 1, 2018.  Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting under ASC Topic 605 “Revenue Recognition”.

Because the impact of adopting the standard on Corning’s financial statements was immaterial,

we have not made an adjustment to opening retained earnings.

﻿

One of Corning’s equity affiliates is currently assessing the potential impact of adopting ASU 2014-09 on its financial statements and will adopt the standard on January 1, 2019.  The current assessment indicates that the impact of adoption to Corning’s financial statements will be an adjustment to 2019 beginning retained earnings of approximately

$2



million relating to timing of revenue recognition for open performance obligations as measured at January 1, 2019 under the new standard.

﻿

On January 1, 2018, Corning adopted ASU

2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, which refines the classification of certain aspects of the cash flow statement in regards to debt prepayment, settlement of debt instruments, contingent consideration payments, proceeds from insurance claims and life insurance policies, distribution from equity method investees, beneficial interests in securitization transactions and separately identifiable cash flows.  The impact of adopting the standard on Corning’s financial statements was not material.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

﻿

On January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU No. 2017-07, Compensation—Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost.  The service cost component of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost is presented with other current compensation costs in operating income.  The remaining components are included in the line item Other expense, net, in the consolidated statements of income (loss).  Corning has applied the practical expedient which permits it to use the amounts disclosed in its pension and other postretirement benefit plan note for the prior comparative periods as the estimation basis for applying the retrospective presentation requirements

.

The impact of adopting the standard on Corning’s financial statements was not material.

﻿

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current

year

’s

presentation.  These reclassifications had no impact on our results of operations, financial position, or changes in shareholders’ equity.

﻿

Dow Corning

﻿

Prior to May 31, 2016, Corning and Dow Chemical each owned half of Dow Corning, an equity company headquartered in Michigan that manufactures silicone products worldwide.  Dow Corning was the majority-owner of HSG, a market leader in the production of high purity polycrystalline silicon for the semiconductor and solar energy industries.  On May 31, 2016, Corning completed the strategic realignment of its equity investment in Dow Corning pursuant to the Transaction Agreement announced in December 2015.  Under the terms of the Transaction Agreement, Corning exchanged with Dow Corning its

50%

stock interest in Dow Corning for

100%

of the stock of a newly formed entity, which

held

an equity interest in HSG and approximately

$4.8

billion in cash.  Prior to realignment, HSG, a consolidated subsidiary of Dow Corning, was an indirect equity investment of Corning.  Upon completion of the exchange, Corning now has a direct equity investment in HSG.

﻿

Refer to Note 5 (Investments) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

﻿

Use of Estimates

﻿

The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes.  Significant estimates and assumptions in these consolidated financial statements include estimates associated with revenue recognition, restructuring charges, goodwill and long-lived asset impairment tests, estimates of acquired assets and liabilities, estimates of fair value of investments, equity interests, environmental and legal liabilities, income taxes and deferred tax valuation allowances, assumptions used in calculating pension and other postretirement employee benefit expenses and the fair value of share-based compensation.  Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results reported in future periods may be different from these estimates.

﻿

Revenue Recognition

﻿

The majority of our revenues are generated by delivery of products to our customers and recognized at a point in time based on our evaluation of when the customer obtains control of the products.  Revenue is recognized when all performance obligations under the terms of a contract with our customer are satisfied, and control of the product has been transferred to the customer.  If customer acceptance clauses are present and it cannot be objectively determined that control has been transferred, revenue is only recorded when customer acceptance is received and all performance obligations have been satisfied.  Sales of goods typically do not include multiple product and/or service elements.

﻿

Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services.  Sales tax, value-added tax, and other taxes we collect concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue.  Incidental contract costs that are not material in the context of the delivery of goods and services are recognized as expense.

Index

1.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

﻿

At the time revenue is recognized, allowances are recorded, with the related reduction to revenue, for estimated product returns, allowances and price discounts based upon historical experience and related terms of customer arrangements.  Where we have offered product warranties, we also establish liabilities for estimated warranty costs based upon historical experience and specific warranty provisions.  Warranty liabilities are adjusted when experience indicates the expected outcome will differ from initial estimates of the liability.

﻿

In addition, Corning also has contractual arrangements with certain customers in which we recognize revenue over time.  The performance obligations under these contracts generally require services to be performed over time, resulting in either a straight-line amortization method or an input method using incurred and forecasted expense to predict revenue recognition patterns which follows satisfaction of the performance obligation.

﻿

Research and Development Costs

﻿

Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred.  Research and development costs totaled

$807

million in 2018,

$689

million in 2017 and

$637

million in 2016.

﻿

Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions

﻿

The determination of the functional currency for Corning’s foreign subsidiaries is made based on the appropriate economic factors.  For most foreign operations, the local currencies are generally considered to be the functional currencies.  Corning’s most significant exception is our Taiwanese subsidiary, which uses the Japanese yen as its functional currency.  For all transactions denominated in a currency other than a subsidiary’s functional currency, exchange rate gains and losses are included in income for the period in which the exchange rates changed.  We recorded a net loss of

$43

million and a net gain of

$20

million for foreign currency transaction activity for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  These amounts were recorded in the line item Other expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss).

﻿

Foreign subsidiary functional currency balance sheet accounts are translated at current exchange rates, and statement of operations accounts are translated at average exchange rates for the year.  Translation gains and losses are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders’ equity.  The effects of remeasuring non-functional currency assets and liabilities into the functional currency are included in current earnings, except for those related to intra-entity foreign currency transactions of a long-term investment nature, which are recorded together with translation gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss in shareholders’ equity.  Upon sale or substantially complete liquidation of an investment in a foreign entity, the amount of net translation gains or losses that have been accumulated in other comprehensive income attributable to that investment are reported as a gain or loss for the period in which the sale or liquidation occurs.

﻿

Share-Based Compensation

﻿

Corning maintains long-term incentive plans (the “Plans”) for key employees and non-employee members of our Board of Directors.  The Plans allow us to grant equity-based compensation awards, including stock options, stock appreciation rights, performance share units, restricted stock units, restricted stock awards or a combination of awards (collectively, share-based awards).  At December 31, 2018, there were approximately


million unissued common shares available for future grants authorized under the Plans.

﻿

The Company measures and recognizes compensation cost for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values.

© 2019 Corning Incorporated. All Rights Reserved.


Index

1.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

﻿

Total share-based compensation expense was

$51

million,

$46

million and

$42

million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  The income tax benefit realized from share-based compensation was not significant for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.  Refer to Note 4 (Income Taxes) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

﻿

Stock Options

﻿

Corning’s stock option plans provide non-qualified and incentive stock options to purchase authorized but unissued common shares, or treasury shares, at the market price on the grant date and generally become exercisable in installments from

one

to

five

years from the grant date.  The maximum term of non-qualified and incentive stock options is


years from the grant date.

﻿

An award is considered vested when the employee’s retention of the award is no longer contingent on providing subsequent service (the “non-substantive vesting period approach”).  Awards to retirement eligible employees are fully vested at the date of grant, and the related compensation expense is recognized immediately upon grant or over the period from the grant date to the date of retirement eligibility for employees that become age 55 during the vesting period.

﻿

Corning uses a multiple-point Black-Scholes valuation model to estimate the fair value of stock option grants.  Corning utilizes a blended approach for calculating the volatility assumption used in the multiple-point Black-Scholes valuation model defined as the weighted average of the short-term implied volatility, the most recent volatility for the period equal to the expected term, and the most recent 15-year historical volatility.  The expected term assumption is the period of time the options are expected to be outstanding, and is calculated using a combination of historical exercise experience adjusted to reflect the current vesting period of options being valued, and partial life cycles of outstanding options.  The risk-free rates used in the multiple-point Black-Scholes valuation model are the implied rates for a zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bond with a term equal to the option’s expected term.  The ranges given below reflect results from separate groups of employees exhibiting different exercise behavior.

﻿

The following inputs were used for the valuat

ion of option grants under our stock option p

lans:

﻿

﻿

﻿

Incentive Stock Plans

﻿

The Corning Incentive Stock Plan permits restricted stock and restricted stock unit grants, either determined by specific performance goals or issued directly, in most instances, subject to the possibility of forfeiture and without cash consideration.  Restricted stock and restricted stock units under the Incentive Stock Plan are granted at the closing market price on the grant date, contingently vest over a period of generally

one

to

ten

years, and generally have contractual lives of

one

to

ten

years.  The fair value of each restricted stock grant or restricted stock unit awarded under the Incentive Stock Plan is based on the grant date closing price of the Company’s stock.

﻿

Cash and Cash Equivalents

﻿

Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash.  We consider securities with contractual maturities of three months or less, when purchased, to be cash equivalents.  The carrying amount of these securities approximates fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments.

$23

million of interest costs that were capitalized as part of property, plant and

equipment

, net of accumulated depreciation, in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively

.

﻿

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

﻿

The Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts is determined based on a variety of factors that affect the potential collectability of the related receivables, including length of time receivables are past due, customer credit ratings, financial stability of customers, specific one-time events and past customer history.  In addition, in circumstances where the Company is made aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations, a specific allowance is established.  The majority of accounts are individually evaluated on a regular basis and appropriate reserves are established as deemed appropriate based on the above criteria.

﻿

Environmental Liabilities

﻿

The Company accrues for its environmental investigation, remediation, operating and maintenance costs when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.  For environmental matters, the most likely cost to be incurred is accrued based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site, current laws and regulations and prior remediation experience.  For sites with multiple potentially responsible parties, the Company considers its likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation costs and the ability of the other parties to fulfill obligations in establishing a provision for those costs.  Where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely to occur than another, the minimum amount is accrued.  When future liabilities are determined to be reimbursable by insurance coverage, an accrual is recorded for the potential liability and a receivable is recorded related to the insurance reimbursement when reimbursement is virtually certain.

﻿

The uncertain nature inherent in such remediation and the possibility that initial estimates may not reflect the outcome could result in additional costs being recognized by the Company in future periods.

﻿

Inventories

﻿

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out basis) or market.

﻿

Property, Plant and Equipment, Net of Accumulated Depreciation

﻿

Land, buildings, and equipment, including precious metals, are recorded at cost.  Depreciation is based on estimated useful lives of properties using the straight-line method.  Except as described in Note 7 (Property, Plant and Equipment, Net of Accumulated Depreciation) to the Consolidated Financial Statements related to the depletion of precious metals, the estimated useful lives range from


to


years for buildings and


to


years for equipment.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

﻿

Included in the subcategory of equipment are the following types of assets (excluding precious metals):

﻿

﻿

Manufacturing equipment includes certain components of production equipment that are constructed of precious metals.  These assets are not depreciated because they have very low physical losses and are repeatedly reclaimed and reused in our manufacturing process over a very long useful life.  We treat the physical loss of precious metals in the manufacturing and reclamation process as depletion and account for these losses as a period expense based on actual units lost.  Precious metals are integral to many of our glass production processes.  They are only acquired to support our operations and are not held for trading or other purposes.

﻿

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

﻿

Goodwill is the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination.  Goodwill relates to and is assigned directly to a specific reporting unit.  Reporting units are either operating segments or one level below the operating segment.  Impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level.  Goodwill is reviewed for indicators of impairment quarterly or if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired.  Corning also performs a detailed quantitative impairment test every three years if no indicators suggest a test should be performed in the interim.  We use this calculation as quantitative validation of the qualitative process; this process does not represent an election to perform the quantitative impairment test in place of the qualitative review.

﻿

The qualitative process includes an extensive review of expectations for the long-term growth of our businesses and forecasting future cash flows.  If we are required to perform the quantitative impairment analysis, our valuation method is an “income approach” using a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods, plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon, are discounted to present value using an appropriate rate of return.  Our estimates are based upon our historical experience, our current knowledge from our commercial relationships, and available external information about future trends.  If the fair value is less than the carrying value, a loss is recorded to reflect the difference between the fair value and carrying value.

﻿

Other intangible assets include patents, trademarks, and other intangible assets acquired from an independent party.  Such intangible assets have a definite life and are amortized on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives ranging from


to


years.

﻿

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

﻿

We review the recoverability of our long-lived assets, such as plant and equipment and intangible assets, when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable.  When impairment indicators are present, we compare estimated undiscounted future cash flows, including the eventual disposition of the asset group at market value, to the assets’ carrying value to determine if the asset group is recoverable.  For an asset group that fails the test of recoverability, the estimated fair value of long-lived assets is determined using an “income approach” that starts with the forecast of all the expected future net cash flows including the eventual disposition at market value of long-lived assets, and considers the fair market value of all precious metals.  We assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.  If there is an impairment, a loss is recorded to reflect the difference between the assets’ fair value and carrying value.

﻿

Employee Retirement Plans

﻿

Corning offers employee retirement plans consisting of defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic and international employees and postretirement plans that provide health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retirees and dependents.  The costs and obligations related to these benefits reflect the Company’s assumptions related to general economic conditions (particularly interest rates), expected return on plan assets, rate of compensation increase for employees and health care trend rates.  The cost of providing plan benefits depends on demographic assumptions including retirements, mortality, turnover and plan participation.

﻿

Costs for our defined benefit pension plans consist of two elements:  1) on-going costs recognized quarterly, which are comprised of service and interest costs, expected return on plan assets and amortization of prior service costs; and 2) mark-to-market gains and losses outside of the corridor, where the corridor is equal to

10%

of the greater of the benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets at the beginning of the year, which are recognized annually in the fourth quarter of each year.  These gains and losses result from changes in actuarial assumptions and the differences between actual and expected return on plan assets.  Any interim remeasurements triggered by a curtailment, settlement or significant plan changes, as well as any true-up to the annual valuation, are recognized as a mark-to-market adjustment in the quarter in which such event occurs.

﻿

Costs for our postretirement benefit plans consist of on-going costs recognized quarterly, and are comprised of service and interest costs, amortization of prior service costs and amortization of actuarial gains and losses.  We recognize the actuarial gains and losses resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions as a component of Shareholders’ Equity on our consolidated balance sheets on an annual basis and amortize them into our operating results over the average remaining service period of employees expected to receive benefits under the plans, to the extent such gains and losses are outside of the corridor.

﻿

Refer to Note 11 (Employee Retirement Plans) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.

﻿

Income Taxes

﻿

The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method.  Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and for differences between the carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.

﻿

The effective income tax rate reflects our assessment of the ultimate outcome of tax audits.  In evaluating the tax benefits associated with our various tax filing positions, we record a tax benefit for uncertain tax positions using the highest cumulative tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized.  Adjustments are made to our liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the period in which we determine the issue is effectively settled with the tax authorities, the statute of limitations expires for the return containing the tax position or when new information becomes available.  Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits, including accrued penalties and interest, is included in other accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets and in income tax expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss).

﻿

Discrete events such as audit settlements or changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur.  Valuation allowances are established when management is unable to conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will ultimately be realized.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

﻿

Beginning in 2018, Corning will indefinitely reinvest the foreign earnings of: (1) any of its subsidiaries located in jurisdictions where Corning lacks the ability to repatriate its earnings, (2) any of its subsidiaries where Corning’s intention is to reinvest those earnings in operations, (3) legal entities for which Corning holds a non-controlling interest, (4) any subsidiaries with an accumulated deficit in earnings and profits and (5) any subsidiaries which have a positive earnings and profits balance but for which the entity lacks sufficient local statutory earnings or stock basis from which to make a distribution.

﻿

A company can make a policy election to account for the tax on GILTI as a period cost or to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities when basis differences exist that are expected to affect the amount of GILTI inclusion upon reversal.  Corning has elected to account for the GILTI provisions as a period cost.

﻿

Equity Method Investments

﻿

Our equity method investments are reviewed for impairment on a periodic basis or if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying amount may be impaired.  This assessment is based on a review of the equity investments’ performance and a review of indicators of impairment to determine if there is evidence of a loss in value of an equity investment.  Factors we consider include:

﻿

·

Absence of our ability to recover the carrying amount;

·

Inability of the equity affiliate to sustain an earnings capacity which would justify the carrying amount of the investment; and

·

Significant litigation, bankruptcy or other events that could impact recoverability.

﻿

For an equity investment with impairment indicators, we measure fair value on the basis of discounted cash flows or other appropriate valuation methods, depending on the nature of the company involved.  If it is probable that we will not recover the carrying amount of our investment, the impairment is considered other-than-temporary and recorded in earnings, and the equity investment balance is reduced to its fair value accordingly.  We require our material equity method affiliates to provide audited financial statements.  Consequently, adjustments for asset recoverability are included in equity earnings.  We also utilize these financial statements in our recoverability assessment.

﻿

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

﻿

Major categories of financial assets and liabilities, including short-term investments, other assets and derivatives are measured at fair value on a recurring basis.  Certain assets and liabilities including long-lived assets, goodwill, asset retirement obligations, and cost and equity investments are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.

﻿

Fair value is the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required to be recorded at fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions, and risk of nonperformance.

﻿

Derivative Instruments

﻿

We participate in a variety of foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign exchange option contracts entered into in connection with the management of our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.  We utilize interest rate swaps to reduce the risk of changes in a benchmark interest rate from the probable forecasted issuance of debt and manage the mix of fixed and floating rate debt.  These financial exposures are managed in accordance with corporate policies and procedures.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

﻿

All derivatives are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet.  Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and hedges of net investments in foreign operations are not recognized in current operating results but are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.  Amounts related to cash flow hedges are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income when the underlying hedged item impacts earnings.  This reclassification is recorded in the same line item of the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) as where the effects of the hedged item are recorded, typically sales, cost of sales or other expense, net.  Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) in the Translated earnings contract loss, net and the Other expense, net lines.

﻿

New Accounting Standards

﻿

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which supersedes all existing guidance on accounting for leases in ASC Topic 840.  ASU 2016-02 will continue to classify leases as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the statement of income.  ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  ASU 2016-02 may be applied with a modified retrospective approach with various practical expedients.  The adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have no impact to retained earnings or income.  Upon adoption of ASU 2016-02, we anticipate recording a right-of-use asset and an offsetting lease liability of approximately

$450

million.  Adoption of the new standard is effective January 1, 2019.

﻿

In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income, which allows for reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. ASU 2018-02 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those annual periods.  We have determined that the impact of this standard will not be material.  Adoption of the new standard is effective January 1, 2019.

﻿

2.

Revenue

﻿

On January 1, 2018, we adopted ASC Topic 606 “Revenue from Contracts with Customer”, and all related amendments, using the modified retrospective method applied to those contracts which were not completed as of January 1, 2018.  Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting under ASC Topic 605 “Revenue Recognition”.

﻿

We have determined that the impact of transition to the new standard is immaterial to our revenue recognition model since the majority of our recognition is based on point in time transfer of control.  Accordingly, we have not made any adjustment to opening retained earnings.

﻿

Product Revenue (Point in Time)

﻿

The majority of our revenues are generated by delivery of products to our customers and recognized at a point in time based on our evaluation of when the customer obtains control of the products.  Revenue is recognized when all performance obligations under the terms of a contract with our customer are satisfied, and control of the product has been transferred to the customer.  If customer acceptance clauses are present and it cannot be objectively determined that control has been transferred, revenue is only recorded when customer acceptance is received and all performance obligations have been satisfied.  Sales of goods typically do not include multiple product and/or service elements.

﻿

Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services.  Sales tax, value-added tax, and other taxes we collect concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue.  Incidental contract costs that are not material in the context of the delivery of goods and services are recognized as expense.

2.

Revenue (continued)

﻿

At the time revenue is recognized, allowances are recorded, with the related reduction to revenue, for estimated product returns, allowances and price discounts based upon historical experience and related terms of customer arrangements.  Where we have offered product warranties, we also establish liabilities for estimated warranty costs based upon historical experience and specific warranty provisions.  Warranty liabilities are adjusted when experience indicates the expected outcome will differ from initial estimates of the liability.  Product warranty liabilities were not material at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017.

﻿

Other Revenue (Over Time)

﻿

Corning’s over time revenues are mainly related to Telecommunications products, and are comprised of design, installation, training and software maintenance services.

The performance obligations under these contracts generally require services to be performed over time, resulting in either a straight-line amortization method or an input method using incurred and forecasted expense to predict revenue recognition patterns which follows satisfaction of the performance obligation.  Corning’s other revenue is inconsequential to our results.

﻿

Revenue Disaggregation Table

﻿

The following table shows revenues by major product categories, similar to our reportable segment disclosure.  Within each product category, contract terms, conditions and economic factors affecting the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty around revenue recognition and cash flows are substantially similar.  The commercial markets and selling channels are also similar. Except for an inconsequential number of Telecommunications products, our product category revenues are recognized at point in time when control transfers to the customer.  Prior year amounts are presented under the ASC 605 basis of revenue recognition.

﻿

Our revenues by product category are as follows (in millions):

﻿

﻿

Contract Assets and Liabilities

﻿

Contract assets, such as incremental costs to obtain or fulfill contracts, are an insignificant component of Corning’s revenue recognition process.  The majority of Corning’s cost of fulfillment as a manufacturer of products is classified as inventory, fixed assets and intangible assets, which are accounted for under the respective guidance for those asset types.  Other costs of contract fulfillment are immaterial due to the nature of our products and their respective manufacturing processes.

Revenue (continued)

﻿

Contract liabilities include deferred revenues, other advanced payments and customer deposits.  Deferred revenue and other advanced payments are not significant to our operations and are classified as part of other accrued liabilities in our financial statements.  Customer deposits are predominately related to Display products and are classified as part of other accrued liabilities and other liabilities as appropriate, and are disclosed below.

﻿

Customer Deposits

﻿

As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, Corning had customer deposits of approximately

$1.0

billion and

$0.4

billion, respectively.  The majority of these represent non-refundable cash deposits for customers to secure rights to an amount of glass produced by Corning under long-term supply agreements.  The duration of these long-term supply agreements ranges up to

ten

years.  As glass is shipped to customers, Corning will recognize revenue and issue credit memoranda to reduce the amount of the customer deposit liability, which are applied against customer receivables resulting from the sale of glass.

No

credit memoranda were issued in 2018 and 2017.

Practical Expedients and Exemptions

﻿

We do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed.

﻿

We treat shipping and handling fees as a fulfillment cost and not as a separate performance obligation under the terms of our revenue contracts due to the perfunctory nature of the shipping and handling obligations.

﻿

Significant Customers

﻿

For 2018 and 2017, no customers met or exceeded 10% of Corning’s consolidated net sales.  For 2016, Corning’s sales to Samsung Display Co. Ltd., a customer of our Display Technologies and Specialty Materials segments, represented

11%

of the Company’s consolidated net sales.

Reconciliation of the U.S. statutory income tax rate to our effective tax rate for operations follows:

﻿

﻿

﻿

In December 2017, the U.S. enacted the 2017 Tax Act which resulted in significant changes for our financial results, including, but not limited to, (1) reducing the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate to

21%

, and (2) imposing a one-time toll charge on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies that had not been previously taxed in the U.S.

﻿

The 2017 Tax Act also established new tax provisions affecting our 2018 results, including, but not limited to, (1) creating a new provision

designed to tax GILTI; (2) generally eliminating U.S. federal taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries; (3) eliminating the corporate AMT; (4) creating the BEAT; (5) establishing a deduction for FDII; (6) establishing new limitations on deductible interest expense; and (7) establishing new limitations on deductibility of  certain executive compensation.

Income Taxes (continued)

﻿

Given the significant complexity of the 2017 Tax Act and the lack of clear tax and accounting regulatory guidance for this new law, the Securities Exchange Commission issued SAB 118 to provide registrants additional time to analyze and report the effects of tax reform during the “measurement period.”  Under SAB 118, the registrant was required to record those items where ASC 740 analysis was complete; include reasonable estimates and label them as provisional where ASC 740 analysis was incomplete; and if reasonable estimates could not be made, record items under the previous tax law.  The measurement period, not to exceed one year, ended on the date the entity obtained, prepared, and analyzed the information that was needed to complete the accounting requirements under ASC Topic 740.

For the year ended December 31, 2018, Corning’s results included a worldwide tax provision of

$437

million, inclusive of tax on ongoing operations of

$412

million and the impacts of the 2017 Tax Act of

$25

million.  The impacts of the 2017 Tax Act include: GILTI tax of

$55

million, FDII benefit of

$10

million, and a

$20

million benefit related to truing up the toll charge and our measurement of U.S. deferred taxes, offset by the recording of a provision related to lifting our assertion of indefinite reinvestment on certain foreign earnings.  As of December 31, 2018, Corning has completed its analysis of the impact of the 2017 Tax Act as required by SAB 118.  The GILTI tax of $55 million was largely driven by the receipt of customer deposits.  See Note 2 (Revenue) to these Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.

﻿

In response to the reduction of the U.S. Federal Corporate Tax Rate, the Company re-measured the U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, which is generally 21%.  We recorded a provisional estimate of

$347

million during 2017.  This was adjusted by an immaterial amount upon completion of our analysis for the year ended December 31, 2018.

﻿

We recorded a provisional expense of

$1.1

billion for the Toll Charge at year end 2017 on unrepatriated earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously deferred. This charge was reduced by

$35

million upon completion of our analysis.

﻿

Corning has completed its analysis on the impact of the 2017 Tax Act on its assertion regarding its indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings.  Corning has determined that it will no longer assert indefinite asset reinvestment on

$15.4

billion of unremitted foreign earnings accumulated prior to 2018.  This represents approximately

94%

of Corning’s unremitted foreign earnings as of the end of 2017.  Corning will continue to indefinitely reinvest the remaining

6%

of historic foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017.

﻿

Beginning in 2018, Corning will indefinitely reinvest the foreign earnings of: (1) any of its subsidiaries located in jurisdictions where Corning lacks the ability to repatriate its earnings, (2) any of its subsidiaries where Corning’s intention is to reinvest those earnings in operations, (3) legal entities for which Corning holds a non-controlling interest, (4) any subsidiaries with an accumulated deficit in earnings and profits and (5) any subsidiaries which have a positive earnings and profits balance but for which the entity lacks sufficient local statutory earnings or stock basis from which to make a distribution.

﻿

During 2018, the Company distributed approximately

$4.2

billion from foreign subsidiaries to their respective U.S. parent companies.  There are no incremental taxes beyond the toll charge due with respect to these distributions.  As of December 31, 2018, Corning has approximately

$1.5

billion of

indefinitely

reinvested foreign earnings.  It remains impracticable to calculate the tax cost of repatriating our unremitted earnings which are considered indefinitely reinvested.

﻿

Under new guidance, a company can make a policy election to account for the tax on GILTI as a period cost or to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities when basis differences exist that are expected to affect the amount of GILTI inclusion upon reversal.  Corning’s has elected to account for the GILTI provisions as a period cost.

The net deferred tax assets are classified in our consolidated balance sheets as follows (in millions):

﻿

﻿

﻿

Details on deferred tax assets for loss and tax credit carryforwards at December 31, 2018 follow (in millions):

﻿

﻿

﻿

Deferred tax assets are to be reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available positive and negative evidence, it is more likely than not (a likelihood of greater than 50 percent) that some portion or all deferred tax assets will not be realized.  Corning has valuation allowances on certain shorter-lived deferred tax assets such as those represented by capital loss and state tax net operating loss carryforwards, as well as other foreign net operating loss carryforwards, because we cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that we will earn income of the character required to utilize these assets before they expire.  The change in the other accrued liabilities is largely driven by the payment of certain withholding taxes and reclassification of a portion of our deferred tax liability to deferred tax payable.  Also, during 2018, a benefit was recorded upon the release of valuation allowances on deferred tax that are now considered realizable outside of the U.S.  The amount of U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets that have remaining valuation allowances at December 31, 2018 and 2017 was

$317

million and

$456

million, respectively.

Income Taxes (continued)

﻿

The 2017 Tax Act makes the following key changes to U.S. tax law which will potentially impact Corning’s deferred tax assets. AMT has been eliminated. Net operating losses (“NOL’s”) generated prior to the 2017 Tax Act may still be carried back

two

years and forward


years.  Corning has

$35

million of Federal NOL’s that are subject to these provisions.  The 2017 Tax Act limits and, in some cases, eliminates foreign tax credits. Corning has

$22

million of foreign tax credit carryforwards that may be subject to these restrictions.

﻿

In 2018, we adopted ASU 2016-16, Improvements to Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory.  As a result, cumulative tax benefits totaling

$5

million were recorded as an adjustment to beginning retained earnings.

﻿

The following is a tabular reconciliation of the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits (in millions):

﻿

﻿

﻿

The additions for 2018 were primarily due to a preliminary agreement with the IRS to resolve its 2013-2014 audit.

Included in the balance at December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 are

$263

million,

$97

million and

$92

million, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits that would impact our effective tax rate if recognized.

﻿

We recognize accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of tax expense.  For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 the amount recognized in interest expense and accrued for the payment of interest and penalties were not material.

﻿

It is possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change due to one or more of the following events during the next twelve months: audit activity, tax payments, or final decisions in matters that are the subject of controversy in various jurisdictions within which we operate.  The majority of the potential change relates to our ongoing U.S. tax audit.  We believe we have provided adequate contingent reserves for these matters.  However, if upon conclusion of these matters, the ultimate determination of taxes owed is for an amount materially different than our current reserves, our overall tax expense and effective tax rate could be materially impacted in the period of adjustment.

﻿

Corning Incorporated, as the common parent company, and all

80%

-or-more-owned of its U.S. subsidiaries join in the filing of co

nsolidated U.S. federal income tax returns.  The statute of limitations is closed for all periods ending through December 31, 2012.  All returns for periods ended through December 31, 2004, have been audited by and settled with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

﻿

Corning Incorporated and its U.S. subsidiaries file income tax returns on a combined, unitary or stand-alone basis in multiple state and local jurisdictions, which generally have statutes of limitations ranging from


to


years.  Various state income tax returns are currently in the process of examination or administrative appeal. We do not expect any material proposed adjustments from any of these audits.

﻿

Corning has reached a preliminary agreement with the IRS to resolve its 2013-2014 audit.  This preliminary agreement resulted in

$172

million of additional tax expense in the first quarter of 2018, of which

$12

million relates to interest expense, net of tax benefit.  Corning will use tax attributes to cover most of the tax expense.  We expect to finalize this agreement during 2019.

﻿

CPM is currently appealing certain tax assessments and tax refund claims for tax years 2006 through 2017.  The Company is required to deposit the disputed tax amounts with the South Korean government as a condition of its appeal of any tax assessments.  Because we believe that it is more likely than not that we will prevail in the appeals process, we have recorded a non-current receivable of

$425

HSG and Dow Corning

﻿

On May 31, 2016, Corning completed the strategic realignment of its equity investment in Dow Corning Corporation (”Dow Corning”) pursuant to the Transaction Agreement announced in December 2015.  Under the terms of the Transaction Agreement, Corning exchanged with Dow Corning its

50%

stock interest in Dow Corning for

100%

of the stock of a newly formed entity, which

held

an equity interest in Hemlock Semiconductor Group (“HSG”) and approximately

$4.8

billion in cash.

Investments (continued)

﻿

Prior to realignment, HSG, a consolidated subsidiary of Dow Corning, was an indirect equity investment of Corning.  Upon completion of the exchange, Corning received a direct equity investment in HSG.  Because our ownership percentage in HSG did not change as a result of the realignment, the investment in HSG is recorded at its carrying value, which had a negative carrying value of

$383

million at the transaction date.  The negative carrying value resulted from a one-time charge to this entity in 2014 for the permanent abandonment of certain assets.  Excluding this charge, the entity has been profitable and recovered its equity as of December 31, 2018.  The carrying value of the investment in HSG as of December 31, 2018 was $42 million and recorded in Investments.

﻿

Corning’s financial statements as of December 31, 2016 include the positive impact of the release of a deferred tax liability of

$105

million related to Corning’s tax on Dow Corning’s earnings that were not distributed as of the date of the transaction and a non-taxable gain of

$2,676

million on the realignment.  Details of the gain are illustrated below (in millions):

During 2018, Corning acquired

substantially all of CMD

in

two

cash transactions totaling

$841

million.  On June 1, 2018, Corning acquired a manufacturing facility and certain other assets (collectively referred to as “Purchased Assets”) for

$801

million.  The Purchased Assets constitute a business, which designs, manufactures and markets high bandwidth and optical fiber products.

On December 3, 2018, as part of the acquisition of CMD, Corning acquired

100%

of the German services company for

$40

million.  The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination.

The goodwill recognized is deductible for U.S. income tax purposes.  The goodwill was allocated to the Optical Communications segment.

﻿

Goodwill is related to the value of CMD’s product and customer portfolio and its combination with Corning’s existing optical communications platform, as well as synergies and other intangibles that do not qualify for separate recognition.  Other intangible assets consist primarily of

$434

million of customer relationships and

$91

million of other intangibles that are amortized over

the weighted average useful life of approximately

years, respectively

.  Acquisition-related costs of

$18

million for the year ended December 31, 2018, included costs for legal, accounting, valuation and other professional services and were included in selling, general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.  Supplemental pro forma information was not provided because the Purchased Assets are not material to Corning’s consolidated financial statements.

Employee Retire

ment Plans

﻿

Defined Benefit Plans

﻿

We have defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic and international employees.  Our funding policy has been to contribute, as necessary, an amount in excess of the minimum requirements in order to achieve the Company’s long-term funding targets.  In 2018, we made voluntary cash contributions to our domestic defined benefit pension plan and our international pension plans in the amount of

$105

million and

$12

million, respectively.  In 2017, we made

no

voluntary cash contributions to our domestic defined benefit pension plan and

$29

million to our international pension plans.  During 2019, we anticipate making cash contributions of

$75

million to our U.S. qualified pension plan and

$31

million to our international pension plans.

﻿

Corning offers postretirement plans that provide health care and life insurance benefits for retirees and eligible dependents.  Certain employees may become eligible for such postretirement benefits upon reaching retirement age and service requirements.  For current retirees (including surviving spouses) and active employees eligible for the salaried retiree medical program, we have placed a “cap” on the amount we will contribute toward retiree medical coverage in the future.  The cap is equal to

120%

of our 2005 contributions toward retiree medical benefits.  Once our contributions toward salaried retiree medical costs reach this cap, impacted retirees will have to pay the excess amount in addition to their regular contributions for coverage.  This cap was attained for post-65 retirees in 2008 and attained for pre-65 retirees in 2010.  Furthermore, employees hired or rehired on or after January 1, 2007 will be eligible for Corning retiree medical benefits upon retirement; however, these employees will pay

100%

of the cost.

﻿

Corning uses a hypothetical yield curve and associated spot rate curve to discount the plan’s projected benefit payments.  Once the present value of projected benefit payments is calculated, the suggested discount rate is equal to the level rate that results in the same present value.  The yield curve is based on actual high-quality corporate bonds across the full maturity spectrum, which also includes private placements as well as Eurobonds that are denominated in U.S. currency.  The curve is developed from yields on approximately


-


bonds from four grading sources, Moody’s, S&P, Fitch and the Dominion Bond Rating Service.  A bond will be included if at least half of the grades from these sources are Aa, non-callable bonds.  The very highest

10%

yields and the lowest

40%

yields are excluded from the curve to eliminate outliers in the bond population.

﻿

Mortality is one of the key assumptions used in valuing liabilities of retirement plans.  It is used to assign a probability of payment for future plan benefits that are contingent upon participants’ survival.  To make this assumption, benefit plan sponsors typically use a base mortality table and an improvement scale that adjusts the rates of mortality for future anticipated changes to historical death rates.

﻿

Corning last updated the adjustment factors applied to its base mortality assumption (RP-2014 white collar table and RP-2014 blue collar table for non-union and union participants, respectively) to value its U.S. benefit plan obligations as of December 31, 2017.  In addition, Corning also updated to the MP-2017 projection scale

for the year ended 2017

.  As the Society of Actuaries publishes additional mortality improvement scales (MP-2018), Corning has considered these revised improvement scales in setting its future mortality improvement assumption.  As of December 31, 2018, Corning decided to continue application of its future improvement scale to the MP-2017 scale.

﻿

Furthermore, Corning updated for

the year ended

2017 the mortality assumption applied to disabled participants to be the RP-2014 disabled mortality base table with future improvements using MP-2017.  These assumptions were unchanged for

Plan Assets

The Company’s primary objective is to ensure the plan has sufficient return on assets to fund the plan’s current and future obligations as they become due.  Investments are made in public securities to ensure adequate liquidity to support benefit payments.  Domestic and international stocks and bonds provide diversification to the portfolio.  The target allocation range for global equity investment is

20%-25%

which includes large, mid and small cap companies and investments in both developed and emerging markets.  The target allocation for bond investments is

60%

, which predominately includes corporate bonds.  Long duration fixed income assets are utilized to mitigate the sensitivity of funding ratios to changes in interest rates.  The target allocation range for non-public investments in private equity and real estate is

5%-15%

, and is used to enhance returns and offer additional asset diversification.  The target allocation range for commodities is

0%-5%

We are required, at the time a guarantee is issued, to recognize a liability for the fair value or market value of the obligation it assumes.  In the normal course of our business, we do not routinely provide significant third-party guarantees.  Generally, third-party guarantees provided by Corning are limited to certain financial guarantees, including stand-by letters of credit and performance bonds, and the incurrence of contingent liabilities in the form of purchase price adjustments related to attainment of milestones.  These guarantees have various terms, and none of these guarantees are individually significant.

Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees (continued)

﻿

The ability of certain subsidiaries and affiliated companies to transfer funds is limited by provisions of foreign government regulations, affiliate agreements and certain loan agreements.  At December 31, 2018, the amount of equity subject to such restrictions for consolidated subsidiaries and affiliated companies was not significant.  While this amount is legally restricted, it does not result in operational difficulties since we have generally permitted subsidiaries to retain a majority of equity to support growth programs.

﻿

Corning is a defendant in various lawsuits and is subject to various claims that arise in the normal course of business, the most significant of which are summarized below.  In the opinion of management, the likelihood that the ultimate disposition of these matters will have a material adverse effect on Corning’s consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of operations, is remote.

﻿

Asbestos Claims

﻿

Corning and PPG Industries, Inc. each owned

50%

of the capital stock of Pittsburgh Corning Corporation (“PCC”).  PCC filed for Chapter 11 reorganization in 2000 and the Modified Third Amended Plan of Reorganization for PCC (the “Plan”) became effective in April 2016.  At December 31, 2016, the Company’s liability under the Plan was

$290

million, which is required to be paid through a series of fixed payments beginning in the second quarter of 2017.  Payments of

$35

million and

$70

million were made in June 2018 and June 2017, respectively.  At December 31, 2018, the total amount of payments due in years 2019 through 2022 is

$185

million, of which

$50

million is due in the second quarter of 2019 and is classified as a current liability.  The remaining

$


million is classified as a non-current liability.

Corning is a defendant in certain cases alleging injuries from asbestos unrelated to PCC (the “non-PCC asbestos claims”) which had been stayed pending the confirmation of the Plan.  The stay was lifted on August 25, 2016.  At December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the amount of the reserve for these non-PCC asbestos claims was estimated to be

$146

million and

$14


million, respectively.  The reserve balance as of December 31, 2018 represents the undiscounted projection of claims and related legal fees for the estimated life of the litigation.

Dow Corning Chapter 11 Related Matters

﻿

Until June 1, 2016, Corning and The Dow Chemical Company (“Dow”) each owned

50%

of the common stock of Dow Corning Corporation (“Dow Corning”).  On May 31, 2016, Corning and Dow realigned their ownership interest in Dow Corning.  In connection with the realignment, Corning retained its indirect ownership interest in the Hemlock Semiconductor Group (HSG) and

formed a new entity

which had been capitalized by Dow Corning with

$4.8

billion.  Following the realignment, Corning no longer owned any interest in Dow Corning.  In connection with the realignment, Corning agreed to indemnify Dow Corning for 50% of Dow Corning’s non-ordinary course, pre-closing liabilities to the extent such liabilities exceed the amounts reserved for them by Dow Corning as of May 31, 2016, including two legacy Dow Corning matters: the Dow Corning Breast Implant Litigation, and the Dow Corning Bankruptcy Pendency Interest Claims.

﻿

Dow Corning Breast Implant Litigation

﻿

In May 1995, Dow Corning filed for bankruptcy protection to address pending and claimed liabilities arising from many thousands of breast implant product lawsuits.  On June 1, 2004, Dow Corning emerged from Chapter 11 with a Plan of Reorganization (the “Plan”) which provided for the settlement or other resolution of implant claims.  The Plan also includes releases for Corning and Dow as shareholders in exchange for contributions to the Plan.

Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees (continued)

﻿

Under the terms of the Plan, Dow Corning has established and funded a Settlement Trust and a Litigation Facility, referred to above, to provide a means for tort claimants to settle or litigate their claims.  Inclusive of insurance, Dow Corning has paid approximately

$1.8

billion to the Settlement Trust.  As of May 31, 2016, Dow Corning had recorded a reserve for breast implant litigation of

$290

million.  In the event Dow Corning’s total liability for these claims exceeds such amount, Corning may be required to indemnify Dow Corning for up to

50%

of the excess liability.  At December 31, 2018, Dow Corning had recorded a reserve for breast implant litigation of

$263

million.

﻿

Dow Corning Bankruptcy Pendency Interest Claims

﻿

As a separate matter arising from the bankruptcy proceedings, Dow Corning is defending claims asserted by a number of commercial creditors who claim additional compounded interest at default and state statutory judgment rates as well as attorneys’ fees and other enforcement costs, during the period from May 1995 through June 2004.  As of May 31, 2016, Dow Corning had recorded a reserve for these claims of

$107

million.  In the event Dow Corning’s liability for these claims exceeds such amount, Corning may be required to indemnify Dow Corning for up to 50% of the excess liability, subject to certain conditions and limits.  At December 31, 2018, Dow Corning estimated the liability to commercial creditors to be

$82

million

.

﻿

Environmental Litigation

﻿

Corning has been named by the Environmental Protection Agency (the Agency) under the Superfund Act, or by state governments under similar state laws, as a potentially responsible party for


active hazardous waste sites.  Under the Superfund Act, all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site, identified by the Agency, are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the Agency agrees otherwise.  It is Corning’s policy to accrue for its estimated liability related to Superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned by Corning based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants.  At December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, Corning had accrued approximately

$30

million (undiscounted) and

$38

million (undiscounted), respectively, for the estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation.  Based upon the information developed to date, management believes that the accrued reserve is a reasonable estimate of the Company’s liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote.

Hedging Activi

ties

﻿

Corning is exposed to interest rate and foreign currency risks due to the movement of these rates.

﻿

The areas in which exchange rate fluctuations affect us include:

﻿

·

Financial instruments and transactions denominated in foreign currencies, which impact earnings; and

·

The translation of net assets in foreign subsidiaries for which the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, which impacts our net equity.

﻿

Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the Japanese yen, South Korean won, New Taiwan dollar, Chinese yuan, the euro and British pound.  We seek to mitigate the impact of exchange rate movements in our income statement by using over-the-counter (OTC) derivative instruments including foreign exchange forward and option contracts.  In general, these hedge expirations coincide with the timing of the underlying foreign currency commitments and transactions.

﻿

We are exposed to potential losses in the event of non-performance by our counterparties to these derivative contracts.  However, we minimize this risk by maintaining our portfolio with a diverse group of highly-rated major financial institutions.  We do not expect to record any losses as a result of such counterparty default.  Neither we nor our counterparties are required to post collateral for these financial instruments.  The Company qualified for and elected the end-user exception to the mandatory swap clearing requirement of the Dodd-Frank Act.

Hedging Activities (continued)

﻿

Cash Flow Hedges

Our cash flow hedging activities utilize OTC foreign exchange forward contracts and options to reduce the risk that movements in exchange rates will adversely affect the net cash flows resulting from the sale of products to customers and purchases from suppliers.  Our cash flow hedging activity also uses interest rate derivatives including Treasury rate lock agreements to reduce the risk of increases in benchmark interest rates on the probable issuance of debt.  In the

second

quarter of 201


, the Company entered into

Treasury rate lock

agreements to hedge against the variability in cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate related to an anticipated debt issuance.  The instruments were designated as cash flow hedges

, and were settled on October 31, 2018 concurrent with the debt issuance.  The settlement amount of

$16

million received will be released from other comprehensive income into earnings when the corresponding interest expense occurs each period.

﻿

Corning uses a regression analysis to monitor the effectiveness of its cash flow hedges both prospectively and retrospectively.  Through December 31, 2018, the hedge ineffectiveness related to these instruments was not material.  Corning defers net gains and losses related to the effective portion of cash flow hedges into accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheet until the hedged item impacts earnings.  At December 31, 2018, the amount expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months is a pre-tax net gain of

$2

million.

﻿

Fair Value Hedges

In October of 2012, we entered into

two

interest rate swaps that are designated as fair value hedges and economically exchange a notional amount of

$550

million of previously issued fixed rate long-term debt to floating rate debt.  Under the terms of the swap agreements, we pay the counterparty a floating rate that is indexed to the one-month LIBOR rate.

In the fourth quarter of 2018, Corning unwound the two interest rate swaps and discontinued the fair value hedge relationship accordingly.  The net losses recorded in current period earnings were not material in the Consolidated Statements of

Income

(Loss)

.

﻿

Corning utilizes the long haul method for effectiveness analysis, both retrospectively and prospectively.  The analysis excludes the impact of credit risk from the assessment of hedge effectiveness.  The amount recorded in curren

t period earnings is in other e

xpense

, net

, relative to ineffectiveness,

and

is not material for the year ended December 31, 2018.

﻿

Net gains and losses from fair value hedges and the effects of the corresponding hedged item are recorded on the same line item in the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss).

﻿

Undesignated Hedges

Corning also uses OTC foreign exchange forward and option contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes.  The undesignated hedges limit exposures to foreign functional currency fluctuations related to certain subsidiaries’ monetary assets, monetary liabilities and net earnings in foreign currencies.

﻿

A significant portion of the Company’s non-U.S. revenues and expenses are denominated in Japanese yen, South Korean won, New Taiwan dollar, Chinese yuan and euro.  When these revenues and expenses are translated back to U.S. dollars, the Company is exposed to foreign exchange rate movements.  To protect translated earnings against movements in these currencies, the Company has entered into a series of average rate forwards and other derivative instruments.

﻿

Index

13.

Hedging Activities (continued)

﻿

The Company continued its foreign exchange hedge program in 2018 and entered into a series of average rate forwards, and purchased put or call options.  These will hedge a significant portion of its projected yen exposure for the period of 2019-2022.  As of December 31, 2018, the U.S. dollar gross notional value of the yen average rate forwards program is

$9.1

billion and

$2.6

billion for zero-cost collars and purchased put or call options.  The average rate forward program was also expanded to partially hedge the impact of the South Korean won, Chinese yuan, euro and British pound translation on the Company’s projected net income.  As of December 31, 2018, these average rate forwards have a total notional value of

$2.0

billion.  The entire average rate forward program will settle net without obligation to deliver Japanese yen, Korean won, Chinese yuan, euro

and British pound

.

With respect to the zero-cost collars, the gross notional amount includes the value of both put and call options.  However, due to the nature of the zero-cost collars, only the put or the call option can be exercised at maturity.

﻿

The fair values of these derivative contracts are recorded as either assets (gain position) or liabilities (loss position) on the Consolidated Balance Sheet

s

.  Changes in the fair value of the derivative contracts are recorded currently in earnings in the Transl

ated earnings contract

loss, net line of the Consolidated Statement of Income (Loss).

Fair Value Meas

urements

﻿

Fair value standards under U.S. GAAP define fair value, establish a framework for measuring fair value in applying generally accepted accounting principles, and require disclosures about fair value measurements.  The standards also identify two kinds of inputs that are used to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities: observable and unobservable.  Observable inputs are based on market data or independent sources while unobservable inputs are based on the Company’s own market assumptions.  Once inputs have been characterized, the inputs are prioritized into one of three broad levels (provided in the table below) used to measure fair value.  Fair value standards apply whenever an entity is measuring fair value under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurement and require the use of observable market data when available.

Fair Value Measurements (continued)

﻿

The following tables provide fair value measurement information for the Company’s major categories of financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis:

﻿

﻿

(1)

Derivative assets and liabilities include foreign exchange contracts which are measured using observable inputs for similar assets and liabilities.

(2)

One of the Company’s equity securities was measured using unobservable (Level 3) inputs, in the amount of $16 million.

(3)

Other liabilities include contingent consideration that was measured using unobservable (Level 3) inputs, in the amount of $20 million.

﻿

﻿

﻿

(1)

Derivative

assets

and

liabilities include foreign exchange contracts which are measured using observable quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities.

(2)

At December 31, 2017, other current assets, other accrued liabilities and other liabilities include contingent consideration that was measured using unobservable (level 3) inp

uts, in the amounts of $300 million, $2 million and $20 million, respectively.

﻿

﻿

As a result of the acquisition of Samsung Corning Precision Materials in January 2014, the Company had contingent consideration that was measured using unobservable (Level 3) inputs in an option pricing model.  The fair value of the contingent consideration was calculated to be

$


million as of December 31, 2017.  This amount was settled in cash and received in June 2018.

assets

and liabilities measured on a nonrecurring basis during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.

Fixed Rate Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, Series A

﻿

On January 15, 2014, Corning designated a new series of its preferred stock as Fixed Rate Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, Series A, par value

$100

per share, and issued

1,900

shares of preferred stock at an issue price of

$1

million per share, for an aggregate issue price of

$1.9

billion, to Samsung Display with the acquisition of its equity interest in Samsung Corning Precision Materials. Corning also issued to Samsung Display an additional amount of preferred stock at closing, for an aggregate issue price of

$400

million in cash.

﻿

Dividends on the preferred stock are cumulative and accrue at the annual rate of

4.25%

on the per share issue price of $1 million. The dividends are payable quarterly as and when declared by the Company’s Board of Directors. The preferred stock ranks senior to our common stock with respect to payment of dividends and rights upon liquidation. The preferred stock is not redeemable except in the case of a certain deemed liquidation event, the occurrence of which is under the control of the Company. The preferred stock is convertible at the option of the holder and the Company upon certain events, at a conversion rate of

50,000

shares of Corning’s common stock per one share of preferred stock, subject to certain anti-dilution provisions. As of December 31, 2018, the preferred stock has not been converted, and none of the anti-dilution provisions have been triggered. Following the seventh anniversary of the closing of the acquisition of Samsung Corning Precision Materials, the preferred stock will be convertible, in whole or in part, at the option of the holder. The Company has the right, at its option, to cause some or all the shares of preferred stock to be converted into common stock, if, for


trading days (whether or not consecutive) within any period of


consecutive trading days, the closing price of common stock exceeds

$35

per share. If the right becomes exercisable before the seventh anniversary of the closing, the Company must first obtain the written approval of the holders of a majority of the preferred stock before exercising its conversion right. The preferred stock does not have any voting rights except as may be required by law.

Share Repurchases

﻿

2016 Share Repurchases

In July 2016, Corning entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (the “2016 ASR agreement”) under the 2015 Repurchase Program to repurchase Corning’s common stock.  Under the 2016 ASR agreement, Corning made a

$2.0

billion payment in July and received an initial delivery of approximately

74.4

million shares of Corning common stock on the same day.  The transaction was structured with two tranches resulting in a total of

12.3

million shares being delivered to Corning in the fourth quarter of 2016, for a total of

86.7

million shares repurchased under the 2016 ASR agreement.

Effective beginning in the first quarter of 2018, the Company has changed its measurement of segment sales and segment net income, and has recast prior periods presented based on the new methodology.  Included in this new measurement is a change in our segment tax rate to

21%

to better reflect the new corporate tax rate under the 2017 Tax Act.  Additionally, the impact of changes in the Japanese yen, Korean won, Chinese yuan and New Taiwan dollar will be excluded from segment sales and segment net income for the Display Technologies and Specialty Materials segments, and certain income and expenses that were previously allocated to our segments are now included in the unallocated amounts in the reconciliation of reportable segment net income to consolidated net income.  These include items that are not used by our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) in evaluating the results of or in allocating resources to our segments and include the following items:  the impact of our translated earnings contracts; acquisition-related costs; discrete tax items and other tax-related adjustments; litigation, regulatory and other legal matters; restructuring, impairment and other charges; adjustments relating to acquisitions; and other non-recurring non-operational items.  Although we exclude these amounts from segment results, they are included in reported consolidated results.

﻿

We prepared the financial results for our reportable segments on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information to assist in making internal operating decisions.  We included the earnings of equity affiliates that are closely associated with our reportable segments in the respective segment’s net income.  We have allocated certain common expenses among reportable segments differently than we would for stand-alone financial information.  Segment net income may not be consistent with measures used by other companies.  The accounting policies of our reportable segments are the same as those applied in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
