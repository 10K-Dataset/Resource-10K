Item 1.  Business
- -----------------

General

Corning traces its origins to a glass business  established in 1851. The present
corporation was  incorporated in the State of New York in December 1936, and its
name was changed from Corning Glass Works to Corning  Incorporated  on April 28,
1989.

Corning  is  a  global,  technology-based  corporation  that  operates  in  four
reportable   business  segments:   Display   Technologies,   Telecommunications,
Environmental Technologies and Life Sciences.

Display Technologies Segment

Corning's Display  Technologies segment manufactures glass substrates for active
matrix liquid  crystal  displays  (LCDs),  which are used  primarily in notebook
computers,   flat  panel  desktop  monitors,  and  LCD  televisions.   Corning's
facilities in Kentucky,  Japan and Taiwan and those of Samsung Corning Precision
Glass Co., Ltd.  (Samsung Corning  Precision,  which is 50% owned by Corning) in
South Korea develop,  manufacture and supply high quality glass substrates using
a proprietary fusion manufacturing process and technology expertise.  Affiliates
of Samsung  Electronics  Co.,  Ltd.  own the  remaining  50% interest in Samsung
Corning Precision,  which sells glass to LCD panel manufacturers in Korea. Panel
manufacturers  in the other  leading  LCD-producing  areas of the world,  Japan,
Taiwan, Singapore and China, are supplied by Corning.

Corning has consistently been a leader to market with new large-generation sized
substrates  used by our customers in the  production of larger LCDs for monitors
and  television.  The  company  continues  to be one of the first  with  product
innovations  that  help our  customers  produce  larger,  lighter,  thinner  and
higher-resolution  displays  more  affordably.  Glass  substrates  are currently
available in sizes up to  Generation  6, and  Generation 7 was  introduced  from
Samsung Corning Precision in January 2005. Large generation substrates allow LCD
manufacturers  to  produce  larger  and a greater  number  of  panels  from each
substrate.  This  leads to  economies  of  scale  for LCD  manufacturers  and is
expected to help lower display prices for consumers in the future. At the end of
2004, approximately 60% of Corning and Samsung Corning Precision's volume of LCD
glass was Generation 5 and higher.

Corning's  proprietary fusion manufacturing process was invented by the company.
It is the  cornerstone of Corning's  technology  leadership in the LCD industry.
The  automated  process  yields high quality  glass  substrates  with  excellent
dimensional  stability and uniformity - essential  attributes for the production
of increasingly  larger,  high performance active matrix LCDs.  Corning's fusion
process is scalable and has proven to be among the most  effective  processes in
producing large size substrates.

LCD  glass  manufacturing  is  a  highly  capital  intensive  business.  Corning
continues to make  significant  investments to expand its liquid crystal display
glass facilities in response to anticipated  customer demand. The environment is
very   competitive   and  important   success   attributes   include   efficient
manufacturing, access to capital, technology know-how, and patents.

Patent  protection and proprietary  trade secrets are important to the segment's
operations.  The  segment  has a growing  portfolio  of patents  relating to its
products,  technologies and  manufacturing  processes.  Reference is made to the
material under the heading "Patents and Trademarks" for information  relating to
patents and trademarks.

The Display Technologies segment represented 29% of Corning's sales for 2004.





Telecommunications Segment

The  Telecommunications  segment  produces optical fiber and cable, and hardware
and equipment products for the worldwide  telecommunications  industry.  Corning
invented the world's  first  low-loss  optical  fiber more than 30 years ago. It
offers a range of optical  fiber  technology  products  and  enhancements  for a
variety  of  applications,  including  premises,  fiber-to-the-premises  access,
metropolitan,   long-haul  and  submarine  networks.  Corning  makes  and  sells
InfiniCor(R)  fibers for local area networks,  data centers and central offices;
NexCor(TM) fiber for converged services networks; SMF-28e(R) single mode optical
fiber that provides  additional  transmission  wavelengths in  metropolitan  and
access networks;  MetroCor(R) fiber products for metropolitan networks;  LEAF(R)
optical fiber for long-haul,  regional and metropolitan networks; and Vascade(R)
submarine  optical  fibers for use in undersea  networks.  Corning has two large
optical  fiber  manufacturing  facilities  in  North  Carolina,  as  well  as  a
controlling interest in Shanghai Fiber Optics Co., Ltd. in China. As a result of
lowered  demand for optical  fiber  products,  in 2002  Corning  mothballed  its
optical fiber manufacturing  facility in Concord, North Carolina and transferred
certain  capabilities  to  its  Wilmington,  North  Carolina  facility.  Corning
believes that the Concord facility can be returned to productive capacity within
six to nine months of a decision to reopen.

A significant portion of Corning's optical fiber is sold to subsidiaries such as
CCS Holdings,  Inc. (Corning Cable Systems),  Corning Cable Systems  Verwaltungs
GmbH,  and  Norddeutsche  Seekabelwerke  GmbH & Co., KG (NSW) or to cable equity
ventures such as Chengdu CCS Optical Fiber Cable Co. in China.  Optical fiber is
cabled prior to being sold in cable form. The remaining fiber production is sold
directly to end users or third party cablers around the world. Corning's cabling
operations  include large  facilities in North  Carolina and Germany and smaller
regional locations or equity affiliates, including those listed above.

Corning's hardware and equipment products include cable assemblies,  fiber optic
hardware, fiber optic connectors,  optical components and couplers, closures and
pedestals,   splice  and  test  equipment  and  other  accessories  for  optical
connectivity.  For copper  connectivity,  Corning's  products include subscriber
demarcation,  connection and protection devices,  xDSL (different  variations of
DSL) passive solutions and outside plant  enclosures.  Each of the product lines
may be  combined  in  Corning's  fiber-to-the-premises  solutions.  Corning  has
manufacturing  operations for hardware and equipment  products in North Carolina
and Texas, as well as Europe, Mexico, China, and the Caribbean.  Corning Gilbert
Inc.  offers  products  for the cable  television  industry,  including  coaxial
connectors and associated tools.  Corning Gilbert has  manufacturing  operations
for coaxial  connectors  and associated  assembly  tools in Arizona,  Mexico and
Denmark.

Patent protection is important to the segment's  operations.  The segment has an
extensive  portfolio  of patents  relating  to its  products,  technologies  and
manufacturing  processes.  The segment  licenses certain of its patents to third
parties and generates  revenue from these licenses,  but such royalty revenue is
not currently material to the business.  Corning is also licensed to use certain
patents owned by others,  and such licenses are also  important to the segment's
operations.  Reference  is made to the material  under the heading  "Patents and
Trademarks" for information relating to the company's patents and trademarks.

The Telecommunications segment represented 40% of Corning's sales for 2004.

Environmental Technologies Segment

Corning's  environmental products include ceramic technologies and solutions for
emissions and pollution control in mobile and stationary applications around the
world,   including  gasoline  and  diesel  substrate  and  filter  products.  As
regulations and laws on emission controls standards have tightened over time and
additional countries have instituted  requirements related to clean air, Corning
has continued to develop more  efficient  emission-control  catalytic  converter
substrate  products  with  higher  density  and greater  surface  area.  Corning
manufactures  these  products in New York,  Virginia,  China,  Germany and South
Africa.  Cormetech Inc., 50% owned by Corning and 50% owned by Mitsubishi  Heavy
Industries Ltd. of Japan,  manufactures ceramic environmental substrate products
at its North Carolina and Tennessee facilities for use in power plants.  Corning
is  investing  in new  ceramic  substrate  and  filter  technologies  for diesel
emission control device products,  with a new production facility in New York to
produce such products for diesel vehicles  worldwide.  Corning sells its ceramic
substrate and filter products  worldwide to  manufacturers  of emission  control
systems who then sell to automotive  and diesel engine  manufacturers.  Although
our sales are to the emission control systems manufacturers,  the use of Corning
substrates  and  filters is  generally  required  by the  specifications  of the
automotive and diesel engine manufacturers.

Patent protection is important to the segment's  operations.  The segment has an
extensive  portfolio  of patents  relating  to its  products,  technologies  and
manufacturing  processes.  The segment is also  licensed to use certain  patents
owned  by  others,  and  such  licenses  are  also  important  to the  segment's
operations.  Reference  is made to the material  under the heading  "Patents and
Trademarks" for information relating to the company's patents and trademarks.

The Environmental  Technologies  segment  represented 14% of Corning's sales for
2004.






Life Sciences Segment

Life Sciences  laboratory products include microplate  products,  coated slides,
filter  plates for genomics  sample  preparation,  plastic cell culture  dishes,
flasks,  cryogenic vials,  roller bottles,  mass cell culture  products,  liquid
handling instruments,  Pyrex(R) glass beakers, pipettors,  serological pipettes,
centrifuge  tubes and  laboratory  filtration  products.  Corning sells products
under 3 primary brands:  Corning,  Costar and Pyrex.  Corning manufactures these
products in Maine,  New York,  England and Mexico and  markets  them  worldwide,
primarily  through  distributors,  to government  entities,  pharmaceutical  and
biotechnology companies, hospitals, universities and other research facilities.

Patent  protection is important to the segment's  operations,  particularly  for
some of its emerging  products.  The segment has a growing  portfolio of patents
relating  to its  products,  technologies  and  manufacturing  processes.  Brand
recognition,  through  some well known  trademarks  is important to the segment.
Reference is made to the material under the heading "Patents and Trademarks" for
information relating to the company's patents and trademarks.

The Life Sciences  segment  represented  approximately 8% of Corning's sales for
2004.

Other Products

Other products made by Corning include  semiconductor  optics,  ophthalmic glass
and plastic products,  technical  products,  such as polarizing glass, glass for
high   temperature   applications   and  machinable   glass  ceramic   products.
Semiconductor optics manufactured by Corning include:  high-performance  optical
material products;  optical-based metrology instruments;  and optical assemblies
for applications in the global semiconductor  industry.  Corning's semiconductor
optics  products are  manufactured  in New York.  Other specialty glass products
include glass lens and window  components and assemblies.  Other specialty glass
products are made in New York, Virginia,  England and France. Corning's Eurokera
and  Keraglass  equity  ventures  with  Saint  Gobain  Vitrage  S.A.  of  France
manufacture  smooth  cooktop  glass/ceramic  products  in  France  and in  South
Carolina.

Corning's conventional glass television business previously included a 51% owned
affiliate,  Corning  Asahi Video  Products  Company  (CAV),  a producer of glass
panels and funnels for cathode ray television tubes in Pennsylvania  that ceased
production in the second quarter of 2003. Corning owns a 50% interest in Samsung
Corning Company,  Ltd. (Samsung Corning), a producer of glass panels and funnels
for cathode ray tubes for televisions and computer monitors,  with manufacturing
facilities in Korea, Germany,  China and Malaysia.  Samsung Electronics Company,
Ltd. owns the remaining 50% interest in Samsung Corning.

Other products represented approximately 9% of Corning's sales for 2004.

We manufacture and process products at more than 45 plants and 15 countries.

Additional  explanation  regarding Corning and our four segments is presented in
Management's  Discussion  and Analysis of Financial  Condition  under  Operating
Review  and  Results  of  Operations  and Note 18  (Operating  Segments)  to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Corporate Investments

Corning and The Dow Chemical Company (Dow Chemical) each own half of Dow Corning
Corporation  (Dow  Corning),  an equity  company in Michigan  that  manufactures
silicone products worldwide.  Dow Corning emerged from its Chapter 11 bankruptcy
proceedings  during 2004.  Dow  Corning's  sales  exceeded $3.3 billion in 2004.
Additional  discussion  about  this  company  appears  in the Legal  Proceedings
section.






Corning and PPG Industries, Inc. each own half of Pittsburgh Corning Corporation
(PCC), an equity company in Pennsylvania  that  manufactures  glass products for
architectural   and  industrial  uses.  PCC  filed  for  Chapter  11  bankruptcy
reorganization  in April 2000.  Additional  discussion  about PCC appears in the
Legal Proceedings  section.  Corning also owns half of Pittsburgh Corning Europe
N.V., a Belgian corporation that manufactures glass products for industrial uses
primarily in Europe.

Competition

Corning  competes  across  all of its  product  lines with many large and varied
manufacturers,  both domestic and foreign.  Some of these competitors are larger
than Corning,  and some have broader product lines.  Corning strives to maintain
its position through technology and product innovation.  For the future, Corning
believes  its  competitive  advantage  lies in its  commitment  to research  and
development,  and its commitment to quality.  There is no assurance that Corning
will be able to maintain its market position or competitive advantage.

Display Technologies Segment

Corning is the largest worldwide  producer of glass substrates for active matrix
LCD displays.  That market  position  remained  relatively  stable over the past
year.  Corning  believes it has  competitive  advantages in LCD glass  substrate
products by  investing  in new  technologies,  offering a  consistent  source of
reliable supply and using its proprietary  fusion  manufacturing  process.  This
competitive  advantage  allows us to deliver  glass that is larger,  thinner and
lighter with exceptional surface quality. Asahi Glass, Nippon Electric Glass and
NH Techno are Corning's  principal  competitors in display glass substrates.  In
addition, new entrants are seeking to expand their presence in this business.

Telecommunications Segment

Competition  within the  telecommunications  equipment industry is intense among
several significant companies.  Corning is a leading competitor in the segment's
principal  product  lines.  Price and new product  innovations  are  significant
competitive factors. The continued downturn in the telecommunications  industry,
particularly in Europe and North America, has changed the competitive  landscape
by increasing  competition based upon pricing.  These competitive conditions are
likely to persist.

Corning is the largest  producer of optical fiber and cable products,  but faces
significant  competition  due to continued  excess capacity in the market place,
price  pressure  and  new  product  innovations.   Corning  obtained  the  first
significant  optical  fiber  patents and believes its large scale  manufacturing
experience,  fiber  process,  technology  leadership and  intellectual  property
assets yield cost advantages relative to several of its competitors. The primary
competing  producers  of optical  fiber  products are  Furukawa  OFS,  Fujikura,
Sumitomo,   Pirelli  and  Draka  Comteq.   Furukawa  OFS  is  Corning's  largest
competitor. For optical fiber cable products,  Corning's primary competitors are
Furukawa OFS, Pirelli, Draka Comteq, Alcoa Fujikura and Sumitomo.

For hardware and  equipment  products,  significant  competitors  are 3M Company
(3M), Tyco Electronics, Furukawa OFS, CommScope, and ADC Communications.

Environmental Technologies Segment

For  worldwide  automotive  ceramic  substrate  products,  Corning has a leading
market position that has remained  relatively stable over the past year. Corning
believes its competitive  advantage in automotive ceramic substrate products for
catalytic   converters  is  based  upon  global  presence,   customer   service,
engineering  design  services and product  innovation.  The heavy duty and light
duty  diesel  vehicle  market   opportunities  are  still  emerging.   Corning's
Environmental  Technologies products face principal competition from NGK, Denso,
Ibiden and Emitec.

Life Sciences Segment

Corning is a leading supplier of glass and plastic science laboratory  products,
with a growing  plastics  products  market presence in North America and Europe,
and a relatively  stable  laboratory glass products market presence during 2004.
Corning seeks to maintain competitive  advantages relative to its competitors by
emphasizing product quality,  product availability,  supply chain efficiency,  a
wide product line and superior  product  attributes.  For  laboratory  products,
Schott  Glaswerke,  Kimble,  Greiner  and  Becton  Dickinson  are the  principal
worldwide  competitors.  Corning also faces increasing  competition from certain
distributors that have backward integrated or introduced private label products.






Other Products

Corning is a leading  supplier of materials and products for lithography  optics
in the  semiconductor  industry  and that market  position  remained  relatively
stable  during the past year.  Corning  seeks to compete by  providing  superior
optical quality, leading optical designs and a local Corning presence supporting
its customers.  For Corning's  semiconductor optical material products,  general
specialty   glass/glass  ceramic  products  and  ophthalmic   products,   Schott
Glaswerke, Shin-Etsu Quartz Products, Hoya and Hereaus are the main competitors.

Samsung  Corning is the third  largest  worldwide  producer  of cathode ray tube
glass products for conventional  televisions.  Its relative competitive position
has remained  stable over the past year,  although there has been a shift in the
industry  as  end-market  customers  have  turned  to  flat  panel  displays  or
projection  technologies.  Samsung  Corning  seeks to maintain  its  competitive
advantage  through  customer  support,  logistics  expertise  and a  lower  cost
manufacturing  structure.  Nippon Electric Glass, Asahi, and various other Asian
manufacturers compete with Samsung Corning.

Raw Materials

Corning's  production  of  specialty  glasses  and  related  materials  requires
significant quantities of energy and batch materials.

Although energy shortages have not been a problem  recently,  the cost of energy
has increased.  Corning has achieved  flexibility through important  engineering
changes to take advantage of the lowest-cost  energy source in most  significant
processes. Specifically, many of Corning's principal manufacturing processes can
now be operated with natural gas, propane, oil or electricity,  or a combination
of these energy sources.

As to resources (ores, minerals,  polymers, and processed chemicals) required in
manufacturing  operations,   availability  appears  to  be  adequate.  Corning's
suppliers  from time to time may  experience  capacity  limitations in their own
operations,  or may  eliminate  certain  product  lines;  nevertheless,  Corning
believes it has adequate programs to ensure a reliable supply of batch chemicals
and raw materials.  For many products,  Corning has alternate glass compositions
that would allow  operations to continue  without  interruption  in the event of
specific materials shortages.

Certain key materials used in the  manufacturing  of products are currently sole
sourced  or  available  only from a  limited  number of  suppliers.  Any  future
difficulty  in obtaining  sufficient  and timely  delivery of  components  could
result in delays or reductions in product  shipments,  or reduce Corning's gross
margins.

Patents and Trademarks

Inventions by members of Corning's research and engineering staff have been, and
continue to be, important to the Company's growth.  Patents have been granted on
many of these inventions in the United States (U.S.) and other  countries.  Some
of these patents have been licensed to other manufacturers,  including companies
in which Corning has equity  investments.  Many of the earlier  patents have now
expired,  but Corning continues to seek and obtain patents  protecting its newer
innovations.  In 2004, Corning was granted over 300 patents in the U.S. and over
300 patents in countries outside the U.S.

Each business  segment  possesses its own patent portfolio that provides certain
competitive  advantages  in  protecting  Corning's   innovations.   Corning  has
historically  enforced,  and will continue to enforce, its intellectual property
rights.  At the end of 2004,  Corning  and its  subsidiaries  owned  over  4,900
unexpired  patents in various  countries of which over 2,400 were U.S.  patents.
Between 2005 and 2007,  approximately 4% of these patents will expire,  while at
the same time Corning intends to seek patents  protecting its newer innovations.
Worldwide,  Corning has over 3,300 patent applications in process, with over 825
in process in the U.S. As a result,  Corning  believes that its patent portfolio
will  continue  to  provide a  competitive  advantage  in  protecting  Corning's
innovation,  although  Corning's  competitors  in  each  of its  businesses  are
actively seeking patent protection as well.

The Display  Technologies  segment has over 200 patents in various  countries of
which over 80 were U.S. patents.  Although no one patent is considered  material
to this business  segment,  and new patents are  frequently  granted to Corning,
some of the  important  issued  U.S.  patents in this  segment  include  patents
relating to glass  compositions and methods for the use and manufacture of glass
substrates  for display  applications.  There is no group of  important  Display
Technology segment patents set to expire between 2005 and 2007.






The  Telecommunications  segment has over 2,100 patents in various  countries of
which  over  1,000  were U.S.  patents.  Although  no one  patent is  considered
material to this business  segment,  and new patents are  frequently  granted to
Corning,  some of the important issued U.S. patents in this segment include: (i)
patents  relating to optical fiber products  including  dispersion  compensating
fiber, low loss optical fiber and high data rate optical fiber and processes and
equipment for  manufacturing  optical fiber including methods for making optical

associated methods of manufacture. While a particular U.S. patent related to one
type of low  loss  optical  fiber  will  expire  in  2005,  there is no group of
important  Telecommunications  segment  patents set to expire  between  2005 and
2007.

The Environmental Technologies segment has over 550 patents in various countries
of which  over 250 were U.S.  patents.  Although  no one  patent  is  considered
material to this business  segment,  and new patents are  frequently  granted to
Corning,  some of the  important  issued U.S.  patents in this  segment  include
patents relating to cellular ceramic honeycomb  products,  together with ceramic
batch and binder system compositions,  honeycomb extrusion and firing processes,
and  honeycomb  extrusion  dies  and  equipment  for the  high-volume,  low-cost
manufacture  of such  products.  While a particular  U.S.  patent related to the
process of mixing and extruding  certain ceramic  materials will expire in 2005,
there is no group of  important  Environmental  segment  patents  set to  expire
between 2005 and 2007.

The Life  Sciences  segment has over 180 patents in various  countries  of which
over 75 were U.S. patents. Although no one patent is considered material to this
business segment, and new patents are frequently granted to Corning, some of the
important  issued  U.S.  patents in this  segment  include  patents  relating to
methods and  apparatus  for the  manufacture  and use of  scientific  laboratory
equipment  including  nucleic acid arrays,  multiwell  plates,  and cell culture
products.  There is no group of important Life Sciences  segment  patents set to
expire between 2005 and 2007.

Many of these  patents are used in Corning's  operations or are licensed for use
by others,  and Corning is licensed to use patents owned by others.  Corning has
entered into cross licensing  arrangements with some major competitors,  but the
scope  of  such  licenses  has  been  limited  to  specific   product  areas  or
technologies.

Corning's  principal   trademarks  include  the  following:   Corning,   Celcor,
Discovering Beyond Imagination,  DuraTrap, Eagle2000, Flame of Discovery Design,
HPFS, LEAF, Pyrex, SMF-28e, Steuben, Lanscape and Vycor.

Protection of the Environment

Corning  has a program to ensure  that its  facilities  are in  compliance  with
state, federal and foreign pollution-control  regulations. This program resulted
in capital and operating expenditures during the past several years. In order to
maintain  compliance with such regulations,  capital  expenditures for pollution
control in continuing  operations were approximately $16 million in 2004 and are
estimated to be $26 million in 2005.

Corning's 2004 operating  results from  continuing  operations were charged with
approximately  $40 million for  depreciation,  maintenance,  waste  disposal and
other operating  expenses  associated with pollution  control.  Corning believes
that its compliance program will not place it at a competitive disadvantage.

Risk factors

Set forth below and  elsewhere  in this Annual  Report on Form 10-K and in other
documents we file with the SEC are some of the principal risks and uncertainties
that could  cause our actual  business  results  to differ  materially  from any
forward-looking  statements or other  projections  contained in this Report.  In
addition,  future results could be materially  affected by general  industry and
market  conditions,  changes  in laws or  accounting  rules,  general  U.S.  and
non-U.S.  economic  and  political  conditions,   including  a  global  economic
slowdown,  fluctuation of interest rates or currency exchange rates,  terrorism,
political  unrest or  international  conflicts,  political  instability or major
health concerns, natural disasters or other disruptions of expected economic and
business conditions.  These risk factors should be considered in addition to our
cautionary  comments  concerning  forward-looking  statements  in  this  Report,
including  statements  related to  markets  for our  products  and trends in our
business  that  involve  a  number  of risks  and  uncertainties.  Our  separate
statement labeled Forward-Looking Statements should be considered in addition to
the statements below.






Our  sales  could be  negatively  impacted  if one or more of our key  customers
substantially reduce orders for our products

     Our customer base is relatively  concentrated with less than 10 significant
customers  accounting for a high  percentage  (greater than 50%) of net sales in
most of our  businesses,  including  those  purchasing  LCD glass.  However,  no
individual customer accounts for more than 10% of consolidated sales.

     Our Display Technologies,  Telecommunications,  Environmental Technologies,
and Life  Sciences  segments  have  concentrated  customer  bases.  If we lose a
significant  customer in any of these businesses,  or if one or more significant
customers  reduce  orders,  our  sales  could be  negatively  impacted.  Corning
manufactures  and  sells  glass  substrates  to  a  concentrated  customer  base
comprised of LCD panel makers  primarily  located in Japan and Taiwan.  The most
significant   customers  in  these  markets  are  AU Optronics  Corp.,  Chi  Mei
Optoelectronics  Corp.,  Hannstar  Display  Corp.,  Quanta  Display Inc.,  Sharp
Corporation,  and Toppan CFI  (Taiwan)  Co.,  Ltd.  For the twelve  months ended
December  31, 2004,  these six LCD  customers  accounted  for 76% of the Display
Technologies segment sales. In addition,  Samsung Corning Precision's sales were
also  concentrated,  with three LCD panel makers in Korea  (Samsung  Electronics
Co., Ltd., LG Philips LCD Co., and BOE Hydis  Technology  Co., Ltd.)  accounting
for 88% of sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004.

     Although the sale of LCD glass  substrates  increased in 2004, there can be
no assurance  that positive  trends will  continue.  Our customers are LCD panel
makers, and as they switch to larger size glass, the pace of their orders may be
uneven  while  they  adjust  their   manufacturing   processes  and  facilities.
Additionally,  consumer  preferences for panels of differing  sizes, or price or
other factors,  may lead to pauses in market growth from time to time.  There is
further  risk  that  our  customers  may  not be  able  to  maintain  profitable
operations or access sufficient capital to fund ongoing expansions.

     Our  Telecommunications  segment  customers'  purchases of our products are
affected  by  their  capital  expansion  plans,   general  market  and  economic
uncertainty and regulatory  changes,  including broadband policy. For the twelve
months ended December 31, 2004, one customer  accounted for approximately 13% of
our  Telecommunications  segment  sales,  and 10 customers  accounted for 47% of
total segment sales. Sales growth in the  Telecommunications  segment is largely
dependent  on the  continuation  of  the  recent  Verizon  fiber-to-the-premises
project.  Should this deployment not occur at the pace  anticipated,  our future
sales would be adversely impacted.

     In the Environmental  Technologies segment,  sales of our ceramic substrate
and filter  products for automotive and diesel  emissions and pollution  control
fluctuate with production and sales of automobiles  and other vehicles,  as well
as changes in  governmental  laws and  regulations  for air quality and emission
controls. Sales in our Environmental  Technologies segment are primarily to four
manufacturers of emission control systems who then sell to automotive and diesel
engine manufacturers.

     Sales  in our  Life  Sciences  segment  are  primarily  through  two  large
distributors to government entities, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies,
hospitals,  universities  and other  research  facilities.  One of Life Sciences
primary distributors has recently  communicated its intent to change its ongoing
business  strategy.  Subsequent  to December 31,  2004,  Corning  notified  this
distributor that we will not renew its existing  distribution  agreement,  which
will expire in April  2005.  We are  actively  working to  transition  the sales
through this distributor to our remaining primary distributor and other existing
and developing channels. However, this change will likely adversely impact sales
volumes in the short term.

If we do not  successfully  adjust  our  manufacturing  volumes  and fixed  cost
structure,  or achieve  manufacturing  yields or sufficient product reliability,
our operating results could suffer, and we may not achieve  profitability levels
anticipated

     We are investing  heavily in additional  manufacturing  capacity of certain
businesses,  including $640 million in 2004 to expand our liquid crystal display
glass  facilities in response to  anticipated  increases in customer  demand and
$124 million in anticipation of the emerging market for diesel emission  control
systems.  The speed of constructing the new facilities presents  challenges.  We
may face  technical  and  process  issues  in moving  to  commercial  production
capacity.  There  can be no  assurance  that  Corning  will be able to pace  its
capacity  expansion to the actual demand.  While the industry has grown rapidly,
it is possible  that glass  manufacturing  capacity may exceed  customer  demand
during certain periods.

     The  manufacturing  of our  products  involves  highly  complex and precise
processes, requiring production in highly controlled and clean environments. Any
changes  in  our  manufacturing  processes  or  those  of  our  suppliers  could
significantly reduce our manufacturing  yields and product reliability.  In some
cases,  existing  manufacturing  may be  insufficient  to achieve  the volume or
requirements  of our  customers.  We will  need  to  develop  new  manufacturing
processes and  techniques to achieve  targeted  volume,  pricing and cost levels
that will permit  profitable  operations.  While we continue to fund projects to
improve  our  manufacturing   techniques  and  processes,  we  may  not  achieve
satisfactory cost levels in our manufacturing activities that will fully satisfy
our yield and margin targets.






We have incurred, and may in the future incur,  restructuring and other charges,
the amounts of which are difficult to predict accurately

     As  a  result  of a  severe  decline  in  the  telecommunications  industry
beginning  in  2001,  we  have  recorded  several  charges  for   restructuring,
impairment of assets,  and the  write-off of cost and equity based  investments,
most  recently  in the third  quarter  of 2004.  It is  possible  we may  record
additional  charges for  restructuring or other asset  impairments if additional
actions become necessary to align costs to a reduced level of demand, or respond
to increased  competition,  regulatory  actions,  or other factors impacting our
businesses.

If the  markets for our  products  do not  develop and expand as we  anticipate,
demand for our products may decline further,  which would negatively  impact our
results of operations and financial performance

     The  markets  for  our  products  are  characterized  by  rapidly  changing
technologies,  evolving industry  government  standards and frequent new product
introductions.  Our success is expected to depend,  in substantial  part, on the
timely and successful introduction of new products, upgrades of current products
to comply with emerging industry  government  standards,  our ability to acquire
technologies  needed to remain  competitive and our ability to address competing
technologies  and products.  In addition,  the following  factors related to our
products and the markets for them, if not achieved, could have an adverse impact
on our results of operations and financial performance:

     .    our ability to introduce leading products such as glass substrates for
          liquid crystal  displays,  optical fiber and  environmental  substrate
          products that can command competitive prices in the marketplace;
     .    our  ability to  maintain  or achieve a  favorable  sales mix of large
          generation sizes of display glass;
     .    our ability to  continue  to develop new product  lines to address our
          customers'  diverse needs within the several  market  segments that we
          participate in, which requires a high level of innovation,  as well as
          the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends;
     .    our  ability  to  develop  new   products  in  response  to  favorable
          government regulations and laws driving customer demand,  particularly
          environmental  substrate  diesel filter products in the  Environmental
          Technologies   segment   and   Telecommunications   segment   products
          associated with fiber-to-the-premises;
     .    continued strong demand for notebook computers;
     .    the rate of  substitution  by  end-users  purchasing  LCD  monitors to
          replace cathode ray tube monitors;
     .    the rate of growth in purchases of LCD  televisions  to replace  other
          technologies;
     .    fluctuations  in  inventory  levels in the supply  chain of  LCD-based
          consumer electronics;
     .    the ability to reallocate LCD glass to other  customers in response to
          canceled orders; or
     .    the rate of growth  of the  fiber-to-the-premises  build-out  in North
          America.

We face pricing pressures in each of our leading businesses that could adversely
affect our results of operations and financial performance

     We periodically face pricing pressures in each of our leading businesses as
a result of intense  competition,  emerging new technologies,  or over-capacity.
While we will work toward reducing our costs to respond to the pricing pressures
that may  continue,  we may not be able to achieve  proportionate  reductions in
costs.  As a result  of  overcapacity  and the  current  economic  and  industry
downturn in the Telecommunications segment, pricing pressures continued in 2004,
particularly  in our optical fiber and cable  products.  We  anticipate  pricing
pressures  will continue  into 2005 and beyond.  Increased  pricing  pressure is
likely in our Display  Technologies  segment as our  customers  strive to reduce
their costs.

We have  incurred,  and may in the future incur,  goodwill and other  intangible
asset impairment charges

     At December 31, 2004,  Corning had goodwill of $282 million (including $123
million related to the Telecommunications  segment). During the third quarter of
2004,  we  recorded  a  $1,420  million  impairment  charge  to  write-down  the
Telecommunications segment goodwill balance to its estimated fair value.

     While we believe the estimates  and judgments  about future cash flows used
in the goodwill  impairment  tests are reasonable,  we cannot provide  assurance
that future  impairment  charges will not be required if the expected  cash flow
estimates  as  projected  by  management  do not occur or change based on market
conditions.






We may be limited in our ability to obtain  additional  capital on  commercially
reasonable terms

     Although we believe  existing cash,  short-term  investments  and borrowing
capacity,  collectively,  provide adequate  resources to fund ongoing  operating
requirements,  we may be  required  to  seek  additional  financing  to  compete
effectively in our markets.  Our public debt ratings affect our ability to raise
capital and the cost of such  capital.  Our ratings as of February 22, 2005 were
BB+ from both Fitch and Standard & Poor's and Ba2 from Moody's.  Any  downgrades
may  increase  our  borrowing  costs and affect  our  ability to access the debt
capital markets.

     We are subject  under our  revolving  credit  facility  to a covenant  that
requires us to maintain a ratio of total debt to capital,  as defined  under the
credit  facility,  of not greater than 60%. Our total debt to capital  ratio was
41% at December  31, 2004.  This  covenant  limits our ability to borrow  funds.
Future losses or significant charges could materially increase our total debt to
capital  ratio  which may  reduce the  amounts  we are able to borrow  under our
existing  revolving credit facility or adversely affect our ability to negotiate
a new revolving  credit facility in 2005. Our revolving  credit facility expires
in  August  2005  and  we  are  currently  negotiating  with  leading  financial
institutions  to arrange a new  credit  facility.  We believe  that a new credit
facility will be arranged and executed in the first half of 2005 on  competitive
terms and conditions. Corning is seeking up to a $1 billion credit facility with
up to a five year term. Among the terms and conditions being negotiated, Corning
believes it will be subject to two financial covenants.

If our products or materials purchased from our suppliers experience performance
issues, our business will suffer

     Our  business   depends  on  the   production  of  excellent   products  of
consistently  high  quality.  To this end,  our  products,  including  materials
purchased  from  our  suppliers,  are  tested  for  quality  both  by us and our
customers.  Nevertheless,  our products are highly  complex,  and our customers'
testing  procedures  are limited to  evaluating  our  products  under likely and
foreseeable failure scenarios. For various reasons (including, among others, the
occurrence of performance problems  unforeseeable in testing),  our products and
materials  purchased  from  our  suppliers  may  fail to  perform  as  expected.
Performance  issues could result from faulty design or problems in manufacturing
or testing.  We have experienced such performance  issues in the past and remain
exposed  to  such  performance  issues.  In some  cases,  product  redesigns  or
additional  capital  equipment may be required to correct a defect. In addition,
any significant or systemic  product failure could result in customer  relations
problems and harm the future sales of our products.

We face intense competition in most of our businesses

     We  expect  that  we  will  face  additional   competition   from  existing
competitors,  low  cost  manufacturers  and new  entrants.  Because  some of the
markets in which we compete have been historically characterized by rapid growth
and are  characterized by rapid technology  changes,  smaller niche and start-up
companies,  or companies  with lower  operating  costs may become our  principal
competitors in the future.  We must invest in research and  development,  expand
our  engineering,  manufacturing  and  marketing  capabilities,  and continue to
improve customer service and support in order to remain  competitive.  We cannot
provide  assurance  that we will be able to maintain or improve our  competitive
position.

We may experience difficulties in enforcing our intellectual property rights and
we may be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual  property rights
of others

     We may encounter  difficulties  in  protecting  our  intellectual  property
rights or obtaining  rights to  additional  intellectual  property  necessary to
permit us to continue or expand our  businesses.  We cannot  assure you that the
patents that we hold or may obtain will provide  meaningful  protection  against
our  competitors  or  competitive  technologies.  Litigation may be necessary to
enforce our intellectual  property  rights,  to protect our trade secrets and to
determine  the  validity  and scope of our  proprietary  rights.  Litigation  is
inherently  uncertain and the outcome is often  unpredictable.  Other  companies
hold patents on technologies used in our industries and are aggressively seeking
to expand, enforce and license their patent portfolios.

     The  intellectual  property  rights of others could  inhibit our ability to
introduce new products.  We are, and may in the future be,  subject to claims of
intellectual  property  infringement or misappropriation that may result in loss
of revenue or require us to incur substantial  costs. We cannot assure you as to
the outcome of such claims.

Current or future  litigation  may harm our  financial  condition  or results of
operations

     Pending,   threatened   or  future   litigation   is  subject  to  inherent
uncertainties. Our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely
affected by unfavorable outcomes, expenses and costs exceeding amounts estimated
or  insured.  In  particular,  we have been  named as a  defendant  in  numerous
lawsuits  against PCC and several other  defendants  involving  claims  alleging
personal  injury from exposure to asbestos.  As described in Legal  Proceedings,
our negotiations with the  representatives of asbestos claimants have produced a
tentative settlement,  but certain cases may still be litigated.  Final approval
of a global settlement through the PCC bankruptcy process may impact the results
of operations for the period in which such costs, if any, are recognized.  Total
charges of $446 million have been incurred through  December 31, 2004;  however,
the final settlement value will be dependent on the price of our common stock at
the time it is contributed to the settlement  trust.  Management  cannot provide
assurances  that the  ultimate  outcome of a settlement  will not be  materially
different from the amount recorded to date.






We face risks related to our international operations and sales

     We have customers and significant  operations,  including manufacturing and
sales,  located  outside the U.S.  We have large  manufacturing  operations  for
liquid crystal display glass  substrates in the Asia-Pacific  region,  including
equity  investments  in  companies  operating  in South  Korea that make  liquid
crystal display glass and in China that make  telecommunications  products,  and
several  significant  customers are located in this region. As a result of these
and other international operations, we face a number of risks, including:

     .    major health concerns such as SARS;
     .    difficulty of effectively managing our diverse global operations;
     .    change in regulatory requirements;
     .    tariffs,  duties  and  other  trade  barriers  including  anti-dumping
          duties;
     .    undeveloped legal systems; and
     .    political and economic instability in foreign markets.

We face risks through our equity method  investments in companies that we do not
control

     Corning's net income includes  significant equity in earnings of associated
companies. For the year ended December 31, 2004, we have recognized $443 million
of equity earnings, of which $393 million came from our two largest investments;
Dow Corning  Corporation  (which makes  silicone  products) and Samsung  Corning
Precision Glass Co., Ltd.  (which makes liquid crystal  display glass).  Samsung
Corning Precision is located in the Asia-Pacific region and, as such, is subject
to those geographic risks referred to above. With 50% or lower ownership,  we do
not  control  such  equity   companies  nor  their  management  and  operations.
Performance of our equity investments may not continue at the same levels in the
future.  During 2003, we recognized charges associated with Samsung Corning Co.,
Ltd. (our 50% equity method  investment  that makes glass panels and funnels for
conventional  televisions),  which recorded  significant  fixed asset impairment
charges.  During 2004, we have  recognized  charges  associated with Dow Corning
Corporation,  which recorded  charges for  restructuring  actions and bankruptcy
related  settlement  activities.  It is possible that future  earnings  could be
negatively  impacted  by  additional  charges  recorded  by  our  equity  method
investments.

We face risks due to foreign currency fluctuations

     Because we have  significant  customers  and  operations  outside the U.S.,
fluctuations in foreign currencies, especially the Japanese Yen and Euro, affect
our sales and profit levels.  Foreign  exchange rates may make our products less
competitive in countries where local currencies decline in value relative to the
dollar.  Sales in our Display  Technologies  segment are denominated in Japanese
Yen. For 2004, the Display  Technologies  segment  represented  29% of Corning's
sales. Based on the expected sales growth of the Display  Technologies  segment,
our  exposure  to  currency  fluctuations  is  increasing.   Although  we  hedge
significant transaction risk, we do not currently hedge translation risk.

If the  financial  condition of our customers  declines,  our credit risks could
increase

     We have experienced,  and in the future may experience,  losses as a result
of our inability to collect our accounts receivable, as well as the loss of such
customer's  ongoing  business.  If our  customers  fail  to meet  their  payment
obligations to us,  including  deposits due under long-term  purchase and supply
agreements in our Display Technologies segment, we could experience reduced cash
flows and  losses in  excess of  amounts  reserved.  As of  December  31,  2004,
reserves for trade receivables totaled approximately $30 million.

We may not have adequate insurance coverage for claims against us

     We face the risk of loss resulting from, and adverse  publicity  associated
with, product liability, securities, fiduciary liability, intellectual property,
antitrust, contractual,  warranty, fraud and other lawsuits, whether or not such
claims are valid. In addition, our product liability,  fiduciary,  directors and
officers,  property and  comprehensive  general  liability  insurance may not be
adequate to cover such claims or may not be  available  to the extent we expect.
Our insurance costs have increased and may increase further.  We may not be able
to get  adequate  insurance  coverage  in the  future  at  acceptable  costs.  A
successful claim that exceeds or is not covered by our policies could require us
to pay substantial  sums. Some of the carriers in our excess insurance  programs
are in  liquidation  and may not be able to  respond  if we should  have  claims
reaching  into  excess  layers.  The  financial  health  of other  insurers  may
deteriorate  and these  insurers  may not be able to respond  if we should  have
claims  reaching into excess layers.  In addition,  we may not be able to insure
against  certain risks or obtain some types of  insurance,  such as terrorism or
war insurance.

Other

Additional  information  in  response  to Item 1 is found in Note 18  (Operating
Segments) to the consolidated financial statements and selected financial data.







Item 2.  Properties
- -------------------

We operate approximately 45 manufacturing plants and processing  facilities,  of
which approximately one half are located in the U.S. We own substantially all of
our executive and corporate  buildings,  which are located in Corning, New York.
We also own  substantially all of our manufacturing and research and development
facilities and more than half of our sales and administrative facilities.

For the years ended 2004,  2003 and 2002,  we invested a total of $1.6  billion,
primarily on facilities outside the U.S. in our Display Technologies segment. Of
the $857 million spent in 2004, $640 million was for facilities outside the U.S.

Manufacturing, sales and administrative, and research and development facilities
at  consolidated  locations have an aggregate  floor space of  approximately  19
million square feet. Distribution of this total area follows:
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(million square feet)         Total            Domestic          Foreign

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Total assets and capital  expenditures by operating segment are included in Note
18 (Operating Segments) to the Consolidated  Financial  Statements.  Information
concerning lease commitments is included in Note 13 (Commitments, Contingencies,
Guarantees and Hedging Activities) to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

During 2004, we continued the restructuring  program that closed or consolidated
certain  smaller  manufacturing  facilities.  Throughout  2005 we expect to have
excess  capacity,  primarily  in our  Telecommunications  segment,  and will not
utilize a portion of space in the  facilities  listed above.  The largest unused
portion is our optical fiber manufacturing  facility in Concord,  North Carolina
that has been  mothballed  until  fiber  demand  rebounds.  We believe  that the
Concord  facility  can be returned  to  productive  capacity  within six to nine
months of a decision to do so.

Item 3.  Legal Proceedings
- --------------------------

Environmental Litigation. Corning has been named by the Environmental Protection
Agency under the  Superfund  Act, or by state  governments  under  similar state
laws, as a potentially  responsible  party at 11 active  hazardous  waste sites.
Under the  Superfund  Act, all parties who may have  contributed  any waste to a
hazardous  waste site,  identified  by such  Agency,  are jointly and  severally
liable  for the cost of  cleanup  unless  the  Agency  agrees  otherwise.  It is
Corning's  policy to accrue for its  estimated  liability  related to  Superfund
sites and other  environmental  liabilities related to property owned by Corning
based on expert analysis and continual  monitoring by both internal and external
consultants.  Corning has accrued  approximately  $14 million for its  estimated
liability for  environmental  cleanup and litigation at December 31, 2004. Based
upon the  information  developed to date,  management  believes that the accrued
reserve is a reasonable estimate of the Company's liability and that the risk of
an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote.

Schwinger and Stevens  Toxins  Lawsuits.  In April 2002,  Corning was named as a
defendant in two actions,  Schwinger  and  Stevens,  filed in the U.S.  District
Court for the Eastern  District of New York,  which  asserted  various  personal
injury and property  damage  claims  against a number of  corporate  defendants.
These  claims  allegedly  arise  from the  release  of toxic  substances  from a
Sylvania  nuclear  materials  processing  facility  near  Hicksville,  New York.
Amended  complaints  naming 205 plaintiffs  and seeking  damages in excess of $3
billion  were served in  September  2002.  The sole basis of  liability  against
Corning was plaintiffs' claim that Corning was the successor to Sylvania-Corning
Nuclear  Corporation,  a Delaware  corporation  formed in 1957 and  dissolved in
1960.  Management  intends to vigorously  contest all claims against Corning for
the reason that  Corning is not the  successor to  Sylvania-Corning.  Management
will also defend on the grounds that almost all of the wrongful death claims and
personal injury claims are time-barred. At a status conference in December 2002,
the Court  decided to  "administratively  close" the Schwinger and Stevens cases
and  ordered   plaintiffs'   counsel  to  bring  new  amended   complaints  with
"bellwether" plaintiffs. In these actions, known as Schwinger II and Astuto, the
plaintiffs  have not named  Corning as a  defendant.  Although  it appears  that
plaintiffs may proceed only against the other corporate defendants, the original
Schwinger  and  Stevens  cases  remain  pending  and no order  has been  entered
dismissing  Corning.   Based  upon  the  information   developed  to  date,  and
recognizing  that the outcome of litigation is  uncertain,  management  believes
that the  likelihood  of a  materially  adverse  impact to  Corning's  financial
statements is remote.






Dow  Corning  Bankruptcy.  Corning and Dow  Chemical  each own 50% of the common
stock of Dow Corning,  which was in reorganization  proceedings under Chapter 11
of the U.S.  Bankruptcy  Code between May 1995 and June 2004.  Dow Corning filed
for bankruptcy  protection to address  pending and claimed  liabilities  arising
from many  thousand  breast-implant  product  lawsuits  each of which  typically
sought  damages in excess of one  million  dollars.  On  November  8, 1998,  Dow
Corning  and the  Tort  Claimants  Committee  jointly  filed a  revised  Plan of
Reorganization   (Joint  Plan)  which  provided  for  the  settlement  or  other
resolution of implant claims. After review and approvals by the Bankruptcy Court
and the U.S. District Court of the Eastern District of Michigan,  and an appeal,
the District Court on April 2, 2004 entered an order  establishing  June 1, 2004
as the effective date of the Joint Plan.

Under the terms of the Joint Plan, Dow Corning has  established and is funding a
Settlement Trust and a Litigation Facility to provide a means for tort claimants
to settle or  litigate  their  claims.  Of the  approximately  $3.2  billion  of
required funding,  Dow Corning has paid approximately $1.6 billion (inclusive of
insurance)  and expects to pay up to an  additional  $1.6 billion  ($710 million
after-tax) over 16 years. Corning and Dow Chemical have each agreed to provide a
credit  facility  to Dow  Corning  of up to $150  million  ($300  million in the
aggregate),  subject to the terms and  conditions  stated in the Joint Plan.  As
required by the Joint Plan,  Dow Corning has fully  satisfied  (or reserved for)
the claims of its  commercial  creditors  in  accordance  with a March 31,  2004
ruling of the District Court determining the amount of pendency interest allowed
on the $810 million in principal owing on such claims.  In the second quarter of
2004,  Dow Corning  recorded a $47 million  pre-tax  adjustment  to its interest
liabilities  relating  to this  matter;  Corning  recognized  $14 million in its
second  quarter  equity  earnings  for its after  tax share of this  adjustment.
Certain  commercial  creditors  have appealed  that ruling to the U.S.  Court of
Appeals of the Sixth  Circuit  seeking  from Dow  Corning an  additional  sum of
approximately  $80 million for interest at default rates and enforcement  costs.
Corning  believes  the risk of loss to Dow  Corning  (net of sums  reserved)  is
remote.

In addition,  Dow Corning has received a statutory notice of deficiency from the
United States  Internal  Revenue  Service  asserting tax  deficiencies  totaling
approximately  $65.3 million  relating to its federal income tax returns for the
1995 and 1996 calendar  years.  This matter is pending before the U.S.  District
Court in Michigan.  Dow Corning has also received a proposed adjustment from the
IRS  (approximately  $116.9  million)  with  respect to its  federal  income tax
returns for the 1997,  1998 and 1999 calendar  years.  Dow Corning is vigorously
contesting  these  deficiencies and proposed  adjustments  which it believes are
excessive.

In 1995,  Corning  fully  impaired its  investment in Dow Corning upon its entry
into  bankruptcy  proceedings and did not recognize net equity earnings from the
second quarter of 1995 through the end of 2002. Corning began recognizing equity
earnings  in the  first  quarter  of 2003  when  management  concluded  that its
emergence  from  bankruptcy  protection  was  probable.  Corning  considers  the
difference  between the carrying  value of its investment in Dow Corning and its
50% share of Dow  Corning's  equity to be  permanent.  This  difference  is $249
million. Subject to future rulings by the bankruptcy court and potential changes
in estimated bankruptcy-related liabilities, it is possible that Dow Corning may
record bankruptcy-related charges in the future.

Corning  received  no  dividends  from Dow  Corning in 2004 or in 2003.  Corning
anticipates that Dow Corning will begin to pay dividends in 2005.

The Joint Plan includes releases for Corning and Dow Chemical as shareholders in
exchange  for  contributions  to the Joint  Plan.  Although  claims  against the
shareholders  were included in several thousand state and federal lawsuits filed
pre-bankruptcy,  alleging  injuries arising from Dow Corning's implant products,
Corning  was awarded  summary  judgment  in federal  court and in several  state
jurisdictions.  The remaining  claims  against  Corning will be channeled by the
Joint Plan into facilities  established by the Joint Plan.  Management  believes
that the  likelihood  of a  materially  adverse  impact to  Corning's  financial
statements arising from these remaining claims against shareholders is remote.

Federal Securities Cases. A federal securities class action lawsuit was filed in
1992 in the U.S.  District  Court for the Southern  District of New York against
Corning and certain individual defendants. The action was brought in the name of
a class of  purchasers  of  Corning  stock  who  allege  misrepresentations  and
omissions of material facts relative to the silicone gel breast implant business
conducted by Dow Corning.  The nominal  class  consisted of those  purchasers of
Corning stock in the period from June 14, 1989 to January 13, 1992. No amount of
damages  was  specified  in the  complaint.  In 1997,  the Court  dismissed  the
individual  defendants  from the case.  On December 21, 2004,  the Court granted
summary  judgment  in  favor of  Corning,  dismissing  all  claims  against  it.
Plaintiffs  may file an  appeal to the U.S.  Court of  Appeals.  Based  upon the
information  developed to date and recognizing that the outcome of litigation is
uncertain,  management  believes  that the  likelihood  of a materially  adverse
impact to Corning's financial statements is remote.






From  December  2001 through  April 2002,  Corning and three of its officers and
directors  were named  defendants  in lawsuits  alleging  violations of the U.S.
securities  laws in  connection  with  Corning's  November  2000  offering of 30
million  shares  of  common  stock  and $2.7  billion  zero  coupon  convertible
debentures,  due  November  2015.  In  addition,  the Company and the same three
officers and directors were named in lawsuits  alleging  misleading  disclosures
and non-disclosures  that allegedly inflated the price of Corning's common stock
in the period from October 2000 through July 9, 2001.  The  plaintiffs  in these
actions seek to represent  classes of  purchasers  of Corning's  stock in all or
part of the period indicated.  On August 2, 2002, the U.S. District Court of the
Western  District of New York entered an order  consolidating  these actions for
all  purposes,  designating  lead  plaintiffs  and lead  counsel,  and directing
service of a consolidated complaint. The consolidated amended complaint requests
substantial  damages in an unspecified amount to be proved at trial. In February
2003,  defendants  filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to allege
the  requisite  elements  of the  claims  with  particularity.  The Court  heard
arguments on May 29 and June 9, 2003 and on April 9, 2004 entered a Decision and
Order dismissing the complaint. Plaintiffs appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals
of the Second Circuit. Oral argument was held on February 2, 2005, and the Court
reserved decision.  Management is prepared to defend these lawsuits  vigorously.
Recognizing  that the outcome of litigation is  uncertain,  management  believes
that the  likelihood  of a  materially  adverse  impact to  Corning's  financial
statements, net of applicable insurance, is remote.

Pittsburgh Corning  Corporation.  Corning and PPG Industries,  Inc. ("PPG") each
own 50% of the capital stock of PCC. Over a period of more than two decades, PCC
and several  other  defendants  have been named in numerous  lawsuits  involving
claims alleging  personal  injury from exposure to asbestos.  On April 16, 2000,
PCC filed for Chapter 11  reorganization  in the U.S.  Bankruptcy  Court for the
Western District of Pennsylvania. As of the bankruptcy filing, PCC had in excess
of 140,000 open claims and had  insufficient  remaining  insurance and assets to
deal  with its  alleged  current  and  future  liabilities.  More  than  100,000
additional  claims have been filed with PCC after its  bankruptcy  filing.  As a
result of PCC's bankruptcy  filing,  Corning recorded an after-tax charge of $36
million  in  2001  to  fully  impair  its  investment  in PCC  and  discontinued
recognition of equity earnings. At the time PCC filed for bankruptcy protection,
there were  approximately  12,400 claims pending  against Corning in state court
lawsuits  alleging  various  theories  of  liability  based on exposure to PCC's
asbestos  products and typically  requesting  monetary  damages in excess of one
million dollars per claim. Corning has defended those claims on the basis of the
separate  corporate status of PCC and the absence of any facts supporting claims
of direct  liability  arising  from  PCC's  asbestos  products.  Corning is also
currently  named in  approximately  11,400  other  cases  (approximately  43,400
claims) alleging  injuries from asbestos and similar amounts of monetary damages
per claim. Those cases have been covered by insurance without material impact to
Corning to date. Asbestos litigation is inherently difficult, and past trends in
resolving these claims may not be indicators of future outcomes.

In the  bankruptcy  court,  PCC in April 2000 obtained a preliminary  injunction
against the prosecution of asbestos  actions arising from PCC's products against
its two  shareholders  to afford  the  parties a period of time (the  Injunction
Period) in which to negotiate a plan of reorganization for PCC ("PCC Plan").

On May 14, 2002,  PPG announced that it had agreed with certain of its insurance
carriers and  representatives  of current and future  asbestos  claimants on the
terms of a  settlement  arrangement  applicable  to claims  arising  from  PCC's
products.

On March 28, 2003,  Corning  announced  that it had also reached  agreement with
representatives  of  current  and  future  asbestos  claimants  on a  settlement
arrangement that was thereafter  incorporated into the PCC Plan. This settlement
remains  subject  to a  number  of  contingencies,  including  approval  by  the
bankruptcy court.  Corning's  settlement will require the  contribution,  if the
Plan is  approved  and becomes  effective,  of its equity  interest in PCC,  its
one-half  equity interest in PCE, and 25 million shares of Corning common stock.
The settlement also requires  Corning to make cash payments of $144 million (net
present  value as of December 31, 2004) in six  installments  beginning one year
after the Plan is effective.  In addition,  Corning will assign policy rights or
proceeds  under primary  insurance  from 1962 through 1984, as well as rights to
proceeds under certain excess  insurance,  most of which falls within the period
from 1962 through 1973. In return for these  contributions,  Corning  expects to
receive a release and an injunction channeling asbestos claims against it into a
settlement trust under the PCC Plan.

Corning  recorded an initial  charge of $298 million in the period  ending March
31, 2003 to reflect the settlement terms.  However, the amount of the charge for
this  settlement  requires  adjustment  each  quarter  based  upon  movement  in
Corning's  common stock price prior to  contribution of the shares to the trust.
During  2004,   Corning  recorded  a  charge  of  $33  million  to  reflect  the
mark-to-market of Corning common stock. Beginning with the first quarter of 2003
and  through  December  31,  2004,  Corning  recorded  total net charges of $446
million  to reflect  the  initial  settlement  and  mark-to-market  the value of
Corning common stock.

Two of Corning's  primary  insurers and several  excess  insurers have commenced
litigation for a declaration of the rights and  obligations of the parties under
insurance  policies,  including  rights that may be  affected by the  settlement
arrangement  described  above.  Corning is  vigorously  contesting  these cases.
Management is unable to predict the outcome of this insurance litigation.






The PCC Plan received a favorable vote from creditors in March 2004. Hearings to
consider  objections to the Plan were held in the Bankruptcy  Court in May 2004.
The  parties  filed  post-hearing  briefs and made final oral  arguments  to the
Bankruptcy  Court  in  November  2004.  The  Bankruptcy  Court  has  allowed  an
additional  round of briefing to address  current  case law  developments,  with
briefs due on  February  28,  2005 and March 10,  2005,  leading to a hearing on
March 16, 2005.  The timing and outcome are uncertain.  If the Bankruptcy  Court
does not  confirm the PCC Plan in its current  form,  changes to the  settlement
agreement are reasonably  possible.  Further  judicial review is also reasonably
possible.  Although the  confirmation  of the PCC Plan is subject to a number of
contingencies,  apart from the  quarterly  adjustment in the value of 25 million
shares of Corning  common stock,  management  believes that the  likelihood of a
material adverse impact to Corning's financial statements is remote.

Astrium. In December of 2000, Astrium,  SAS and Astrium,  Ltd. filed a complaint
for negligence in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California
against TRW,  Inc.,  Pilkington  Optronics  Inc.,  Corning  NetOptix,  Inc., OFC
Corporation and Optical Filter  Corporation  claiming  damages in excess of $150
million.  The complaint alleges that certain cover glasses for solar arrays used
to  generate  electricity  from solar  energy on  satellites  sold by  Astrium's
corporate  successor  were  negligently  coated by NetOptix or its  subsidiaries
(prior to  Corning's  acquisition  of NetOptix) in such a way that the amount of
electricity  the satellite can produce and their  effective life were materially
reduced.  NetOptix  has denied  that the  coatings  produced  by NetOptix or its
subsidiaries  caused the damage alleged in the complaint,  or that it is legally
liable for any damages that  Astrium may have  experienced.  In April 2002,  the
Court granted motions for summary  judgment by NetOptix and other  defendants to
dismiss  the  negligence  claims,  but  permitted  plaintiffs  to add  fraud and
negligent  misrepresentation  claims  against  all  defendants  and a breach  of
warranty claim against NetOptix and its subsidiaries. In October 2002, the Court
again  granted  defendants'  motions  for summary  judgment  and  dismissed  the
negligent misrepresentation and breach of warranty claims. The intentional fraud
claims were dismissed against all non-settling  defendants on February 25, 2003.
On March 19, 2003,  Astrium  appealed all of the Court's  Rulings  regarding the
various  summary  judgment  motions to the Ninth Circuit  Court of Appeals.  The
period of  briefing  the appeal was  extended,  and oral  argument  has not been
scheduled.  Recognizing that the outcome of litigation is uncertain,  management
believes  that the  likelihood  of a  materially  adverse  impact  to  Corning's
financial statements is remote.

Furukawa  Electric  Company.  On February 3, 2003, The Furukawa Electric Company
filed suit in the Tokyo  District  Court in Japan against  Corning Cable Systems
International   Corporation  ("CCS  International")   alleging  infringement  of
Furukawa's Japanese Patent No. 2,023,966 which relates to separable fiber ribbon
units used in optical cable.  Furukawa's  complaint  requests slightly over (Y)6
billion in damages (approximately $56 million) and an injunction against further
sales in Japan of these fiber ribbon  units.  CCS  International  has denied the
allegation  of  infringement,  asserted  that  the  patent  is  invalid,  and is
defending  vigorously  against  this  lawsuit.  On October 29,  2004,  the Tokyo
District Court issued it's ruling in favor of CCS on both  non-infringement  and
patent  invalidity.  Furukawa has filed an appeal from this  ruling.  Management
believes  that the  likelihood  of a  materially  adverse  impact  to  Corning's
financial statements is remote.

PicVue  Electronics  Ltd.,  PicVue  OptoElectronics   International,   Inc.  and
Eglasstrek Gmbh. In June 2002, Corning brought an action seeking to restrain the
use of its trade  secrets  and for  copyright  infringement  relating to certain
aspects  of the  fusion  draw  machine  used for liquid  crystal  display  glass
melting.  This  action is pending  in the U.S.  District  Court for the  Western
District of New York against these three named defendants. The District Court in
July  2003  denied  the  PicVue  motion to  dismiss  and  granted a  preliminary
injunction  in favor of  Corning,  subject  to posting a bond in an amount to be
determined.  PicVue,  a  Taiwanese  company,  responded  in  July  2003  with  a
counterclaim  alleging  violations of the antitrust laws and claiming damages of
more than  $120  million  as well as  requesting  trebled  damages.  PicVue  has
appealed the District  Court's ruling and the District Court has deferred ruling
on the bond amount until the  completion  of such appeal.  The  appellate  court
affirmed the grant of the preliminary injunction,  but remanded the case for the
District  Court to clarify the scope of the  injunction and to consider what, if
any, bond should be posted.  The parties have  submitted  papers to the District
Court  addressing the issues  remanded.  Additional  proceedings in the District
Court are  expected in the first half of 2005.  Recognizing  that the outcome of
litigation is uncertain,  management  believes that the PicVue  counterclaim  is
without  merit  and  that the  likelihood  of a  materially  adverse  impact  to
Corning's financial statements is remote.

Tyco Electronics  Corporation and Tyco Technology Resources,  Inc. On August 13,
2003, CCS Holdings Inc. ("CCS"),  a Corning  subsidiary,  filed an action in the
U.S.  District  Court for the Middle  District of North  Carolina  against  Tyco
Electronics Corporation and Tyco Technology Resources, Inc. ("Tyco"), asking the
court to declare a Tyco patent  invalid  and not  infringed  by CCS.  The patent
generally  relates to a type of connector  for optical  fiber  cables.  Tyco has
responded with a motion to dismiss the action for lack of jurisdiction, but that
motion has been withdrawn.  Tyco has filed an answer and  counterclaims to CCS's
complaint.  Tyco's  counterclaims  allege patent  infringement  by CCS and seeks
unspecified monetary damages and an injunction.  Recognizing that the outcome of
litigation is uncertain,  management believes that the risk of a material impact
on Corning's financial statements is remote.






Grand Jury Investigation of Conventional  Cathode Ray Television Glass Business.
In August  2003,  CAV was served  with a federal  grand jury  document  subpoena
related to  pricing,  bidding  and  customer  practices  involving  conventional
cathode ray television  glass picture tube  components.  Seventeen  employees or
former  employees  have  each  received  a  related  subpoena.  CAV is a general
partnership,  51% owned by Corning  and 49% owned by Asahi Glass  America,  Inc.
CAV's only manufacturing  facility in State College,  Pennsylvania closed in the
first  half  of  2003  due to  declining  sales.  CAV is  cooperating  with  the
government investigation. Management is not able to estimate the likelihood that
any charges will be filed as a result of the investigation.

Item 7. Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
of Operations
- -------------

Overview

We  continued  to focus on three  significant  priorities  in 2004:  protect our
financial  health,  improve  profitability,  and invest in our  future.  We made
significant progress towards all three in 2004.

Financial Health

During 2004, we continued to strengthen our balance sheet and delivered positive
cash flows for the year. The following are key accomplishments for 2004:

..    As part of a debt reduction  program,  we retired $487 million of long-term
     debt. Additionally,  we repaid $115 million of debt, primarily attributable
     to certain bondholders exercising their early repayment option.
..    We issued $400  million of  long-term  debt,  the proceeds of which will be
     used to repay debt,  fund capital  expenditures  and extend the duration of
     our debt portfolio.
..    We reduced  our DSOs to 52 days,  compared  to 58 days as of  December  31,
     2003. This was  accomplished  through the  negotiation of improved  payment
     terms with customers, primarily in the Display Technologies segment.
..    Negotiated  multi-year  supply  agreements  with  customers  in the Display
     Technologies segment,  including the receipt of deposits against orders, to
     meet the rapid growth of the liquid  crystal  display (LCD) market.  During
     2004, we received deposits totaling $204 million under such agreements.
..    We generated  sufficient cash flows from operating  activities to cover our
     capital expenditures.

We ended  2004  with $1.9  billion  in cash,  cash  equivalents  and  short-term
investments. This represents an increase of $615 million from December 31, 2003.
We  continue  to have  unrestricted  access  to a $2  billion  revolving  credit
facility,  and have $2.5 billion of capacity under our existing  universal shelf
registration statement. Our revolving credit facility expires in August 2005. We
are currently in negotiations with leading  financial  institutions to arrange a
credit  facility,  and believe a new facility will be executed in the first half
of 2005. We believe we have  sufficient  liquidity for the next several years to
fund operations, capital expenditures and scheduled debt repayments.

Profitability

Although 2004 resulted in a net loss of $2,165  million,  this included a number
of charges that are not anticipated to recur in the future, and is therefore not
indicative of our projections for  profitability  in 2005. The most  significant
charges included in our net loss were:

..    Goodwill and asset impairment  charges of $1,746 million,  primarily in our
     Telecommunications segment.
..    An increase in our provision for income taxes of $937 million caused by our
     decision to record a  valuation  allowance  against  certain  deferred  tax
     assets.

The goodwill and fixed asset impairment  charges were triggered from the results
of our annual  strategic  planning  process of the  Telecommunications  segment.
Specifically,  we determined that we needed to lower our estimates and forecasts
for the long-term revenue growth of the Telecommunications  segment. Although we
are currently  experiencing  stronger than expected volume in this segment,  the
improved demand comes from a narrow band of customers, and we see few signs of a
broader recovery in overall demand, mix of premium products, and pricing for our
products. The lack of industry consolidation, increased competitive pressures in
the industry,  and revised  estimates of future customer demand for the types of
products they will deploy have caused us to change our  assessment of the future
pace of recovery. The primary estimates and forecasts driving this change in our
outlook are:

..    Revised  estimates  of future  pricing for fiber and cable:  Pricing in the
     telecommunications industry remains depressed as the industry has failed to
     reduce capacity.  Our previous  projections assumed some rationalization of
     capacity that would lead to more stable pricing.  We now expect the current
     depressed pricing conditions to persist into 2005 and beyond.
..    Revised estimates of demand for premium fiber product: Based on competitive
     conditions and projected future customer requirements,  we do not expect to
     achieve  the level of demand  for  premium  fiber  products  we  previously
     forecasted.  Although we have introduced innovative products to the market,
     we have not been able to obtain  the  historical  premium  prices  for such
     products. Additionally,  demand for premium fiber has declined as there are
     fewer long-haul  projects.  As a result, we have significantly  reduced our
     outlook for future revenue and profitability from premium products.  We now
     do not  expect  any  significant  increase  in  premium  fiber  mix for the
     foreseeable future.
..    Revised  estimates for the long-term  worldwide market volume growth: As we
     project customer  demand,  we have lowered the rate of volume growth in the
     longer range.






As a result of the  impairment  charges  and  lower  long-term  outlook  for our
Telecommunication  segment,  we have  also  concluded  that we  must  provide  a
valuation  allowance  against  certain of our deferred tax assets in  accordance
with Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  Statement of Financial  Accounting
Standard (SFAS) No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" (SFAS 109). The valuation
allowance  relates to our domestic  (U.S.  federal,  state and local) and German
deferred tax assets. We have incurred significant losses in the U.S. and Germany
due primarily to the Telecommunications restructuring and impairment charges and
operating losses over the last four years. Although Corning's  profitability has
improved  over the last  several  quarters,  a growing  portion of our sales and
earnings is outside of the U.S.,  particularly in Asia. The U.S.  portion of our
operations  operated at a loss in 2004.  This portion not only  includes most of
our  Telecommunications  segment,  but also a significant  portion of our global
research,  development and engineering and corporate infrastructure spending. As
we have taken additional  significant impairment charges and lowered our outlook
for our largest U.S. based business during the third quarter,  we believe that a
valuation  allowance  against these tax assets is required until  realization is
more assured.  We remain  committed to return to  profitability  in the U.S. and
Germany so that we will be able to use these  deferred  tax assets  before  they
expire.  In  general,  U.S.  tax  laws  allow 20  years  to use  operating  loss
carryforwards.

The above  charges  more than  offset  the  significant  earnings  growth in our
Display  Technologies  segment and the gross margin improvements  resulting from
restructuring  actions taken in 2003, most notably the exit of the  conventional
television  and  photonics  businesses.  We remain  confident  in our ability to
execute our plans and return to profitability in 2005.

Investing in our future

We remain  committed  to  investing in  innovation.  We are  investing in a wide
variety of technologies  with our focus being glass substrates for active matrix
LCDs, diesel filters and substrates in response to tightening  emissions control
standards, and the optical fiber and cable, and hardware and equipment that will
enable fiber-to-the-premises.

Our research, development and engineering expenditures have moderately increased
compared to 2003.  We believe our  spending  levels are  adequate to support our
growth strategies.

We also  remain  committed  to  investing  in  manufacturing  capacity  to match
increased  demand in our  businesses.  Our capital  expenditures  are  primarily
focused on  expanding  manufacturing  capacity for LCD glass  substrates  in the
Display   Technologies   segment  and  diesel  products  in  the   Environmental
Technologies segment.  Total capital expenditures for 2004 were $857 million, of
which $640 million was directed toward our Display Technologies segment and $124
million in  anticipation  of the  emerging  market for diesel  emission  control
systems.

We expect our 2005  capital  spending to be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.4
billion,  of which $900  million to $1.1  billion  will be  directed  toward our
Display  Technologies  segment and  approximately  $140 million will be directed
toward our Environmental Technologies segment.








RESULTS OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS



Net Sales

The net  sales  increase  in 2004 was the  result  of  strong  demand  for glass
substrates  in  our  Display  Technologies  segment,  demand  for  hardware  and
equipment products in our  Telecommunications  segment,  and improvements across
the majority of our other businesses.  These  improvements were partially offset
by the 2003 exit of our photonic technologies and U.S.  conventional  television
glass  businesses.  Movements in foreign exchange rates,  primarily the Japanese
Yen and Euro, did not  significantly  impact the comparison of net sales between
2004 and 2003.

The net sales  decline  in 2003 was  primarily  due to the exit of the  photonic
technologies and U.S.  conventional  television  glass  businesses  during 2003.
Based on the exchange  rates at the beginning of 2003,  our sales were favorably
impacted  by the  weakening  U.S.  dollar  against  the  Yen  and  the  Euro  by
approximately 3%.

Reflecting  the  growth in our  Display  Technologies  segment,  net sales  into
international  markets are  increasing at a faster rate than those into the U.S.
market.  For 2004,  sales into  international  markets  accounted for 65% of net
sales while  sales to the U.S.  market  accounted  for 35%.  For 2003,  sales to
international  markets  accounted  for 60% of net sales  while sales to the U.S.
market for 40%.

Gross Margin

As a  percentage  of net sales,  gross  margin  improved 10 points in 2004.  The
improvement in overall gross margin dollars and as a percentage of net sales was
driven by (a) net sales growth in the Display  Technologies  segment of 87%, (b)
operating efficiencies in our  Telecommunications  segment and (c) the 2003 exit
of the conventional television glass business.






For 2003,  gross margins  improved eight points.  This improvement was primarily
the  result  of lower  costs  resulting  from our 2002  restructuring  programs,
primarily in the Telecommunications  segment. Gross margin improved in all other
reportable segments;  however, the gains achieved were partially offset by a $13
million  write-down  of inventory  related to the exit of the U.S.  conventional
television business.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

The 2004 increase in selling,  general and administrative expenses was primarily
driven by increases in  compensation  costs.  For 2003, the decrease in selling,
general and  administrative  expenses  reflects cost savings  primarily from the
2003 and 2002 restructuring actions.

Research, Development and Engineering Expenses

Research,  development and engineering  expenditures increased modestly in 2004,
but the focus of our spending has shifted  from  Telecommunications  projects to
Display  Technologies  projects.   Expenditures  on  Environmental  Technologies
projects  have  remained  relatively  constant  and  spending  on Life  Sciences
projects has increased $10 million.  The 2003 decrease reflects the cost savings
that resulted  from the 2002  restructuring  actions,  including the closure and
consolidation of research facilities.

Restructuring, Impairment and Other Charges and (Credits)

     Impairment of Goodwill
     ----------------------

     2004 Impairment Charge

     Pursuant to SFAS No. 142,  "Goodwill and Other  Intangible  Assets,"  (SFAS
     142)  goodwill  is  required  to be tested for  impairment  annually at the
     reporting unit level. In addition, goodwill should be tested for impairment
     between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances  change that would
     more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting  unit below its
     related  carrying value. Our annual goodwill  recoverability  assessment is
     completed in the fourth quarter, as it is traditionally based on our annual
     strategic  planning  process  that runs from June to October.  This process
     includes reviewing  expectations for the long-term growth of our businesses
     and  forecasting  future cash flows.  In the third  quarter,  we identified
     certain factors during this annual  strategic  planning process that caused
     us to lower our estimates and projections for the long-term  revenue growth
     of the Telecommunications  segment, which indicated that it was more likely
     than not that the fair value of the  Telecommunications  segment  reporting
     unit was less than its  carrying  value.  As such,  we performed an interim
     impairment  test of the  Telecommunications  segment  goodwill in the third
     quarter of 2004, the results of which were reviewed with Corning's board of
     directors on October 6, 2004.

     We  estimated  the fair  value of the  Telecommunications  segment  using a
     discounted cash flow model based on our current estimates for the long-term
     growth of the Telecommunications segment, and concluded that the fair value
     of  the   Telecommunications   segment  was  below  its  carrying   amount.
     Accordingly,  we recorded an impairment  charge of $1,420 million to reduce
     the carrying value of goodwill to its estimated fair value.  We updated our
     Telecommunications  segment goodwill test in the fourth quarter. The result
     of the test  concluded  that the fair value of the reporting  unit exceeded
     its book value.







     2002 Impairment Charge

     In the fourth quarter of 2002, we conducted our annual impairment tests and
     concluded that an impairment charge of $400 million was necessary to reduce
     the carrying value of goodwill in the Telecommunications  reporting unit to
     its estimated fair value of $1.6 billion. The decrease in fair value at the
     end of 2002 from that  measured  in the  initial  benchmark  assessment  on
     January 1, 2002 primarily reflected the following:

     .    a delay in the timing of the  expected  recovery  from late  2002,  or
          early 2003 to 2005,
     .    a reduction in the short-term cash flow  expectations of the fiber and
          cable business and a lower base from which the expected  recovery will
          occur, and
     .    a reduction in the short and long-term cash flow  expectations  of the
          photonic technologies product line.

     We  retained  valuation  specialists  to  assist  in the  valuation  of our
     tangible and identifiable  intangible assets for the purpose of determining
     the implied fair value of goodwill at December 31, 2002.

     Impairment Of Long-Lived Assets Other Than Goodwill
     ---------------------------------------------------

     Given our  restructuring  actions  and the  market  conditions  facing  our
     businesses,  at  various  times  throughout  2002  to  2004,  we  performed
     evaluations of the  recoverability  of our held for use  long-lived  assets
     other  than  goodwill.  In each  case  that an  impairment  evaluation  was
     required,  we developed expected future cash flows against which to compare
     the carrying value of the asset group being  evaluated.  If our projections
     indicated  that our long lived assets were not  recoverable  through future
     cash  flows,  we were  then  required  to  estimate  the fair  value of the
     long-lived  assets,  which were limited to property,  plant and  equipment,
     using the expected cash flow approach as a measure of fair value.

     2004 Impairment Charge

     Assets to be disposed of by sale or abandonment

     These charges comprise the following:
     .    Telecommunications  segment: In 2004, we recorded a net charge of $344
          million to impair plant and equipment related to certain facilities to
          be disposed of or  shutdown.  Approximately  $332  million of this net
          charge  is  comprised  of  the  partially  completed  sections  of our
          Concord,  N.C.  optical  fiber  facility.  As a result of our  lowered
          outlook,  we have permanently  abandoned this construction in progress
          as we no longer  believe the demand for optical fiber will warrant the
          investment necessary to complete this facility.  Corning will continue
          to mothball and depreciate the separate previously-operated portion of
          the Concord fiber facility.

     .    Other  businesses:  We recorded net credits of $42 million,  primarily
          for  gains on the sale of  assets  of  Corning  Asahi  Video  Products
          Company  (CAV)  sold to a  third  party  in  China.  This  represented
          proceeds  in excess of assumed  salvage  values for assets  previously
          impaired. In July 2004, we completed the sale of CAV's assets.

     Assets to be held and used

     Due to our decision to  permanently  abandon  certain  assets and lower our
     long-term  outlook  for the  Telecommunications  segment  during  the third
     quarter of 2004, we determined  that an event of impairment had occurred in
     our  Telecommunications  segment  which  required us to test the  segment's
     long-lived  assets other than goodwill for impairment.  As a result of this
     impairment  evaluation,  we recorded a $24 million impairment charge in the
     third quarter of 2004 to write-down certain assets to fair value.

     2003 Impairment Charge

     Assets to be disposed of by sale or abandonment

     These charges comprise the following:
     .    Telecommunications  segment:  We  recorded  charges of $24  million to
          impair plant and equipment  related to the shutdown of a cabling plant
          and the final exit of the photonic technologies  business. The charges
          were more than  offset by a $61  million  credit  related to  previous
          restructuring plans,  primarily the result of decision not to exit two
          of the cable sites previously marked for shutdown in 2002.

     .    Other  businesses:  We  recorded  charges  of $78  million,  primarily
          related to our decision to shutdown  CAV, and the closure of our North
          Brookfield semiconductor materials plant.







     2002 Impairment Charges

     Assets to be disposed of by sale or abandonment

     In 2002, in  connection  with the  restructuring  actions we recorded a net
     charge of $701 million related to facilities to be shut down or dispose of,
     and the  abandonment of certain  construction  projects.  These net charges
     were  primarily  related  to the  Telecommunications  segment  and  certain
     research facilities.

     Assets to be held and used

     These charges comprise the following:
     .    Telecommunications  segment:  In 2002, the  telecommunications  market
          underwent  a  dramatic  decline in demand  for its  products  as major
          buyers of network  equipment in this  industry  reduced  their capital
          spending.  As a result of our  impairment  evaluation,  the  photonics
          assets were written down to estimated  salvage  value,  as this amount
          was our best  estimate of fair value.  This resulted in a $269 million
          write-down of the long-lived  assets  including $90 million related to
          patents.

     .    Other  businesses:  In 2002,  the market was  impacted by a decline in
          demand for conventional  television  glass and a dramatic  increase in
          the  importation of television  glass,  tubes and sets from Asia. As a
          result of our impairment evaluation, CAV's assets were written down to
          their  estimated  fair  values.   This  resulted  in  a  $140  million
          write-down of the assets.

     Accelerated Depreciation
     ------------------------

     2004 Accelerated Depreciation

     We recorded $37 million of accelerated  depreciation  relating to the final
     shutdown  of  our  semiconductor   materials   manufacturing   facility  in
     Charleston,  South  Carolina,  which we announced in the fourth  quarter of
     2003.

     2003 Accelerated Depreciation

     We recorded  $12  million of  accelerated  depreciation  as a result of our
     decision to shutdown our semiconductor  materials manufacturing facility in
     Charleston, South Carolina by March 31, 2004.

     Loss on Sale of Businesses
     --------------------------

     2004 Loss on Sale of Business

     On  September  1,  2004 we  completed  the sale of our  frequency  controls
     business,  which was part of the  Telecommunications  segment, for net cash
     proceeds of $80  million.  We  recorded a loss on the sale of $14  million,
     which  included  an  allocation  of $30  million of the  Telecommunications
     segment goodwill.  The frequency controls business had 2003 annual sales of
     $76 million.

     2003 Loss on Sale of Business

     In the third quarter of 2003, we recorded a $13 million loss on the sale of
     a significant portion of our photonic technologies business, which was part
     of our Telecommunications segment.

     2002 Loss on Sale of Business

     We  recorded  a loss of $16  million  upon  the  sale of a  portion  of the
     controls   and   connectors   product   line,   which   was   part  of  the
     Telecommunications segment.

     Impairment of Cost Investments
     ------------------------------

     2003 Impairment Charge

     In the first  quarter of 2003,  we  recorded a $5 million  charge for other
     than   temporary    declines   in   certain   cost   investments   in   the
     Telecommunications  segment.  In the third  quarter of 2003,  we sold these
     investments  for $4  million  in  cash,  which  was $1  million  more  than
     previously  expected.  We reported  this gain as a credit to  restructuring
     actions.

     2002 Impairment Charge

     We   impaired   cost   based   investments   in   a   number   of   private
     telecommunications companies based upon a decision in the fourth quarter of
     2002 to divest the portfolio.  As a result of this decision,  we recorded a
     charge of $107 million.






     Restructuring Actions
     ---------------------

     2004 Restructuring Actions

     There were no significant restructuring actions taken during 2004, nor were
     there  any   significant   revisions  to  estimates   used  in  prior  year
     restructuring plans.

     2003 Restructuring Actions

     Corning  recorded net  restructuring  charges of $41 million in 2003. Major
     actions approved and initiated in 2003 included the following:

     .    The shutdown of CAV.
     .    The  exit of our  photonics  products  within  the  Telecommunications
          segment.
     .    Credits to prior year restructuring plans, primarily the result of our
          decision not to exit two small  cabling  sites  previously  marked for
          shutdown in 2002.
     .    The  shutdown  of  two  of  our  specialty   materials   manufacturing
          facilities in North Brookfield and Charleston, South Carolina.

     2002 Restructuring Actions

     Corning recorded net  restructuring  charges of $447 million in 2002. Major
     actions approved and initiated in 2002 included the following:

     .    Permanent  closure of our optical  fiber  manufacturing  facilities in
          Noble Park, Victoria,  Australia, and Neustadt bei Coburg, Germany. We
          also mothballed our optical fiber  manufacturing  facility in Concord,
          North Carolina and transferred certain capabilities to our Wilmington,
          North Carolina facility.
     .    Reductions in capacity and  employment in our cabling and hardware and
          equipment locations worldwide to reduce costs.
     .    Permanent  closure  of our  photonic  technologies  thin  film  filter
          manufacturing facility in Marlborough, Massachusetts.
     .    Permanent  abandonment of certain construction  projects that had been
          stopped  in  2001  in  the  fiber  and  cable   business   within  the
          Telecommunications segment.
     .    Closure  of  minor   manufacturing   facilities,   primarily   in  the
          Telecommunications segment.
     .    Closure and  consolidation  of research  facilities.
     .    Elimination of positions  worldwide  through voluntary and involuntary
          programs.

Asbestos settlement

On  March  28,  2003,  we  announced  that we had  reached  agreement  with  the
representatives  of asbestos  claimants  for the  settlement  of all current and
future   non-premises   asbestos  claims  against  us  and  Pittsburgh   Corning
Corporation (PCC), which might arise from PCC products or operations.

The agreement is expected to be incorporated into a settlement fund as part of a
reorganization  plan for PCC. The plan was  submitted to the federal  bankruptcy
court at the end of 2003, received a favorable vote from creditor classes in the
first quarter of 2004,  but remains  subject to a number of  contingencies.  The
Bankruptcy  Court has allowed an additional round of briefing to address current
case law developments,  with briefs due on February 28, 2005 and March 10, 2005,
leading  to a  hearing  on March 16,  2005.  The  timing  and  outcome  of these
proceedings are uncertain. If the Bankruptcy Court does not confirm the PCC Plan
in  its  current  form,  changes  to the  settlement  agreement  are  reasonably
possible. Further judicial review is also reasonably possible. Our contributions
to the settlement  trust under the agreement are not required unless the plan is
approved, becomes effective and is no longer subject to appeal.

If the plan becomes  effective,  our settlement will require the contribution of
our equity interest in PCC, our one-half  equity interest in Pittsburgh  Corning
Europe N.V. (PCE),  and 25 million shares of our common stock.  The common stock
will be marked-to-market  each quarter until it is contributed to the settlement
trust,  thus resulting in adjustments to income and the settlement  liability as
appropriate.  We will  also  make cash  payments  with a  current  value of $144
million over six years beginning one year after the plan becomes  effective.  In
addition,  we will assign insurance  policy proceeds from our primary  insurance
and a portion of our excess insurance as part of the settlement.






The  following  summarizes  the  charges  we  have  recorded  for  the  asbestos
settlement (in millions):

Loss From Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes



(Provision) Benefit for Income Taxes

Our (provision)  benefit for income taxes and the related effective (income tax)
benefit rates were as follows (in millions):

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Provision) benefit for income taxes   $   (1,031)    $   254         $    726
Effective (income tax) benefit rate         (65.3)%        33.4%           26.7%
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The  effective  (income tax) benefit rate for 2004,  2003 and 2002 differed from
the U.S.  statutory  rate of 35%  primarily  due to increases  in the  valuation
allowance against certain domestic (U.S.  federal,  state and local) and foreign
deferred  tax  assets,  and,  for 2004  only,  the  write-off  of  nondeductible
goodwill.

During  2004,  we  increased  our tax expense by $937 million as a result of our
decision to establish a valuation allowance against a significant portion of our
deferred tax assets, primarily in the U.S. and Germany. We reached this decision
by  performing  a review of all positive and  negative  evidence  regarding  the
realization of the net deferred tax assets in accordance with SFAS No. 109. This
assessment  included  the  evaluation  of  scheduled  reversals  of deferred tax
liabilities,  estimates  of projected  future  taxable  income and  tax-planning
strategies,  as well as  related  key  assumptions.  SFAS  109  requires  that a
valuation allowance be established when it is more likely than not that all or a
portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.  SFAS 109 further requires
that "greater weight be given to previous cumulative losses than the outlook for
future profitability when determining whether deferred tax assets can be used."

We have incurred significant losses in the U.S. and Germany due primarily to the
restructuring   and   impairment   charges   and   operating   losses   in   our
Telecommunications  segment  over the last four years.  As a result of the third
quarter of 2004 impairment charges and the lowering of our long-term outlook for
the  Telecommunications  segment,  our  largest  U.S.  and German  business,  we
concluded that a valuation  allowance  against  certain  deferred tax assets was
required.






We expect to  maintain a valuation  allowance  on future tax  benefits  until an
appropriate  level of  profitability,  primarily  in the U.S.  and  Germany,  is
sustained  or we are able to develop tax planning  strategies  that enable us to
conclude  that it is more likely than not that a larger  portion of our deferred
tax assets would be realizable,  or if the PCC  settlement is finalized  earlier
than we anticipate.  Until then, our tax provision will include only the net tax
expense  attributable  to certain  foreign  operations.  Refer to Note 6 (Income
Taxes) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

The 2004 and 2003 increases in equity earnings of associated  companies,  net of
impairments, are primarily due to the following:
..    Strong sales and earnings  performance at Samsung Precision Glass Co., Ltd.
     (Samsung Corning Precision),  our 50% owned South Korea-based  manufacturer
     of LCD glass.
..    The  recognition  of equity  earnings  from Dow  Corning  Corporation  (Dow
     Corning) in 2003 and strong sales and earnings performance in 2004.

In addition to the above,  equity in earnings of  associated  companies,  net of
impairments, included the following restructuring and impairment charges:
..    $35 million,  $7 million and $34 million of charges to impair equity method
     investments in the Telecommunications segment to their estimated fair value
     in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
..    In 2004, Dow Corning recorded charges related to restructuring  actions and
     adjustments  to  interest   liabilities  recorded  on  its  emergence  from
     bankruptcy.  Our equity  earnings  included  $21  million  related to these
     charges.
..    In 2003, Samsung Corning Co., Ltd. recorded asset impairment  charges.  Our
     equity earnings included $66 million related to these charges.
..    In 2002,  Samsung Corning Micro Optics recorded asset  impairment  charges.
     Our equity earnings included $20 million related to these charges.

Loss From Continuing Operations



RESULTS OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

On December 13, 2002, we completed the sale of our precision lens business to 3M
Company  (3M) for cash  proceeds  up to $850  million,  of which $50 million was
deposited in an escrow  account.  During 2002,  we received  approximately  $800
million in cash and recorded a gain on the sale of $415 million,  net of tax, in
income  from   discontinued   operations  in  the  consolidated   statements  of
operations.  3M notified  Corning that 3M believed it had certain claims arising
out of the representations and warranties made by Corning in connection with the
sale of the precision lens business to 3M. In the third quarter of 2004, Corning
and 3M  reached  a final  settlement  agreement  for the funds  held in  escrow.
Accordingly, we received $20 million in cash and recorded a gain of $20 million.

The precision lens business  operating  results and cash flows have been removed
from our results of continuing  operations for all periods  presented,  and have
been excluded from the operating  segments data.  Refer to Note 2  (Discontinued
Operations) to the  consolidated  financial  statements  for selected  financial
information  for the years  ended  December  31,  2004 and 2002.  There  were no
results from discontinued operations in 2003.






OPERATING SEGMENTS

Our   reportable    operating    segments    included   Display    Technologies,
Telecommunications,   Environmental   Technologies,   and  Life  Sciences.   The
Environmental   Technologies   reportable  segment  is  an  aggregation  of  our
Automotive and Diesel  operating  segments,  as these two segments share similar
economic  characteristics,  products,  customer types,  production processes and
distribution methods. The following provides a brief description of the products
and markets served by each reportable segment:

..    Display  Technologies - manufactures  liquid crystal display glass for flat
     panel displays;
..    Telecommunications - manufactures optical fiber and cable, and hardware and
     equipment components for the worldwide telecommunications industry;
..    Environmental  Technologies - manufactures  ceramic  substrates and filters
     for automobile and diesel applications; and
..    Life Sciences - manufactures  glass and plastic  consumables for scientific
     applications.

Our segment presentation  reflects how Corning's Chief Operating Decision Making
group (CODM) allocates resources and assesses the performance of its businesses.

We prepared the financial results for our operating  segments on a basis that is
consistent  with  the  manner  in  which we  internally  disaggregate  financial
information to assist in making  internal  operating  decisions.  We include the
earnings of equity  affiliates  that are closely  associated  with our operating
segments in the  respective  segment's  net income.  We have  allocated  certain
common  expenses  among  segments  differently  than we  would  for  stand-alone
financial  information  prepared in accordance with GAAP. These expenses include
interest,  taxes  and  corporate  functions.  Segment  net  income  may  not  be
consistent with measures used by other companies. The accounting policies of our
operating  segments are the same as those applied in the consolidated  financial
statements.

Display Technologies


2004 vs. 2003

The 2004 sales increase is largely  reflective of the overall LCD-market growth.
During 2004,  glass  substrate  volumes  (measured in square feet of glass sold)
increased  approximately  65%.  Sales also  benefited  from modest average price
increases,  primarily  the  result  of a change  in  product  mix as the  market
continues to trend toward large size glass  substrates  (generation 5 and above)
which carry a higher  selling  price per square  foot.  The sales of the Display
Technologies  segment are denominated in Japanese Yen and, as such, our revenues
are  susceptible  to movements  in the US dollar - Japanese Yen exchange  rates.
Sales  benefited  by  approximately  10% from a  weakening  of the  U.S.  dollar
compared to 2003.

For 2004, the key drivers for the increase in income before equity earnings were
the impact of incremental volumes and efficiencies realized through the shift in
production toward large size glass  substrates.  Movements in exchange rates did
not have a significant impact on income before equity earnings.  The increase in
our equity  earnings from Samsung  Corning  Precision were largely driven by the
same factors identified for our wholly-owned business.

The Display  Technologies  segment  manufactures and sells glass substrates to a
concentrated  customer base comprised of LCD panel makers  primarily  located in
Japan  and  Taiwan.  The  most  significant   customers  in  these  markets  are
AU Optronics  Corp.,  Chi Mei  Optoelectronics  Corp.,  Hannstar  Display Corp.,
Quanta Display Inc.,  Sharp  Corporation,  and Toppan CFI (Taiwan) Co., Ltd. LCD
panels are used in computer  products,  such as notebook  computers  and desktop
monitors,  consumer electronics products, such as digital cameras and camcorders
and car  navigation  systems,  and  LCD  televisions.  In  2004,  these  six LCD
customers  accounted  for 76% of the  Display  Technologies  segment  sales.  In
addition,  Samsung Corning Precision's sales were also concentrated,  with three
LCD panel makers in Korea  (Samsung  Electronics  Co., Ltd., LG Philips LCD Co.,
and BOE Hydis Technology Co., Ltd.) accounting for 88% of sales.

Corning and these  customers  have  typically  entered  into  multi-year  supply
agreements  for the  purchase  and sale of glass  substrates.  These  agreements
provide for Corning to supply a percentage of the  customers'  requirements  and
include  mechanisms for forecasting and ordering.  During 2004, Corning improved
the payment  terms under these  agreements  to improve  cash flow and reduce its
working capital requirements.






We expect the LCD market to  continue  to grow  rapidly.  We  anticipate  higher
demand for LCD  televisions,  for which our LCD  customers  require  larger size
glass  substrates.  During 2004,  Corning held  discussions  with several of its
customers  to  discuss  how to meet  this  demand.  As part of its  discussions,
Corning has sought improved payment terms, including deposits against orders, to
provide a greater degree of assurance that we are effectively  building capacity
to meet the needs of a rapidly growing industry.  There can be no assurance that
Corning will be able to pace its capacity expansion to the actual demand.  While
the  industry  has  grown  rapidly,  the  pace of  growth  may be  less  than we
anticipate,  and it is possible  that glass  manufacturing  capacity  may exceed
demand during certain periods.

In 2004,  Corning and a Taiwanese customer entered into a long-term purchase and
supply  agreement  (as amended) in which the Display  Technologies  segment will
supply  LCD  glass  to the  customer  over a  five-year  period.  As part of the
agreement,  the  customer  will make  advance  cash  deposits of $460 million to
Corning  through  2006 for a portion of the  contracted  glass to be  purchased.
Corning  received a total of $204 million of deposits against orders in 2004 and
expects to receive an additional $171 million in 2005.  Refer to Note 1 (Summary
of  Significant  Accounting  Policies)  and Note 10 (Other  Liabilities)  to the
consolidated financial statements for further information.

In  the  ordinary  course  of  business,  Corning  will  continue  to  negotiate
multi-year supply agreements with its large customers where feasible.

2003 vs. 2002

The 2003 sales increase was primarily due to volume gains of approximately  43%,
as penetration of liquid crystal display panels in the desktop market increased,
and favorable exchange rates. Earnings approximately doubled in 2003 compared to
the prior year due to the  increase  in volume and  significant  gains in equity
earnings from Samsung Corning Precision over the prior year.

In July 2003,  we  announced  a $180  million  expansion  of our liquid  crystal
display glass manufacturing facility in Taiwan.

Outlook:
We expect to see a  continuation  of the overall  industry  growth and the trend
toward  large  size  substrates.  We  continue  to see  positive  trends  in the
penetration rates of LCD's into the end-markets  (notebook  computers,  monitors
and televisions),  and increasing  demand for the large size substrates.  Volume
growth for the LCD market is  anticipated to be between 40% and 60% in 2005, and
we anticipate  adding  sufficient  capacity to meet market  growth.  This market
growth will occur at varying rates in the principal LCD markets of Japan, Taiwan
and  Korea.   Sales  of  our  wholly-owned   business  are  primarily  to  panel
manufacturers  in Japan and Taiwan with  customers  in Korea  being  serviced by
Samsung Corning Precision.  The actual growth rates in these markets will impact
our sales and earnings performance. For 2005, we are anticipating price declines
after two years of price stability as competitors bring on additional  capacity.
We also anticipate our costs will continue to decline. There can be no assurance
that the end-market rates of growth will continue at the high rates  experienced
in recent years or that the rate of cost declines will offset price  declines in
any given period.  Consumer  preferences for panels of differing sizes, or price
or other  factors,  may lead to pauses in market  growth from time to time.  For
2005, Corning's rate of sales growth is expected to be higher in the second half
of the year based on anticipated  increases in panel manufacturers'  capacity to
meet the anticipated market demands for LCD televisions. We expect net income in
the segment to increase  significantly in 2005 based on the strong volume growth
in our wholly-owned  business and increased equity earnings from Samsung Corning
Precision.

Telecommunications







2004 vs. 2003

During 2004 we experienced a stabilization of the  telecommunications  industry.
Fiber volumes grew at a stronger than  anticipated  18%, but pricing declined by
9% from 2003 levels. Although we are encouraged by the volume growth, the demand
comes from a narrow band of customers  and we do not view this as the  beginning
of a broader  recovery in the  industry.  The primary  driver for the 2004 sales
growth  was  Verizon  Communications'  fiber-to-the-premises  project  in  North
America,  with  the  most  significant  benefit  realized  in our  hardware  and
equipment products. During 2004, one customer accounted for 13% of total segment
sales, and 10 customers accounted for 47% of total segment sales.

Offsetting this sales performance were the following items:
..    During 2003 we  completed  the sale and exit of our  photonic  technologies
     business.
..    On  September  1,  2004 we  completed  the sale of our  frequency  controls
     business. This business had 2003 annual sales of $76 million.
..    Sales in Japan were down in 2004,  largely due to 2003  projects  that were
     not repeated in 2004.

Movements in foreign  exchange  rates,  primarily the Japanese Yen and Euro, did
not have a significant impact on 2004 sales compared to 2003.

In  June  2004,  the  Chinese   Ministry  of  Commerce  issued  an  anti-dumping
preliminary  determination  asserting that Corning had dumped optical fiber into
China  during 2002 and 2003 and imposed a 16% duty on  Corning's  optical  fiber
imports. Corning contested this preliminary determination, and in December 2004,
the Ministry of Commerce  concluded  that Corning had not dumped  optical  fiber
into China and the 16% duty was removed.

The increased net loss for 2004 is primarily attributable to the goodwill, fixed
asset and equity method  investments  impairment  charges  recorded in the third
quarter of 2004.  Refer to  Results  of  Continuing  Operations  for  additional
information on these charges.

2003 vs. 2002

The   2003   sales   decrease   is   primarily   attributable   to  the   global
telecommunications  market  downturn  that  continued  into 2003.  Overall fiber
volumes increased 11%, and pricing pressures  continued with overall declines of
31%.  The lack of capital  spending by our  customers  negatively  affected  all
product  lines,  and the sale of our appliance  controls  group further  reduced
hardware and equipment  sales.  Also during 2003, we completed the sale and exit
of our photonic  technologies  business.  Partially  offsetting  this was strong
demand for optical  fiber and cable  products in Japan and China.  2003  volumes
benefited  from  having  the full year  results of the  Chinese  fiber and cable
entities acquired from Lucent Technologies in the fourth quarter of 2002.

Outlook:
We  expect  sales  in 2005 to  increase  over  2004.  We  expect  the  worldwide
telecommunications  industry market to grow,  particularly in North America, but
still do not view this as the beginning of a broad-based  industry recovery.  We
expect fiber volumes to increase  modestly and pricing pressures should again be
moderate.  Sales  improvement  will largely be dependent on the  continuation of
Verizon's fiber-to-the-premises project, and should these plans not occur at the
pace anticipated our sales and earnings would be adversely  affected.  We expect
to realize a loss in 2005,  although at  significantly  lower  levels than 2004.
This  reduction  in  anticipated  segment  loss  is  largely  attributed  to the
impairment  charges  incurred in 2004, as well as the  operational  efficiencies
from increased volumes in 2005.

Environmental Technologies







2004 vs. 2003

The 2004  increase  in net sales is  primarily  the  result  of  demand  for our
automotive and diesel  ceramic  filters and substrates in response to tightening
emissions  control  standards  around  the  world.  Volumes  for our  automotive
products were up slightly from 2003 and sales benefited from a higher mix of our
thin-wall and ultra thin-wall  substrates,  which allow engine  manufacturers to
meet their emissions control  requirements in a more cost effective manner.  Our
diesel  products  sales  growth was  primarily  driven by demand  from  retrofit
markets,  although we experienced a softening in Asian  retrofit  markets in the
second half of 2004.  A portion of the sales of the  Environmental  Technologies
segment are  susceptible to movements in the U.S.  dollar-Euro  exchange  rates.
Movements in exchange rates did not have a significant  impact on sales for 2004
compared to 2003.

The Environmental  Technologies segment sells to a concentrated customer base of
manufacturers  of emission  control  systems,  who then sell to  automotive  and
diesel  engine  manufacturers.  Although our sales are to the  emission  control
systems  manufacturers,  the use of our  substrates  and filters  are  generally
required  by  the   specifications   of  the   automotive   and  diesel   engine
manufacturers.  For 2004,  four  customers  accounted  for 69% of total  segment
sales.

The 2004 decline in net income is primarily the result of increased  development
costs and plant start-up costs to support our emerging  diesel  products.  These
costs offset the gross margin  benefits of increased  volumes and the higher mix
of  premium   automotive   products.   Movements  in  exchange   rates  did  not
significantly impact net income.

2003 vs. 2002

The 2003  increase  in net  sales  was  primarily  due to  increased  U.S.  auto
production  driven by financing  incentives,  favorable mix of premium products,
favorable  exchange rates and higher sales for diesel  products.  The net income
decrease was primarily due to a decrease in equity  earnings from  Cormetech,  a
U.S. designer and manufacturer of industrial  catalysts,  and higher development
spending for the diesel product line.

Outlook:
We expect sales to increase in 2005. For automotive  products,  we expect to see
stable demand based on anticipated worldwide auto production, and a continuation
of a shift to premium  products;  although at slightly  slower  rates than 2004.
Although  volumes are anticipated to be stable,  a slowdown in auto  production,
particularly in North America,  could adversely  impact our growth  projections.
Diesel  product sales are also expected to grow.  Demand for diesel  products in
2005 will be largely based on retrofit markets,  and we expect a recovery of the
Asian  market  during  the year.  In 2005,  we must  successfully  complete  the
development  of our diesel  technology  and have our filters  designed  into the
specifications  of engine  manufacturers to meet anticipated  demand in 2006 and
beyond as diesel  engine  manufacturers  ramp up  production  for the 2007 model
years. The retrofit market is somewhat volatile,  and any unanticipated declines
in demand could adversely impact our expected 2005 sales growth.  Net income for
the  segment is expected  to  increase  only  slightly in 2005 as we continue to
spend heavily on research, development and engineering for diesel products.

Life Sciences



2004 vs. 2003

The 2004 increase in net sales is primarily due to volume  increases  across the
majority of our product lines. Demand from research,  development and production
end-users  remained steady for 2004,  which  represented an improvement over the
industry-wide softness experienced in 2003. Movements in foreign exchange rates,
primarily the Euro, did not have a significant impact on sales for 2004 compared
to 2003.






The Life  Sciences  segment sells to a  concentrated  customer  base,  primarily
distributors,  who  in  turn  sell  to  end-users  such  as  pharmaceutical  and
biotechnology  companies,  government entities,  academic institutions and other
research  facilities.  For 2004,  two  distributors  accounted  for 56% of total
segment sales. One of these  distributors  communicated its intent to change its
ongoing business strategy in the second half of 2004. Subsequent to December 31,
2004,  Corning  notified  this  distributor  that we will not renew its existing
distribution  agreement,  which will expire in April 2005.  Approximately 30% of
Life  Sciences  2004 sales were made through this  distributor.  We are actively
working to  transition  the sales  through  this  distributor  to our  remaining
primary distributor and other existing and developing  channels.  However,  this
change will likely adversely impact sales volumes in the short term.

The 2004  decrease  in net  income  is  largely  attributable  to  gross  margin
improvements  resulting  from the increase in sales  volume being  substantially
offset  by new  product  development  costs.  In  addition,  in 2003 net  income
benefited  from a gain  recognized on the  disposition  of a minor product line.
Movement in exchange rates did not significantly impact net income.

2003 vs. 2002

Sales were flat in 2003, compared to 2002, primarily due to weak sales in Europe
and a general  softness in the market.  Earnings  were down 44%  compared to the
prior year. Improved manufacturing  efficiencies,  and a gain on the disposition
of a minor product line, were more than offset by higher development spending.

Outlook:
We expect to see a  continuation  of the research,  development  and  production
spending in the life sciences market. Sales will likely be adversely impacted by
as  much  as  10%  to 20% by the  recent  changes  in the  distribution  channel
described  above;  particularly  in the U.S.  Net income for 2005 is expected to
decline  from 2004 levels,  largely due to increases in new product  development
and commercialization  expenditures and the anticipated impact of the changes in
distribution channel.

Unallocated and Other



Unallocated and Other includes all other operating segments that do not meet the
quantitative  threshold for separate reporting (e.g.  Specialty  Materials,  and
Conventional Video Components), certain corporate investments (e.g. Dow Corning,
Samsung Corning and Steuben), discontinued operations, and unallocated expenses.
Unallocated expenses include research and other expenses related to new business
development;  gains or losses on  repurchases  and  retirement of debt;  charges
related to the asbestos litigation; restructuring and impairment charges related
to the corporate  research and development or staff  organizations;  and charges
for  increases  in our tax  valuation  allowance.  Unallocated  and  Other  also
represents the reconciliation between the totals for the reportable segments and
our consolidated total.

The 2004 increase in net sales is primarily  attributable to improvements in our
Specialty  Materials  segment.  Although this segment  experienced  strong sales
growth in 2004,  primarily for  semiconductor  lens glass,  we do not expect the
pace of growth to continue into 2005.  The 2004 decrease in  Conventional  Video
Components  sales is due to our  2003  decision,  along  with  our  partner,  to
shutdown CAV. The 2003 decrease in net sales is primarily due to the shutdown of
CAV and  weak  demand  for  semiconductor  lens  glass  due to  softness  in the
semiconductor market.

Refer to Restructuring,  Impairment,  and Other Charges and (Credits),  Asbestos
settlement,  and  (Provision)  Benefit for Income Taxes for a description of the
key drivers of net (loss) income for 2004 vs. 2003 and 2003 vs. 2002.






LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Financing Structure

During 2004, we engaged in the following significant transactions:
..    Issued $400 million of senior unsecured notes under our existing universal
     shelf registration statement. At December 31, 2004, our remaining capacity
     under the shelf registration is approximately $2.5 billion.
..    Retired a total of $487 million of our 3.5% convertible debentures and zero
     coupon convertible debentures in exchange for $154 million of cash and 38
     million shares of common stock.
..    Repaid $115 million of loans payable, the majority of which related to our
     7.625% debentures due 2024, as a result of certain bond holders exercising
     their early repayment option.

We currently have unrestricted  access to a $2 billion revolving credit facility
with 16 banks. At December 31, 2004,  there were no borrowings  under the credit
facility.  The facility  includes one financial  covenant  limiting the ratio of
total debt to total  capital,  as defined,  to not greater than 60%. At December
31, 2004, this ratio was 41%. Our revolving  credit  facility  expires in August
2005 and we are currently  negotiating  with leading  financial  institutions to
arrange a new credit  facility.  We believe that a new credit  facility  will be
arranged  and  executed  in the  first  half of 2005 on  competitive  terms  and
conditions. Corning is seeking up to a $1.0 billion credit facility with up to a
five  year  term.  Among  the terms and  conditions  being  negotiated,  Corning
believes it will be subject to two financial covenants.

The  remaining  zero coupon  convertible  debentures,  totaling  $272 million at
December 31, 2004, will likely be put back to us on November 8, 2005, at $819.54
per  debenture  or on November 8, 2010,  at $905.29 per  debenture.  We have the
option of settling this  obligation in cash,  common stock,  or a combination of
both.  From time to time, we may retire  additional  debt securities for cash or
equity.

Additionally,  effective  November 8, 2004,  we have the right to redeem some or
all of the outstanding 3.5% convertible debentures at any time prior to maturity
at redemption prices ranging from 102.0% to 100.5% of the principal amount based
on the date we exercise our redemption  options. It is possible that during 2005
we may exercise this redemption  option,  or execute other privately  negotiated
transactions,  to  retire  some  or all of our  $297  million  outstanding  3.5%
convertible debentures.

Capital Spending

Capital  spending  totaled $857 million,  $366 million and $357 million in 2004,
2003 and 2002,  respectively.  Capital spending  activity in 2004, 2003 and 2002
primarily  included  expansion  of LCD  capacity  and new  capacity  for  diesel
substrates.  Our 2005  capital  spending  program is expected to be in the range
of$1.2 billion to $1.4 billion, of which $900 million to $1.1 billion will be to
expand   manufacturing   capacity  for  LCD  glass  substrates  in  the  Display
Technologies  segment.   These  expenditures   primarily  relate  to  previously
announced expansion plans for our existing  manufacturing  facilities in Tainan,
Taiwan  and  Shizuoka,  Japan  and for the  construction  of a new  facility  in
Taichung,  Taiwan.  Additionally,  approximately  $140  million will be directed
toward our  Environmental  Technologies  segment in anticipation of the emerging
diesel emissions control market.

Restructuring

During 2004,  2003 and 2002, we made  payments of $85 million,  $233 million and
$278 million,  respectively,  related to employee severance and other exit costs
resulting from restructuring  actions. Cash payments for employee-related  costs
will be  substantially  completed  by the end of 2005,  while  payments for exit
activities will be substantially completed by the end of 2007.

Key Balance Sheet Data

At December 31, 2004, cash, cash equivalents and short-term  investments totaled
$1.9 billion, compared with $1.3 billion at December 31, 2003. The increase from
December  31,  2003,  was  primarily  due to the  issuance  of $400  million  of
long-term debt and improved operating cash flows,  including the receipt of $204
million in customer deposits.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our 2004  earnings  were not  adequate to cover our fixed  charges  (principally
interest and related  charges on debt),  primarily as a result of the impairment
charges in the  Telecommunications  segment and our  decision  to  increase  our
valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets. We expect our full year
2005 earnings will be sufficient to cover our fixed charges.

Management Assessment of Liquidity

Our major source of funding for 2005 and beyond will be our existing  balance of
cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. From time to time we may also
issue debt or equity  securities to raise  additional  cash to fund a portion of
our capital  expenditures  related to our growth  businesses.  We are  currently
negotiating  with leading  financial  institutions for a new credit facility and
believe we will arrange and execute one in the first half of 2005. We believe we
have  sufficient  liquidity  for the  next  several  years  to fund  operations,
restructuring,  the  asbestos  settlement,  research  and  development,  capital
expenditures and scheduled debt repayments.

Contractual Obligations


(1)  At December 31, 2004,  $34 million of the $52 million was included in other
     accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.
(2)  Balance   primarily    represents    obligations    associated   with   the
     Telecommunications segment.
(3)  Capital   expenditure   obligations   primarily   related  to  our  Display
     Technologies segment expansions, which are included on our balance sheet.
(4)  At December 31, 2004,  $2,692 million of the $2,694 million was included on
     our balance sheet. Amounts above are stated at their maturity value.






We have provided other  financial  guarantees and contingent  liabilities in the
form of stand-by letters of credit and performance  bonds,  some of which do not
have fixed or  scheduled  expiration  dates.  We have agreed to provide a credit
facility  related to Dow Corning as  discussed  in Note 7  (Investments)  to the
consolidated  financial  statements.  The  funding  of the  Dow  Corning  credit
facility will be required only if Dow Corning is not otherwise  able to meet its
scheduled funding  obligations in its confirmed  Bankruptcy Plan. We believe the
significant majority of these guarantees and contingent  liabilities will expire
without being funded.

Pensions

We have a number of defined benefit pension plans covering  certain domestic and
international  employees.  Our largest  single  pension plan is  Corning's  U.S.
qualified  plan.  At  December  31,  2004,  this plan  accounted  for 82% of our
consolidated defined benefit pension plans' projected benefit obligation and 91%
of the related plans' assets.  In 2004 and 2003,  although  global  equities had
positive returns,  interest rates continued to decline. As a result, at December
31, 2004 and 2003, the  accumulated  benefit  obligation  (ABO) for our domestic
qualified and non-qualified  plans and several  international plans exceeded the
fair  value of  related  plan  assets,  which  required  Corning  to  record  an
additional minimum pension liability in accordance with SFAS No. 87, "Employers'
Accounting for Pensions."

Balances of these non-cash adjustments follow (in millions):

Other accumulated comprehensive loss, after-tax            273              159
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have  traditionally  contributed  to the U.S.  qualified  pension  plan on an
annual  basis  in  excess  of the IRS  minimum  requirements,  and as a  result,
mandatory  contributions  are not expected to be required for this plan until at
least 2008. We  contributed  $40 million in 2004 to our U.S.  pension plan.  For
2005, we anticipate  making voluntary  contributions of at least $100 million in
cash or common stock to this plan.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

The  preparation  of  financial  statements  requires us to make  estimates  and
assumptions that affect amounts reported therein. The estimates that required us
to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments follow.

Impairment of goodwill

SFAS 142 requires us to make certain difficult, subjective and complex judgments
on a number of matters,  including  assumptions  and estimates used to determine
the fair value of our reporting units, which are the same as our segments.

We measure fair value on the basis of discounted expected future cash flows. Our
estimates are based upon our historical  experience,  our current knowledge from
our commercial  relationships,  and available external  information about future
trends.

Telecommunications

Pricing in the  telecommunications  industry  remains  depressed.  Our  previous
forecasts  assumed  some  rationalization  of  capacity  that would lead to more
stable  pricing.  We now expect the  current  depressed  pricing  conditions  to
persist.   Based  on  competitive  conditions  and  forecasted  future  customer
requirements, we do not expect the level of demand for premium fiber products we
previously  forecasted.  As a result, we have significantly  reduced our outlook
for future  revenue and  profitability  from  premium  products.  As we forecast
customer demand,  we have lowered the rate of volume growth in the longer range.
Further negative developments in the telecommunications  industry could cause us
to change our forecasts for fiber  volumes,  pricing or mix of premium  products
which  may  result  in  additional  goodwill  impairment  charges  of up to $123
million.

Terminal value of the business  assumes a growth in perpetuity of 3%. These cash
flows are also used to value  intangible and tangible assets which determine the
implied  value of reporting  unit  goodwill.  The discount rate applied to these
cash flows  represents  a  telecommunications  weighted  average cost of capital
based upon current debt and equity activity of 11 public companies  representing
a cross section of worldwide  competitors  of the reporting  unit.  For our 2004
impairment  test,  we used a discount rate of 12.5% in our  calculation  of fair
value of the expected future cash flows. An impairment  charge of $1,420 million
was recorded in 2004. Had we used a discount rate of 12%, the impairment  charge
would have been  approximately $90 million lower. Had we used a discount rate of
13%, the impairment charge would have been  approximately $80 million higher. In
2003, we used a 12% discount rate for our annual impairment test. The results of
our 2003 test indicated  that goodwill was not impaired.  The 2003 results would
not have changed had we used a discount rate of 11.5% or 12.5%.






Specialty Materials

Our  discounted  cash  flow  test for this  reporting  unit  assumes a growth in
perpetuity  of 3%.  The  discount  rate  applied  to the  forecasted  cash flows
represents  weighed  average cost of capital  based upon current debt and equity
activity of eight public  companies  representing  a cross  section of worldwide
competitors  of the reporting  unit. For the 2004 and 2003  impairment  tests we
used a discount rate of 12% in our calculation of the fair value of the expected
future  cash  flows.  The  results  of our 2004 and 2003  tests  indicated  that
goodwill  was not  impaired.  The results  would not have  changed had we used a
discount rate of 11.5% or 12.5%.

Impairment of assets held for use

SFAS No. 144,  "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,"
requires us to assess the  recoverability  of the carrying  value of  long-lived
assets when an event of impairment  has occurred.  We must exercise  judgment in
assessing  whether  an  event  of  impairment  has  occurred.  For  purposes  of
recognition and measurement of an impairment  loss, a long-lived asset or assets
is grouped  with  other  assets and  liabilities  at the lowest  level for which
identifiable  cash  flows are  largely  independent  of the cash  flows of other
assets and liabilities.  We must exercise judgment in assessing the lowest level
for which  identifiable cash flows are largely  independent of the cash flows of
other assets and liabilities.

In 2004,  based on our decision to permanently  abandon certain assets and lower
our  outlook  for the  Telecommunications  segment,  we  determined  an event of
impairment  had  occurred in our  Telecommunications  segment.  We  performed an
impairment test on the segment's  long-lived  assets, and recorded a $24 million
charge to write-down certain assets to their fair value.

In 2003,  we concluded  events of impairment  had occurred in our  semiconductor
materials product line, which is part of the specialty  materials  segment,  and
performed  an  impairment  test.  The  results  of our test  indicated  that our
long-lived assets held for use were not impaired.

Restructuring charges and impairments resulting from restructuring actions

During 2004 and 2003, we recorded  write-downs of property,  plant and equipment
as a result of decisions to exit facilities, primarily in the Telecommunications
segment. Assets impaired were primarily equipment,  construction in progress and
buildings,  which were sold or abandoned.  We used  information  available  from
recent auctions of  telecommunications  equipment to estimate salvage value when
measuring impairment.  The estimated salvage values were very low, primarily due
to the depressed market for  telecommunications  related equipment.  The salvage
values of  property  impaired  were also  estimated  to be  minimal  as  certain
facilities  will be abandoned and not sold.  It is possible that actual  results
will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to reserves.

Valuation allowances for deferred income taxes

SFAS 109 requires us to exercise  judgment about our future results in assessing
the realizability of our deferred tax assets. At December 31, 2004,  Corning had
gross deferred tax assets of approximately $2.3 billion.  We determined that the
likelihood of  realization  of certain  deferred tax assets is less than 50% and
recorded additional  valuation  allowances of $1.2 billion in 2004 to reduce our
net deferred tax assets to $532 million.  If we sustain an appropriate  level of
profitability,  primarily in the U.S. and Germany,  or if we are able to develop
additional  tax-planning  strategies,  or if the  PCC  settlement  is  finalized
earlier than we anticipate, adjustments to these allowances will be required and
may affect future net income.

In  determining  the amount of domestic  deferred tax assets that we believe are
more likely than not to be realized  through a tax planning  strategy  involving
the sale of a non-strategic asset, we estimated the fair value of the underlying
non-strategic  asset based  primarily  on  discounted  cash flows and  precedent
transactions.  Changes in fair value of the non-strategic  asset may also affect
future net income.

Probability of litigation outcomes

SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies,"  requires us to make judgments about
future events that are inherently uncertain.  In making determinations of likely
outcomes of litigation  matters,  we consider the evaluation of outside  counsel
knowledgeable  about each  matter,  as well as known  outcomes in case law.  See
Legal  Proceedings  for a detailed  discussion of the key litigation  matters we
face.  The  most  significant  matter  involving  judgment  is the PCC  asbestos
liability.  There are a number of factors bearing upon our potential  liability,
including the inherent complexity of a Chapter 11 filing, our history of success
in defending  ourselves against asbestos claims,  our assessment of the strength
of our  corporate  veil  defenses,  our  continuing  dialogue with our insurance
carriers and the claimants' representatives,  and other factors. We have reached
a tentative  settlement  on PCC as  disclosed  in Legal  Proceedings  and Note 7
(Investments)  to the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements.  The  settlement  is
subject to a number of contingencies, including approval by the bankruptcy court
and resolution of any appeals.






Pension and other postretirement employee benefits (OPEB)

Pension and OPEB costs and  obligations  are  dependent on  assumptions  used in
calculating such amounts.  These assumptions include discount rates, health care
cost trend  rates,  benefits  earned,  interest  cost,  expected  return on plan
assets,  mortality  rates,  and other factors.  In accordance with GAAP,  actual
results that differ from the  assumptions  are  accumulated  and amortized  over
future  periods and,  therefore,  generally  affect  recognized  expense and the
recorded  obligation  in future  periods.  While  management  believes  that the
assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in
assumptions may affect Corning's  pension and other  postretirement  obligations
and future expense.



The above sensitivities  reflect impact of changing one assumption at a time. It
should be noted that  economic  factors and  conditions  often  affect  multiple
assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not
necessarily linear.

These  changes  in  assumptions  would  have  no  effect  on  Corning's  funding
requirements.  In addition,  at December 31, 2004, a 25 basis point  decrease in
the discount rate would decrease stockholders' equity by $55 million before tax;
a 25 basis point  increase in the  discount  rate would  increase  stockholders'
equity by $53  million.  With a 25 basis point  decrease in the  discount  rate,
certain  pension  plans  would  become  Accumulated   Benefit  Obligation  (ABO)
underfunded  resulting in a significantly  larger impact on equity compared to a
25 basis point increase in the discount rate. In addition, the impact of greater
than a 25 basis point decrease in discount rate would not be proportional to the
first 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate.

The following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in the discount rate
assumption related to Corning's U.S. OPEB plans:
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                            Effect on 2005       Effect on

25 basis point increase in discount rate     -$1 million       -$19 million
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time.
It should be noted that economic  factors and conditions  often affect  multiple
assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not
necessarily linear.

ENVIRONMENT

We have been named by the  Environmental  Protection  Agency under the Superfund
Act,  or by  state  governments  under  similar  state  laws,  as a  potentially
responsible party for 11 active hazardous waste sites.  Under the Superfund Act,
all  parties  who may have  contributed  any waste to a  hazardous  waste  site,
identified  by such  Agency,  are jointly and  severally  liable for the cost of
cleanup unless the Agency agrees  otherwise.  It is our policy to accrue for the
estimated   liability  related  to  Superfund  sites  and  other   environmental
liabilities  related  to  property  owned  and  operated  by us based on  expert
analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants.  We
have  accrued   approximately  $14  million  for  the  estimated  liability  for
environmental  cleanup and related  litigation at December 31, 2004.  Based upon
the  information  developed  to date,  we believe  that the accrued  amount is a
reasonable  estimate of our liability and that the risk of an additional loss in
an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote.






NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151,  "Inventory Costs - An Amendment
of ARB No. 43,  Chapter 4" ("SFAS 151").  SFAS 151 amends ARB No. 43, Chapter 4,
"Inventory  Pricing," to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense,
freight,  handling costs, and wasted material (spoilage) should be recognized as
current-period charges. Additionally, SFAS 151 requires that allocation of fixed
production  overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity
of the  production  facilities.  Corning is required to adopt SFAS 151 effective
January 1, 2006.  Corning  does not  expect the  adoption  of SFAS 151 to have a
material  impact  on  its  consolidated  results  of  operations  and  financial
condition.

In December  2004,  the FASB issued SFAS No. 123  (revised  2004),  "Share-Based
Payment" ("SFAS 123R"), which replaces SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation,"  ("SFAS 123") and supercedes APB Opinion No. 25,  "Accounting for
Stock  Issued to  Employees."  SFAS 123R  requires all  share-based  payments to
employees,  including grants of employee stock options,  to be recognized in the
financial  statements at fair value beginning in Corning's third quarter.  Under
SFAS 123R,  Corning must determine the  appropriate  fair value model to be used
for valuing share-based payments, the amortization method for compensation cost,
and the transition  method to be used at date of adoption.  The standard permits
three transition method adoption alternatives:

..    "Prospective adoption" would require Corning to begin expensing share-based
     payments after July 1, 2005.  Prior interim and annual periods would not be
     restated.
..    "Modified  prospective  adoption"  would require Corning to begin expensing
     share-based  payments effective January 1, 2005. Prior annual periods would
     not be restated.
..    "Modified  retrospective adoption" would require Corning to begin expensing
     share-based  payments effective January 1, 2005. Prior annual periods would
     be restated.

We are  currently  evaluating  the  impact  that  SFAS  123R  will  have  on its
consolidated results of operations and financial  condition,  which in part will
be dependent on the  transition and  amortization  methods used to adopt the new
rules in 2005.  Our current  estimate is that our 2005 pretax expense will be in
the range of $25 million to $50  million,  and that future  years  expense  will
approximate $60 million.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, "Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets
- - An Amendment of APB Opinion No. 29,  Accounting for Nonmonetary  Transactions"
("SFAS 153").  SFAS 153 eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for
nonmonetary  exchanges of similar  productive  assets in paragraph  21(b) of APB
Opinion No. 29, "Accounting for Nonmonetary  Transactions," and replaces it with
an exception  for  exchanges  that do not have  commercial  substance.  SFAS 153
specifies  that a nonmonetary  exchange has  commercial  substance if the future
cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the
exchange.  Corning  is  required  to adopt SFAS 153  effective  January 1, 2006.
Corning does not expect the adoption of SFAS 153 will have a material  impact on
its consolidated results of operations and financial condition.

Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

We operate and conduct  business in many foreign  countries  and as a result are
exposed to  movements  in foreign  currency  exchange  rates.  Our  exposure  to
exchange rate effects includes:

..    exchange  rate  movements  on  financial   instruments   and   transactions
     denominated in foreign currencies which impact earnings, and
..    exchange  rate  movements   upon   conversion  of  net  assets  in  foreign
     subsidiaries  for which the  functional  currency  is not the U.S.  dollar,
     which impact our net equity.

Our most significant  foreign currency exposures relate to Japan,  Korea, Taiwan
and western  European  countries.  We  selectively  enter into foreign  exchange
forward and option contracts with durations generally 15 months or less to hedge
our exposure to exchange rate risk on foreign source income and  purchases.  The
hedges are  scheduled  to mature  coincident  with the timing of the  underlying
foreign currency commitments and transactions.  The objective of these contracts
is to neutralize the impact of exchange rate movements on our operating results.
We also enter into foreign  exchange  forward  contracts when  situations  arise
where our  foreign  subsidiaries  or  Corning  enter  into  lending  situations,
generally on an intercompany  basis,  denominated in currencies other than their
local currency.  We do not hold or issue  derivative  financial  instruments for
trading purposes.

Equity in  earnings of  associated  companies  has  historically  contributed  a
significant amount of our income from continuing operations.  Equity in earnings
of associated  companies,  net of impairments  was $443 million in 2004 and $209
million  in 2003  with  foreign-based  affiliates  comprising  over  70% of this
amount.  Equity  earnings  from Samsung  Corning and Samsung  Corning  Precision
totaled  $309  million  for  2004  and  $105  million  in  2003.  Exchange  rate
fluctuations  and actions taken by  management of these  entities to reduce this
risk can affect the earnings of these companies.

We use a  sensitivity  analysis  to assess the market risk  associated  with our
foreign currency  exchange risk.  Market risk is defined as the potential change
in fair value of assets and  liabilities  resulting from an adverse  movement in
foreign  currency  exchange  rates.  At December 31,  2004,  we had open forward
contracts,  open option contracts,  foreign denominated debt with values exposed
to exchange rate  movements,  all of which were designated as hedges at December
31, 2004. A 10% adverse movement in quoted foreign currency exchange rates could
result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of $122 million. Specific to
the  Japanese  Yen, a 10% adverse  movement in quoted Yen  exchange  rates could
result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of $45 million.

The  nature  of our  foreign  exchange  rate  risk  exposures  has  not  changed
materially from December 31, 2003.

As we derive more than 60% of our net sales from outside the U.S., our sales and
net income could be affected if the U.S.  dollar  significantly  strengthens  or
weakens against foreign currencies,  most notably the Japanese yen and Euro. Our
outlooks included in Management's  Discussion and Analysis assume no significant
changes  in  currency  exchange  rates  during  2005.  A plus or  minus 10 point
movement  in the U.S.  dollar - Japanese  yen  exchange  rate would  result in a
change  to  net  sales  of   approximately   $180  million  and  net  income  of
approximately $150 million. A plus or minus 10 point movement in the U.S. dollar
- - Euro exchange rate would result in a change to net sales of approximately  $50
million but would have a negligible effect on net income.

Interest Rate Risk Management

In March and April of 2002,  we entered into three  interest rate swaps that are
fair value hedges and  economically  exchanged a notional amount of $275 million
of fixed rate long-term debt to floating rate debt.  Under the terms of the swap
agreements,  we paid the  counterparty  a  floating  rate that is indexed to the
six-month  LIBOR rate and received the fixed rates of 8.3% to 8.875%,  which are
the stated  interest  rates on the long-term  debt  instruments.  As a result of
these transactions, Corning was exposed to the impact of interest rate changes.

In 2004 and 2003, we  terminated  the interest  rate swap  agreements  described
above.  The  termination  of these swaps resulted in gains of $5 million in 2004
and $15 million in 2003 which we will  amortize  to  earnings as a reduction  of
interest expense over the remaining life of the debt. The cash proceeds from the
termination  of the swaps totaled $8 million in 2004 and $17 million in 2003 and
are included in the  financing  section of our  consolidated  statements of cash
flows.

It is our policy to  conservatively  manage our  exposure to changes in interest
rates.  Our policy  sets a maximum  cap that total  variable  rate debt will not
exceed 35% of the total debt  portfolio at anytime.  At December  31, 2004,  our
consolidated debt portfolio contained less than 1% of variable rate instruments.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our principal executive and principal  financial officers,  after evaluating the
effectiveness  of our  disclosure  controls  and  procedures  (as defined in the
Securities  Exchange Act of 1934 Rules  13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e)) as of the end of
the period  covered by this report,  have concluded that based on the evaluation
of these controls and procedures required by paragraph (b) of Exchange Act Rules
13a-15 or 15d-15, that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

(a)  Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
     -----------------------------------------------------------------------

     Management  is  responsible  for  establishing  and  maintaining   adequate
     internal  control  over  financial   reporting  for  Corning  and  for  our
     assessment  of  the   effectiveness  of  internal  control  over  financial
     reporting. Corning's internal control over financial reporting is a process
     designed to provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  the  reliability  of
     financial  reporting  and  the  preparation  of  financial  statements  for
     external  purposes  in  accordance  with  accounting  principles  generally
     accepted in the United States of America.  Corning's  internal control over
     financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain
     to the  maintenance of records that, in reasonable  detail,  accurately and
     fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of Corning's assets;  (ii)
     provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
     permit  preparation of financial  statements in accordance  with accounting
     principles  generally  accepted in the United  States of America,  and that
     Corning's  receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with
     authorizations  of Corning's  management and  directors;  and (iii) provide
     reasonable   assurance   regarding   prevention  or  timely   detection  of
     unauthorized  acquisition,  use, or  disposition  of Corning's  assets that
     could have a material effect on the financial statements.

     Because  of its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial
     reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
     evaluation of  effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
     controls may become  inadequate  because of changes in conditions,  or that
     the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.

     Management  conducted an evaluation of the  effectiveness  of the system of
     internal  control  over  financial  reporting  based  on the  framework  in
     Internal  Control  -  Integrated  Framework  issued  by  the  Committee  of
     Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  Treadway  Commission.   Based  on  this
     evaluation,  management  concluded  that  Corning's  internal  control over
     financial  reporting  was  effective as of December 31, 2004.  Management's
     assessment  of  the  effectiveness  of  Corning's   internal  control  over
     financial  reporting  has been  audited by  PricewaterhouseCoopers  LLP, an
     independent  registered  public  accounting firm, as stated in their report
     which is included on page 50.

(c)  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
     ----------------------------------------------------

     There were no changes in our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting
     identified in connection  with the evaluation  required by paragraph (d) of
     Exchange  Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that  occurred  during our last fiscal
     quarter  that  have  materially  affected,  or  are  reasonably  likely  to
     materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Item 14.  Principal Accountant Fees and Services
- ------------------------------------------------

The section  entitled  "Independent  Auditors" in our definitive Proxy Statement
relating to the annual meeting of  shareholders to be held on April 28, 2005, is
incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Our  independent  auditor,  PricewaterhouseCoopers  LLP  ("PwC"),  has  recently
notified the Audit  Committee of our Board of Directors (the "Audit  Committee")
that certain non-audit work it performed in China potentially violated the SEC's
Independence Rules on Scope of Service.

PwC performs expatriate tax return preparation services for certain employees of
Corning in China. In conjunction  with these services,  PwC's affiliated firm in
China took custody of funds intended to satisfy the  employees' tax  obligations
and remitted payment of those funds to the local taxing authorities on behalf of
the employees.  As a result,  PwC had custody of funds that may have belonged to
Corning,  which is not  permitted  under SEC  auditor  independence  rules.  The
payment  aspect of the tax  return  preparation  services  was  discontinued  in
October  2004.  The fees paid to PwC for  expatriate  tax services in China were
$28,550 in 2004,  $47,957 in 2003 and  $40,278 in 2002,  of which the  estimated
amounts  attributable  to the tax payment aspect of services was no more than 5%
in any one year. The amount of disbursements made by PwC-China was $1,168,000 in
2004, $765,000 in 2003 and $559,000 in 2002.

Based upon PwC's disclosure, Corning evaluated PwC's non-audit services provided
to Corning  during the relevant time periods and did not identify any additional
non-audit  services that may compromise PwC's  independence for purposes herein.
Corning  and PwC  continue  to  evaluate  and review  processes  relevant to the
maintenance of PwC's independence.

PwC has concluded that its objectivity and impartiality were unaffected by these
services and therefore its independence  has not been impaired.  This conclusion
is based upon the nature of services,  the de minimus fees associated therewith,
the fact that none of its  personnel  who were  involved in providing  these tax
services  performed any audit or  audit-related  services for Corning,  and that
those professionals who did conduct the audit were unaware of the payment aspect
of the tax services.  In January  2005,  PwC issued its  Independence  Standards
Board Standard No. 1 independence  letter to the Audit Committee of our Board of
Directors and therein reported that it is independent under applicable standards
in connection with its audit opinion for the financial  statements  contained in
this report.  The Audit Committee has discussed with PwC its  independence  from
Corning and  concurred  with PwC that its  independence  was not impaired by the
provision of these services.

         Index to Financial Statements and Financial Statement Schedules







REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP



To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Corning Incorporated:

We  have  completed  an  integrated   audit  of  Corning   Incorporated's   2004
consolidated  financial  statements  and of its internal  control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2004, and audits of its 2003 and 2002  consolidated
financial  statements  in accordance  with the  standards of the Public  Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Our opinions,  based on our audits,
are presented below.

Consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule
- ------------------------------------------------------------------

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying
index  present  fairly,  in all material  respects,  the  financial  position of
Corning Incorporated and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the
results of their  operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended  December 31, 2004 in  conformity  with  accounting  principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion,
the financial  statement  schedule  listed in the  accompanying  index  presents
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in
conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements.  These financial
statements  and  financial  statement  schedule  are the  responsibility  of the
Company's  management.  Our  responsibility  is to  express  an opinion on these
financial  statements and financial  statement  schedule based on our audits. We
conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board (United  States).  Those  standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable  assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit of
financial  statements includes examining,  on a test basis,  evidence supporting
the  amounts  and  disclosures  in  the  financial  statements,   assessing  the
accounting  principles  used and significant  estimates made by management,  and
evaluating the overall  financial  statement  presentation.  We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Internal control over financial reporting
- -----------------------------------------

Also, in our opinion, management's assessment,  included in "Management's Annual
Report on Internal  Control Over Financial  Reporting"  appearing under Item 9A,
that the Company maintained  effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2004,  based on criteria  established  in Internal  Control -
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring  Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on
those criteria.  Furthermore,  in our opinion,  the Company  maintained,  in all
material  respects,  effective  internal control over financial  reporting as of
December  31,  2004,  based  on  criteria  established  in  Internal  Control  -
Integrated Framework issued by COSO. The Company's management is responsible for
maintaining  effective  internal  control over  financial  reporting and for its
assessment of the  effectiveness of internal  control over financial  reporting.
Our responsibility is to express opinions on management's  assessment and on the
effectiveness of the Company's  internal control over financial  reporting based
on our  audit.  We  conducted  our  audit of  internal  control  over  financial
reporting in  accordance  with the  standards of the Public  Company  Accounting
Oversight  Board  (United  States).  Those  standards  require  that we plan and
perform  the  audit to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  effective
internal  control  over  financial  reporting  was  maintained  in all  material
respects.  An  audit of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  includes
obtaining  an  understanding  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,
evaluating  management's  assessment,  testing  and  evaluating  the  design and
operating   effectiveness  of  internal  control,   and  performing  such  other
procedures as we consider  necessary in the  circumstances.  We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company's  internal control over financial  reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable  assurance  regarding the reliability of financial  reporting
and the preparation of financial  statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over
financial  reporting  includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to
the  maintenance  of records that, in reasonable  detail,  accurately and fairly
reflect the  transactions  and  dispositions of the assets of the company;  (ii)
provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting  principles,  and that receipts and  expenditures  of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company;  and (iii) provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention or
timely  detection  of  unauthorized  acquisition,  use,  or  disposition  of the
company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.






Because of its inherent  limitations,  internal control over financial reporting
may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate  because of changes in  conditions,  or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

1.   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Organization

Corning Incorporated is a world-leading  provider of high-performance  glass for
computer monitors and other information display applications;  optical fiber and
cable and hardware and equipment products for the  telecommunications  industry;
ceramic  substrates  for  the  automotive  and  diesel  industries;   scientific
laboratory  products  for  the  scientific  community  and  specialized  polymer
products for  biotechnology  applications;  advanced  optical  materials for the
semiconductor industry and the scientific community; and other technologies.  In
these notes, the terms  "Corning,"  "Company," "we," "us," or "our" mean Corning
Incorporated and subsidiary companies.

Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation

Our  consolidated   financial   statements  were  prepared  in  conformity  with
accounting  principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP)
and include the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of all majority-owned
subsidiaries over which Corning exercises control and, when applicable, entities
for which Corning has a  controlling  financial  interest.  We  consolidate  one
variable interest entity in which we are the primary beneficiary.

The equity method of accounting is used for investments in associated  companies
which are not  controlled  by Corning  and in which our  interest  is  generally
between 20% and 50%. Our share of earnings or losses of associated companies, in
which  at  least  20%  of  the  voting  securities  is  owned,  is  included  in
consolidated operating results.

We use the cost method to account for our  investments  in companies  that we do
not control  and for which we do not have the  ability to  exercise  significant
influence over  operating and financial  policies.  In accordance  with the cost
method, these investments are recorded at cost or fair value, as appropriate.

All material intercompany  accounts,  transactions and profits are eliminated in
consolidation.

On December 13, 2002, we completed the sale of the precision lens business to 3M
Company.  Our  consolidated  statements of operations and cash flows and related
notes present the precision lens business as a discontinued operation.

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current-year
presentation,  including  the  classification  of  auction  rate  securities  as
available-for-sale  securities,  which are reported as  short-term  investments,
instead  of cash  equivalents.  These  reclassifications  had no  impact  on our
results of operations or changes in shareholders' equity.

Use of Estimates

The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with GAAP  requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the
consolidated  financial statements and related notes.  Significant estimates and
assumptions in these consolidated financial statements include restructuring and
other  charges  and  credits,   allowances  for  doubtful  accounts  receivable,
estimates of fair value associated with goodwill and long-lived asset impairment
tests,  estimates of the fair value of assets held for  disposal,  environmental
and legal liabilities,  income taxes and deferred tax valuation allowances,  and
the  determination  of discount and other rate assumptions for pension and other
postretirement  employee  benefit  expenses.  Due  to the  inherent  uncertainty
involved in making  estimates,  actual results reported in future periods may be
different from these estimates.

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and has been earned.  Net
sales consist of revenue related to sales of product,  which generally  comprise
standard products.  We recognize product revenue when persuasive  evidence of an
arrangement exists, the product has been delivered and legal title and all risks
of ownership  have been  transferred,  customer  acceptance  has  occurred,  and
payment is reasonably assured.

At the time  revenue is  recognized,  accruals  are  recorded,  with the related
reduction  to revenue,  for  estimated  product  returns,  allowances  and price
discounts  based  upon  historical  experience  and  related  terms of  customer
arrangements.  Where  we have  offered  product  warranties,  we also  establish
liabilities for estimated  warranty costs based upon  historical  experience and
specific  warranty  issues.  Warranty  liabilities  are adjusted when experience
indicates an expected settlement will differ from initial estimates.





1.   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Corning periodically enters into long-term supply contracts and receives advance
payments for product to be delivered in future periods. Upon receipt of the cash
deposits made by customers,  Corning records a customer deposit liability, which
will be applied in the form of credits against future product purchases over the
life of the  contract.  As  product  is  shipped  to a  customer,  Corning  will
recognize  revenue at the  selling  price and issue a credit  memorandum  for an
agreed amount of the customer deposit  liability.  The credit memorandum will be
applied against customer  receivables  resulting from the sale of product,  thus
reducing operating cash flows over the customer contract's life.

Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions

The determination of the functional currency for Corning's foreign  subsidiaries
is made based on the appropriate  economic and management  indicators.  For most
foreign  operations,  the local  currencies  are generally  considered to be the
functional currencies.  Prior to 2005, non-U.S.  operations which do not use the
local currency as the functional currency use the U.S. dollar. Effective January
1, 2005, our Taiwan  subsidiary's  functional  currency will change from the new
Taiwan  dollar (its local  currency) to the  Japanese  yen due to the  increased
significance of Japanese yen based transactions of that subsidiary.

For foreign subsidiary functional currency financial  statements,  balance sheet
accounts are translated at current  exchange rates, and statements of operations
accounts are  translated  at average  exchange  rates for the year.  Translation
gains and losses are  recorded  as a separate  component  of  accumulated  other
comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders'  equity. The effects of remeasuring
non-functional  currency assets and liabilities into the functional currency are
included in current earnings.

Stock-Based Compensation

Pursuant  to  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  (SFAS)  No.  123,
"Accounting for Stock-Based  Compensation"  (SFAS 123), we apply the recognition
and measurement  principles of Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No. 25,
"Accounting  for Stock Issued to  Employees"  (APB 25), to our stock options and
other stock-based  compensation  plans.  These plans are more fully described in
Note 16 (Stock Compensation Plans).

In accordance  with APB 25, stock option  compensation  expense is recognized in
earnings based on the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of the stock at
the  grant  date of the  award or other  measurement  date  over the  amount  an
employee  must pay to acquire the stock.  The exercise  price for stock  options
granted to employees equals or exceeds the fair market value of our common stock
at the date of grant.

The following table  illustrates  the effect on loss from continuing  operations
and loss per share if we had applied the fair value  recognition  provisions  of
SFAS 123 to stock-based employee compensation.  The estimated fair value of each
Corning option is calculated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.







1.   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

On December 1, 2004, Corning's  Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors
considered and adopted a proposal that  accelerated  the vesting of all unvested
underwater  options held by active employees.  Unvested  underwater options were
defined as options  granted prior to December 1, 2004 with a grant price greater
than $12.70.  Approximately  7 million  stock  options or 5 percent of Corning's
outstanding stock options were  accelerated.  This action was one of a series of
actions taken to manage Corning's  anticipated future  compensation cost for all
forms of equity incentives within an acceptable range once SFAS 123R is adopted.
Other  actions  included  reducing the use of stock  options for all  employees,
increasing  the use of performance  shares in the executive  plan, and reviewing
the cost  considerations  of the global  employee share purchase  program.  As a
result of this  action,  the 2004  "stock-based  employee  compensation  expense
determined under fair value based method,  net of tax" amount above includes $13
million of incremental expense relating to these accelerated options.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash  equivalents   consist  of  highly  liquid  investments  that  are  readily
convertible  into cash. We consider  securities with  contractual  maturities of
three  months or less,  when  purchased,  to be cash  equivalents.  The carrying
amount of these  securities  approximates  fair value because of the  short-term
maturity of these instruments.



Short-Term Investments

Our   short-term   investments   consist  of  debt   securities   classified  as
available-for-sale,  which are  stated  at  estimated  fair  value.  These  debt
securities include U.S. treasury notes, state and municipal bonds,  asset-backed
securities,  auction rate  securities,  corporate  bonds,  commercial  paper and
certificates of deposit. These investments are on deposit with a major financial
institution.  Unrealized  gains and  losses,  net of tax,  are  computed  on the
first-in first-out basis and are reported as a separate component of accumulated
other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders' equity until realized.

Inventories

Inventories  are  stated at the  lower of cost  (first-in,  first-out  basis) or
market.

Property, Net of Accumulated Depreciation

Land,  buildings and equipment  are recorded at cost.  Depreciation  is based on
estimated useful lives of properties using the straight-line  method.  Except as
described in Note 3 (Restructuring,  Impairment and Other Charges and (Credits))
related to accelerated  depreciation  arising from restructuring  programs,  the
estimated useful lives range from 20 to 40 years for buildings and 3 to 20 years
for the majority of our equipment.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill is the excess of cost of an acquired  entity over the amounts  assigned
to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business  combination.  Goodwill
is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter,  and will be tested for
impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances  change that
more  likely  than not would  indicate  the  carrying  amount  may be  impaired.
Impairment  testing for  goodwill is done at a reporting  unit level.  Reporting
units are either one level below the operating  segment level or an  aggregation
of two or more  reporting  units  within  the  same  operating  segment  if such
reporting units share similar economic characteristics.  Goodwill relates and is
assigned  directly to a specific  reporting  unit. An impairment  loss generally
would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting  unit's net assets
exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. The estimated fair value
of a reporting unit is determined  using a discounted cash flow analysis.  Refer
to Notes 3  (Restructuring,  Impairment  and Other Charges and  (Credits)) and 9
(Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets) for additional information.

Other intangible assets include patents,  trademarks and other intangible assets
acquired from an independent  party. Such intangible assets have a definite life
and are amortized on a straight-line  basis with estimated  useful lives ranging
from 5 to 20 years.





1.   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

We  review  the  recoverability  of our  long-lived  assets,  such as plant  and
equipment and intangible assets,  when events or changes in circumstances  occur
that  indicate  that the  carrying  value of the asset or asset group may not be
recoverable.  The  assessment of possible  impairment is based on our ability to
recover the carrying value of the asset or asset group from the expected  future
pre-tax cash flows  (undiscounted  and without interest  charges) of the related
operations.  We assess the  recoverability  of the carrying  value of long-lived
assets at the  lowest  level  for  which  identifiable  cash  flows are  largely
independent  of the cash flows of other  assets and  liabilities.  If these cash
flows  are  less  than the  carrying  value of such  asset  or asset  group,  an
impairment loss is measured based on the difference between estimated fair value
and carrying  value.  Assets to be disposed are  written-down  to the greater of
their  fair  value or  salvage  value.  Fair  values  are  based on  assumptions
concerning  the amount and timing of  estimated  future  cash flows and  assumed
discount rates, reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk.

Treasury Stock

Shares of common stock  repurchased by us are recorded at cost as treasury stock
and result in a reduction of shareholders'  equity in the  consolidated  balance
sheets.  From time to time,  treasury shares may be reissued as contributions to
our employee  benefit plans and for the retirement or conversion of certain debt
instruments.  When  shares  are  reissued,  we use an  average  cost  method for
determining  cost.  The  difference  between  the  cost  of the  shares  and the
reissuance price is added or deducted from additional paid-in capital.

Income Taxes

We use the asset and liability  approach to account for income taxes. Under this
method,  deferred tax assets and  liabilities  are  recognized  for the expected
future tax  consequences of differences  between the carrying  amounts of assets
and liabilities and their  respective tax base using enacted tax rates in effect
for the year in which the  differences  are  expected to reverse.  The effect on
deferred tax assets and  liabilities  of a change in tax rates is  recognized in
income in the period when the change is enacted. Deferred tax assets are reduced
by a valuation  allowance when, in the opinion of management,  it is more likely
than not  that  some  portion  or all of the  deferred  tax  assets  will not be
realized.

Derivative Instruments

We  participate  in a variety of foreign  exchange  forward  contracts,  foreign
exchange  option  contracts,  and interest rate swaps entered into in connection
with the  management  of our exposure to  fluctuations  in foreign  exchange and
interest  rates.  These  financial  exposures  are  managed in  accordance  with
corporate policies and procedures.

All derivatives are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet.  Changes in the
fair  value of  derivatives  designated  as cash flow  hedges  and hedges of net
investments   in  foreign   operations   are  recorded  in   accumulated   other
comprehensive  income (loss).  Amounts are reclassified  from accumulated  other
comprehensive  income (loss) when the underlying  hedged item impacts  earnings.
Changes in the fair value of  derivatives  designated  as fair value  hedges are
recorded  currently  in  earnings  offset  to  the  extent  the  derivative  was
effective,  by the change in the fair value of the hedged  item.  Changes in the
fair value of  derivatives  not designated as hedging  instruments  are recorded
currently in earnings.

We have issued foreign  currency  denominated debt that has been designated as a
hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation. The effective portion of the
changes  in fair  value  of the  debt  is  reflected  as a  component  of  other
comprehensive  income  (loss)  as  part  of  the  foreign  currency  translation
adjustment.

New Accounting Standards

In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151,  "Inventory Costs - An Amendment
of ARB No. 43,  Chapter 4" (SFAS  151).  SFAS 151 amends ARB No. 43,  Chapter 4,
"Inventory  Pricing," to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense,
freight,  handling costs, and wasted material (spoilage) should be recognized as
current-period charges. Additionally, SFAS 151 requires that allocation of fixed
production  overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity
of the  production  facilities.  Corning is required to adopt SFAS 151 effective
January 1, 2006.  Corning  does not  expect the  adoption  of SFAS 151 to have a
material  impact  on  its  consolidated  results  of  operations  and  financial
condition.





1.   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (concluded)

In December  2004,  the FASB issued SFAS No. 123  (revised  2004),  "Share-Based
Payment" (SFAS 123R),  which replaces SFAS No. 123,  "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation,"  (SFAS 123) and  supercedes APB Opinion No. 25,  "Accounting  for
Stock  Issued to  Employees."  SFAS 123R  requires all  share-based  payments to
employees,  including grants of employee stock options,  to be recognized in the
financial statements at fair value beginning in Corning's third quarter of 2005.
Under SFAS 123R,  Corning must determine the appropriate  fair value model to be
used for valuing share-based payments,  the amortization method for compensation
cost,  and the  transition  method to be used at date of adoption.  The standard
permits three transition method adoption alternatives:

..    "Prospective adoption" would require Corning to begin expensing share-based
     payments after July 1, 2005.  Prior interim and annual periods would not be
     restated.
..    "Modified  prospective  adoption"  would require Corning to begin expensing
     share-based  payments effective January 1, 2005. Prior annual periods would
     not be restated.
..    "Modified  retrospective adoption" would require Corning to begin expensing
     share-based  payments effective January 1, 2005. Prior annual periods would
     be restated.

We are  currently  evaluating  the  impact  that  SFAS  123R  will  have  on its
consolidated results of operations and financial  condition,  which in part will
be dependent on the  transition and  amortization  methods used to adopt the new
rules in 2005.  Our current  estimate is that our 2005 pretax expense will be in
the range of $25 million to $50  million,  and that future  years  expense  will
approximate $60 million.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, "Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets
- - An Amendment of APB Opinion No. 29,  Accounting for Nonmonetary  Transactions"
(SFAS 153). SFAS 153 is based on the principle that nonmonetary  asset exchanges
should be recorded and measured at the fair value of the assets exchanged,  with
certain exceptions.  This standard requires exchanges of productive assets to be
accounted for at fair value,  rather than at carryover basis, unless (1) neither
the  asset  received  nor  the  asset  surrendered  has a  fair  value  that  is
determinable  within  reasonable  limits or (2) the transactions lack commercial
substance.  SFAS  153  specifies  that a  nonmonetary  exchange  has  commercial
substance  if the  future  cash  flows of the  entity  are  expected  to  change
significantly as a result of the exchange. Corning is required to adopt SFAS 153
effective January 1, 2006. Corning does not expect the adoption of SFAS 153 will
have a material impact on its  consolidated  results of operations and financial
condition.

2.   Discontinued Operation

On December 13, 2002, we completed the sale of our precision lens business to 3M
Company  (3M) for cash  proceeds  up to $850  million,  of which $50 million was
deposited in an escrow  account.  During 2002,  we received  approximately  $800
million in cash and recorded a gain on the sale of $415 million,  net of tax, in
income from discontinued operation in the consolidated statements of operations.
In 2003, 3M notified  Corning that 3M believed it had certain claims arising out
of the  representations  and warranties  made by Corning in connection  with the
sale of the precision lens business to 3M. In the third quarter of 2004, Corning
and 3M  reached  a final  settlement  agreement  for the funds  held in  escrow.
Accordingly, we received $20 million in cash and recorded a gain of $20 million.
This gain is included in income from discontinued  operation in the consolidated
statements of operations.

The precision lens business  operating  results and cash flows have been removed
from our results of  continuing  operations  for all periods  presented and have
been  excluded  from the  operating  segments  data.  There were no results from
discontinued operations in 2003.

3.   Restructuring, Impairment and Other Charges and (Credits)

2004 Actions

Corning  recorded  net  charges  of $1,789  million  in 2004.  A summary  of the
significant charges and credits follows:

..    We recorded a charge of $1,420  million to impair a significant  portion of
     our Telecommunications  segment goodwill balance. Refer to Note 9 (Goodwill
     and Other Intangible Assets) for additional information on this charge.
..    We  recorded  a $350  million  charge to  impair  certain  fixed  assets in
     accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
     Long-Lived  Assets" (SFAS 144). This charge primarily  relates to our third
     quarter  decision to  permanently  abandon  approximately  $332  million of
     construction  in progress at our optical  fiber  manufacturing  facility in
     Concord,  North  Carolina that had been stopped in 2002. As a result of our
     lowered outlook for the  Telecommunications  segment,  we have  permanently
     abandoned this  construction in progress as we no longer believe the demand
     for optical  fiber will warrant the  investment  necessary to complete this
     facility.
..    We  recorded  an asset  held for use  impairment  charge of $24  million to
     impair  certain fixed assets and  intangible  assets other than goodwill in
     accordance  with SFAS  144.  Due to our  decision  to  permanently  abandon
     certain   fixed   assets   and  lower  our   long-term   outlook   for  the
     Telecommunications  segment, we determined that an event of impairment,  as
     defined by SFAS 144, had occurred in our  Telecommunications  segment which
     required us to test the segment's long-lived assets other than goodwill for
     impairment.  We estimated the fair value of the long-lived assets using the
     discounted  cash flow  approach as a measure of fair value.  As a result of
     our impairment  evaluation,  we recorded an impairment charge to write-down
     certain assets to their estimated fair values.
..    We recorded a gain of $33 million  related to proceeds in excess of assumed
     salvage  values for assets of Corning  Asahi Video  Products  Company (CAV)
     that were  previously  impaired  but later sold to a Henan Anyang CPT Glass
     Bulb Group,  Electronic  Glass Co., Ltd. (Henan Anyang),  located in China.
     CAV, our 51% owned affiliate that manufactured glass panels and funnels for
     use in conventional televisions, was shut down in 2003. This represents the
     substantial completion of the sale of CAV's assets.
..    We recorded $37 million of accelerated  depreciation  relating to the final
     shutdown  of  our  semiconductor   materials   manufacturing   facility  in
     Charleston,  South  Carolina,  which we announced in the fourth  quarter of
     2003.
..    We  recorded a loss of $14  million on the sale of our  frequency  controls
     business  for net cash  proceeds of $80  million.  The  frequency  controls
     business,  which was part of our  Telecommunications  segment,  had  annual
     sales of $76 million.
..    We  recorded  net credits of $25 million  related to  adjustments  to prior
     period restructuring, impairment, and other charges.


Cash payments for employee-related costs will be substantially  completed by the
end of 2005, while payments for exit activities will be substantially  completed
by the end of 2008.





3.   Restructuring, Impairment and Other Charges and (Credits) (continued)


2003 Actions

Corning recorded net charges of $111 million in 2003. Major actions approved and
initiated in 2003 included the following:

..    The shutdown of CAV.
..    The   exit   of   our   photonic    technologies    products   within   the
     Telecommunications  segment,  which  included the sale of certain assets to
     Avanex Corporation (Avanex).
..    Credits  to prior year  restructuring  plans,  primarily  the result of our
     decision not to exit two cabling  sites  previously  marked for shutdown in
     2002.
..    The shutdown of two of our specialty materials manufacturing  facilities in
     North Brookfield and Charleston, South Carolina.






As of December 31, 2004, all of the 1,975 employees from the 2003  restructuring
plans had been separated.





3.   Restructuring, Impairment and Other Charges and (Credits) (concluded)

2002 Actions

Corning  recorded net charges of $2,080 million in 2002.  Major actions approved
and initiated in 2002 included the following:

..    Permanent  closure of our optical fiber  manufacturing  facilities in Noble
     Park,  Victoria,  Australia,  and  Neustadt  bei Coburg,  Germany.  We also
     mothballed  our optical  fiber  manufacturing  facility  in Concord,  North
     Carolina and transferred  certain  capabilities  to our  Wilmington,  North
     Carolina facility.
..    Reductions  in capacity  and  employment  in our cabling and  hardware  and
     equipment locations worldwide to reduce costs.
..    Permanent   closure  of  our   photonic   technologies   thin  film  filter
     manufacturing facility in Marlborough, Massachusetts.
..    Permanent  abandonment  of  certain  construction  projects  that  had been
     stopped   in  2001  in  the   fiber   and   cable   business   within   the
     Telecommunications segment.
..    Closure   of   minor   manufacturing    facilities,    primarily   in   the
     Telecommunications segment.
..    Closure and consolidation of research facilities.
..    Elimination  of  positions  worldwide  through  voluntary  and  involuntary
     programs.
..    Impairment  of a  significant  portion  of our  Telecommunications  segment
     goodwill balance.
..    An asset held for use impairment  charge to impair certain fixed assets and
     intangible  assets  other  than  goodwill  in  the  Telecommunications  and
     conventional video segments in accordance with SFAS 144.
..    Charges for other than  temporary  declines in certain cost  investments in
     the Telecommunications segment.
..    Divestiture of a portion of the controls and connectors product line in the
     Telecommunications  segment.  We  received  proceeds  of  $30  million  and
     realized  a  loss  on  sale  of  approximately  $16  million  ($10  million
     after-tax).







As of December 31, 2004, all of the 7,100 employees from the 2002 restructuring
plans had been separated.

6.   Income Taxes


The increase in the loss from continuing  operations before income taxes in 2004
compared to 2003 is due primarily to several  non-cash  charges  associated with
goodwill and other long-lived asset impairments. Refer to Note 3 (Restructuring,
Impairments and Other Charges and (Credits)) for additional information.

(Provision) benefit for income taxes          $ (1,031)    $   254    $   726
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Amounts are  reflected  in the  preceding  tables  based on the  location of the
taxing authorities.

We  do  not  provide  income  taxes  on  the  post-1992   earnings  of  domestic
subsidiaries that we expect to recover tax-free without significant cost. Income
taxes have been provided for post-1992 unremitted earnings of domestic corporate
joint ventures that we do not expect to recover tax-free. Unremitted earnings of
domestic  subsidiaries  and corporate  joint ventures that arose in fiscal years
beginning on or before December 31, 1992 have been indefinitely  reinvested.  We
currently  provide  income  taxes on the  earnings of foreign  subsidiaries  and
associated  companies to the extent  these  earnings  are  currently  taxable or
expected to be remitted.  As of December 31, 2004,  taxes have not been provided
on approximately $1.5 billion of accumulated  foreign unremitted  earnings which
are expected to remain invested indefinitely.

The  American  Jobs  Creation  Act of 2004 (the  "Act") was  signed  into law on
October 22, 2004. The Act  introduced a special  one-time (for 2004 or 2005) 85%
dividends received deduction for certain repatriated  foreign earnings.  At this
point in time,  we do not expect our  remittance  plans to change as a result of
this provision.  Our  accumulated  foreign  unremitted  earnings are expected to
remain invested indefinitely.

The Act also provided for the repeal of the  extraterritorial  income tax regime
(through reduced benefits in 2005 and 2006, with full repeal effective for 2007)
and the allowance of a deduction for qualified  domestic  production  activities
(phased in over the years 2005 to 2009 and fully effective in 2010).  Neither of
these changes is expected to have a significant impact on our effective tax rate
or U.S.  tax  liabilities  because  of our loss  position  in the  U.S.  and the
resulting  recording and  maintaining of valuation  allowances  against our U.S.
deferred tax assets.

Reconciliation  of the U.S.  statutory income tax rate to our effective tax rate
for continuing operations follows:

The component  percentages  above  reflect the increase in loss from  continuing
operations  before  income taxes in 2004  compared to 2003 due  primarily to the
impairment charges. In addition,  as further described below, our 2004 provision
for income taxes reflects  charges to increase our valuation  allowance  against
certain U.S. and German deferred tax assets.

We have  performed  the required  assessment  of positive and negative  evidence
regarding the realization of the net deferred tax assets in accordance with SFAS
No. 109,  "Accounting for Income Taxes" (SFAS No. 109). This assessment included
the evaluation of scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities,  estimates of
projected future taxable income and tax-planning strategies,  as well as related
key  assumptions.  SFAS 109 requires  that  greater  weight be given to previous
cumulative  losses than the outlook for future  profitability  when  determining
whether deferred tax assets can be used.

Prior to our 2004  assessment  of  realizability,  we believed  that it was more
likely  than not that  our net U.S.  (federal,  state  and  local)  and  foreign
deferred  tax  assets  would  be  realized.  This  assessment  was  based on the
following:

..    Approximately  $140  million  of our net  U.S.  deferred  tax  assets  were
     expected to have been realized  through net operating loss carryback claims
     to be filed over the next three to five years,  which would have  generated
     cash refunds during such period.
..    We expected the  remaining  net U.S. and foreign  deferred tax assets to be
     realized from future earnings.
..    In the event future earnings were insufficient,  approximately $500 million
     of our net U.S.  deferred  tax assets were  expected to have been  realized
     through  a  tax-planning  strategy  involving  the sale of a  non-strategic
     appreciated asset.

The 2004 assessment produced the following conclusions:

..    Due to delays in finalizing the Pittsburgh Corning Corporation  settlement,
     we no longer believe that it is more likely than not that we will realize a
     portion of our net U.S.  deferred  tax assets  through net  operating  loss
     carryback claims.
..    We have incurred  significant  losses in the U.S. and Germany due primarily
     to  the   Telecommunications   restructuring  and  impairment  charges  and
     operating  losses over the last four  years.  Although  Corning's  business
     environment  has improved,  a growing portion of our sales and earnings are
     outside  of the  U.S.,  particularly  in  Asia.  The  U.S.  portion  of our
     operations  operated at a loss in 2004. This portion not only includes most
     of our  Telecommunications  segment,  but also a significant portion of our
     global research,  development and engineering and corporate  infrastructure
     spending.  As we have taken additional  significant  impairment charges and
     lowered the outlook for our largest U.S.  based  business  during 2004,  we
     believe  that a valuation  allowance  against  these tax assets is required
     until  realization  is more assured.  The valuation  allowance is primarily
     attributable to the uncertainty  regarding the realization of specific U.S.
     and foreign deductible temporary differences, U.S. net operating losses and
     tax  credit  carryforwards  that  expire  through  2024,  and  foreign  net
     operating  losses,  primarily in Germany,  which  allows for an  indefinite
     carryforward period. Refer to Notes 3 (Restructuring,  Impairment and Other
     Charges and  (Credits))  and 9 (Goodwill and Other  Intangible  Assets) for
     additional information.

Based on our 2004  assessment  of  realizability,  we  increased  our  valuation
allowance  by $1.2  billion  in 2004 to reduce  our net  deferred  tax assets to
approximately  $532 million,  which are primarily  U.S. net deferred tax assets.
This  amount is  comprised  of $937  million  recorded  in the third  quarter to
establish a valuation  allowance  against  deferred tax assets recorded prior to
July 1, 2004 and $279  million  recorded in the third and fourth  quarters,  the
majority of which  relates to deferred tax assets  recorded in  connection  with
third quarter fixed asset impairment  charges.  Refer to Note 3  (Restructuring,
Impairment and Other Charges and (Credits)) for additional  information on these
charges.  We continue  to believe  that it is more likely than not that we could
realize  these net U.S.  deferred  tax assets  through a  tax-planning  strategy
involving the sale of a non-strategic appreciated asset.





6.   Income Taxes (concluded)

We expect to  maintain a valuation  allowance  on future tax  benefits  until an
appropriate  level of  profitability,  primarily  in the U.S.  and  Germany,  is
sustained  or we are able to develop tax planning  strategies  that enable us to
conclude  that it is more likely than not that a larger  portion of our deferred
tax  assets  would  be  realizable,  or if the  Pittsburgh  Corning  Corporation
settlement  is  finalized  earlier  than  we  anticipate.  Until  then,  our tax
provision will include only the net tax expense  attributable to certain foreign
operations.

Corning  expects to take a worthless  stock  deduction in its 2004 U.S.  Federal
consolidated  tax  return  for  the  loss  on its  investment  in  the  photonic
technologies business associated with the Pirelli acquisition.  This acquisition
was  completed  in December  2000 and was  substantially  impaired in the second
quarter of 2001. The tax benefit of the deduction,  before  consideration of any
valuation  allowance,  is  approximately  $1.54 billion.  We have not recorded a
deferred tax asset for this item as the ultimate  realization  of such deduction
is uncertain,  and consistent with the  requirements of SFAS No. 5,  "Accounting
for  Contingencies,"  recognition  of an  asset  prior  to the  time  management
determines the realization of the asset to be probable is prohibited.

In 2001, tax legislation was enacted in the U.S. that  temporarily  extended the
net  operating  loss  carryback  period  from  two to  five  years.  Due to this
legislative  change,  we were  able to  carryback  the  2002  U.S.  federal  net
operating loss and claim a refund that would not have otherwise been  available.
Corning received a $191 million refund in the first quarter of 2003.

Dow Corning Corporation (Dow Corning)
- -------------------------------------
Dow Corning is a U.S. based manufacturer of silicone products.  In 1995, Corning
fully  impaired its  investment  of Dow Corning  upon its entry into  bankruptcy
proceedings and did not recognize net equity earnings from the second quarter of
1995 through the end of 2002.  Corning began recognizing  equity earnings in the
first  quarter  of 2003  when  management  concluded  that  its  emergence  from
bankruptcy protection was probable. Dow Corning emerged from bankruptcy in 2004.
See discussion  below for additional  information  for a history of this matter.
With the exception of the  possibility  of future  bankruptcy  related  charges,
Corning considers the difference between the carrying value of its investment in
Dow  Corning and its 50% share of Dow  Corning's  equity to be  permanent.  This
difference is $249 million.

Corning received no dividends from Dow Corning in 2004 or 2003.


(1)  Dow Corning's 2003 financial  statements  were prepared in conformity  with
     the  American  Institute  of  Certified  Public  Accountants  Statement  of
     Position No. 90-7, "Financial Reporting by Entities in Reorganization under
     the  Bankruptcy  Code"  (SOP  90-7).  SOP 90-7  requires a  segregation  of
     liabilities  subject to compromise by the Bankruptcy Court as of the filing
     date (May 15, 1995) and  identification of all transactions and events that
     are directly associated with the reorganization.






7.   Investments (continued)

Corning and The Dow Chemical  Company (Dow  Chemical) each own 50% of the common
stock of Dow Corning,  which was in reorganization  proceedings under Chapter 11
of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code between May 1995 and May 2004. Dow Corning filed for
bankruptcy  protection to address pending and claimed  liabilities  arising from
many thousand  breast-implant  product  lawsuits each of which typically  sought
damages in excess of $1 million.  On November 8, 1998,  Dow Corning and the Tort
Claimants Committee jointly filed a revised Plan of Reorganization  (Joint Plan)
which provided for the settlement or other  resolution of implant claims.  After
review and approvals by the Bankruptcy Court and the U.S.  District Court of the
Eastern District of Michigan, and an appeal, the District Court on April 2, 2004
entered an order  establishing  June 1, 2004 as the effective  date of the Joint
Plan.

Under the terms of the Joint Plan, Dow Corning has  established and is funding a
Settlement Trust and a Litigation Facility to provide a means for tort claimants
to settle or  litigate  their  claims.  Of the  approximately  $3.2  billion  of
required funding,  Dow Corning has paid approximately $1.6 billion (inclusive of
insurance)  and expects to pay up to an  additional  $1.6 billion  ($710 million
after-tax) over 16 years. Corning and Dow Chemical have each agreed to provide a
credit  facility  to Dow  Corning  of up to $150  million  ($300  million in the
aggregate),  subject to the terms and  conditions  stated in the Joint Plan.  As
required by the Joint Plan,  Dow Corning has fully  satisfied  (or reserved for)
the claims of its  commercial  creditors  in  accordance  with a March 31,  2004
ruling of the District Court determining the amount of pendency interest allowed
on the $810 million in principal owing on such claims.  In the second quarter of
2004, Dow Corning recorded a $47 million adjustment to its interest  liabilities
relating to this matter,  of which Corning  recognized $14 million in its second
quarter equity in earnings of associated companies, net of impairments.  Certain
commercial  creditors  have appealed that ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals of
the Sixth Circuit  seeking from Dow Corning an additional  sum of  approximately
$80  million  for  interest  at default  rates and  enforcement  costs.  Corning
believes the risk of loss to Dow Corning (net of sums reserved) is remote.

In addition,  Dow Corning has received a statutory notice of deficiency from the
United States  Internal  Revenue  Service  asserting tax  deficiencies  totaling
approximately  $65 million  relating  to its federal  income tax returns for the
1995 and 1996 calendar  years.  This matter is pending before the U.S.  District
Court in Michigan.  Dow Corning has also received a proposed adjustment from the
IRS (approximately  $117 million) with respect to its federal income tax returns
for the 1997, 1998 and 1999 calendar years. Dow Corning is vigorously contesting
these deficiencies and proposed adjustments which it believes are excessive.

The Joint Plan includes releases for Corning and Dow Chemical as shareholders in
exchange  for  contributions  to the Joint  Plan.  Although  claims  against the
shareholders  were included in several thousand state and federal lawsuits filed
pre-bankruptcy,  alleging  injuries arising from Dow Corning's implant products,
Corning  was awarded  summary  judgment  in federal  court and in several  state
jurisdictions.  The remaining  claims  against  Corning will be channeled by the
Joint Plan into facilities  established by the Joint Plan.  Management  believes
that the  likelihood  of a  materially  adverse  impact to  Corning's  financial
statements arising from these remaining shareholder claims is remote.

Pittsburgh Corning Corporation (PCC)
- ------------------------------------
Corning and PPG Industries,  Inc. (PPG) each own 50% of the common stock of PCC.
Over a period of more than two decades,  PCC and several other  defendants  have
been named in numerous  lawsuits  involving claims alleging personal injury from
exposure to asbestos. On April 16, 2000, PCC filed for Chapter 11 reorganization
in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. As of the
bankruptcy filing, PCC had in excess of 140,000 open claims and had insufficient
remaining  insurance  and  assets to deal with its  alleged  current  and future
liabilities.  More than 100,000 additional claims have been filed with PCC after
its bankruptcy filing. As a result of PCC's bankruptcy filing,  Corning recorded
an after-tax charge of $36 million in 2001 to fully impair its investment in PCC
and  discontinued  recognition  of  equity  earnings.  At the time PCC filed for
bankruptcy  protection,  there were approximately  12,400 claims pending against
Corning in state court lawsuits  alleging various theories of liability based on
exposure to PCC's asbestos products and typically requesting monetary damages in
excess of one million  dollars per claim.  Corning has defended  those claims on
the basis of the separate  corporate  status of PCC and the absence of any facts
supporting  claims of direct  liability  arising from PCC's  asbestos  products.
Corning  is  also   currently   named  in   approximately   11,300  other  cases
(approximately  42,800  claims)  alleging  injuries  from  asbestos  and similar
amounts  of  monetary  damages  per  claim.  Those  cases  have been  covered by
insurance  without  material impact to Corning to date.  Asbestos  litigation is
inherently  difficult,  and past  trends in  resolving  these  claims may not be
indicators of future outcomes.

In the  bankruptcy  court,  PCC in April 2000 obtained a preliminary  injunction
against the prosecution of asbestos  actions arising from PCC's products against
its two  shareholders  to afford  the  parties a period of time (the  Injunction
Period) in which to negotiate a plan of reorganization for PCC (PCC Plan).

On May 14, 2002, PPG announced that it had agreed with certain of its insurance
carriers and representatives of current and future asbestos claimants on the
terms of a settlement arrangement applicable to claims arising from PCC's
products.





7.   Investments (concluded)

On March 28, 2003,  Corning  announced  that it had also reached  agreement with
representatives  of  current  and  future  asbestos  claimants  on a  settlement
arrangement  that will be  incorporated  into the PCC Plan.  This  settlement is
subject  to a number of  contingencies,  including  approval  by the  bankruptcy
court. Corning's settlement will require the contribution, when the Plan becomes
effective,  of its equity  interest  in PCC,  its  one-half  equity  interest in
Pittsburgh  Corning Europe N.V.  (PCE),  and 25 million shares of Corning common
stock.  The  common  stock will be  marked-to-market  each  quarter  until it is
contributed to the settlement  trust.  Corning also will be making cash payments
of $144 million (net present value as of December 31, 2004) in six  installments
beginning one year after the Plan is effective. In addition, Corning will assign
policy  rights or proceeds  under primary  insurance  from 1962 through 1984, as
well as rights to proceeds under certain excess  insurance,  most of which falls
within the period from 1962  through  1973.  In return for these  contributions,
Corning  expects  to receive a release  and an  injunction  channeling  asbestos
claims against it into a settlement trust under the PCC Plan.

The  following  summarizes  the  charges  we  have  recorded  for  the  asbestos
settlement (in millions):

Asbestos settlement                               $    33             $   413
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Two of Corning's  primary  insurers and several  excess  insurers have commenced
litigation for a declaration of the rights and  obligations of the parties under
insurance  policies,  including  rights that may be  affected by the  settlement
arrangement  described  above.  Corning is  vigorously  contesting  these cases.
Management is unable to predict the outcome of this insurance litigation.

The PCC Plan received a favorable vote from creditors in March 2004. Hearings to
consider  objections to the Plan were held in the Bankruptcy  Court in May 2004.
The  parties  filed  post-hearing  briefs and made final oral  arguments  to the
Bankruptcy  Court  in  November  2004.  The  Bankruptcy  Court  has  allowed  an
additional  round of briefing to address  current  case law  developments,  with
briefs due on  February  28,  2005 and March 10,  2005,  leading to a hearing on
March 16, 2005.  The timing and outcome are uncertain.  If the Bankruptcy  Court
does not  confirm the PCC Plan in its current  form,  changes to the  settlement
agreement are reasonably  possible.  Further  judicial review is also reasonably
possible.  Although the  confirmation  of the PCC Plan is subject to a number of
contingencies,  apart from the  quarterly  adjustment in the value of 25 million
shares of Corning  common stock,  management  believes that the  likelihood of a
material adverse impact to Corning's financial statements is remote.

9.   Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill


(1)  This balance relates to our Specialty Materials operating segment.

2004 Assessment
- ---------------
Our  annual  goodwill  recoverability  assessment  is  completed  in the  fourth
quarter,  as it is traditionally  based on our annual strategic planning process
that runs from June to October. This process includes reviewing expectations for
the long-term growth of our businesses and forecasting future cash flows. In the
third  quarter,  we  identified  certain  factors  during this annual  strategic
planning  process that caused us to lower our estimates and  projections for the
long-term revenue growth of the Telecommunications segment, which indicated that
it was more  likely  than not  that  the  fair  value of the  Telecommunications
segment  reporting unit was less than its carrying  value. As such, we performed
an interim  impairment test of the  Telecommunications  segment  goodwill in the
third quarter of 2004, the results of which were reviewed with  Corning's  board
of directors on October 6, 2004.

Although we are currently  experiencing  stronger  than expected  volume in this
segment,  the improved demand comes from a narrow band of customers,  and we see
few signs of a broader recovery in overall demand, mix of premium products,  and
pricing  for our  products.  The  lack  of  industry  consolidations,  increased
competitive pressures in the industry,  and revised estimates of future customer
demand for the types of  products  they will deploy have caused us to change our
assessment of the future pace of recovery.  The primary  estimates and forecasts
driving  this  change  in  our  outlook  and  reducing  the  fair  value  of the
Telecommunications segment from that measured in 2003 follow:

..    Revised  estimates  of future  pricing for fiber and cable:  Pricing in the
     telecommunications industry remains depressed as the industry has failed to
     reduce capacity.  Our previous  projections assumed some rationalization of
     capacity that would lead to more stable pricing.  We now expect the current
     depressed pricing conditions to persist into 2005 and beyond.
..    Revised estimates of demand for premium fiber product: Based on competitive
     conditions and projected future customer requirements,  we do not expect to
     achieve  the level of demand  for  premium  fiber  products  we  previously
     projected.  Although we have introduced  innovative products to the market,
     we have not been able to obtain  the  historical  premium  prices  for such
     products. Additionally,  demand for premium fiber has declined as there are
     fewer projects  demanding premium fiber. As a result, we have significantly
     reduced our  outlook for future  revenue  and  profitability  from  premium
     products.  We now do not expect any  significant  increase in premium fiber
     mix for the foreseeable future.
..    Revised  estimates for the long-term  worldwide market volume growth: As we
     forecast  customer demand, we have lowered the rate of volume growth in the
     longer range.

We estimated the fair value of the Telecommunications segment using a discounted
cash flow model based on our current  estimates for the long-term  growth of the
Telecommunications   segment,   and  concluded   that  the  fair  value  of  the
Telecommunications  segment  was  below its  carrying  amount.  Accordingly,  we
recorded an impairment  charge of $1,420 million to reduce the carrying value of
goodwill to its implied  fair value.  The  goodwill  impairment  charge has been
included in  restructuring,  impairment  and other  charges and (credits) on the
consolidated statements of operations. We updated our Telecommunications segment
goodwill test in the fourth  quarter.  The result of the test concluded that the
fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its book value.

We performed a goodwill  impairment test for our Specialty  Materials  reporting
unit in the fourth  quarter.  The result of this  impairment test indicated that
the fair value of our reporting unit exceeded its book value.





9.   Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (concluded)

As  discussed  in  Note 3  (Restructuring,  Impairment  and  Other  Charges  and
(Credits)), in the third quarter of 2004, we completed the sale of our frequency
controls business, which was part of the Telecommunications segment. As required
by SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible  Assets," we allocated a portion
of the Telecommunications segment goodwill balance to the carrying amount of the
frequency  controls business in determining the loss on disposal.  The amount of
goodwill to be included in that  carrying  amount was based on the relative fair
value of the business to be disposed  and the portion of the  Telecommunications
segment to be retained.  The amount of goodwill  allocated to the carrying value
of frequency controls business was $30 million.

2003 Assessment
- ---------------
We performed goodwill impairment tests for our  Telecommunications and Specialty
Materials  segment reporting units in the fourth quarter of 2003. The results of
our  impairment  tests  indicated  that the fair  value of each  reporting  unit
exceeded its book value.

In the third  quarter we  completed  the sale of certain  photonic  technologies
assets, which was part of the Telecommunications segment. We allocated a portion
of the Telecommunications segment goodwill balance to the carrying amount of the
photonic technologies assets in determining the loss on disposal.  The amount of
goodwill allocated to the photonic technologies assets was $21 million.

Other Intangible Assets


Amortized  intangible  assets are  primarily  related to the  Telecommunications
segment.

Amortization  expense  related  to these  intangible  assets is  expected  to be
approximately $17 million in 2005, $13 million in 2006, $12 million in 2007, $11
million in 2008, and insignificant thereafter.

10.  Other Accrued Liabilities (concluded)

Asbestos Settlement

The current liability  represents the cost of our investment in PCE and the fair
value of the 25 million  shares of Corning common stock as of December 31, 2004,
which will be contributed to the Plan when it becomes  effective.  As the timing
of this  obligation's  settlement is controlled by a third party (not  Corning),
this portion of the PCC  liability is  considered a "due on demand"  obligation.
Accordingly,  this portion of the  obligation  has been  classified as a current
liability,  even though it is possible  that the  contribution  could be made in
2006 or later.  The  non-current  liability  represents the net present value of
cash payments as of December 31, 2004,  which will be contributed to the Plan in
six installments beginning one year after the Plan is effective. Refer to Note 7
(Investments) for additional information on the asbestos settlement.

Customer Deposits

During 2004, in response to the rapid growth of the liquid crystal display (LCD)
market, Corning held discussions with several of its customers to discuss how to
meet this  demand.  Corning and these  customers  have  typically  entered  into
multi-year  supply  agreements  for the purchase  and sale of glass  substrates.
These  agreements  provide for Corning to supply a percentage of the  customers'
requirements and include mechanisms for forecasting and ordering. As part of its
discussions,  Corning has sought  improved  payment  terms,  including  deposits
against orders, to provide a greater degree of assurance that we are effectively
building capacity to meet the needs of a rapidly growing industry.

In 2004,  Corning and a Taiwanese customer entered into a long-term purchase and
supply  agreement  (as amended) in which the Display  Technologies  segment will
supply  LCD  glass  to the  customer  over a  five-year  period.  As part of the
agreement,  the  customer  will make  advance  cash  deposits of $460 million to
Corning  through  2006 for a portion of the  contracted  glass to be  purchased.
Corning  received a total of $204 million of deposits against orders in 2004 and
expects to receive an additional $171 million in 2005.

In the  event  the  customer  does  not make all  customer  deposit  installment
payments  or elects not to  purchase  the agreed  upon  quantities  of  product,
subject to specific  conditions  outlined in the  agreement,  Corning may retain
certain amounts of the customer deposit.  Likewise,  if Corning does not deliver
agreed upon product  quantities,  subject to specific conditions outlined in the
agreement,  Corning may be required to return  certain  amounts of the  customer
deposit.






11.  Debt



Based on borrowing rates currently  available to us for loans with similar terms
and  maturities,  the fair value of long-term  debt was $2.8 billion at December
31, 2004.

The  following  table shows debt  maturities  by year at  December  31, 2004 (in
millions):
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2005        2006           2007          2008           2009         Thereafter
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

$478         $16           $104          $411           $166           $1,517
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We  have  convertible  debt  of  $297  million  due  November  1,  2008  that is
convertible into approximately 31 million shares of common stock at an effective
conversion  price  of  $9.675  per  share.  The  debentures  are  available  for
conversion  into  103.3592  shares  of  Corning  common  stock  for each  $1,000
debenture.   The  debentures  are  issued  at  par  and  pay  interest  of  3.5%
semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year.  Effective November 8, 2004,
we may call the  debentures at any time,  at specified  redemption  prices.  The
holder can convert the debenture  into Corning common stock at any time prior to
maturity or redemption.

We have $272  million of zero coupon  convertible  debentures  outstanding.  The
initial price of the debentures was $741.92 with a 2% annual yield.  Interest is
compounded  semi-annually with a 25% conversion factor. The debentures mature on
November 8, 2015, and are  convertible  into  approximately  3 million shares of
Corning common stock at the rate of 8.3304 shares per $1,000  debenture.  We may
call the debentures at any time on or after November 8, 2005. The debentures may
be put to us for $819.54 on November 8, 2005 and $905.29 on November 8, 2010. We
have the  option  of  settling  this  obligation  in cash,  common  stock,  or a
combination  of both.  The holder can convert the debenture  into Corning common
stock at any time prior to maturity or redemption.  The zero coupon  convertible
debentures are presented in the above table as due in 2005 which is the earliest
possible redemption date.

We also have $96 million of convertible  subordinated  notes bearing interest at
4.875%,  due in 2008. The notes are convertible into 6 million shares of Corning
common stock at a conversion price of approximately $16 per share.





11.  Long-Term Debt and Loans Payable (concluded)

We have full access to a $2.0 billion  revolving line of credit with a syndicate
of banks.  The line of credit  expires in August 2005.  There were no borrowings
under the  agreement  at December  31,  2004.  The  revolving  credit  agreement
provides for  borrowing of U.S.  dollars and Euro  currency at various rates and
supports our commercial  paper program when available.  The facility  includes a
covenant  requiring  us to  maintain a total  debt to total  capital  ratio,  as
defined, not greater than 60%. At December 31, 2004, this ratio was 41%.

Debt Retirements

During  the  years  ended  December  31,  2004,  2003 and  2002,  we  retired  a
significant  portion of our  outstanding  debentures as part of a debt reduction
program.  The debt was retired  through a combination  of cash  repurchases  and
exchanges  for  Corning  common  stock.   The  following  table  summarizes  the
activities related to our debt retirements (in millions):


In addition to the above  repurchases,  during 2004 we repaid  approximately $99
million of our 7.625% debentures as a result of certain bond holders  exercising
their early repayment  option.  The remaining balance of the bonds that were not
repaid will mature in 2024.

Issuance of Long-Term Debt

In the first  quarter of 2004,  we issued $400 million of  debentures,  of which
$200 million aggregate  principal amount of 5.90% notes mature on March 15, 2014
and $200 million  aggregate  principal amount of 6.20% notes mature on March 15,
2016. These debentures were issued under our existing $5 billion universal shelf
registration  statement,  which became  effective in March 2001. We realized net
proceeds of  approximately  $396 million from the issuance of these  debentures,
which  was  used to fund  debt  repurchases,  capital  expenditures  and cost of
operations.  At  December  31,  2004,  our  remaining  capacity  under the shelf
registration is approximately $2.5 billion.

In 2004,  Corning  entered into a 10-year loan agreement with a Japanese bank to
fund  certain  capital  expansion  activities  in  Japan.  An  initial  loan  of
approximately  $46 million,  bearing  interest at 2.6%,  was received in 2004. A
final loan of approximately $48 million,  bearing interest at 2.1%, was received
in  January  2005.  The loans  will  amortize  equally  from  July 2006  through
maturity.

12.  Employee Retirement Plans

Defined Benefit Plans

We  have  defined   benefit   pension  plans  covering   certain   domestic  and
international  employees.  Our  funding  policy  has  been  to  contribute,   as
necessary, an amount in excess of the minimum requirements determined jointly by
us and our  consulting  actuaries  to achieve the  company's  long-term  funding
targets. In 2004, we made a voluntary incremental contribution of $52 million to
our domestic and international pension plans.

We use a December 31 measurement  date for our domestic  defined  benefit plans.
The  measurement  dates  for our  foreign  defined  benefit  pension  plans  are
September 30 and December 31.





12.  Employee Retirement Plans (continued)

In 2000,  we amended our U.S.  pension  plan to include a cash  balance  pension
feature.  All salaried and non-union  hourly employees hired before July 1, 2000
were given the choice of staying in the existing  plan or  participating  in the
cash balance plan beginning January 1, 2001. Salaried employees hired after July
1, 2000  automatically  became  participants in the new cash balance plan. Under
the cash balance plan,  employee accounts are credited monthly with a percentage
of  eligible  pay based on age and years of  service.  Benefits  are 100% vested
after five years of service.

Corning and certain of its domestic subsidiaries also offer postretirement plans
that provide health care and life  insurance  benefits for retirees and eligible
dependents.  Certain  employees  may  become  eligible  for such  postretirement
benefits upon reaching  retirement  age. Prior to January 1, 2003, our principal
retiree  medical plans  required  retiree  contributions  each year equal to the
excess of medical cost increases over general  inflation  rates.  In response to
rising health care costs, effective January 1, 2003, we changed our cost-sharing
approach for retiree medical coverage. For current retirees (including surviving
spouses) and active employees eligible for the salaried retiree medical program,
we are placing a "cap" on the amount we will  contribute  toward retiree medical
coverage in the future. The cap will equal 150% of our 2001 contributions toward
retiree medical benefits.  Once our  contributions  toward retiree medical costs
reach  this cap,  impacted  retirees  will  have to pay the  excess  amount,  in
addition to their regular contributions for coverage.



The  accumulated  benefit  obligation for defined benefit pension plans was $2.3
billion and $2.0 billion at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
In December 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug,  Improvement and Modernization
Act of 2003 (the Act) was passed which expands Medicare to include an outpatient
prescription  drug benefit beginning in 2006. In May 2004, the FASB issued Staff
Position (FSP) No. FAS 106-2, "Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to
the Medicare Prescription Drug,  Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003" (FSP
No.  106-1),  which  provides  guidance on how companies  should account for the
impact  of  the  Act on its  postretirement  health  care  plans.  To  encourage
employers to retain or provide  postretirement drug benefits,  beginning in 2006
the federal  government will provide  non-taxable  subsidy payments to employers
that  sponsor  prescription  drug  benefits  to retirees  that are  "actuarially
equivalent"  to  the  Medicare   benefit.   Corning  has  determined   that  its
postretirement  health care plans'  prescription  drug benefits are  actuarially
equivalent to Medicare Part D benefits to be provided  under the Act.  Effective
in the third  quarter of 2004,  Corning  prospectively  adopted  the  accounting
guidance of FSP No. 106-2, which reduced our postretirement health care and life
insurance plans'  accumulated  postretirement  benefit obligation by $73 million
and the related  annual  expense by $10 million.  For 2004,  our  postretirement
benefit expense decreased $5 million  reflecting the adoption of this accounting
guidance.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The total fair value of  domestic  plan  assets at  December  31, 2004 is $1,791
million and the expected long-term rate of return on these assets is 8.5%.





12.  Employee Retirement Plans (concluded)

We have an investment policy for domestic and international pension plans with a
primary objective to adequately provide for both the growth and liquidity needed
to support all current and future  benefit  payment  obligations.  For  domestic
plans, the investment strategy is to invest in a diversified portfolio of assets
which are expected to satisfy the above  objective and produce both absolute and
risk adjusted  returns  competitive  with a benchmark that for domestic plans is
60% Russell 3000 Index, 20% Lehman Long  Government/Credit  Index and 20% Lehman
Long Credit Index. For international plans, the investment strategy is to invest
in a composite  of 50%  equities  and 50% fixed  income  indexes.  The  strategy
includes the following target asset allocation:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                Domestic         International
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Equity Securities                                 50%                48%
Fixed Income Securities                           32%                50%
Real Estate                                        8%
Other                                             10%                 2%
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Total                                        100%               100%
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A tactical allocation mandate, which is part of the overall investment strategy,
allows the actual  allocation  in equity  securities to be reduced by maximum of
10% relative to the total based on market valuations.

Equity securities include Corning common stock in the amount of $7 million (0.4%
of total plan assets) and $6 million (0.3% of total plan assets) at December 31,
2004 and 2003, respectively.

Cash Flow Data
- --------------
We anticipate making voluntary contributions of at least $100 million in cash or
common stock to our domestic and international pension plans in 2005.



Other Benefit Plans

We  offer  defined   contribution   plans  covering  employees  meeting  certain
eligibility   requirements.   On  January  1,  2003,  we  reduced  our  matching
contributions  to the domestic Corning  Incorporated  Investment Plan by 2.5% of
pay for all salaried employees.  This reduction was temporary,  and we increased
our contributions to prior levels on January 1, 2004. Total consolidated defined
contribution  plan expense was $28 million,  $24 million and $44 million for the
years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

13.  Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and Hedging Activities

Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees

FASB  issued  Interpretation  No. 45,  "Guarantor's  Accounting  and  Disclosure
Requirements for Guarantees,  Including  Indirect  Guarantees of Indebtedness of
Others"  (FIN 45),  requires a company,  at the time a guarantee  is issued,  to
recognize a liability  for the fair value or market value of the  obligation  it
assumes.  In the normal  course of our  business,  we do not  routinely  provide
significant third-party guarantees.  Generally,  third-party guarantees provided
by Corning  are  limited to certain  financial  guarantees,  including  stand-by
letters  of credit and  performance  bonds,  and the  incurrence  of  contingent
liabilities in the form of purchase price  adjustments  related to attainment of
milestones.  These  guarantees have various terms,  and none of these guarantees
are individually significant.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Total  rental  expense was $54  million  for 2004,  $66 million for 2003 and $85
million for 2002.

The ability of certain  subsidiaries and associated  companies to transfer funds
is limited by provisions of foreign government regulations, affiliate agreements
and certain loan agreements.  At December 31, 2004, the amount of equity subject
to such restrictions for consolidated  subsidiaries totaled $217 million.  While
this  amount  is  legally   restricted,   it  does  not  result  in  operational
difficulties since we have generally permitted subsidiaries to retain a majority
of equity to support their growth programs.  In addition, we have provided other
financial guarantees and contingent  liabilities in the form of stand-by letters
of credit and  performance  bonds.  We have agreed to provide a credit  facility
related to Dow Corning as discussed in Note 7 (Investments).  The funding of the
Dow  Corning  credit  facility  will  be  required  only if Dow  Corning  is not
otherwise  able to meet  its  scheduled  funding  obligations  in its  confirmed
Bankruptcy Plan. The purchase obligations primarily represent raw materials take
or pay  contracts in our  Telecommunications  segment.  We believe a significant
majority of these  guarantees  and  contingent  liabilities  will expire without
being funded.



Corning  is  a  defendant   in  various   lawsuits,   including   environmental,
product-related  suits,  the Dow  Corning and PCC  matters  discussed  in Note 7
(Investments), and is subject to various claims which arise in the normal course
of business.  In the opinion of  management,  the ultimate  disposition of these
matters  will not have a  material  adverse  effect  on  Corning's  consolidated
financial position, liquidity or results of operations.

Hedging Activities

We operate and conduct  business in many foreign  countries  and as a result are
exposed to  movements  in foreign  currency  exchange  rates.  Our  exposure  to
exchange rate effects includes:

..    exchange  rate  movements  on  financial   instruments   and   transactions
     denominated in foreign currencies which impact earnings, and
..    exchange  rate  movements   upon   conversion  of  net  assets  in  foreign
     subsidiaries  for which the  functional  currency  is not the U.S.  dollar,
     which impact our net equity.

Our most significant  foreign currency exposures relate to Japan,  Korea, Taiwan
and western  European  countries.  We  selectively  enter into foreign  exchange
forward and option contracts with durations generally 15 months or less to hedge
our exposure to exchange rate risk on foreign source income and  purchases.  The
hedges are  scheduled  to mature  coincident  with the timing of the  underlying
foreign currency commitments and transactions.  The objective of these contracts
is to neutralize the impact of exchange rate movements on our operating results.

We engage in foreign currency hedging activities to reduce the risk that changes
in exchange  rates will adversely  affect the eventual net cash flows  resulting
from the sale of  products  to foreign  customers  and  purchases  from  foreign
suppliers.  The hedge contracts  reduce the exposure to fluctuations in exchange
rate movements  because the gains and losses  associated  with foreign  currency
balances  and  transactions  are  generally  offset with gains and losses of the
hedge  contracts.  Because the impact of movements in foreign  exchange rates on
the value of hedge contracts  offsets the related impact on the underlying items
being hedged,  these  financial  instruments  help alleviate the risk that might
otherwise result from currency exchange rate fluctuations.





13.  Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and Hedging Activities (concluded)

The following table  summarizes the notional  amounts and respective fair values
of Corning's derivative financial instruments, which mature at varying dates, at
December 31, 2004 (in millions):
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                        Notional Amount             Fair Value
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Foreign exchange forward contracts         $ 304                      $  (3)
Foreign exchange option contracts          $ 660                      $ (18)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The  forward  and option  contracts  we use in  managing  our  foreign  currency
exposures contain an element of risk in that the counterparties may be unable to
meet the terms of the agreements. However, we minimize this risk by limiting the
counterparties   to  a  diverse  group  of   highly-rated   major  domestic  and
international   financial  institutions  with  which  we  have  other  financial
relationships.   We  are   exposed   to   potential   losses  in  the  event  of
non-performance by these counterparties; however, we do not expect to record any
losses  as a result  of  counterparty  default.  We do not  require  and are not
required to place collateral for these financial instruments.

In March and April of 2002,  we entered into three  interest rate swaps that are
fair value hedges and  economically  exchanged a notional amount of $275 million
of fixed rate long-term debt to floating rate debt.  Under the terms of the swap
agreements,  we paid the  counterparty  a  floating  rate that is indexed to the
six-month  LIBOR rate and received the fixed rates of 8.3% to 8.875%,  which are
the stated  interest  rates on the long-term  debt  instruments.  As a result of
these transactions, Corning was exposed to the impact of interest rate changes.

In 2004 and 2003, we  terminated  the interest  rate swap  agreements  described
above.  The  termination  of these swaps resulted in gains of $5 million in 2004
and $15 million in 2003 which we will  amortize  to  earnings as a reduction  of
interest expense over the remaining life of the debt. The cash proceeds from the
termination  of the swaps totaled $8 million in 2004 and $17 million in 2003 and
are included in the  financing  section of our  consolidated  statements of cash
flows.

It is our policy to  conservatively  manage our  exposure to changes in interest
rates.  Our policy  sets a maximum  cap that total  variable  rate debt will not
exceed 35% of the total debt  portfolio at anytime.  At December  31, 2004,  our
consolidated debt portfolio contained less than 1% of variable rate instruments.

14.  Shareholders' Equity








14.  Shareholders' Equity (continued)

Preferred Stock

We have designated 2.4 million shares as Series A Junior Participating Preferred
Stock for which no shares have been issued. In June 1996, the Board of Directors
approved the renewal of the Preferred Share Purchase Right Plan,  which entitles
shareholders  to  purchase  0.01 of a share of  Series  A  Junior  Participating
Preferred Stock upon the occurrence of certain events.  In addition,  the rights
entitle shareholders to purchase shares of common stock at a 50% discount in the
event a person or group  acquires 20% or more of our  outstanding  common stock.
The preferred  share purchase  rights became  effective July 15, 1996 and expire
July 15, 2006.

The Series C mandatory  convertible  preferred stock has an annual dividend rate
of 7%,  payable  quarterly in cash.  The dividends are also payable  immediately
upon  conversion  to Corning  common  stock.  At the time we issued the Series C
mandatory  convertible preferred stock, a one-time dividend was declared for all
dividends  that will be payable from issuance  through the mandatory  conversion
date.  We secured  the  payment  of the  dividends  through  the  issuance  of a
promissory note and used a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the Series C
preferred  stock to  purchase  U.S.  treasury  securities  that were  pledged as
collateral to secure the payments on the promissory note. The Series C mandatory
convertible   preferred  stock  will  automatically  convert  on  the  mandatory
conversion  date of August 16,  2005,  into  between  50.813 and 62.5  shares of
Corning common stock,  depending on the then current  market price.  At any time
prior to the mandatory conversion date, holders may elect to convert in whole or
part of their  shares of Series C preferred  stock into 50.813  shares of common
stock plus an amount of cash  equal to the market  value at that time of the pro
rata share of the collateral portfolio that secures the promissory note.

The Series C mandatory convertible preferred stock has a liquidation  preference
of $100 per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends.





14.  Shareholders' Equity (concluded)



(1)  Includes adjustments from Dow Corning.
(2)  Zero tax effect for 2004. Refer to Note 6 (Income Taxes) for an explanation
     of Corning's tax paying position.

15. Loss Per Common Share

Basic loss per common share is computed by dividing loss  attributable to common
shareholders,  adjusted for the Series C mandatory  convertible  preferred stock
dividend,  by the  weighted-average  number of common shares outstanding for the
period.  Diluted loss per common share assumes the issuance of common shares for
all potentially dilutive securities  outstanding.  Since we reported a loss from
continuing  operations in 2004, 2003 and 2002, the diluted loss per common share
is the same as the basic  loss per common  share,  as any  potentially  dilutive
securities would reduce the loss per common share from continuing operations.





15.  Loss Per Common Share (concluded)




16.  Stock Compensation Plans

At December 31, 2004, our stock compensation programs are in accordance with the
2000 Employee Equity Participation Program and 2000 Equity Plan for Non-Employee
Directors  Program.  For calendar years  beginning  January 1, 2001, 3.5% of our
common stock  outstanding at the beginning of the year and any ungranted  shares
from prior years will be available  for grant in the current  year.  At December
31, 2004,  114 million  shares are available  under these programs for 2005. Any
remaining shares available for grant, but not yet granted,  will be carried over
and used in the following year.

Stock Option Plans

Our stock option plans  provide  non-qualified  and  incentive  stock options to
purchase  authorized but unissued or treasury  shares at the market price on the
grant date and generally  become  exercisable in  installments  from one to five
years from the grant date. The maximum term of non-qualified and incentive stock
options is 10 years from the grant date.





16.  Stock Compensation Plans (continued)


The  weighted-average  fair value of options granted was $4.99 in 2004, $3.82 in
2003 and $3.64 in 2002.



Incentive Stock Plans

The Corning  Incentive  Stock Plan permits  stock grants,  either  determined by
specific performance goals or issued directly, in most instances, subject to the
possibility of forfeiture and without cash consideration.

In 2004, 2003 and 2002, grants of 3,051,000 shares,  1,842,000 shares and 88,500
shares,  respectively,  were made under this plan. The weighted-average price of
the grants was $12.57 in 2004, $10.61 in 2003 and $7.15 in 2002, respectively. A
total of 5.1 million  shares issued  remained  subject to forfeiture at December
31, 2004.

We apply APB 25 accounting for our stock-based compensation plans.  Compensation
expense is recorded for awards of shares or share rights over the period earned.
Compensation  expense of $5 million, $1 million and $1 million,  net of tax, was
recorded in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.





16.  Stock Compensation Plans (concluded)

SFAS 123  requires  that reload  options be treated as separate  grants from the
related  original option grants.  Under our reload program,  upon exercise of an
option,  employees may tender  unrestricted shares owned at the time of exercise
to pay the  exercise  price and  related tax  withholding,  and receive a reload
option  covering  the same number of shares  tendered  for such  purposes at the
market  price on the date of exercise.  The reload  options vest in one year and
are only granted in certain circumstances according to the original terms of the
option being exercised. The existence of the reload feature results in a greater
number of options being measured.

For  purposes of SFAS 123  disclosure,  the fair value of each  option  grant is
estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.

The following are  weighted-average  assumptions used for grants under our stock
plans in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively:
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                       2004             2003              2002
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Expected life in years                   4                 5                5
Risk free interest rate                3.4%              2.9%             4.0%
Expected volatility                     50%               79%              80%
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

During 2004,  Corning  updated its  analysis of the  historical  stock  exercise
behavior of its employees, among other relevant factors, and determined that the
best estimate of the stock  options'  expected term granted in 2004 was 4 years,
compared  to our  previous  expected  term  estimate  of 5 years.  Additionally,
Corning  used a 10-year  mean  reversion  analysis,  as allowed by SFAS 123,  to
determine  the  volatility  assumption  also used to estimate  the fair value of
options  granted  in 2004.  Prior  to 2004,  Corning  used  historical  trailing
volatility for a period equal to the expected term of our stock options. Corning
believes  a mean  reversion  analysis  provides  a  better  estimate  of  future
volatility expectations.

Worldwide Employee Share Purchase Plan

In  addition to the Stock  Option  Plan and  Incentive  Stock  Plans,  we have a
Worldwide Employee Share Purchase Plan (WESPP).  Under the WESPP,  substantially
all  employees  can elect to have up to 10% of their  annual  wages  withheld to
purchase our common stock.  The purchase  price of the stock is 85% of the lower
of the beginning-of-quarter or end-of-quarter market price.

17.  Business Combinations



(1)  Acquisition  of 56% interest in Lucent  Technologies  Shanghai  Fiber Optic
     Co.,  Ltd. and a 68% interest in Lucent  Technologies  Beijing  Fiber Optic
     Cable Co.,  Ltd.  from  Lucent  Technologies.  The  Shanghai-based  company
     manufactures optical fiber and the Beijing-based company manufactures fiber
     cable.  Purchase  price  included 30 million shares of Corning common stock
     valued   at   $48   million.   These   entities   are   included   in   the
     Telecommunications segment.

The  transaction  listed  on the  previous  table  was  accounted  for under the
purchase method of accounting.  We are responsible for estimating the fair value
of the assets and liabilities  acquired.  We have made estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets,  liabilities and expenses  resulting
from  such  acquisitions.  From  time  to  time  we  use  our  common  stock  as
consideration for business combinations.  The value of the common stock is based
upon the  average  closing  price of  Corning  common  stock for a range of days
surrounding  the  agreement  or   announcement   and  adjusted  for  a  discount
commensurate with restrictions on the shares, if applicable.






18.  Operating Segments

Corning conducts its worldwide operations through operating segments,  which are
defined  as  components  of  an  enterprise   about  which  separate   financial
information  is  available  that is evaluated  regularly by the chief  operating
decision maker, or decision making group, in deciding how to allocate  resources
and in assessing  performance.  Our Chief Operating Decision Making group (CODM)
is  comprised of the chairman and chief  executive  officer,  vice  chairman and
chief   financial    officer,    president   and   chief   operating    officer,
president-Corning  Technologies,  executive vice president-chief  administrative
officer,  executive vice  president-chief  technology  officer,  and senior vice
president and operations chief of staff.

Our reportable operating segments follow:

..    Display  Technologies - manufactures  liquid crystal display glass for flat
     panel displays;
..    Telecommunications  - manufactures optical fiber and cable and hardware and
     equipment components for the telecommunications industry;
..    Environmental  Technologies - manufactures  ceramic  substrates and filters
     for automobile and diesel applications; and
..    Life Sciences - manufactures  glass and plastic  consumables for scientific
     applications.

The  Environmental  Technologies  reportable  segment is an  aggregation  of our
Automotive and Diesel  operating  segments,  as these two segments share similar
economic  characteristics,  products,  customer types,  production processes and
distribution methods.

All other  operating  segments that do not meet the  quantitative  threshold for
separate reporting (e.g., Specialty Materials, Ophthalmic and Conventional Video
Components),  certain  corporate  investments  (e.g.  Dow Corning and  Steuben),
discontinued  operations,  and unallocated  expenses  (including other corporate
items)  have been  grouped as  "Unallocated  and  Other."  Unallocated  expenses
include:  gains or losses on repurchases and retirement of debt; charges related
to the asbestos litigation;  restructuring and impairment charges related to the
corporate  research  and  development  or staff  organizations;  and charges for
increases in our tax valuation allowance.  Unallocated and Other also represents
the  reconciliation  between  the totals  for the  reportable  segments  and our
consolidated operating results.

We prepared the financial results for our operating  segments on a basis that is
consistent  with  the  manner  in  which we  internally  disaggregate  financial
information to assist in making  internal  operating  decisions.  We include the
earnings of equity  affiliates  that are closely  associated  with our operating
segments in the  respective  segment's  net income.  We have  allocated  certain
common  expenses  among  segments  differently  than we  would  for  stand-alone
financial  information  prepared in accordance with GAAP. These expenses include
interest,  taxes  and  corporate  functions.  Segment  net  income  may  not  be
consistent with measures used by other companies. The accounting policies of our
operating  segments are the same as those applied in the consolidated  financial
statements.  Revenue  attributed to geographic areas is based on the location of
the customer.

18.  Operating Segments (continued)

(1)  Depreciation   expense  for  Corning's   reportable  segments  includes  an
     allocation  of   depreciation  of  corporate   property  not   specifically
     identifiable to a segment.  Related depreciable assets are not allocated to
     segment assets.
(2)  Non-direct research,  development and engineering expenses are allocated to
     segments based upon direct project spending for each segment.
(3)  Interest  expense is allocated to segments based on a percentage of segment
     net operating assets.  Consolidated  subsidiaries with independent  capital
     structures do not receive additional allocations of interest expense.
(4)  Many of Corning's  administrative  and staff  functions  are performed on a
     centralized  basis.  Where  practicable,  Corning charges these expenses to
     segments  based upon the extent to which each  business  uses a centralized
     function. Other staff functions, such as corporate finance, human resources
     and legal are allocated to segments, primarily as a percentage of sales.
(5)  Minority  interests  include the following  restructuring,  impairment  and
     other charges and (credits):
     .    For 2004,  gains  from the sale of assets of CAV in excess of  assumed
          salvage value of $17 million,  and reversals of CAV severance reserves
          of $2 million.
     .    Impairment  charges for long-lived assets of CAV and exit costs of $57
          million and $70 million for 2003 and 2002, respectively.
(6)  Equity in earnings of associated companies, net of impairments includes the
     following restructuring and impairment charges:
     .    $35  million,  $7 million and $34 million of charges to impair  equity
          method  investments  in  the   Telecommunications   segment  to  their
          estimated fair value in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
     .    In  2004,  Dow  Corning   Corporation   recorded  charges  related  to
          restructuring actions and adjustments to interest liabilities recorded
          on its emergence from  bankruptcy.  Our equity  earnings  included $21
          million related to these charges.
     .    In 2003, Samsung Corning Co., Ltd. recorded asset impairment  charges.
          Our equity earnings included $66 million related to these charges.
     .    In  2002,   Samsung  Corning   Micro-Optics   Company  Ltd.   recorded
          restructuring and impairment charges. Our equity earnings included $20
          million related to these charges.
(7)  Segment  assets  include  inventory,  accounts  receivable,   property  and
     associated equity companies and cost investments.



(1)  Non-reportable operating segments net (loss) income includes the results of
     non-reportable operating segments.
(2)  Non-segment  loss and other includes the results of non-segment  operations
     and other corporate activities.
(3)  (Provision)  benefit  for  income  taxes  includes  taxes  associated  with
     non-segment  restructuring,  impairment and other charges and (credits) and
     $937 for the impact of establishing a valuation  allowance  against certain
     deferred tax assets in 2004.
(4)  Equity in earnings of associated  companies,  net of  impairments  includes
     amounts   derived  from  corporate   investments,   primarily  Dow  Corning
     Corporation.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP



To the Stockholders and
Board of Directors of
Dow Corning Corporation


In our  opinion,  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets  and  related
consolidated  statements  of  operations,  comprehensive  income,  stockholders'
equity and cash flows present fairly,  in all material  respects,  the financial
position of Dow Corning  Corporation  and its  subsidiaries at December 31, 2004
and December 31, 2003, and the results of their  operations and their cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004, in conformity
with accounting  principles  generally accepted in the United States of America.
These financial  statements are the responsibility of the Company's  management;
our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial  statements based
upon our audits.  We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting  Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance   about  whether  the  financial   statements  are  free  of  material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the  amounts  and  disclosures  in  the  financial  statements,   assessing  the
accounting  principles  used and significant  estimates made by management,  and
evaluating the overall  financial  statement  presentation.  We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

NOTE 1 - BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION
- -------------------------------------------

Business
- --------

     Dow Corning Corporation ("Dow Corning") was incorporated in 1943 by Corning
Glass Works, now Corning Incorporated ("Corning"),  and The Dow Chemical Company
("Dow Chemical") for the purpose of developing and producing  polymers and other
materials based on silicon chemistry.  Dow Corning operates in various countries
around the world  through  numerous  wholly owned or majority  owned  subsidiary
corporations  (hereinafter,  the consolidated  operations of Dow Corning and its
subsidiaries will be referred to as the "Company").

     Dow Corning built its business based on silicon  chemistry.  Silicon is one
of the most abundant elements in the world.  Most of Dow Corning's  products are
based  on  polymers  known as  silicones,  which  have a  silicon-oxygen-silicon
backbone. Through various chemical processes, Dow Corning manufactures silicones
that have an extremely  wide variety of  characteristics,  in forms ranging from
fluids,  gels,  greases  and  elastomeric  materials  to resins and other  rigid
materials.  Silicones  combine the temperature and chemical  resistance of glass
with the versatility of plastics.  Regardless of form or application,  silicones
generally possess such qualities as electrical resistance, resistance to extreme
temperatures,   resistance  to  deterioration   from  aging,  water  repellency,
lubricating  characteristics,  relative chemical and physiological inertness and
resistance to ultraviolet radiation.

     The Company engages primarily in the discovery, development, manufacturing,
marketing  and  distribution  of  silicon-based  materials  and the provision of
related  services.  Since its  inception,  Dow  Corning  has been  engaged  in a
continuous  program of basic and applied research on silicon-based  materials to
develop new products and processes,  to improve and refine existing products and
processes and to develop new  applications  for existing  products.  The Company
manufactures  over 7,000  products  and serves  approximately  25,000  customers
worldwide, with no single customer accounting for more than three percent of the
Company's  sales  in  any of the  past  three  years.  Principal  United  States
manufacturing  plants are located in Kentucky and  Michigan.  Principal  foreign
manufacturing  plants are located in Belgium,  China,  France,  Germany,  Japan,
South  Korea  and  the  United  Kingdom.   The  Company  operates  research  and
development facilities in the United States, Belgium,  China, Germany,  Ireland,
Japan,  South Korea and the United Kingdom.  The Company also operates technical
service centers in the United States,  Belgium,  Brazil, China, Germany,  Japan,
South Korea, Taiwan and the United Kingdom. Dow Corning's average employment for
2004 was approximately 8,800 persons.

     The consolidated  financial  statements include the accounts of the Company
and its subsidiaries. Certain prior year items have been reclassified to conform
to the 2004 presentation.

Bankruptcy Proceedings
- ----------------------

     Prior to 1992,  the  Company  was  engaged in the  manufacture  and sale of
silicone gel breast implants and the raw material  components of those products.
In January 1992,  the Company ceased  production of these  products  following a
request by the United States Food and Drug  Administration  that breast  implant
producers  voluntarily  halt the sale of silicone gel breast  implants.  Between
1991 and 1995, the Company  experienced a substantial  increase in the number of
lawsuits against the Company relating to breast implants.

     By May 1995, the Company was named in thousands of lawsuits filed by, or on
behalf of,  individuals  who claim to have, or have had, breast  implants.  As a
result, on May 15, 1995 (the "Filing Date"),  the Company  voluntarily filed for
protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S.  Bankruptcy Code (the "Bankruptcy Code")
with the U.S.  Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern  District of Michigan,  Northern
Division  (the  "Bankruptcy  Court") in order to resolve  the  Company's  breast
implant  liabilities  and related  matters (the  "Chapter 11  Proceeding").  The
Company  emerged from the Chapter 11 Proceeding on June 1, 2004 (the  "Effective
Date")  and  is   currently  in  the  process  of   implementing   its  plan  of
reorganization.  The plan of reorganization  provides funding for the resolution
of breast implant and other products liability litigation covered by the Chapter
11  Proceeding  through  settlement or litigation  and for the  satisfaction  of
commercial creditor claims. See Note 17 for further information on this matter.

     The Company's  consolidated  financial  statements  for periods  during the
pendency  of  the  Company's  Chapter  11  Proceeding  have  been  presented  in
conformity  with  the  American  Institute  of  Certified  Public   Accountants'
Statement of Position  90-7 ("SOP  90-7"),  "Financial  Reporting by Entities in
Reorganization  Under the Bankruptcy  Code," issued  November 19, 1990. SOP 90-7
requires a segregation  of  liabilities  subject to compromise by the Bankruptcy
Court as of the bankruptcy filing date (May 15, 1995) and  identification of all
transactions and events that are directly  associated with the reorganization of
the Company. Upon emergence from the Chapter 11 Proceeding,  the Company was not
subject to "fresh start" reporting as defined in SOP 90-7.






NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
- ---------------------------------------------------

Principles of Consolidation
- ---------------------------

     The consolidated  financial  statements include the accounts of Dow Corning
and  all  of  its  wholly  owned  and  majority   owned   domestic  and  foreign
subsidiaries.  The  Company's  interests  in 20% to 50% owned  subsidiaries  are
carried on the equity basis and are included  under the caption  "Other Assets -
Other"  in  the  consolidated  balance  sheets.  Intercompany  transactions  and
balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

Cash and Cash Equivalents
- -------------------------

     Cash  equivalents  include all highly liquid  investments  with an original
maturity  of ninety days or less.  The  carrying  amounts  for cash  equivalents
approximate their fair market values.

Inventories
- -----------

     The value of inventories is determined using lower of cost or market as the
basis.  Produced  goods  are  valued  using  a  first-in,  first-out  cost  flow
methodology,  while purchased materials and supplies are valued using an average
cost flow methodology. See Note 6 for further information.

Property and Depreciation
- -------------------------

     Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less any impairment and is
depreciated  principally using accelerated  methods over estimated useful lives.
Upon  retirement  or other  disposal,  the asset  cost and  related  accumulated
depreciation  are  removed  from  the  accounts  and the net  amount,  less  any
proceeds,  is charged or credited  to income.  If an asset is  determined  to be
impaired,  either based on value or a shortened life, the carrying amount of the
asset is reduced to its fair  value and the  difference  is charged to income in
the period incurred.

     Expenditures  for  maintenance  and repairs are charged  against  income as
incurred.  Expenditures that significantly  increase asset value,  extend useful
asset lives or adapt property to a new or different use are capitalized.

     The Company follows the policy of  capitalizing  interest as a component of
the cost of capital assets  constructed  for its own use. See Note 9 for further
information.

Investments
- -----------

     The Company  accounts  for  investments  in debt and equity  securities  in
conformity with Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards  ("SFAS") No. 115,
"Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities." SFAS No. 115
requires  the use of fair value  accounting  for  trading or  available-for-sale
securities, while retaining the use of the amortized cost method for investments
in debt  securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold
to  maturity.  Investments  in debt and equity  securities  are  included in the
captions   "Marketable   securities,"   "Restricted   insurance   proceeds"  and
"Restricted   investments"  in  the  consolidated   balance  sheets.   All  such
investments  are  considered  to be available  for sale.  If the decline in fair
value of an  investment  in debt or equity  securities is determined to be other
than  temporary,  the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its fair value,
and the difference is charged to income in the period incurred.  See Notes 5 and
11 for further information.

Credit Risk
- -----------

     Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration
of credit risk consist principally of cash,  investments,  derivative  financial
instruments and trade  receivables.  The Company's  policies limit the amount of
credit exposure to any single counterparty for cash and investments. The Company
uses  major  financial  institutions  with  high  credit  ratings  to  engage in
transactions  involving  investments  and  derivative  instruments.  The Company
minimizes  credit risk in its  receivables  from  customers  through its sale of
products to a wide variety of customers and markets in locations  throughout the
world.  The Company  performs  ongoing  credit  evaluations of its customers and
generally  does not require  collateral.  The  Company  maintains  reserves  for
potential  credit  losses,   and  historically  such  losses  have  been  within
expectations. Management believes the risk of incurring losses related to credit
risk is remote,  and any losses would be  immaterial to  consolidated  financial
results.





NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
- ---------------------------------------------------

Intangibles
- -----------

     Intangible  assets of the Company include  goodwill,  patents and licenses,
and other assets acquired by the Company that are separable and measurable apart
from goodwill. Goodwill,  representing the excess of cost over the fair value of
net assets of businesses  acquired,  is tested for impairment in accordance with
SFAS No. 142,  "Goodwill and Other Intangible  Assets." Other intangible  assets
with finite lives are amortized on a  straight-line  basis over their  estimated
useful lives. See Note 10 for further information.

Revenue
- -------

     The Company recognizes  revenue in accordance with the U.S.  Securities and
Exchange Commission's Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, "Revenue Recognition in
Financial  Statements."  The Company  recognizes  revenue  only when  persuasive
evidence of an arrangement  exists,  delivery has occurred or services have been
rendered,  the price to the customer is fixed or determinable and collectibility
is reasonably assured.  Generally,  revenue is recognized when title and risk of
loss  transfer  to the  customer  for  products  and as  work is  performed  for
professional  services.  Amounts  billed  to a  customer  in a sale  transaction
related to shipping costs are classified as revenue. The Company reduces revenue
for product returns, allowances and price discounts.

Shipping Costs
- --------------

     Shipping costs are primarily comprised of payments to third party shippers.
The Company records shipping costs incurred as a component of "Cost of sales" in
the consolidated statements of operations.  Shipping costs totaled $94.3, $76.6,
and $61.6 for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Research and Development Costs
- ------------------------------

     Research and development  costs are charged to operations when incurred and
are included in "Cost of sales" in the  consolidated  statements of  operations.
These costs totaled $181.4 in 2004, $162.5 in 2003 and $154.5 in 2002.

Income Taxes
- ------------

     The Company  accounts for income taxes in conformity with the provisions of
SFAS No. 109,  "Accounting for Income Taxes." SFAS No. 109 requires a company to
recognize  deferred  tax  assets and  liabilities  for the  expected  future tax
consequences  of events  that  have been  recognized  in a  company's  financial
statements  or  tax  returns.  Under  this  method,   deferred  tax  assets  and
liabilities  are  determined  based  on the  difference  between  the  financial
statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted
tax  rates in  effect in the years in which  the  differences  are  expected  to
reverse.  The Company records a valuation  allowance on deferred tax assets when
appropriate  to reflect the  expected  future tax  benefits to be  realized.  In
determining  the appropriate  valuation  allowance,  certain  judgments are made
relating  to   recoverability   of  deferred   tax  assets,   use  of  tax  loss
carryforwards,  level of  expected  future  taxable  income  and  available  tax
planning  strategies.  These judgments are routinely reviewed by management.  At
December 31, 2004 and 2003,  the Company had net deferred tax asset  balances of
$983.3 and $947.8,  respectively,  after valuation  allowances of $3.1 and $2.0,
respectively. For additional information, see Note 7.

Currency Translation
- --------------------

     The value of the U.S. dollar fluctuates against foreign  currencies.  Since
the Company  does  business in many  countries,  these  fluctuations  affect the
Company's consolidated financial position and results of operations. The Company
accounts  for  these  fluctuations  in  accordance  with SFAS No.  52,  "Foreign
Currency Translation."

     Subsidiaries in Europe and Japan  translate  their assets and  liabilities,
stated in their  functional  currency,  into U.S.  dollars at  current  exchange
rates,  that is,  the  rates in effect  at the end of the  period.  The gains or
losses that result from this process affect "Cumulative  translation adjustment"
in the stockholders' equity section of the consolidated balance sheets.  Changes
in the functional currency value of monetary assets and liabilities  denominated
in foreign currencies are recognized in the caption, "Other" in the consolidated
statements  of   operations.   The  revenues  and  expenses  of  these  non-U.S.
subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates that
prevailed  during the  period.  Therefore,  the  reported  U.S.  dollar  results
included in the  consolidated  statement of operations  fluctuate from period to
period, depending on the value of the dollar against foreign currencies.

     For  non-U.S.  subsidiaries  outside of Europe  and  Japan,  where the U.S.
dollar is the functional currency,  inventories,  property,  plant and equipment
and other non-monetary assets,  together with their related elements of expense,
are translated at historical rates of exchange. All other assets and liabilities
are translated at current  exchange  rates.  All other revenues and expenses are
translated at average  exchange  rates.  Translation  gains and losses for these
subsidiaries  are  recognized  in  the  caption,  "Other"  in  the  consolidated
statements of operations.





NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
- ---------------------------------------------------

Derivative Financial Instruments
- --------------------------------

     The Company uses derivative  financial  instruments to reduce the impact of
changes in foreign exchange rates on its earnings, cash flows and fair values of
assets and  liabilities.  In  addition,  the Company uses  derivative  financial
instruments  to reduce  the  impact of  changes  in  natural  gas  prices on its
earnings and cash flows. The Company enters into derivative  financial contracts
based on analysis of specific and known economic exposures. The Company's policy
prohibits  holding or issuing  derivative  financial  instruments for trading or
speculative  purposes.  The  types of  instruments  typically  used are  forward
contracts,  but may  also  include  option  combinations  and  purchased  option
contracts.

     The Company  recognizes all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.
On the date the  derivative  instrument  is  entered  into,  if the  Company  is
designating the instrument as a hedge, the Company  designates the derivative as
either (1) a hedge of the  exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized
asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment (fair value hedge),  (2) a
hedge of the exposure to variability  in cash flows of a forecasted  transaction
(cash flow  hedge),  or (3) a hedge of the  foreign  currency  exposure of a net
investment  in a foreign  operation.  Changes in the fair value of a  derivative
that is  designated  as and meets all the  required  criteria  for a fair  value
hedge,  along with the gain or loss on the  hedged  asset or  liability  that is
attributable  to the hedged  risk,  are  recorded  in current  period  earnings.
Changes in the fair value of a derivative  that is  designated  as and meets all
the required criteria for a cash flow hedge are recorded in other  comprehensive
income and  reclassified  into  earnings as the  underlying  hedged item affects
earnings.  Changes in the fair value of a derivative or  non-derivative  that is
designated  as  and  meets  all  the  required  criteria  for a  hedge  of a net
investment are recorded in other comprehensive income. Changes in the fair value
of a derivative  that is not  designated as a hedge are recorded  immediately in
earnings.

     The majority of currency derivative instruments entered into by the Company
are not designated as hedging instruments.  Contracts used to hedge the exposure
to foreign  currency  fluctuations  associated with certain  monetary assets and
liabilities  are not  designated as hedging  instruments.  Net foreign  currency
losses  recognized in income,  which  include  changes in the fair value of such
currency  derivatives  as well as foreign  exchange gains and losses on monetary
assets and  liabilities of the Company,  amounted to $1.7 in 2004,  $5.7 in 2003
and $3.6 in 2002.  In addition,  the income tax  provision  in the  consolidated
statements  of  operations  includes net foreign  currency  losses from currency
derivatives of $2.7, $6.3 and $1.8 for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively,  which
when considered together with the related tax benefits and gains from underlying
exposures, had the effect of decreasing (increasing) the income tax provision by
$1.0,  ($0.1)  and $2.1 in 2004,  2003 and  2002,  respectively.  See Note 7 for
further information.

     Where  an  instrument  is  designated  as a  hedge,  the  Company  formally
documents all relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items, as
well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge
transactions. This process includes relating all derivatives that are designated
as fair value or cash flow  hedges to  specific  assets and  liabilities  on the
balance sheet or to specific firm  commitments or forecasted  transactions.  The
Company also  formally  assesses,  both at the  inception of the hedge and on an
ongoing basis, whether each derivative is highly effective in offsetting changes
in fair  values or cash flows of the hedged  item.  If it is  determined  that a
derivative is not highly effective as a hedge, or if a derivative ceases to be a
highly  effective  hedge,  the Company will  discontinue  hedge  accounting with
respect to that derivative prospectively.

Litigation
- ----------

     The Company is subject to legal  proceedings  and claims arising out of the
normal course of business.  The Company routinely assesses the likelihood of any
adverse  judgments or outcomes to these  matters,  as well as ranges of probable
losses.  A  determination  of the amount of the reserves  required,  if any, for
these  contingencies  is made after analysis of each known issue and an analysis
of  historical  claims  experience  for incurred but not reported  matters.  The
Company  expenses these legal costs,  including those expected to be incurred in
connection with a loss contingency,  as incurred. The Company has an active risk
management  program  consisting of numerous insurance policies secured from many
carriers.  These  policies  provide  coverage  that is utilized to mitigate  the
impact,  if any, of the legal  proceedings.  The required reserves may change in
the  future  due to new  developments  in each  matter.  See Notes 16 and 17 for
further information.

Environmental Matters
- ---------------------

     The  Company  determines  the costs of  environmental  remediation  for its
facilities,  facilities  formerly  owned by the  Company  and third  party waste
disposal   facilities   based  on   evaluations  of  current  law  and  existing
technologies. Inherent uncertainties exist in these evaluations primarily due to
unknown  conditions,  changing  governmental  regulations  and  legal  standards
regarding liability, and evolving technologies.  The Company records a charge to
earnings for environmental matters when it is probable that a liability has been
incurred  and the  Company's  costs can be  reasonably  estimated.  The recorded
liabilities  are adjusted  periodically  as remediation  efforts  progress or as
additional  technical or legal information  becomes  available.  The Company had
accrued   obligations   of  $2.9  and  $3.3  at  December  31,  2004  and  2003,
respectively,  for environmental  remediation and restoration costs.  Management
believes  that any costs  incurred  in excess of those  accrued  will not have a
material  adverse  impact on the Company's  consolidated  financial  position or
results of operations.






NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
- ---------------------------------------------------

New Accounting Standards
- ------------------------

     In December 2004,  the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board (the "FASB")
issued  SFAS  No.  153,  "Exchanges  of  Nonmonetary  Assets - an  amendment  of
Accounting  Principles  Board ("APB")  Opinion No. 29." APB No. 29 requires that
exchanges  of  nonmonetary  assets be  measured  based on the fair  value of the
assets  exchanged,  with certain  exceptions.  SFAS No. 153 amends APB No. 29 to
eliminate the exception for nonmonetary  exchanges of similar  productive assets
and includes a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not
have commercial substance. The Statement is effective for fiscal years beginning
after June 15, 2005.  The Company plans to adopt SFAS No. 153 on January 1, 2006
and  does  not  expect  its  adoption  to  have  a  material  effect  on  future
consolidated results.

     On October 22,  2004,  the  American  Jobs  Creation Act of 2004 (the "Jobs
Creation  Act")  became law in the United  States.  In December  2004,  the FASB
issued FASB Staff Position  ("FSP") Nos. FAS 109-1 and FAS 109-2,  which provide
guidance on  accounting  and  disclosure  of the Jobs  Creation Act. FSP No. FAS
109-1,  "Application of FASB Statement No. 109,  Accounting for Income Taxes, to
the Tax Deduction on Qualified  Production  Activities  Provided by the American
Jobs  Creation  Act of  2004,"  requires  the  qualified  production  activities
deduction  provided for under the Jobs  Creation  Act to be  accounted  for as a
special  deduction  in  accordance  with  SFAS  No.  109.  FSP  No.  FAS  109-2,
"Accounting  and  Disclosure  Guidance  for the  Foreign  Earnings  Repatriation
Provision  within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004,"  provides  accounting
and disclosure requirements for the one-time dividends received deduction on the
repatriation of certain foreign earnings under the Jobs Creation Act. See Note 7
for further discussion of the effects of the Jobs Creation Act.

     In  November  2004,  the FASB issued SFAS No.  151,  "Inventory  Costs,  an
Amendment of Accounting  Research  Bulletin ("ARB") No. 43, Chapter 4." SFAS No.
151  amends  Chapter  4 of ARB No.  43,  "Inventory  Pricing,"  to  clarify  the
accounting  for abnormal  amounts of idle facility  expense,  freight,  handling
costs and wasted material.  The Statement  requires such costs to be recorded as
charges  in the period  incurred,  and also  requires  the  allocation  of fixed
production  overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity
of the  production  facilities.  SFAS No. 151 is  effective  for annual  periods
beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company plans to adopt SFAS No. 151 effective
January  1, 2006 and does not  expect  the  adoption  of SFAS No.  151 to have a
material effect on future consolidated results.

     In  January  2004,  the FASB  issued FSP No.  FAS  106-1,  "Accounting  and
Disclosure  Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug,  Improvement
and  Modernization Act of 2003." This FSP was superseded in June 2004 by FSP No.
FAS 106-2 of the same title.  These FSP's provide guidance on the accounting for
and disclosure of the effects of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and
Modernization  Act of 2003 (the  "Act").  The Act  expands  Medicare  to provide
prescription  drug benefits to eligible  enrollees and contains  provisions that
apply to  employers  who sponsor  postretirement  health care plans that provide
prescription drug benefits.  Beginning in 2006, sponsors of postretirement plans
that provide a prescription drug benefit that is "actuarially equivalent" to the
benefit provided by Medicare will receive a subsidy from the federal government.
The  Company  adopted FSP FAS 106-1  effective  April 30, 2004 and FSP FAS 106-2
effective July 1, 2004. The Company has  determined  that the benefits  provided
under its  postretirement  health care plan are  "actuarially  equivalent"  with
those  provided  under the Act.  The adoption of FSP FAS 106-1 and FSP FAS 106-2
did  not  have  a  material  impact  on  the  Company's  consolidated  financial
statements.  See Note 15 for further  information related to the impact of these
FSP's.

     In December  2003,  the FASB  revised FASB  Interpretation  ("FIN") No. 46,
"Consolidation  of  Variable  Interest  Entities."  FIN  No.  46  clarifies  the
application  of Accounting  Research  Bulletin No. 51,  "Consolidated  Financial
Statements,"  to certain  entities  in which  equity  investors  do not have the
characteristics of a controlling financial interest or in which equity investors
do not bear the residual  economic risks.  The Company adopted the provisions of
FIN No. 46 effective  January 1, 2004. The adoption of FIN No. 46 did not have a
material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

     In December  2003, the FASB revised SFAS No. 132,  "Employer's  Disclosures
about Pensions and Other  Postretirement  Benefits." This Statement  retains the
existing disclosure  requirements for pensions and other postretirement benefits
and requires additional information on changes in the benefit obligations,  fair
values of plan  assets,  and  estimated  future  benefit  payments.  The Company
adopted the domestic plan  disclosure  requirements  for the year ended December
31,  2003.  The  interim  disclosure  requirements  were  adopted by the Company
effective January 1, 2004. The additional  disclosures  required were adopted by
the  Company  effective  with  the  December  31,  2004  consolidated  financial
statements. See Note 15 for required disclosures.

Use of Estimates
- ----------------

     The  preparation  of financial  statements  in conformity  with  accounting
principles  generally accepted in the United States requires  management to make
estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of assets and
liabilities,  the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period and  disclosure of contingent  assets and  liabilities at the date of the
financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.





NOTE 3 - ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES
- --------------------------------------

     On September 30, 2004, the Company, through Dow Corning Toray Silicone Co.,
Ltd. ("DCTS"), a subsidiary owned 65% percent by the Company,  purchased the net
assets of the  Silicone  Division of Nippon  Unicar Co.,  Ltd.  ("NUC").  NUC is
located  in Tokyo,  Japan  and is a  manufacturer  of  specialty  chemicals  and
silicone  products.   The  net  assets  were  purchased  by  DCTS  for  cash  of
approximately $92.0 and consisted primarily of working capital items, intangible
assets and property,  plant and equipment. The Company recorded $3.0 of goodwill
as a result of the  transaction.  The results of operations for the  acquisition
were included in the consolidated statement of operations beginning in the three
month period ended December 31, 2004.  Purchase  accounting for this acquisition
was finalized during the three month period ended December 31, 2004.

     On September 2, 2004, the Company,  through its wholly owned subsidiary Dow
Corning  Enterprises,  Inc.  ("DCEI"),  sold its 50%  ownership  interest in SDC
Technologies  Inc.  ("SDC")  for  $10.0.  The  Company   recognized  a  gain  of
approximately  $7.1  on  the  sale.  SDC  is  a  California-based  developer  of
proprietary,  high-performance  coating  systems for application to plastics and
glass.

     On July 1, 2003, DCEI purchased 20% of the outstanding  stock of DC Dongjue
Silicone Group Company Ltd. ("DCDSG"),  bringing DCEI's total ownership of DCDSG
to 60%.  Previously,  in November 2001, DCEI and New Energy Chemicals Group Ltd.
formed DCDSG as a corporate  joint venture.  At that time, DCEI was the minority
interest shareholder,  owning 25% of the outstanding stock and the joint venture
was  accounted  for on an equity  basis.  In January  2003,  DCEI  increased its
ownership to 40%. The July 1, 2003  purchase  resulted in an aggregate  purchase
price of $6.4,  of which  $4.6 was  recognized  as  goodwill.  The  Company  has
consolidated the results of DCDSG in the consolidated financial statements since
July 1, 2003.

     On June 16, 2003,  the Company  purchased all of the  outstanding  stock of
Simcala, Inc. ("Simcala"), a silicon metal manufacturer located near Montgomery,
Alabama.  The  consideration  paid for the stock  was  approximately  $15.5.  In
addition,  immediately  prior to the transaction  closing,  Simcala redeemed the
stock of its executive management for consideration of approximately $1.5. Also,
Dow Corning provided  intercompany loans of approximately $13.3 to Simcala, $7.1
of which was for the purpose of retiring Simcala's  outstanding debt and $6.2 of
which was for the purpose of securing  Simcala's  obligations  under outstanding
industrial  development revenue bonds.  Purchase accounting for this acquisition
was finalized during the three month period ended June 30, 2004.

     On February 27, 2003, the Company purchased substantially all of the assets
of Tyco Electronics,  Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Tyco International Inc.
for a purchase  price of $9.4.  Tyco  Electronics,  Inc.'s  primary  facility is
located in Menlo Park, California. The transaction resulted in goodwill of $0.6.

     On January 23,  2003,  DCEI  purchased  substantially  all of the assets of
Sterling  Semiconductor,  Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Uniroyal Technology
Corporation,  for a purchase price of $11.5. On December 4, 2002, DCEI purchased
substantially  all of the  assets  of GAN  Semiconductor,  Inc.,  of  Sunnyvale,
California  for a purchase  price of $4.9.  Included in the purchase was $2.9 of
in-process research and development,  which was charged to "Other" expense.  The
transaction  resulted  in goodwill of $0.3.  Dow  Corning has  consolidated  the
assets acquired from GAN Semiconductor, Inc. and Sterling Semiconductor, Inc. in
Midland, Michigan, forming Dow Corning Compound Semiconductor Solutions, LLC.

     On March 28,  2002,  the  Company  offered  to  purchase  up to 100% of the
preferred   and  common   shares  of  Paturle,   S.A.   ("Paturle"),   a  French
thermoplastics  manufacturer  serving the  automotive,  appliance  and packaging
industries.  The  acquisition  was  finalized on April 30, 2002 when Dow Corning
France  S.A.S.,  a wholly owned  subsidiary of the Company,  purchased  99.9% of
Paturle's  preferred and common shares and DCEI purchased the minority  interest
in Multibase,  Inc., a subsidiary of Paturle.  The aggregate  purchase price was
$57.9 and  goodwill of $44.6 was recorded as a result of the  transaction.  This
acquisition  included  the  indirect  acquisition  of  Paturle's   subsidiaries,
including Multibase S.A.S. in France,  Multibase, Inc. in the United States, and
76.8% of the stock of Synergy Multibase, Limited in India.

NOTE 4 - GLOBAL RESTRUCTURING
- -----------------------------

     Beginning in 1998, the Company  announced a series of restructurings of its
global operations  designed to improve operating  efficiencies and to enable the
Company to better  meet  customers'  expectations.  Principal  actions  included
closure of certain  manufacturing,  marketing  and research  facilities  and the
consolidation  of activities  formerly carried on at the closed  facilities,  as
well as a  reduction  in the  number of  employees  due to either  (1)  position
elimination or (2)  deficiencies  in specific  employee  skills required to meet
current or anticipated  Company needs. As a result of the programs committed to,
announced and  implemented in 1998 through 2001,  approximately  1,350 employees
left the Company.  During 2002, the Company announced a further reduction of 470
employees. In 2002, the non-cash activity included $18.0 for special termination
benefits as a result of the programs in effect.  The Company does not expect any
further expenses related to these  announcements.  In the first quarter of 2003,
the Company completed the restructuring program.






NOTE 4 - GLOBAL RESTRUCTURING (Continued)
- -----------------------------

     The  restructuring  activity for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002
is illustrated in the following table:


     The Company  implemented  a  restructuring  program in 2004,  consisting of
separation of employees and the withdrawal of certain fixed assets from service.
During the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company incurred pre-tax expense of
$34.9  primarily  for one-time  termination  benefits  related to the  workforce
reduction of  approximately  212 employees.  Results for the year ended December
31,  2004  also  include a pre-tax  charge  of $2.7 for  non-cash  restructuring
activity related to curtailment and special  termination  benefits.  See Note 15
for additional  information  regarding the global workforce  reduction effect on
defined benefit pension plans and the U.S.  retiree medical plan.  Additionally,
the  Company  recorded  charges  of  $6.4  related  to  the  impairment  of  its
manufacturing site located in Yamakita,  Japan. These restructuring charges have
been reported in the  "Restructuring  costs" line in the Company's  consolidated
statement of operations.

     As of December  31,  2004,  the Company had a liability  of $5.4 related to
restructuring  recorded in the caption  titled  "Accrued  payrolls  and employee
benefits"  in  the  consolidated  balance  sheets.  The  remaining  payments  to
employees under the restructuring program are expected to be made by the Company
in 2005.  As of December 31, 2004,  the assets from the Yamakita  site have been
classified  as  long-lived  assets to be  disposed  of by sale and  recorded  at
estimated fair value less anticipated costs to sell.

     The  restructuring  activity  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2004 is
illustrated in the following table:


NOTE 5 - UNRESTRICTED INVESTMENTS
- ---------------------------------

     The  carrying  amounts  of  unrestricted  investments  reflected  under the
caption  "Marketable  securities" in the current and noncurrent  sections of the
consolidated  balance  sheets at December 31, 2004 and 2003  totaled  $355.8 and
$1,227.5,  respectively.  These unrestricted  investments consist principally of
obligations  backed by the U. S. Government or one of its agencies and corporate
and municipal issue bonds.  These investments have been classified as "available
for sale" in  conformity  with SFAS No.  115.  The  Company  does not  invest in
securities that are below investment  grade. Fair values are determined based on
quoted market prices or, if quoted  market prices are not  available,  on market
prices of  comparable  instruments.  For purposes of computing  realized gain or
loss on the disposition of unrestricted investments, the specific identification
method is used.

     The Company  reviews all marketable  securities to determine if any decline
in value is other than temporary.  The analysis  includes a review of the amount
and duration of the decline in value of a security and a comparison  between the
amount and  duration of the decline in value of the security and that of similar
securities in the same market sector.  The Company has reviewed the  investments
that have a gross unrealized loss as of December 31, 2004 and has concluded that
the decline in value is not other than temporary.






NOTE 5 - UNRESTRICTED INVESTMENTS (Continued)
- ---------------------------------

     The amortized cost, gross unrealized gains,  gross unrealized  losses,  and
market value of the  unrestricted  investments  consisted of the following as of
December 31, 2004 and 2003:



     The contractual  maturities of the debt securities included in unrestricted
investments consisted of the following at December 31, 2004 and 2003:

                                                         2004             2003
                                                         ----             ----

     Mature in one year or less                      $     288.5     $     986.6
     Mature after one year through five years               64.1           236.7
     Mature after five years                                 -               2.2
                                                     -----------     -----------

     Total debt securities                           $     352.6     $   1,225.5
                                                     ===========     ===========







NOTE 6 - INVENTORIES
- --------------------

     The following  table  provides a breakdown of  inventories  at December 31,
2004 and 2003:

                                               2004                  2003
                                               ----                  ----

     Produced goods                          $     329.5           $     294.7
     Purchased materials                            61.8                  42.8
     Maintenance and supplies                       33.7                  32.3
                                             -----------           -----------

     Total inventory                         $     425.0           $     369.8
                                             ===========           ===========


     Due to the  nature  of  the  Company's  operations,  it is  impractical  to
classify inventory as raw materials,  work-in-process, or finished goods as such
classifications can be interchangeable for certain inventoriable items.

NOTE 7 - INCOME TAXES
- ---------------------

     The  components of income before income taxes and minority  interests as of
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 are as follows:


      The  components of the income tax  provision as of December 31, 2004, 2003
and 2002 are as follows:








NOTE 7 - INCOME TAXES (Continued)
- ---------------------

     The tax effects of the principal  temporary  differences as of December 31,
2004 and 2003  giving  rise to  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities  were as
follows:


     With  the  exception  of  the  valuation  allowances  provided  for  below,
management  believes  that it is more likely than not that the net  deferred tax
asset will be realized. This belief is based on criteria established in SFAS No.
109,  "Accounting for Income Taxes." The criteria that management  considered in
making this determination were historical and projected  operating results,  the
ability to utilize tax planning strategies and the period of time over which the
tax benefits can be utilized.

     Operating  loss  carryforwards  at  December  31,  2004  amounted to $192.8
compared to $183.9 at the end of 2003. All of the operating  loss  carryforwards
are subject to expiration beyond 2009 or have an indefinite carryforward period.
Substantially  all  of  operating  loss  carryforwards  were  generated  by  the
Company's subsidiary in the United Kingdom.  There is an unlimited  carryforward
of net operating losses in the United Kingdom and management has determined that
no valuation allowance is needed for these net operating losses.

     The valuation allowance of $3.1 is attributable to the inability to utilize
net operating loss carry forwards of $2.1 in Australia, and $1.0 in Ireland. The
operating  loss  carryforward  in  Australia is subject to  expiration  in years
beyond  2009.  The  operating  loss  carryforward  in Ireland has an  indefinite
carryforward period.

     Cash paid  (received)  during  the year for  income  taxes,  net of refunds
received was $103.7 in 2004,  $66.5 in 2003,  and ($58.7) in 2002. In 2002,  tax
refunds  exceeded  payments due to the carryback of the net operating  loss from
the year ended  December  31,  2001 in the United  States  that  generated  cash
refunds of $107.0.





NOTE 7 - INCOME TAXES (Continued)
- ---------------------

     The income tax provision at the effective  rate differs from the income tax
provision  at the United  States  federal  statutory  tax rate in effect  during
December 31, 2004,  2003 and 2002 for the reasons  illustrated  in the following
table:


     On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act was enacted into law in
the United  States.  This act  contains a special  one-time  dividends  received
deduction on the  repatriation  of certain  foreign  earning to a United  States
taxpayer,  provided  certain criteria are met. The Company has not completed its
evaluation of this  provision  with respect to all foreign  subsidiaries  and is
expected to complete its  evaluation  by June 30, 2005. As of December 31, 2004,
the Company  has  determined  that it will  repatriate  approximately  $145.0 of
earnings of two foreign  subsidiaries under this provision in 2005. The deferred
tax  expense  associated  with this  remittance  is  approximately  $17.2 and is
recognized  as a deferred tax liability as of December 31, 2004 on the Company's
consolidated  balance  sheets.  The range of income tax effects of  repatriating
earnings from other subsidiaries  cannot be reasonably  estimated at the time of
issuance of these consolidated financial statements.

     At December 31, 2004, income and remittance taxes have not been recorded on
$160.4 of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, except as noted above,
either because any taxes on dividends would be offset  substantially  by foreign
tax  credits  or  because  the  Company   intends  to  reinvest  those  earnings
indefinitely.

NOTE 8 - DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES
- ------------------------------------------------------

     The  Company  uses  forward  exchange  contracts  and  options to hedge the
exposure to foreign  currency  fluctuations  associated  with  certain  monetary
assets and liabilities. Changes in the fair value of these items are recorded in
earnings to offset the foreign  exchange gains and losses of the monetary assets
and liabilities. The maturities of these contracts and options do not exceed one
year.  The carrying  amounts,  which  represent  fair values,  of these  forward
contracts and options were net  unrealized  losses of $19.1 and $9.9 at December
31,  2004 and  2003,  respectively.  The fair  value  of the  Company's  forward
exchange contracts and options is based principally on quoted market prices.

     Forward  exchange  options are also used to hedge specific firm commitments
or forecasted  transactions  by locking in exchange  rates for such  anticipated
cash flows. Gains and losses on these instruments are recorded as a component of
other comprehensive income until the forecasted  transaction occurs. At December
31, 2004,  the carrying  amounts of such options,  which  represent fair values,
were net unrealized  losses of $0.1.  There were no  outstanding  instruments at
December  31,  2003  designated  as  hedges  of  specific  firm  commitments  or
forecasted transactions.






NOTE 9 - PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
- --------------------------------------

     The following  table provides a breakdown of property,  plant and equipment
balances at December 31, 2004 and 2003:



     The Company recorded  depreciation expense of $207.9, $242.5 and $263.5 for
the years ended  December 31, 2004,  2003 and 2002,  respectively.  In the first
quarter of 2004,  the  Company  changed its  estimate  of the  service  lives of
certain  depreciable  assets to  increase  the useful  economic  life beyond the
original  service life assigned to these assets.  The Company made this decision
based on design factors,  which were confirmed by actual  operating  experience.
The change in accounting  estimate reduced expenses by approximately  $6.4 ($4.0
net of tax) for the year ended December 31, 2004.

     The amount of interest  capitalized  as a component  of the cost of capital
assets constructed for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $3.1
($2.0 after tax), $6.6 ($4.2 after tax) and $3.2 ($2.0 after tax), respectively.

NOTE 10 - GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS
- ----------------------------------------------

     As of December 31, 2004 and 2003,  the gross and net amounts of  intangible
assets, excluding goodwill were:






NOTE 10 - GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS (Continued)
- ----------------------------------------------

     The  Company  recorded  amortization  expense  related to these  intangible
assets of $2.7,  $1.4 and $3.1 for the years ended  December 31, 2004,  2003 and
2002, respectively.  The estimated aggregate amortization expense to be recorded
in each of the next five succeeding years is as follows:

                    2005              $5.5
                    2006              $5.3

     The Company tests the carrying value of goodwill for  impairment  annually,
as required by SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." The Company
completed  its tests for  impairment  of goodwill  during the three month period
ended  September 30, 2004.  No  impairments  were  identified as a result of the
tests performed.

     In the three month period ended  September 30, 2004,  the Company  acquired
the Silicone  Division of NUC (see Note 3). The Company  assigned the  following
amounts and estimated useful lives to the intangible  assets  identified in this
transaction:

     None of the intangible  assets acquired from NUC have significant  residual
value.  The amount  assigned to the  intangible  assets will be  amortized  on a
straight-line basis over the applicable  estimated useful lives. No research and
development assets were acquired from NUC as part of this transaction.  Goodwill
of $3.0 was recognized by the Company from the NUC acquisition.

     Restricted  assets  consist  principally  of money market  funds,  but also
include  obligations  backed by the U.S.  Government  or one of its agencies and
corporate and municipal  issue bonds,  which have been  classified as "available
for sale" in conformity with SFAS No. 115,  "Accounting for Certain  Investments
in Debt and Equity  Securities." The aggregate  carrying value of the marketable
securities  classified as restricted assets  approximates the fair market value.
Fair values are  determined  based on quoted  market prices or, if quoted market
prices  are not  available,  on market  prices of  comparable  instruments.  For
purposes of computing  realized  gain or loss on the  disposition  of restricted
assets,  the  specific  identification  method is used.  Restricted  assets  are
included  in  the  captions  "Restricted  insurance  proceeds"  and  "Restricted
investments" in the "Other Assets" section of the consolidated balance sheets.

     The  Company  has  Letters  of  Credit  outstanding  of $28.7  and $46.1 at
December  31,  2004 and 2003,  respectively,  for which the  Company has legally
restricted  funds  to  serve as  collateral  for the  purpose  of  reducing  the
effective cost of those letters of credit. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the
Company had $30.3 and $46.7, respectively,  of funds restricted to support these
obligations.  In  addition,  the Company had  foreign  bank  deposits of $1.8 at
December 31, 2004 included in restricted assets.

     In order to comply with certain environmental  regulations,  as of December
31,  2004 and 2003,  the Company  maintained  $23.7 and $23.4,  respectively  in
certain trusts in order to provide financial assurance for the potential payment
of aggregate  estimated closure,  post-closure,  corrective action and potential
liability  costs  associated  with the  operation  of  hazardous  waste  storage
facilities  at certain plant sites (see Note 16 for further  discussion).  Those
amounts are included in the caption "Restricted investments" in the consolidated
balance sheets.

     As of December  31,  2003,  $207.4 of cash  proceeds  from  breast  implant
products liability insurers (the "Insurers"), including investment income earned
thereon,  was  restricted  as to its use  pursuant  to orders of the  Bankruptcy
Court. This balances is included in the caption "Restricted  insurance proceeds"
in the  consolidated  balance  sheets and was invested in investment  categories
approved by the  Bankruptcy  Court.  Cash proceeds from the Insurers and related
interest  have  been,  and  will  be,  applied  toward  the  Company's   payment
obligations  under various funding  agreements  related to implementation of the
Company's  Chapter 11 plan of  reorganization  (see Note 17). A majority  of the
"Restricted   insurance   proceeds"  and  the  "Anticipated   implant  insurance
receivable"  recorded in the  consolidated  balance  sheets relate to the Shared
Insurance Assets.  The term "Shared Insurance Assets" is defined in Note 17. All
future  settlements of policies  naming the Company as a co-insured  will not be
subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court, because the Company has emerged
from the Chapter 11 Proceeding.  However,  one insurance policy  settlement that
was reached prior to the Effective  Date  continues to be subject to approval of
the Bankruptcy Court. See discussion of "Insurance Allocation Agreement" in Note
17 for related  information.  As of December  31, 2004 there were no  restricted
insurance assets.

NOTE 12 - NOTES PAYABLE AND CREDIT FACILITIES
- ---------------------------------------------

     Notes payable include amounts  outstanding under short-term lines of credit
and were $5.6 and $7.5 at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The carrying
amounts of these  short-term  borrowings  approximated  their fair value.  Notes
payable included under "Liabilities  Subject to Compromise" at December 31, 2003
were  $375.0,   representing   amounts  outstanding  under  a  revolving  credit
agreement.  Upon  emergence from Chapter 11 in June 2004, the Company repaid the
$375.0 outstanding under this revolving credit agreement.

     DCTS  maintains an accounts  receivable  securitization  facility  with its
primary  bank.  The  discount  rate under  this  facility  is TIBOR plus  0.25%.
Pursuant to this  facility,  DCTS has sold accounts  receivable in the amount of
$197.7 to such bank in exchange for $197.6  during 2004,  and $171.2 was sold to
such bank in exchange for $171.1 in 2003.  Under the  facility,  DCTS retains no
interest in the accounts receivable.  However, it maintains insurance to protect
95% of the receivables liquidated under the program; premiums for such insurance
of $0.2 were paid in each of the years 2004 and 2003.  As of  December  31, 2004
and  2003,  $27.3  and  $26.1,  respectively,  remained  outstanding  under  the
facility.





NOTE 12 - NOTES PAYABLE AND CREDIT FACILITIES (Continued)
- ---------------------------------------------

     On December 16, 2004, the Company entered into a $500.0 unsecured revolving
credit agreement with a syndicate of commercial banks, which expires on December
16, 2009. This agreement  replaced the $500.0 364-day revolving credit agreement
dated June 1, 2004. The new revolving  credit  agreement allows for borrowing in
various  currencies  for  general  corporate  purposes  of the  Company  and its
subsidiaries. These credit facilities require the payment of commitment fees. As
of December 31, 2004, these credit lines were unused.

     In addition, the Company had unused and committed credit facilities for use
by foreign  subsidiaries  at December  31, 2004 and 2003 with  various  U.S. and
foreign banks totaling $130.3 and $110.0, respectively.  These credit facilities
require  the payment of  commitment  fees.  The  Company  intends to renew these
facilities at their  respective  maturities.  These  facilities are available in
support of working capital requirements.

NOTE 13 - MANAGEMENT VARIABLE COMPENSATION
- ------------------------------------------

     Dow Corning maintains a number of variable  compensation  plans designed to
reward employees for outstanding individual and Company performance.  "Operating
Income" reflects  compensation expenses for all such plans as and when earned by
participants.  All such plans are annual in nature,  with the  exception  of the
Phantom Stock  Appreciation  Rights Plan ("The StARs Plan") and the  Performance
Excellence Plan ("PEP").

     The StARs Plan was designed to provide a long-term  compensation  component
for key  employees  in order  to  create a sense  of  ownership  and to  promote
long-term  Company  success.  The value of a StARs Unit was based on a metric of
Company financial performance.  The intrinsic value of a StARs Unit was equal to
the  current  value of a StARs Unit less its value at the time it was granted to
the participant.  The StARS Plan had a three-year  vesting period,  during which
time the awarded StARs Units could not be exercised.  After the StARs Units were
vested,  the StARS Plan had a seven-year period in which the StARs Units must be
exercised or forfeited.

     In December 2002, the Company  decided to modify the StARs Plan in order to
limit the future  liabilities of the Company in the event that StARs Unit values
increased at rates not originally  intended when the StARs Plan was  structured.
As a result, pursuant to agreements with participants, the StARs Plans for years
1992 through 2002 were modified to reflect a fixed net value to participants for
each  outstanding  StARs Unit in each such StARs Plan year. The vesting schedule
for unvested shares remained unchanged, but the dates of future cash payments to
participants were fixed.  Management believes that despite these  modifications,
the StARs Plan  continues  to achieve  its  intended  purpose of  rewarding  and
retaining key employees.

     Based on these changes to the StARs Plan, the Company reported  expenses of
$68.8 for the year ended  December  31, 2002 within the caption  "Marketing  and
administrative  expenses," such amount being equal to the $77.0 liability of the
StARs Plan after modifications less the $8.2 liability before modifications. The
liability  recorded  for the StARS Plan was $48.1 and $52.3 at December 31, 2004
and 2003, respectively.

     The PEP Plan was initiated in 2003 as a replacement for the StARs Plan. The
liability  for the PEP Plan was $48.4 at December  31, 2004 and $7.9 at December
31, 2003.






NOTE 14 - LONG-TERM DEBT
- ------------------------

     Long-term debt at December 31, 2004 and 2003 consisted of the following:


     The fair value of the Company's  long-term debt,  including the portion due
within one year,  approximated  its book value of $68.5 at December 31, 2004. At
December 31, 2003, the fair value of the long-term  debt,  including the portion
due  within one year,  approximated  the book value of $61.4.  The  Company  was
unable to  estimate  the fair value of the  long-term  debt  included  under the
caption  "Liabilities  Subject  to  Compromise"  in the  table  above and in the
consolidated  balance  sheets  at  December  31,  2003,  due to the  uncertainty
associated  with the  Company's  filing for  protection  under Chapter 11 of the
Bankruptcy Code.

     Annual aggregate  maturities of the long-term debt of the Company are: $8.3
in 2005,  $14.0 in 2006,  $5.8 in  2007,  $2.0 in 2008,  $2.1 in 2009 and  $36.3
thereafter.

     Upon  emergence  from Chapter 11 in June 2004, the Company repaid $273.7 of
long-term  debt  classified  as  "Liabilities  Subject  to  Compromise"  in  the
consolidated balance sheets.

     Cash paid during the year for interest was $679.3 in 2004, $5.4 in 2003 and
$5.0 in 2002.  Cash paid for interest in 2004  includes the payment of $673.8 in
accrued interest on pre-petition debt, payables,  and other liabilities upon the
Company's emergence from Chapter 11 in June 2004.






NOTE 15 - PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS
- ---------------------------------------------------

     The Company  maintains  defined benefit employee  retirement plans covering
most  domestic  and certain  non-U.S.  employees.  The Company  also has various
defined   contribution  and  savings  plans  covering  certain  employees.   The
components of pension  expense for the Company's  domestic and foreign plans are
set forth below for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002:


     On April 5, 2004, Dow Corning announced a global workforce reduction, which
was primarily the result of internal  restructuring.  The Company  accounted for
the  workforce  reduction  under  the  guidelines  of SFAS No.  88,  "Employers'
Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and
for Termination  Benefits." During the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company
recognized  pre-tax  charges  related to its defined  benefit  plans of $2.7 for
special  termination  benefits and the effect of curtailment.  In addition,  the
Company accounted for the effects of the workforce reduction on its U.S. Retiree
Medical Plan by  recognizing  a pre-tax  charge of $0.7 for special  termination
benefits and pre-tax income of $0.7 for curtailment.

     The Company settled a portion of its obligation under defined benefit plans
during 2004 through lump sum payments to participants  and annuity  arrangements
with third-party financial institutions.  The reduction in these obligations was
accounted  for as  settlements  under  SFAS No. 88 and  resulted  in  settlement
expense of $4.5 from early recognition of unrealized actuarial losses.

     The majority of the Company's  defined benefit  employee  retirement  plans
have a measurement  date of December 31 of the  applicable  year.  The following
table   reconciles  the  defined  benefit  plans'  funded  status  with  amounts
recognized in the Company's consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2004 and
2003,  respectively as part of other assets,  other long-term  liabilities,  and
liabilities subject to compromise:


     The projected benefit obligation,  accumulated benefit obligation, and fair
value  of plan  assets  for  defined  benefit  plans  with  accumulated  benefit
obligations  in excess of plan assets for the year ended  December  31, 2004 and
2003 are as follows:






NOTE 15 - PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS (Continued)
- ---------------------------------------------------

     The  following  table  provides a  reconciliation  of beginning  and ending
balances of the projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2004 and 2003:


       The following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending
balances of the fair value of plan assets as of December 31, 2004 and 2003:


     For the United  States  defined  benefit  plan, as of December 31, 2004 and
2003,  the fair value of plan assets  included 65% and 69% of equity  securities
and 35% and 31% of debt  securities,  respectively.  The plan  targets  an asset
allocation of 55%-75% equity securities and 25%-45% debt securities.

     The Company's funding policy is to contribute to defined benefit plans when
pension laws and economics either require or encourage  funding.  Of the defined
benefit plans  maintained  by the Company,  the U.S.  plans  covering the parent
company are the largest plans.  Contributions  to the U.S. defined benefit plans
for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2004  totaled  $68.8.   Contributions   of
approximately $25.0 are planned for the U.S. plans in 2005.

     Of the defined  contribution  and savings plans  maintained by the Company,
the U.S. plan covering the parent company is the largest plan. Employer matching
contributions for the U.S. defined contribution plan for the year ended December
31,  2004  totaled  $10.4.   The  Company  expects  to  make   contributions  of
approximately $10.0 during 2005.





NOTE 15 - PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS (Continued)
- ---------------------------------------------------

     The  weighted-average  assumptions used to determine the benefit obligation
and to  determine  the net  benefit  costs  are  shown in the  following  table.
Discount rates and rates of increase in future  compensation  are weighted based
upon the projected  benefit  obligations of the respective  plans.  The expected
long-term  rate of return on plan assets is weighted  based on total plan assets
for  each  plan  at year  end.  The  long-term  rate of  return  on plan  assets
assumption  is determined  considering  historical  returns and expected  future
asset allocation and returns for each plan.


     For the December 31, 2004 measurement  date, the Company,  upon advice from
its  actuaries,  employed a new method to determine the discount rate to be used
for the U.S.  defined  benefit  pension  plans.  In the past,  the  Company  had
determined the applicable  discount rate by reference to a bond index.  In 2004,
the  Company  used a bond  mapping  analysis,  which  matches  cash flows from a
hypothetical  portfolio of corporate bonds against the estimated  future benefit
payments of the plans, to arrive at an effective discount rate.

     The Company  expects to pay  benefits  under its defined  benefit  plans in
future periods as detailed in the following  table.  The expected  benefits have
been  estimated  based on the same  assumptions  used to measure  the  Company's
benefit obligation as of December 31, 2004 and include benefits  attributable to
future employee service.

                                Estimated Future
                                Benefit Payments
                                ----------------

                     2005           $   80.5
                     2006               78.3
                     2007               80.3
                     2008               80.5
                     2009               80.7
                2010-2014              433.7

     In addition to providing  pension benefits,  the Company,  primarily in the
United States, provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for most
retired employees.  The cost of providing these benefits to retirees outside the
United States is not  significant.  The Company's health care and life insurance
benefit plan has a measurement  date of December 31 of the applicable  year. Net
periodic  postretirement  benefit cost includes the  following  components as of
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002:






NOTE 15 - PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS (Continued)
- ---------------------------------------------------

     The following table presents a  reconciliation  of the beginning and ending
balances as of  December  31,  2004 and 2003 of the  accumulated  postretirement
benefit  obligation,   as  well  as  the  accrued  postretirement  benefit  cost
recognized  in the  Company's  consolidated  balance  sheets  as part  of  other
long-term liabilities and liabilities subject to compromise.


     The Company adopted FSP FAS 106-1,  "Accounting and Disclosure Requirements
Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug,  Improvement and Modernization Act of
2003," effective April 30, 2004. FSP FAS 106-2 of the same title superseded this
FSP in June 2004.  The  adoption of these FSP's  reduced  the  accumulated  post
retirement  benefit  obligation related to the Company's retiree health care and
life  insurance  benefit  plans by $6.1 at April  30,  2004.  In  addition,  the
adoption of these FSP's  reduced the net periodic  benefit cost  recognized  for
these plans by $0.5 during the year ended December 31, 2004.

     In 1992,  the  Company  amended its retiree  health  care  benefit  plan to
require that,  beginning in 1994,  employees must have a certain number of years
of service to be eligible for any retiree  health care benefit.  This  amendment
resulted in the Company  recording an unrecognized  negative prior service cost,
which is being  amortized  in the  consolidated  statement  of  operations.  The
retiree  health care plan  provides for certain cost sharing  changes that limit
the Company's share of retiree health care costs. The Company  continues to fund
benefit costs on a pay-as-you-go  basis with the retiree paying a portion of the
costs.  In 2003,  the Company  amended its retiree  health care  benefit plan to
discontinue  certain  previously  offered  healthcare  options and replace  such
options with more cost effective  alternatives  and also changed its methodology
for  coordination  with  Medicare.  This had the effect of reducing  the accrued
postretirement benefit obligation by $33.4 in 2003.

     The  health  care  cost  trend  rate  used  in  measuring  the  accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation was 10.00% in 2004 and was assumed to decrease
gradually  to 5.00% in 2010 and remain at that level  thereafter.  For  retirees
under age 65, plan features limit the health care cost trend rate  assumption to
a maximum  of 8.0% for years 1994 and  later.  The  health  care cost trend rate
assumption  has a significant  effect on the amounts  reported.  Increasing  the
assumed health care cost trend rate by one  percentage  point in each year would
increase the  accumulated  postretirement  benefit  obligation  by 5.82% and the
aggregate  of  the  service  and  interest  cost   components  of  net  periodic
postretirement  benefit cost for 2004 by 6.52%.  Decreasing  the assumed  health
care cost trend rates by one  percentage  point in each year would  decrease the
accumulated  postretirement benefit obligation by 5.11% and the aggregate of the
service and interest cost components of net periodic postretirement benefit cost
for 2004 by 5.64%.

     The  discount  rate  used in  determining  the  accumulated  postretirement
benefit  obligation  was 6.00% at December  31,  2004 and 6.25% at December  31,
2003.






NOTE 15 - PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS (Continued)
- ---------------------------------------------------

     The Company  funds most of the cost of the  postretirement  health care and
life insurance benefits as incurred.  Benefit payments to retirees totaled $18.9
for the year ended December 31, 2004. The Company expects to pay future benefits
under its postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plan as detailed
in the following table.  The expected  payments have been estimated based on the
same   assumptions  used  to  measure  the  Company's   postretirement   benefit
obligations as of December 31, 2004.

NOTE 16 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
- ---------------------------------------

Chapter 11 Related Matters
- --------------------------

Insurance
- ---------

     The Company had a  substantial  amount of  unexhausted  products  liability
insurance  coverage  with  respect to breast  implant  lawsuits  and  claims.  A
substantial  number  of the  Company's  insurers  reserved  the  right  to  deny
coverage,  in whole or in part,  due to  differing  legal  theories.  Litigation
between the Company and its insurers ("Litigating  Insurers") regarding coverage
for products  liability was  conducted  between 1993 and 1999.  This  litigation
resulted in judicial rulings  substantially  in favor of the Company's  position
regarding  its insurance  coverage.  As a result,  a majority of the  Litigating
Insurers have reached  settlements  with the Company.  The Company is continuing
settlement  negotiations  with the  remaining  Litigating  Insurers,  previously
settling  insurers who claim a reimbursement  right with respect to a portion of
previously paid insurance proceeds, and other insurers that were not involved in
the litigation.

     Of the total  "Anticipated  implant  insurance  receivable" of $307.8 as of
December 31, 2004, $73.5 related to insurance that has not yet been settled with
certain of the Company's insurance carriers and $234.3 represented amounts to be
received by the  Company  pursuant to  settlements  with other of the  Company's
insurance carriers.

     The principal  uncertainties  that exist with respect to the realization of
the  "Anticipated  implant  insurance  receivable"  include the ultimate cost of
resolving implant litigation and claims, the results of settlement  negotiations
with  insurers,  and the extent to which  insurers  may become  insolvent in the
future.  Management  believes  that,  while  uncertainties  regarding this asset
continue to exist, these  uncertainties are not reasonably likely to result in a
material  adverse  change to the  Company's  financial  position  or  results of
operations, and that it is probable that this asset will ultimately be realized.
This belief is further supported by the fact that the Company received insurance
recoveries of $1,268.3  from  September 1, 1994 through  December 31, 2004,  and
entered into settlements with certain insurers for future reimbursement.

Implant Reserve
- ---------------

     As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company's  "Implant reserve" recorded
in the consolidated balance sheets was $1,884.9 and $2,249.9,  respectively,  to
reflect the Company's  estimated  remaining  obligation  to fund breast  implant
claims  resolution  pursuant to the Company's  Chapter 11 plan of reorganization
and other breast  implant  litigation  related  matters (see Note 17 for further
discussion).

Accrued Interest
- ----------------

     As of December  31, 2004 and 2003,  the amount of interest  included in the
caption "Accrued interest"  recorded in the consolidated  balance sheets related
to the  Company's  potential  obligation  to  pay  interest  to  its  commercial
creditors in the Chapter 11 Proceeding was $63.5 and $650.9,  respectively.  The
actual amount of interest that will be paid to these  creditors is uncertain and
will ultimately be resolved through  continued  proceedings in the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Sixth Circuit (see Note 17 for further discussion).





NOTE 16 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (Continued)
- ---------------------------------------

Co-Insurance Payable
- --------------------

     As of  December  31,  2004 and 2003,  the amount  payable  pursuant  to the
"Insurance Allocation Agreement" included in the caption "Co-insurance  payable"
recorded in the  consolidated  balance sheets was $48.9 and $79.7,  respectively
(see Note 17 for further discussion).

Tax Matters
- -----------

     In May 1999,  the Company  received a Statutory  Notice of Deficiency  (the
"Notice") from the United States Internal  Revenue Service  ("IRS").  The Notice
asserts tax deficiencies totaling  approximately $65.3 relating to the Company's
consolidated  federal  income tax returns for the 1995 and 1996 calendar  years.
Management believes that the deficiencies  asserted by the IRS are excessive and
is  vigorously  contesting  the IRS' claims.  Management  anticipates  that this
matter will be resolved by the U.S.  District Court for the Eastern  District of
Michigan (the "U.S.  District  Court in Michigan"),  which retains  jurisdiction
over items that occurred during the Chapter 11 Proceeding and believes that such
resolution will not have a material adverse impact on the Company's consolidated
financial  position or results of  operations.  The Company has been  engaged in
discussions with the IRS in an effort to resolve this matter, and several of the
relevant  issues  are  currently  pending  before  the  U.S.  District  Court in
Michigan.

     In August 2004, the Company  received a Notice of Proposed  Adjustment (the
"Adjustment Notice") from the IRS related to the Company's  consolidated federal
income tax returns  for the 1997,  1998,  and 1999  calendar  years.  If the IRS
prevails with respect to the issues  identified in the  Adjustment  Notice,  the
amount  of  a  resulting  tax  deficiency  would  total  approximately   $116.9.
Management believes that the deficiencies  asserted by the IRS are excessive and
will vigorously contest the IRS' claims. Management believes that the resolution
of the  issues  identified  in the  Adjustment  Notice  will not have a material
adverse impact on the Company's  consolidated  financial  position or results of
operations.

Risks and Uncertainties
- -----------------------

     While the Company  does not  anticipate  a need to further  revise  amounts
recorded in its consolidated  financial  statements for these Chapter 11 related
matters,  as  additional  facts  and  circumstances  develop,  it  is  at  least
reasonably  possible  that  amounts  recorded  in  the  Company's   consolidated
financial statements may be revised. Future revisions, if required, could have a
material effect on the Company's  financial position or results of operations in
the period or periods in which such  revisions are recorded.  Since any specific
future  developments,  and the impact  such  developments  might have on amounts
recorded in the Company's consolidated financial statements, are unknown at this
time, an estimate of possible future adjustments cannot be made.

Environmental Matters
- ---------------------

     The Company had been advised by the United States Environmental  Protection
Agency  ("EPA") or by similar state and non-U.S.  national  regulatory  agencies
that the Company,  together  with others,  is a  Potentially  Responsible  Party
("PRP") with respect to a portion of the cleanup costs and other related matters
involving a number of  abandoned  hazardous  waste  disposal  sites.  Management
believes  that there are 11 sites at which the Company may have some  liability,
although  management expects to settle the Company's liability for four of these
sites for de minimis amounts. Based upon preliminary estimates by the EPA or the
PRP groups formed with respect to these sites, the aggregate liabilities for all
PRP's at those sites at which management believes the Company may have more than
a de  minimis  liability  is $5.8.  Management  cannot  estimate  the  aggregate
liability  for all PRP's at all of the  sites at which  management  expects  the
Company has a de minimis liability.

     The Company records, on an undiscounted  basis,  accruals for environmental
matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the Company's
costs can be reasonably estimated.  The amount accrued for environmental matters
as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, was $2.9 and $3.3  respectively.  In addition,
receivables  of $0.1 for  probable  third-party  recoveries  have been  recorded
related to these environmental matters.

     As additional facts and  circumstances  develop,  it is at least reasonably
possible that either the accrued liability or the recorded receivable related to
environmental matters may be revised.  While there are a number of uncertainties
with respect to the  Company's  estimate of its ultimate  liability  for cleanup
costs at these  hazardous  waste disposal  sites,  management  believes that any
costs  incurred  in excess of those  accrued  will not have a  material  adverse
impact  on  the  Company's   consolidated   financial  position  or  results  of
operations.  This opinion is based upon the number of  identified  PRP's at each
site, the number of such PRP's that are believed by management to be financially
capable of paying  their  share of the  ultimate  liability,  and the portion of
waste sent to the sites for which management  believes the Company might be held
responsible based on available records.





NOTE 16 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (Continued)
- ---------------------------------------

     As a result of financial provisions recorded with respect to breast implant
liabilities,  the  Company  has been  unable to meet  certain  federal and state
environmental  statutory financial ratio tests.  Consequently,  in order for the
Company to continue to operate  hazardous  waste  storage  facilities at certain
plant sites,  the states involved have required the Company to establish  trusts
to provide for aggregate estimated closure, post-closure,  corrective action and
potential  liability costs.  These trusts aggregated $23.7 and were fully funded
as of December 31,  2004.  Interest on the funds held in trust will be available
to the Company under certain  circumstances,  and the amount required to be held
in trust may vary  annually.  At such time as the  Company  satisfies  the above
referenced  financial  ratio tests, or the Company no longer needs or closes the
permitted  facilities,  the funds then  remaining in these trusts will revert to
the Company.

Other Regulatory Matters
- ------------------------

     Companies that manufacture and sell chemical  products may experience risks
under current or future laws and  regulations,  which may result in  significant
costs and liabilities.  The Company routinely conducts health, toxicological and
environmental  tests of its  products.  The Company  cannot  predict what future
legal, regulatory or other actions, if any, may be taken regarding the Company's
products or the  consequences  of their  production and sale. Such actions could
result in significant  losses,  and there can be no assurance  that  significant
losses would not be incurred. However, based on currently available information,
the  Company's  management  does not believe that any such actions  would have a
material  adverse  effect on the  Company's  financial  condition  or results of
operations.

Leases
- ------

     The Company leases certain real and personal property under agreements that
generally  require  the  Company to pay for  maintenance,  insurance  and taxes.
Rental  expense was $32.2 in 2004,  $35.2 in 2003 and $37.9 in 2002. The minimum
future  rental  payments  required  under  noncancellable  operating  leases  at
December 31, 2004, in the aggregate,  are $153.9 including the following amounts
due in each of the next five years:  2005 - $24.3,  2006 - $18.6,  2007 - $15.5,
2008 - $12.1 and 2009 - $11.1.

Guarantees
- ----------

     Guarantees arise during the ordinary course of business from  relationships
with  customers,  employees  and  nonconsolidated  affiliates  when the  Company
undertakes an obligation to guarantee the performance of others (via delivery of
cash or other  assets) if specified  triggering  events  occur.  Non-performance
under a contract by the guaranteed party triggers the obligation of the Company.
The maximum amount of potential  future  payments  under such  guarantees of the
Company was $7.9 and $8.9 at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, primarily
related to guarantees of housing loan  obligations  of certain  employees of the
Company's  subsidiaries in Japan. Such guarantees have various  expiration dates
and typically span  approximately  20 years. The Company's  estimated  potential
obligation under these guarantees is not material to the consolidated  financial
statements  and no liability  has been  recorded on the  Company's  consolidated
balance sheets for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003.

     The Company also has guarantees  related to its  performance  under certain
operating lease arrangements and the residual value of leased assets. If certain
operating  leases are terminated by the Company,  it guarantees a portion of the
residual value loss, if any, incurred by the lessors in disposing of the related
assets.  Expiration dates vary, and certain leases contain renewal options.  The
maximum amount of future payments the Company was potentially  obligated to make
for guarantees of residual values of leased assets was $5.3 and $2.6 at December
31, 2004 and 2003,  respectively.  Management  believes that, based on facts and
circumstances,  the Company's estimated potential  obligation under its residual
value lease guarantees is not material to the Company's  consolidated  financial
statements  and as  such,  no  liability  has  been  recorded  on the  Company's
consolidated balance sheets for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003.

Warranties
- ----------

     In the normal course of business to facilitate  sales of its products,  the
Company has issued  product  warranties,  and it has entered into  contracts and
purchase orders that often contain  standard terms and conditions that typically
include a warranty.  The  Company's  warranty  activities do not have a material
impact  on  the  Company's   consolidated   financial  position  or  results  of
operations.






NOTE 17 - PROCEEDING UNDER CHAPTER 11
- -------------------------------------

Plan of Reorganization
- ----------------------

     In 1999,  the Company,  with the Committee of Tort  Claimants,  a committee
appointed  in  the  Chapter  11  Proceeding  to  represent   products  liability
claimants,   filed  a  joint  plan  of   reorganization   (the  "Joint  Plan  of
Reorganization")  and a related  disclosure  statement.  In November  1999,  the
Bankruptcy  Court issued an order  confirming the Joint Plan of  Reorganization,
(the "Confirmation Order"). After various appeals of the Confirmation Order, the
Joint Plan of  Reorganization  became effective on the Effective Date. The Joint
Plan of Reorganization provides funding for the resolution of breast implant and
other products liability litigation covered by the Chapter 11 Proceeding through
several  settlement  options or through  litigation and for the  satisfaction of
commercial creditor claims.

Breast Implant and Other Products Liability Claims
- --------------------------------------------------

     Products liability claims to be resolved by settlement will be administered
by a settlement  facility (the "Settlement  Facility"),  and products  liability
claims to be resolved by  litigation  will be defended by a litigation  facility
(the "Litigation Facility"). Under the Joint Plan of Reorganization, the present
value of the total  amount of  payments  by the  Company  committed  to  resolve
products  liability  claims  will not  exceed  $2.35  billion  valued  as of the
Effective  Date.  Of this  amount,  no more than $400.0 will be used to fund the
Litigation Facility.  Payments made by the Company will be placed in a trust and
withdrawn by the Settlement  Facility to pay eligible settling  claimants and to
cover  the  Settlement  Facility's  operating  expenses.  Amounts  will  also be
withdrawn  from the trust as necessary to fund the  resolution of claims via the
Litigation Facility and the operational expenses of the Litigation Facility.

     Under the Joint Plan of Reorganization,  the Settlement Facility will allow
breast  implant  claimants who choose to settle their claims against the Company
and who meet certain  documentation  and  eligibility  criteria to combine up to
three  settlement  options,  which will result in Base Payments for U.S.  breast
implant  claimants  ranging  from  $2  thousand  to  more  than  $250  thousand.
Settlement payments to non-U.S. breast implant claimants under the Joint Plan of
Reorganization  will be equal to either 35% or 60% of similar  payments  made to
U.S.  breast  implant  claimants,  depending  on the country of residence of the
non-U.S.  breast implant claimant receiving settlement  payments.  These reduced
amounts are designed to account for  differing  local  economic and legal system
factors.  Furthermore,  the Joint Plan of Reorganization  incorporates the terms
and conditions of three  Canadian  class action  settlements in the provinces of
Ontario,  Quebec,  and British  Columbia,  Canada and a settlement  of Australia
breast implant litigation.

     Under  the  Joint  Plan of  Reorganization,  products  liability  claimants
choosing to litigate  their  claims  will be  required  to pursue  their  claims
through  litigation  against  the  Litigation  Facility,  including  a  mandated
pre-trial  mediation  program.  The  deadline  for  claimants to elect to file a
notice of intent to litigate has passed.  Those claimants who failed to file the
notice of intent to litigate are prohibited  from litigating  their claims.  The
Company  contemplates  that the litigation  process will include  certain common
issues  procedures  (the  "Common  Issues  Procedures")  to resolve the issue of
whether silicone  implants cause the diseases alleged by the products  liability
claimants. The U.S. District Court in Michigan will ultimately determine whether
the Common Issues Procedures will be implemented. The result of implementing the
Common Issues  Procedures  will not affect those claimants who choose to resolve
their claims through the Settlement Facility.

     In  1997,  the  Company  filed  an  objection  with  the  Bankruptcy  Court
challenging all claims alleging that silicone breast implants caused disease and
a motion for summary  judgment  requesting that the Bankruptcy Court dismiss all
such  claims  on the  basis  that  there  is no  scientifically  valid  evidence
sufficient to support such claims.  The Bankruptcy  Court  recommended  that the
U.S.   District  Court  for  the  Eastern   District  of  Michigan  should  take
responsibility  for ruling on these issues.  The U.S. District Court in Michigan
accepted  that  responsibility,  but  indicated  that it would not rule on these
issues until after the Joint Plan of  Reorganization  becomes effective and that
it would do so in the context of the Common Issues  Procedures  discussed above.
The U.S.  District  Court in Michigan also indicated that the 1998 report of the
National Science Panel,  established by the U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of  Alabama,  may be used in  connection  with  resolving  the issue of
whether  silicone  gel implants  cause the diseases  claimed by those who assert
such claims.  The report  concluded that the weight of scientific  evidence does
not indicate a link between silicone breast implants and systemic diseases, such
as  connective  tissue  diseases,  related  signs and symptoms and immune system
dysfunction.

     If use  of the  Common  Issues  Procedures  results  in a  conclusion  that
silicone  implants do not cause disease,  some or all disease claims against the
Litigation  Facility  may be  disallowed  and  some  or all  products  liability
claimants choosing to resolve their disease claims by litigation may not receive
any  distribution  from the  Litigation  Facility.  If use of the Common  Issues
Procedures  results in a conclusion  that  silicone  implants do cause  disease,
individual claims that remain against the Litigation  Facility would be resolved
through further litigation or settlement. In any event, non-disease claims could
continue  to  proceed  against  the  Litigation  Facility.  The  Joint  Plan  of
Reorganization  also  contemplates  that other Common Issues  Procedures  may be
requested  by the  Litigation  Facility.  Claimants  who choose to pursue  their
claim(s)  against the Company  through the Litigation  Facility would forego any
right to receive benefits under the various  settlement options provided through
the Settlement Facility.

     The Joint Plan of Reorganization  provides that punitive damage claims will
not be allowed.





NOTE 17 - PROCEEDING UNDER CHAPTER 11 (Continued)
- -------------------------------------

Funding the Settlement and Litigation Facilities
- ------------------------------------------------

     The Company will fund the Settlement  Facility and the Litigation  Facility
(collectively,  the  "Facilities")  over a  16-year  period,  commencing  at the
Effective Date. The Company anticipates that it will be able to meet its payment
obligations to the Facilities  utilizing  cash flow from  operations,  insurance
proceeds and/or prospective borrowings. Under certain circumstances, the Company
will also have  access to a  ten-year  unsecured  revolving  credit  commitment,
established by Dow Chemical and Corning,  to assist in the timely funding of the
Facilities. During the first five years of this revolving credit commitment, the
maximum  aggregate  amount  available to the Company will be $300.0,  thereafter
decreasing by $50.0 per year.  Borrowings under this revolving credit commitment
will only be  permitted  in the  event  that the  Company  is unable to meet its
payment obligations to fund the Facilities.

     Funds  will be paid by the  Company  (a) to the  Settlement  Facility  with
respect to products  liability  claims, as such claims are processed and allowed
by the Settlement Facility,  and (b) via the Settlement Facility with respect to
products  liability  claims  allowed  through the Litigation  Facility,  as such
claims are  resolved.  Future  insurance  settlements  will be paid by  Insurers
directly  to the  Settlement  Facility on behalf of the  Company.  The amount of
funds to be paid by or on behalf  of the  Company  are  subject  to  annual  and
aggregate  funding  limits.  The  Company  has made  payments of $1,383.9 to the
Settlement Facility through December 31, 2004.

     Based on  funding  agreements  relating  to the  amount  and  timing of the
Company's  payment  obligations  to the  Settlement  Facility,  payments  to the
Settlement  Facility  will  be made  on a  periodic  basis  until  such  payment
obligations  are met.  These  funding  agreements  restrict the  application  of
payments  made by the  Company  in  advance  of  their  due  dates  (the  "Early
Payments").  Under these funding agreements, the Company will receive credit for
the  future  value  equivalent,  at  the  due  date  of  the  scheduled  payment
obligations,  of the Early  Payments using a discount rate of 7%. As of December
31, 2004 and 2003, the Company's  "Implant reserve" recorded in the consolidated
balance sheets was $1,884.9 and $2,249.9, respectively, to reflect the Company's
expected remaining  obligation to fund the Settlement Facility and the Company's
estimate of other breast implant litigation related matters.  The actual amounts
payable and the timing of such payments by the Company are uncertain and will be
affected  by,  among  others,  the  rate at which  claims  are  resolved  by the
Facilities,  the rate at which  insurance  proceeds  are received by the Company
from its  insurers and the degree to which the Company  receives  credit for the
future value  equivalent of Early  Payments.  During the year ended December 31,
2004,  the  Company  recorded  $12.1 in other  nonoperating  income to reflect a
credit for the future value equivalent  credit of Early Payments from restricted
insurance proceeds to the Settlement  Facility of $306.0. The ultimate amount of
additional  future value  equivalent  credit is subject to  confirmation  by the
claims administrator of the Settlement Facility.

Discharge of the Company and Releases of Other Parties
- ------------------------------------------------------

     Under the Joint Plan of Reorganization,  personal injury claims and certain
related claims will be transferred to the Settlement Facility and the Litigation
Facility for handling and payment.  In addition,  all of such claims against (a)
the Company,  its  subsidiaries  and affiliates,  (b) Dow Chemical,  Corning and
their  respective  subsidiaries  and  affiliates,  (c) certain of the  Company's
insurers who have settled  coverage issues with the Company relating to products
liability  claims  and  (d)  all  of  the  officers,  directors,  employees  and
representatives  of these parties have been  discharged  (as to the Company) and
released (as to all other parties),  and any prosecution or enforcement of those
claims are permanently barred,  subject only to the limits of the enforceability
of orders of the  Bankruptcy  Court and the  District  Court  outside the United
States.

Insurance Allocation Agreement between the Company and Dow Chemical
- -------------------------------------------------------------------

     A number of the products  liability  insurance  policies relevant to claims
against the  Company  name the Company  and Dow  Chemical  as  co-insureds  (the
"Shared Insurance Assets").  A portion of the Shared Insurance Assets may, under
certain  conditions,  become  payable by the  Company to Dow  Chemical  under an
insurance allocation agreement, as amended, between the Company and Dow Chemical
(the "Insurance Allocation  Agreement").  The Insurance Allocation Agreement was
reached  between Dow Chemical and the Company in order to resolve issues related
to the amount of the Shared  Insurance  Assets  that would be  available  to the
Company for  resolution of its products  liability  claims.  Under the Insurance
Allocation Agreement, 25% of certain of the Shared Insurance Assets will be paid
by the Company to Dow Chemical  subsequent to the Effective Date.  However,  the
amount of Shared  Insurance  Assets that will be payable to Dow  Chemical by the
Company under the Insurance  Allocation  Agreement will not exceed approximately
$285.0. In addition, a portion of any such amounts paid to Dow Chemical,  to the
extent not used by Dow Chemical to pay certain products  liability claims,  will
be  paid  over  to the  Company  after  the  expiration  of a  17.5-year  period
commencing  on the  Effective  Date.  Furthermore,  the  Company  recognized  an
obligation  of $35.0 to Dow Chemical  related to additional  insurance  coverage
under which the Company  and Dow  Chemical  are  co-insureds.  Consequently,  as
previously reported,  the Company's results for 1998 reflect a pre-tax charge of
$320.0 for an estimate of amounts of insurance proceeds payable or to be paid to
Dow Chemical  (the  "Co-insurance  payable").  As a result of certain  insurance
settlements and an amendment to the Insurance  Allocation  Agreement between the
Company and Dow Chemical,  as of December 31, 2004, the Co-insurance payable has
been reduced to $48.9.





NOTE 17 - PROCEEDING UNDER CHAPTER 11 (Continued)
- -------------------------------------

Commercial Creditor Issues
- --------------------------

     The Joint Plan of  Reorganization  provides  funding to satisfy  commercial
creditor claims,  including accrued interest.  The Joint Plan of Reorganization,
as amended  pursuant  to a May 21,  2004  ruling of the U.S.  District  Court in
Michigan, provides that each of the Company's commercial creditors would receive
in cash the sum of (a) an amount equal to the  principal  amount of their claims
and (b) interest on such claims.  As of December 31, 2004,  the Company has paid
approximately  $1.5 billion in principal and the undisputed  portion of interest
payable  to  commercial  creditors  of the  Company.  The  remaining  amount  of
principal  payable to commercial  creditors as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 was
$2.1 and $816.6,  respectively.  As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the amount of
interest included in the caption "Accrued interest" recorded in the consolidated
balance sheets related to the Company's potential  obligation to pay interest to
its  commercial  creditors  in the Chapter 11  Proceeding  was $63.5 and $650.9,
respectively.

     The  actual  amount  of  interest  that  will  ultimately  be paid to these
commercial  creditors (the  "Commercial  Creditors") is uncertain due to pending
litigation in the U.S.  Court of Appeals for the Sixth  Circuit.  The Bankruptcy
Court has issued a number of orders  related to the interest rate that should be
applied to claims of the  Commercial  Creditors from the Filing Date through the
Effective Date ("Pendency  Interest").  In 1999, the Bankruptcy  Court held that
Commercial  Creditors  were  entitled to Pendency  Interest in an amount no less
than the amount that would result from the  application of the Federal  Judgment
Rate as of the Filing Date, which is 6.28%.  Subsequently,  the Bankruptcy Court
held that  Pendency  Interest  would be measured  by the terms of the  Company's
contracts  in effect  on the  Filing  Date.  In  addition,  in April  2001,  the
Bankruptcy Court issued an opinion which (a) ruled that, where contracts related
to claims  specified  both a base  contract rate and a default rate of interest,
the base contract rate would apply, (b) denied the request of certain Commercial
Creditors  for default  interest and  collection  costs and (c)  indicated  that
interest on claims held by certain Commercial  Creditors should be compounded on
an annual basis. The involved Commercial  Creditors,  joined by the Committee of
Unsecured Creditors,  appealed the April 2001 Bankruptcy Court opinion. On March
31, 2004, the U.S.  District Court in Michigan  affirmed the Bankruptcy  Court's
April 2001 opinion.

     On May 18, 2004, the U.S. District Court in Michigan ruled that interest on
claims of certain  Commercial  Creditors would accrue based on contract rates of
interest in effect under  relevant loan  agreements as of May 15, 1995,  but not
less than 6.28%.  With respect to loan agreements  providing for a floating rate
of interest, the U.S. District Court in Michigan ruled that the floating rate in
effect on May 15, 1995 would be fixed as of that date,  but not less than 6.28%.
The Company  based its accrual for interest  payable on this ruling and based on
the amended Joint Plan of Reorganization  requirement that a rate of 5.0% should
be applied to amounts owed by the Company to the Commercial Creditors after June
1, 2004.  Consequently,  the Company's  results for the year ended  December 31,
2004,  include a pretax charge of $48.3 ($30.4 after tax). The Company's results
for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003,  reflected  interest  expense of
$95.5  ($60.2  after tax) and $94.5  ($59.5  after tax),  respectively,  for the
amount of interest potentially payable to the Commercial Creditors.

     The Company,  certain  Commercial  Creditors and the Committee of Unsecured
Creditors have appealed the U.S. District Court in Michigan's March 31, 2004 and
May 18, 2004 rulings  regarding  applicable  interest rates to the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.  The Company's position is that non-default rates
of interest for floating  rate  obligations  should be  determined in accordance
with the formulas in the relevant contracts, except that the aggregate amount of
interest cannot be less than that resulting from the application of a fixed rate
of 6.28% through June 1, 2004. The undisputed interest portion was calculated by
application of the Company's  position as described  above.  The  application of
this position would result in an aggregate  amount of interest that is less than
the  amount of  interest  that  would  result  from the U.S.  District  Court in
Michigan's  ruling. As of September 29, 2004, the position of certain Commercial
Creditors,  joined by the Committee of Unsecured  Creditors is that, in addition
to the aggregate  amount of interest  resulting from the U.S.  District Court in
Michigan's  ruling,  default  interest in excess of $80.0,  plus an unquantified
amount of certain fees,  costs and expenses  should be added to the claims filed
by holders of the fixed and floating rate obligations.

Securities Laws Class Action Lawsuits
- -------------------------------------

     As previously  reported,  in 1992 the Company and certain of its former and
present  directors and officers were named,  as defendants  with others,  in two
securities  laws class action  lawsuits  filed by purchasers of stock of Corning
and Dow Chemical in the Federal  District Court in the Southern  District of New
York.  These  cases  have been  dismissed  without  prejudice  with  respect  to
directors,  officers and other individuals  originally named as defendants.  Dow
Chemical  and  Corning  have been  dismissed  from this  litigation.  The claims
asserted  against the Company in these cases have been discharged in the Chapter
11 Proceeding as of the Effective Date.





NOTE 17 - PROCEEDING UNDER CHAPTER 11 (Continued)
- -------------------------------------

Reorganization Costs
- --------------------

     The Company has incurred and will continue to incur costs  associated  with
(a) the matters  related to the Chapter 11  Proceeding  that will be resolved by
the U.S.  District Court in Michigan and the U.S. Court of Appeals,  and (b) the
implementation  of the Joint Plan of  Reorganization.  The  aggregate  amount of
these  costs,  which are being  expensed as  incurred,  are  recorded  under the
caption "Reorganization costs" in the consolidated statements of operations. For
the years ended  December 31, 2004 and 2003 the Company  incurred the  following
reorganization  costs:  Legal  Expenses  of $5.1  and  $3.9,  respectively,  and
Administrative Expenses of $2.1 and $1.5, respectively.

NOTE 18 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
- ------------------------------------

     The  Company has  transactions  in the normal  course of business  with its
shareholders,  Dow Chemical and Corning,  and their  affiliates.  The  following
tables  summarize  related  party  transactions  and balances with the Company's
shareholders.


     In addition, non-wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company have transactions
in the normal course of business with their minority shareholders. The following
tables  summarize   related  party   transactions  and  balances  between  these
non-wholly owned subsidiaries and their minority owners.


     Management  believes  the costs of such  purchases  and the prices for such
sales were  competitive  with purchases from other  suppliers and sales to other
customers.

     In addition,  DCTS loans excess  funds to its  minority  shareholder  Toray
Industries,  Inc. The amount of loans  receivable  at December 31, 2004 and 2003
was $29.3 and $60.5,  respectively.  These  balances  are included in "Notes and
other receivables" in the consolidated balance sheets.  Management believes that
interest earned from this loan arrangement is at rates  commensurate with market
rates for companies of similar credit standing.

                          NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


1.   Organization and Nature of Operations

Samsung Corning  Precision  Glass Co., Ltd. (the "Company") was  incorporated on
April 20,  1995 under the laws of the  Republic  of Korea in  accordance  with a
joint venture agreement between Corning Incorporated  ("Corning") located in the
U.S.A. and domestic companies in Korea.

As of December 31, 2004, the issued and  outstanding  number of common shares of
the Company is  2,400,000,  50% of which are owned by Corning,  42.6% by Samsung
Electronics Co., Ltd. and 7.4% by another domestic shareholder.

The Company  operates in one business  segment,  the production and marketing of
precision flat glass  substrates.  Glass substrates  provided by the Company are
used to make TFT-LCD  (Thin-Film  Transistor  Liquid Crystal Display) panels for
notebook  computers,  LCD monitors,  LCD TVs and other handheld  devices such as
digital cameras,  PDAs and navigators.  The Company's major customers are Korean
LCD panel makers such as Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., LG Philips LCD Co., Ltd.
and BOE Hydis  Technology  Co., Ltd. The Company's  current  market is primarily
limited to companies incorporated in Korea.

2.   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

The  accompanying   financial   statements  are  presented  in  accordance  with
accounting  principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S.
GAAP").   Significant  accounting  policies  followed  by  the  Company  in  the
preparation of the accompanying financial statements are summarized below.

Basis of Presentation
The  accounting  records  of the  Company  are  expressed  in Korean Won and are
maintained in accordance with the laws and regulations of the Republic of Korea.

Foreign Currencies
The Company operates primarily in Korean Won, its local and functional currency.
The Company has chosen the U.S. Dollar as its reporting currency.  In accordance
with the Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards  ("SFAS") No. 52, Foreign
Currency  Translation,  revenues and  expenses  have been  translated  into U.S.
Dollars at average  exchange  rates  prevailing  during the  period.  Assets and
liabilities  have been  translated  at the exchange  rates on the balance  sheet
date.  Equity accounts have been translated at historical  rates.  The resulting
translation  gain  or loss  adjustments  are  recorded  directly  as a  separate
component of stockholders'  equity.  Transaction gains or losses that arise from
exchange rate fluctuations on transactions  denominated in a currency other than
the functional currency are included in the income statement as incurred. Assets
and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are
translated  at the  exchange  rates at the  balance  sheet date and the  related
exchange gains or losses are recorded in the statement of income.

Revenue Recognition
The Company derives its revenue from the sale of precision flat glass substrates
to its customers, primarily located in Korea. The Company recognizes its revenue
when persuasive  evidence of an arrangement exists, the products or the services
have been  delivered  and  legal  title  and all  risks of  ownership  have been
transferred  to the  customer,  the sales  price is fixed or  determinable,  and
collectibility is reasonably assured. This typically occurs upon delivery of the
products to the  customers,  as the majority of the  customers  are large Korean
manufacturers  of LCD panels who enter into general supply  agreements  with the
Company and place large orders of products for delivery on a regular basis.  The
Company  reduces revenue for estimated price discounts and rebates based on past
experience.

Use of Estimates
The  preparation  of the  financial  statements  in  conformity  with U.S.  GAAP
requires  management  to make  estimates  and  assumptions  that affect  amounts
reported in the  accompanying  financial  statements and  disclosures.  The most
significant  estimates  and  assumptions  relate to the useful life of property,
plant and equipment, allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable, contingent
liabilities,  inventory valuation, impairment of long-lived assets and allocated
expenses.  Although these estimates are based on management's  best knowledge of
current events and actions that the Company may undertake in the future,  actual
results may be different from those estimates.

Financial Instruments
The amounts for cash and cash  equivalents,  short-term  financial  instruments,
accounts receivable, certain other assets, accounts payable, certain accrued and
other liabilities, short-term loan and long-term debt are reported at their fair
value due to their short maturities or market interest rates. Obligations due to
or  receivables  from  related  parties have no  ascertainable  fair value as no
market exists for such instruments.





2.   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash  and  cash  equivalents   include  cash,  demand  deposits  and  short-term
investments  with an original  maturity  of three  months or less at the time of
acquisition.

Inventories
Inventories  are  stated  at the  lower  of  cost or  market,  with  cost  being
determined by the  weighted-average  method,  which  approximates  the first-in,
first-out method.

Property and Depreciation
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated  depreciation.
Depreciation is computed using the  straight-line  method based on the following
estimated useful lives:

Buildings                                    From 20 to 40 years
Machinery and equipment                      From 1.5 to 8 years
Vehicle, tools, furniture and fixtures       From 2 to 8 years

Expenditures  that enhance the value or materially extend the useful life of the
facilities are capitalized as additions to property, plant and equipment.  Costs
of normal,  recurring or periodic repairs and maintenance activities are charged
to expense as incurred.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived  assets are reviewed  for  impairment  whenever  events or changes in
circumstances  indicate  that  the  carrying  amount  of an  asset  may  not  be
recoverable.  Recoverability  of  assets  to be held  and  used is  measured  by
comparing  the  carrying  amount  of an  asset  or asset  group  against  future
undiscounted  cash flows expected to be generated from the asset or asset group.
If the sum of the expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of
the asset or asset group, an impairment loss equates the difference  between the
estimated fair value and the carrying value.

Accrued Severance Benefits
Employees  and  directors  with at least one year of  service  are  entitled  to
receive  a  lump-sum  payment  upon  termination  of their  employment  with the
Company,  based  on  their  length  of  service  and  rate of pay at the time of
termination.  Accrued  severance  benefits  represent  the amount which would be
payable  assuming all employees and directors were to terminate their employment
with the Company as of the balance sheet date.

The  Company  has  funds  deposited  at the  Korean  National  Pension  Fund  in
accordance with National Pension Funds Law. The use of the deposit is restricted
to the payment of severance benefits. Accordingly, accrued severance benefits in
the accompanying balance sheet are presented net of this deposit.

In addition,  accrued severance benefits are funded at approximately 57% and 60%
as of  December  31,  2004 and 2003,  respectively,  through  a group  severance
insurance plan and are presented as a deduction from accrued severance benefits.

Research and Development Costs
Research and  development  expenditures  which  include costs in relation to new
product,  development,  research, process improvement and product use technology
are expensed as incurred and included in operating expenses.

Income Taxes and Investment Tax Credit
The  Company  recognizes  deferred  income  taxes  for  anticipated  future  tax
consequences  resulting from temporary  differences between amounts reported for
financial reporting and income tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are computed on the said temporary differences by applying the enacted statutory
tax rates applicable to the years when such differences are expected to reverse.
Deferred  tax assets are  recognized  when it is more  likely than not that they
will be  realized.  The total  income tax  provision  includes  the  current tax
expense under the  applicable tax  regulations  and the change in the balance of
deferred tax assets and liabilities during the year.

The Company is  eligible to use  investment  tax  credits  that are  temporarily
allowed for  qualified  plant and equipment  expenditures.  The  investment  tax
credit is  recognized  as a  reduction  of tax  expense in the year in which the
qualified plant and equipment expenditure is incurred.





2.   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Derivative Instruments
The Company has entered into foreign  exchange  forward  contracts to manage its
exposure to the fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The risk being hedged is
the fluctuation in future cash flows from the Company's sales as a result of the
changes in exchange  rate between the Japanese Yen and Korean Won. The Company's
foreign  exchange  forward  contracts  are  denominated  in Japanese Yen and for
periods  consistent  with  the  terms  of  the  underlying  sales  transactions,
generally  one  year or less.  Since  the  Company's  foreign  exchange  forward
contracts  are made in the normal  course of  business  and not  speculative  in
nature, they are designated as cash flow hedging instruments.

All derivative  instruments are recorded at fair value. Effective changes in the
fair  value  of the  derivative  instruments  designated  as cash  flow  hedging
instruments are recorded in accumulated  other  comprehensive  income (or loss).
Amounts are reclassified from accumulated other  comprehensive  income (or loss)
when the underlying  hedged  transactions  impact  earnings.  If the transaction
being  hedged  fails  to  occur,  the gain or loss on the  associated  financial
instruments  are recorded  immediately in earnings.  As of December 31, 2004 and
2003, there were no outstanding balances of forward foreign exchange contracts.

Cash flows associated with the derivative  instruments are classified consistent
with the cash flows from the transactions being hedged.

Reclassifications
Certain amounts in the 2003 and 2002 financial statements have been reclassified
to conform to 2004 presentation.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151,  Inventory  Costs,  which amends
the  guidance  in ARB No.  43,  Chapter 4,  Inventory  Pricing,  to clarify  the
accounting  for abnormal  amounts of idle facility  expense,  freight,  handling
costs, and wasted material (spoilage). This standard requires items such as idle
facility expense, excessive spoilage, double freight, and rehandling costs to be
recognized  as  current-period  charges.  In addition,  this  standard  requires
allocation of fixed production  overheads to the costs of conversion to be based
on the normal  capacity of the  production  facilities.  The  provisions of this
standard  are  effective  for  inventory  costs  incurred  during  fiscal  years
beginning  after June 15, 2005. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS
No.  151 to have a  material  impact on its  financial  position  or  results of
operations.

3.   Inventories

Inventories consist of the following:

allowances  for  doubtful  accounts  receivable  which  management  believes are
adequate.  Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are
limited to the credit worthiness of the Company's  customers.  Three of the four
major customers of the Company are domestic TFT-LCD makers incorporated in Korea
and  another is a  domestic  Color-Filter  maker  incorporated  in Korea.  Trade
accounts  receivables  from these four major  customers are 90% and 92% of total
trade  accounts  receivable  of the  Company as of  December  31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively,  and revenues from these four major customers  constitute 90%, 95%

2003 and 2002, respectively.

In  addition,   a  substantial  portion  of  the  Company's  long-term  debt  is

     a material  fact or omit to state a  material  fact  necessary  to make the

     report;

3.   Based on my  knowledge,  the  financial  statements,  and  other  financial

     respects the financial  condition,  results of operations and cash flows of
     the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;

4.   The  registrant's  other  certifying  officer(s) and I are  responsible for
     establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined

     financial  reporting  (as  defined  in  Exchange  Act Rules  13a-15(f)  and
     15d-15(f))for the registrant and have:

     a)   designed  such  disclosure  controls  and  procedures,  or caused such
          disclosure   controls  and   procedures  to  be  designed   under  our
          supervision,  to ensure  that  material  information  relating  to the
          registrant,  including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to
          us by others within those entities,  particularly during the period in
          which this report is being prepared;

     b)   designed such internal  control over  financial  reporting,  or caused
          such internal  control over  financial  reporting to be designed under

          reliability  of financial  reporting and the  preparation of financial
          statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
          accounting principles;

     c)   evaluated the  effectiveness of the registrant's  disclosure  controls
          and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions  about the

          control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's
          most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's  fourth fiscal quarter in
          the case of an annual  report)  that has  materially  affected,  or is
          reasonably  likely to materially  affect,  the  registrant's  internal
          control over financial reporting; and

5.   The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on
     our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to
     the registrant's  auditors and the audit committee of registrant's board of
     directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

     a)   all significant  deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
          operation  of internal  control  over  financial  reporting  which are
          reasonably  likely to  adversely  affect the  registrant's  ability to
          record, process, summarize and report financial information; and

     b)   any fraud, whether or not material,  that involves management or other
          employees who have a  significant  role in the  registrant's  internal
          control over financial reporting.
