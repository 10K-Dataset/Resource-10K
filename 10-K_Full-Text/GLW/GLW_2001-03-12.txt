PART I

Item 1. Business

General

Corning traces its origins to a glass business established in 1851. The present corporation was incorporated in the State of New York in December 1936, and its
name was changed from Corning Glass Works to Corning Incorporated on April 28, 1989.

Corning
is a global, technology-based corporation which operates in three broadly based business segments: Telecommunications, Advanced Materials and Information Display.

The
Telecommunications Segment produces optical fiber and cable, optical hardware and equipment, photonic modules and components and optical networking devices for the worldwide
telecommunications industry.

The
Advanced Materials Segment manufactures specialized products with unique properties for customer applications utilizing glass, glass ceramic and polymer technologies. Businesses
within this segment include environmental products, life science products, semiconductor materials and optical and lighting products.

The
Information Display Segment manufactures glass panels and funnels for televisions and CRTs, liquid crystal display glass for flat panel displays and projection video lens
assemblies.

Corning
and its subsidiaries manufacture products at approximately 96 plants in 18 countries.

Additional
discussion of Corning and each of its segments is discussed in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, appearing on
pages 13 through 31, and Note 3 (Information by Operating Segment) of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements appearing on pages 64 through 68.

Competition

Corning competes across all of its product lines with many large and varied manufacturers, both domestic and foreign.

Competition
within the telecommunications industry is intense among several significant companies. Corning represents an important market presence in the segment's principal product
lines. Price and new product innovations are significant competitive factors.

Within
the Advanced Materials Segment, Corning's principal products face competition from a variety of materials manufacturers, some of which manufacture similar products made from
materials other than glass and ceramics. Among other things, innovation, product quality, performance, and service are key competitive elements. Competition is also intense for certain businesses
within the Information Display Segment.

Corning
strives to maintain its market position through technology and product innovation. For the future, Corning's competitive advantage lies in its commitment to research and
development, its financial resources and its commitment to quality.

Raw Materials

Corning's production of specialty glasses and related materials requires significant quantities of energy and batch materials.

Although
energy shortages have not been a problem recently, Corning has achieved flexibility through important engineering changes to take advantage of the lowest-cost energy source
in most


significant processes. Specifically, Corning's principal manufacturing processes can now be operated with natural gas, propane, oil or electricity, or a combination of these energy sources.

As
to resources (ores, minerals, and processed chemicals) required in manufacturing operations, availability appears to be adequate. Corning's suppliers from time to time may
experience capacity limitations in their own operations, or may eliminate certain product lines; nevertheless, Corning believes it has adequate programs to ensure a reliable supply of batch chemicals
and raw materials. For many products, Corning has alternative glass compositions that would allow operations to continue without interruption in the event of specific materials shortages.

Certain
key optical components used in the manufacture of products within Corning's Telecommunications Segment are currently available only from a limited number of sources. Any
future difficulty in obtaining sufficient and timely delivery of components could result in delays or reductions in product shipments.

Patents and Trademarks

Inventions by members of Corning's research and engineering staff have been, and continue to be, important to the Company's growth. Patents have been granted
on many of these inventions in the United States and other countries. Some of these patents have been licensed to other manufacturers, including Corning's associated companies. Many of the earlier
patents have now expired.

Most
of Corning's products are marketed under the following trademarks: Corning, Celcor, CMT, Costar, FiberGain, HPFS, LEAF, MetroCor, PurePath, Pyrex, Steuben and Vycor. Subsidiaries
and divisions of Corning frequently use their own trademarks.

Protection of the Environment

Corning has a program to ensure that its facilities are in compliance with state, federal and foreign pollution-control regulations. This program resulted in
capital and operating expenditures during the past several years. In order to maintain compliance with such regulations, capital expenditures for pollution control in continuing operations were
approximately $90.9 million in 2000 compared to $63.3 million in 1999 and are estimated to be $168.4 million in 2001. The increase in 2000 was primarily due to pollution control expenditures on new
facilities constructed during the year. The estimated increase in 2001 is also due primarily to capacity expansions expected to be completed during the year.

Corning's
2000 operating results from continuing operations were charged with approximately $44.2 million for depreciation, maintenance, waste disposal and other operating expenses
associated with pollution control. The level of these costs is expected to increase slightly in 2001 due to depreciation costs associated with capital expenditures. Corning believes that its
compliance program will not place it at a competitive disadvantage.

Risk Factors

OUR
SALES COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED IF ONE OR MORE OF OUR KEY CUSTOMERS SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED ORDERS FOR OUR PRODUCTS

Our
customer base is relatively concentrated and a modest number of customers account for a high percentage of net sales in our telecommunications, environmental products and advanced
display business. If we are unable to establish or maintain good relationships with key customers, it could negatively affect our results of operations and financial performance.

In
addition, if our current customers do not continue to place orders at the levels that they have done in the past, we may not be able to replace these orders with new orders from
new customers.


If our customers experience difficulties in accessing the capital markets, they may further reduce capital spending and adjust inventories which could adversely affect our business.
While we have announced plans to respond to the softer market by cutting costs and reallocating optical fiber volume to customers we had been unable to supply, we cannot assure you that our plans will
be successful in mitigating the adverse effects of a softer market and in maintaining our projected growth.

DIFFICULTIES
WE MAY ENCOUNTER IN MANAGING OUR GROWTH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

We
have historically achieved growth through a combination of internally developed new products and acquisitions. Our growth strategy depends on our ability to continue developing or
acquiring new products for our customer base. We expect to continue to pursue acquisitions of other companies as well as equity ventures to develop new technologies and product lines, although we
cannot guarantee that we will be successful. The success of each acquisition will depend, in part, upon our ability:

•

to
efficiently integrate acquired businesses into our organization;

•

to
manufacture and sell the products of the businesses acquired;

•

to
retain key personnel of the acquired businesses;

•

to
apply our financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures to the acquired businesses; and

•

to
successfully complete technology initiatives.

ACCOUNTING
CONSEQUENCES OF PURCHASE ACQUISITIONS WILL MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR NET INCOME CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES

Acquisitions
recorded as purchases for accounting purposes have resulted, and in the future may result, in the recognition of significant amounts of goodwill and other purchased
intangibles. The amortization of these assets will significantly reduce our future net income calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

IF
THE MARKETS FOR OUR PRODUCTS DO NOT DEVELOP AND EXPAND AS WE ANTICIPATE, DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS MAY DECLINE, WHICH WOULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

The
markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technologies, evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions. Our success is expected to depend,
in substantial part, on the timely and successful introduction of new products, upgrades of current products to comply with emerging industry standards, our ability to acquire technologies needed to
remain competitive and our ability to address competing technologies and products. In addition, the following factors related to our products and the markets for them could have an adverse impact on
our results of operations and financial performance:

•

if
we are unable to introduce optical fiber and photonic component products or any other leading products, such as our glass for flat panel displays, that
can command competitive prices in the marketplace;

•

if
we are unable to maintain a favorable mix of products;

•

if
the level of demand for our products by our customers does not continue. While this demand has been increasing in recent quarters, there is no assurance
that this upward trend can be sustained. A leveling or declining demand or an unanticipated change in market demand for


products
based on a specific technology would adversely affect our ability to sustain recent operating and financial performance;

•

if
we are unable to continue to develop new product lines to address our customers' diverse needs and the several market segments in which we participate.
This requires a high level of innovation, as well as the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends; or

•

if
we are not successful in creating the infrastructure required to support anticipated growth in product demand.

IF
WE DO NOT ACHIEVE ACCEPTABLE YIELDS OR SUFFICIENT PRODUCT RELIABILITY, OUR OPERATING RESULTS COULD SUFFER

The
manufacture of our products involves highly complex and precise processes, requiring production in highly controlled and clean environments. Changes in our manufacturing processes
or those of our suppliers could significantly reduce our manufacturing yields and product reliability. In some cases, existing manufacturing techniques, which involve substantial manual labor, may be
insufficient to achieve the volume or cost targets of our customers. We will need to develop new manufacturing processes and techniques to achieve targeted volume and cost levels. While we continue to
devote substantial efforts to the improvement of our manufacturing techniques and processes, we may not achieve manufacturing volumes and cost levels in our manufacturing activities that will fully
satisfy customer demands.

INTERRUPTIONS
OF SUPPLIES FROM OUR KEY SUPPLIERS MAY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

Interruptions
of supplies from our key suppliers could disrupt production or impact our ability to increase production and sales. We obtain several critical components used in
production of telecommunications products from a limited number of suppliers, some of which are also our competitors. We do not have long-term or volume purchase agreements with every supplier, and
may have limited options for alternative supply if these suppliers fail to continue the supply of components.

WE
FACE INTENSE COMPETITION IN SEVERAL OF OUR BUSINESSES

We
face intense competition in several of our businesses. We expect that we will face additional competition from existing competitors and from a number of companies that may enter
our markets.
Since some of the markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid growth and rapid technology changes, smaller niche and start-up companies may become our principal competitors in the future.
We must invest in research and development, expand our engineering, manufacturing and marketing capabilities and continue to improve customer service and support in order to remain competitive. While
we expect to undertake the investment and effort in each of these areas, we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain or improve our competitive position.

Our
competitors may have greater financial, engineering, manufacturing, marketing or other support resources. Market consolidation may create additional or stronger competitors and
may intensify competition.

WE
FACE PRICE PRESSURES IN EACH OF OUR LEADING BUSINESSES THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

We
periodically face pricing pressures in each of our leading businesses as a result of intense competition, emerging new technologies, and manufacturing efficiencies in both the
domestic and the international marketplaces. While we will work toward reducing our costs to respond to pricing pressures, we may not be able to achieve proportionate reductions in costs.


WE MAY EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTIES IN OBTAINING OR PROTECTING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

We
may encounter difficulties, costs or risks in protecting our intellectual property rights or obtaining rights to additional intellectual property to permit us to continue or expand
our businesses. Other companies, including some of our large competitors, hold patents in our industries and the intellectual property rights of others could inhibit our ability to introduce new
products in our field of operations unless we secure licenses on commercially reasonable terms.

WE
FACE RISKS RELATED TO OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND SALES

We
have customers located outside the United States, as well as significant foreign operations, including manufacturing and sales. As a result of these international operations, we
face a number of risks, including:

•

the
difficulty of effectively managing our diverse global operations;

•

change
in regulatory requirements;

•

tariffs
and other trade barriers;

•

political
and economic instability in foreign markets; and

•

fluctuations
in foreign currencies which may make our products less competitive in countries in which local currencies decline in value relative to the
dollar.

IF
WE FAIL TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN KEY PERSONNEL, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE MAY SUFFER

Our
future success will be determined in part by our ability to attract and retain, in a highly competitive marketplace, key scientific and technical personnel for our research,
development and engineering efforts. Our business also depends on the continued contributions of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel. While we believe that we have
been successful in attracting and retaining key personnel, we cannot assure you that we will continue to be successful in the future.

IF
WE PROVIDE CUSTOMER FINANCING IN THE FUTURE, IT COULD EXPOSE US TO THE TERM CREDIT QUALITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS

We
have not provided any customer financing to date. However, the competitive environment in which we operate may require us to provide medium-term and long-term customer financing in
the future. If we do so, we will be exposed to the term credit quality of our customers. In the event of economic uncertainty or reduced demand for customer financings in the capital and bank markets,
we may be required to continue to hold some customer financing obligations for longer periods prior to placement with third-party lenders.

OUR
QUARTERLY RESULTS MAY FLUCTUATE

We
expect to continue to experience fluctuations in our quarterly results. All of the concerns we have discussed under "Risk Factors" could affect our operating results. In addition,
our operating results may be affected by:

•

seasonality;

•

the
timing of the receipt of product orders from a limited number of major customers;

•

the
announcement and introduction of new products by us;


•

expenses
associated with litigation; and

•

the
costs associated with the acquisition or disposition of a business.

We
may experience modification and rescheduling of orders by customers in the future, if there are reductions in capital spending and inventory adjustments by our customers in response to a less
certain demand and a softer market.

OUR
COMMON STOCK PRICE HAS EXPERIENCED AND MAY CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIAL VOLATILITY

The
market price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, highly volatile because of the following factors:

•

fluctuations
in our quarterly results;

•

announcements
by our competitors and customers of technological innovations or new products;

•

developments
with respect to patents or proprietary rights; and

•

general
market conditions.

In
addition, changes in the market's valuation of telecommunications equipment stocks, and in particular those that participate in supplying optical fiber and photonic products, could
cause our common stock to be volatile or decline from current levels, possibly significantly. The stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are
unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies, which fluctuation may also cause the price of our common stock to decline.

Our
results of operations and financial performance in future quarters may not meet the expectations of public market securities analysts and investors and that could cause
significant volatility in the price of our common stock.

A
DECLINE IN THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK COULD LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL CAPITAL THAT WE MAY NEED

Although
we believe existing cash balances, cash flows from operations, available lines of credit, and proceeds from our previous securities offerings will be sufficient to meet our
capital requirements in the foreseeable future, we may be required to seek additional financing to compete effectively in these markets. We cannot precisely determine the timing and amount of such
capital requirements and they will depend on several factors, including our acquisitions and the demand for our products and products under development. The price of our common stock declined from the
highs attained in 2000. This decline could limit our ability to access the equity capital markets on terms and in the amounts that may be satisfactory to us.

Additional information in response to Item I is found in Note 3 (Information by Operating Segment) of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements appearing
on pages 64 through 68 and Five Years in Review—Historical Comparison appearing on pages 87 and 88.

Except
as otherwise indicated by the context, the terms "Corning" or "Company" as used herein, mean Corning Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries.


Item 2. Properties

Corning operates a total of 96 manufacturing plants and processing facilities, 52 of which are located in the United States. Corning owns substantially all of
its executive and corporate buildings, which are located in Corning, New York. Corning also owns substantially all of its manufacturing and research and development facilities and more than half of
its sales and administrative facilities.

During
the last five years, Corning has invested $4.6 billion in property, construction, expansion, and modernization for continuing operations. Of the $1.7 billion committed in 2000,
$392.1 million was spent on facilities outside the United States.

Manufacturing,
sales and administrative, and research and development facilities at consolidated locations have an aggregate floor space of approximately 21.2 million square feet.

Operating Segment) of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements appearing on pages 64 through 68. Information concerning lease commitments is included in Note 14 (Commitments, Contingencies,
Guarantees and Hedging Activities) of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements appearing on pages 82 and 83.

In
the opinion of management, Corning's facilities are suitable and adequate for production and distribution of the Company's products. At December 31, 2000 Corning did not own any
significant amounts of surplus or idle property.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

There are no pending legal proceedings to which Corning or any of its subsidiaries is a party or of which any of their property is the subject which are
material in relation to the consolidated financial statements.

Environmental Litigation.

Corning has been named by the Environmental Protection Agency under the Superfund Act, or by
state governments under similar state laws, as a potentially responsible party at 11 active hazardous waste sites. Under the Superfund Act, all parties who may have contributed any waste to a
hazardous waste site, identified by such Agency, are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the Agency agrees otherwise. It is Corning's policy to accrue for its estimated
liability related to Superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned by Corning based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external
consultants. Corning has accrued approximately $17.1 million for its estimated liability for environmental cleanup and litigation at December 31, 2000. Based upon the information developed to date,
management believes that the accrued reserve is a reasonable estimate of the Company's estimated liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is
remote.

Dow Corning Bankruptcy.

Corning and The Dow Chemical Company each own 50% of the common stock of Dow Corning
Corporation. On May 15, 1995, Dow Corning sought protection under the reorganization provisions of Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. The bankruptcy


proceeding is pending in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, Northern Division (Bay City, Michigan). The bankruptcy filing stayed the prosecution against Dow
Corning of approximately 19,000 breast-implant product liability lawsuits, including 45 class actions. In the period from December 1996 through February 1998, Dow Corning filed a plan of
reorganization and two amended plans, each of which was opposed by creditor representatives. In 1998, Dow Corning and the Tort Claimants Committee engaged in extended negotiations and reached certain
compromises. On November 8, 1998, Dow Corning and the Tort Claimants Committee jointly filed a revised Plan of Reorganization (Joint Plan). The Joint Plan and related disclosure materials were mailed
to claimants for their approval. Following a favorable vote from all but four classes of creditors, a hearing to confirm the Joint Plan was held in mid 1999. On November 30, 1999, the Bankruptcy Court
entered an order confirming the Joint Plan and indicated that certain written opinions would follow. On December 21, 1999, the Bankruptcy Court issued an opinion that approved the principal elements
of the Joint Plan with respect to tort claimants, but construed the Joint Plan as providing releases for third parties (including Corning and Dow Chemical as shareholders) only with respect to tort
claimants who voted in favor of the Joint Plan. A number of parties opposing the Joint Plan filed appeals on a variety of grounds to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of
Michigan. Dow Corning and the Committee of Tort Claimants filed a notice of appeal seeking review of the ruling limiting the scope of the shareholder releases. Corning and Dow Chemical filed separate
notices of appeal on this issue. On November 13, 2000, the District Court entered an Order affirming the Bankruptcy Court's November 30, 1999 Order confirming the Joint Amended Plan and reversing the
Bankruptcy Court's December 21, 1999 Opinion on the release and injunction provisions. One group of plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration in the District Court and the District Court entered a
February 5, 2001 Opinion Denying Motion for Reconsideration, confirming that the Litigation Facility under the Joint Plan is the defendant in place of Dow Corning, Corning and Dow Chemical, and that
Corning and Dow Chemical are not named defendants for direct claims. Approximately 20 appeals were filed from the District Court's Order and are pending in the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, which is
expected to rule in the second half of 2001. After all appeals are exhausted, if the Joint Plan is upheld but the shareholder releases are effective only for those voting in favor of the Joint Plan,
Corning would expect to defend any remaining claims against it on the same grounds that led to a series of orders and judgments dismissing all claims against Corning in the federal courts and the
state courts as described under the heading Implant Tort Lawsuits immediately hereafter. With respect to the possibility of additional direct or indirect claims against Corning if the full releases
are not reinstated in the Joint Plan, management believes that such claims lack merit and that the breast implant litigation against Corning will be resolved without material impact on Corning's
financial statements.

Under
the terms of the Joint Plan, Dow Corning would be required to establish a Settlement Trust and a Litigation Facility to provide a means for tort claimants to settle or litigate
their claims. Dow Corning would have the obligation to fund the Trust and the Facility, over a period of up to 16 years, in an amount up to approximately $3.2 billion (nominal value), subject to the
limitations, terms and conditions stated in the Joint Plan. Dow Corning proposes to provide the required funding over the 16 year period through a combination of cash, proceeds from insurance, and
cash flow from operations. Corning and Dow Chemical have each agreed to provide a credit facility to Dow Corning of up to $150 million ($300 million in the aggregate), subject to the terms and
conditions stated in the Joint Plan. The Joint Plan also provides for Dow Corning to make full payment, through cash and the issuance of senior notes, to its commercial creditors. If and when Dow
Corning emerges from bankruptcy, Corning will likely begin to recognize equity earnings from Dow Corning. Corning does not expect to receive dividends from Dow Corning in the foreseeable future.

Implant Tort Lawsuits.

Corning and Dow Chemical, the shareholders of Dow Corning Corporation, have been named in a
number of state and federal tort lawsuits alleging injuries arising from Dow Corning's implant products. The claims against the shareholders allege a variety of direct or indirect theories of
liability. From 1991 through December 31, 2000, Corning has been named in


approximately 11,470 state and federal tort lawsuits, some of which were filed as class actions or on behalf of multiple claimants. In 1992, the federal breast implant cases were coordinated for
pretrial purposes in the United States District Court, Northern District of Alabama (Judge Sam C. Pointer, Jr.). In 1993, Corning obtained an interlocutory order of summary judgment, which was made
final in April 1995, dismissing Corning from over 4,000 federal court cases. On March 12, 1996, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit dismissed the plaintiffs' appeal from that judgment.
The District Court entered several orders directing that Corning be dismissed from each case pending in or later transferred to the Northern District of Alabama after Dow Corning filed for bankruptcy
protection. In state court litigation, Corning was awarded summary judgment in California, Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and
Dallas, Harris and Travis Counties in Texas, thereby dismissing approximately 7,000 state cases. On July 30, 1997, the judgment in California became final when the Supreme Court of California
dismissed further review as to Corning. In Louisiana, Corning was awarded summary judgment dismissing all claims by plaintiffs and a cross-claim by Dow Chemical on February 21, 1997. On February 11,
1998, the intermediate appeals court in Louisiana vacated this judgment as premature. The Louisiana cases were transferred to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan,
Southern District (the Michigan Federal Court) to which substantially all breast implant cases were transferred in 1997. In the Michigan Federal Court, Corning is named as a defendant in approximately
70 pending cases (including some cases with multiple claimants), in addition to the transferred Louisiana cases. In the fourth quarter of 1997, Corning moved for summary judgment in the Michigan
Federal Court to dismiss these remaining cases by plaintiffs as well as the third party complaint and all cross-claims by Dow Chemical. The Michigan Federal Court heard Corning's motion for summary
judgment on February 27, 1998, but has deferred its ruling in light of the proceedings in the Bankruptcy Court. Based upon the information developed to date and recognizing that the outcome of complex
litigation is uncertain, management believes that the risk of a materially adverse result in the implant litigation against Corning is remote and believes the implant litigation against Corning will
be resolved without material impact on Corning's financial statements.

Federal securities case.

A federal securities class action lawsuit was filed in 1992 against Corning and certain
individual defendants by a class of purchasers of Corning stock who allege misrepresentations and omissions of material facts relative to the silicone gel breast implant business conducted by Dow
Corning. This action is pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The class consists of those purchasers of Corning stock in the period from June 14, 1989 to
January 13, 1992 who allegedly purchased at inflated prices due to the non-disclosure or concealment of material information and were damaged when Corning's stock price declined in January 1992 after
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requested a moratorium on Dow Corning's sale of silicone gel implants. No amount of damages is specified in the complaint. In 1997 the Court dismissed the
individual defendants from the case. In December 1998, Corning filed a motion for summary judgment
requesting that all claims against it be dismissed. Plaintiffs requested the opportunity to take depositions before responding to the motion for summary judgment. The Court permitted limited
additional discovery of certain Dow Corning, Corning and Dow Chemical officers and directors. These depositions were completed in the second quarter of 1999. On September 23, 1999, the Court granted
in part the request by plaintiffs for certain additional documentary discovery. In April 2000, the District Court ordered two additional depositions, one of which would be that of Dow Corning's former
General Counsel. Because it believes the deposition will necessarily impinge on privileged information, Dow Corning filed a petition with the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit
seeking immediate relief. The Second Circuit ruling is expected in the first half of 2001. The discovery process is continuing and the Court has set no schedule to address the still pending summary
judgment motion. Corning intends to continue to defend this action vigorously. Based upon the information developed to date and recognizing that the outcome of litigation is uncertain, management
believes that the possibility of a materially adverse verdict is remote.


Shin Etsu Quartz Products Company.

In July 1999 and February 2000, Shin Etsu Quartz Products Company filed two patent
suits in Japan against Corning for alleged patent infringement of two patents relating to the properties of fused silica materials used in the optical components of stepper machines. The suits request
damages and an injunction preventing sales of infringing products in Japan. Corning has denied infringement and has argued that the patents are invalid or unenforceable. Corning intends to defend
these suits vigorously. While recognizing that litigation is inherently uncertain, based upon the information developed to date, management believes that Corning has good defenses to Shin Etsu's
claims and that the likelihood of a materially adverse outcome is remote.

Sumitomo Electric Industries, Inc.

In September 2000, Sumitomo Electric Industries, Inc. filed a patent infringement
suit in the Federal Court in North Carolina and asserted that Corning was infringing three Sumitomo U.S. patents relating to optical fiber. The complaint also asserted that a Corning patent relating
to optical fiber was invalid. The suit seeks damages in an unspecified amount for the alleged infringement of the Sumitomo patents, an injunction restraining infringement, and a declaration that the
Corning patent is invalid. Since the filing of the complaint, Corning has met with Sumitomo. It is Corning's position that the three Sumitomo patents are either not infringed or are invalid and there
is no basis for a holding that the Corning patent is invalid. On December 13, 2000, Sumitomo amended its complaint to add a fourth patent, which it contends is infringed by Corning, and served the
amended complaint on Corning. Management is prepared to defend this action vigorously and, recognizing that the outcome of litigation is uncertain, believes it has strong defenses to Sumitomo's
claims.

Stanford University and Litton Systems.

In October 2000, the Board of Trustees of Stanford University and Litton
Systems filed a patent suit in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California against Corning and other optical amplifier makers for alleged infringement of a patent relating to
optical amplifiers. The suit requested unspecified damages and an injunction preventing sales of infringing products. The suit was settled in December 2000 and Litton has granted a license to Corning.

Quest Diagnostics.

Government Investigations and Related Claims.

On
December 31, 1996, Corning completed the spin-off of its health care services businesses by the distribution to its shareholders of the Common Stock of Quest Diagnostics Incorporated (Quest
Diagnostics) and Covance Inc. (Covance). In connection with these distributions, Quest Diagnostics assumed financial responsibility for the liabilities related to the contract research business.
Corning agreed to indemnify Quest Diagnostics against all monetary penalties, fines or settlements for any governmental claims arising out of alleged violations of applicable federal fraud and health
care statutes and relating to billing practices of Quest Diagnostics and its predecessors that were pending at December 31, 1996. Corning also agreed to indemnify Quest Diagnostics for 50% of the
aggregate of all judgment or settlement payments made by Quest Diagnostics that are in excess of $42 million in respect of claims by private parties (i.e., nongovernmental parties such as private
insurers) that relate to indemnified or previously settled governmental claims and that allege over billings by Quest Diagnostics, or any existing subsidiaries of Quest Diagnostics, for services
provided prior to December 31, 1996;

provided, however,

such indemnification is not to exceed $25 million in the aggregate and that all amounts
indemnified against by Corning for the benefit of Quest Diagnostics are to be calculated on a net after-tax basis. Such share of judgments or settlement payments does not cover (i) any governmental
claims that arise after December 31, 1996 pursuant to service of subpoena or other notice of such investigation after December 31, 1996, (ii) any nongovernmental claims unrelated to the indemnified
governmental claims or investigations, (iii) any nongovernmental claims not settled prior to December 31, 2001, (iv) any consequential or incidental damages relating to the billing claims, including
losses of revenues and profits as a consequence of exclusion for participation in federal or state health care programs or (v) the fees and expenses of litigation. Quest Diagnostics settled a
significant matter with


the Department of Justice late in 2000, requiring Corning to reimburse $9 million to Quest Diagnostics. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2000 Corning released reserves totaling $12.5 million
after tax that were in excess of the indemnified settlement between Quest Diagnostics and the Department of Justice.

Pittsburgh Corning Corporation.

Corning and PPG Industries, Inc. each own 50% of the capital stock of Pittsburgh
Corning Corporation (PCC). PCC and several other defendants have been named in numerous lawsuits involving claims alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos. As of the bankruptcy filing on
April 16, 2000, PCC had in excess of 240,000 open claims. In the first quarter of 2000, after incurring adverse verdicts in five trials involving 19 claimants, PCC filed for Chapter 11 reorganization
in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. At the time of its Chapter 11 filing, PCC sought and obtained a temporary restraining order and filed a motion for a
preliminary injunction against the prosecution of asbestos actions against its two shareholders. The preliminary injunction has been extended by stipulation of the parties and by court order to May
21, 2001 to enable the parties to negotiate a plan of reorganization for PCC. Upon expiration of the injunction on or after May 21, 2001, PCC, PPG Industries and Corning will have 90 days to seek
removal and transfer of stayed cases that have not been resolved through a plan of
reorganization. As a result of PCC's bankruptcy filing, Corning recorded an after tax charge of $36.3 million in the first quarter of 2000 to impair its entire investment in PCC and discontinued
recognition of equity earnings. At the time PCC filed for bankruptcy protection, there were approximately 12,400 claims pending against Corning alleging various theories of liability based on exposure
to PCC's asbestos products, all of which are stayed pursuant to the injunction of the bankruptcy court. Before PCC filed for bankruptcy protection, Corning was dismissed from similar claims as cases
against PCC proceeded to trial. The Chapter 11 filing may lead to additional claims against Corning with related costs of defense, charges and expenses. Although the outcome of litigation and the
bankruptcy case is uncertain, management believes that the separate corporate status of PCC will continue to be upheld. Management is continuing to investigate Corning's options for defending claims
against it, which might include vigorously defending itself on all fronts or exploring a global settlement through the bankruptcy process. The range of cost for these options (net of insurance) cannot
be estimated at this time, although management believes these matters will be resolved without a materially adverse impact on Corning's financial position.

Astrium.

In December 2000, Astrium, SAS and Astrium, Ltd. filed a complaint for negligence in the United States
District Court for the Central District of California against TRW, Inc., Pilkington Optronics Inc., Corning NetOptix, Inc., OFC Corporation and Optical Filter Corporation claiming damages in excess of
$150 million. The complaint alleges that certain cover glasses for solar arrays used to generate electricity from solar energy on satellites sold by Astrium's corporate successor were negligently
coated by NetOptix or its subsidiaries (prior to Corning's acquisition of NetOptix) in such a way that the amount of electricity the satellite can produce and their effective life were materially
reduced. Corning has denied that the coatings produced by NetOptix or its subsidiaries caused the damage alleged in the complaint or that it is legally liable for any damages which Astrium may have
experienced. No depositions or formal discovery have yet been taken and it is too early to form a definitive opinion about the outcome of the litigation. Based upon the information developed to date
and recognizing that the outcome of litigation is uncertain, management believes that there are good defenses to these claims and believes they will be resolved without material impact on Corning's
financial statements.

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Corning's financial performance in 2000 was strong as the company recorded sales at $7.1 billion, the highest sales ever in its 149-year history. In 2000,
Corning continued its strategy of growth through research and development, capacity expansion, new product development in key growth markets and acquisitions. Corning also saw the results of past
investments in acquisitions, capital expenditures and research and development begin to contribute to 2000 earnings.

Overall,
Corning reported robust results in 2000 as each of its three segments experienced sales growth over 1999 which was also a very strong year. Sales growth in 2000 was most
pronounced in the Telecommunications Segment where demand for Corning's premium fiber, cable and photonic products, driven by the growth of the Internet, and the impact of acquisitions generated high
double-digit growth. The Telecommunications and Information Display Segments demonstrated strong earnings performances in 2000 as both segments more than doubled their 1999 earnings.

Business Combinations

In 2000, Corning completed 12 strategic business combinations valued at approximately $10 billion within the Telecommunications Segment, including the pooling
of interests with Oak Industries, Inc. (Oak) in January 2000. The largest purchases closed in the year included:

•

the
acquisition of Pirelli S.p.A.'s (90%) and Cisco Systems Inc.'s (10%) optical components and devices business (Pirelli acquisition),

•

the
acquisition of NetOptix Corporation, a manufacturer of thin film filters for use in dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) components,

•

the
acquisition of Siemens AG's worldwide optical fiber and cable systems and equipment business, including its 50% ownership in Siecor Corporation and
Siecor GmbH (Siemens transaction).

Each
of these transactions supports Corning's strategic growth initiatives in the Telecommunications Segment and also strengthens and broadens Corning's portfolio of businesses. See
Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on business combinations for 2000, 1999 and 1998.

Allocation
of the purchase price of the acquisitions resulted in charges related to purchased in-process research and development (IPRD) in certain acquisitions. Further discussion
regarding these charges is included on page 26.

Capital Expenditures

In 2000, Corning committed $1.7 billion in capital spending, more than double any other year in its history. The capital spending plan for 2001 will
approximate $2.5 billion. Corning's 2000 and 2001


spending concentrates on key growth prospects in optical fiber and cable, photonics and the display technologies businesses. Significant capital expenditures in 2000 were as follows:

•

$610
million to expand capacity for optical fiber and cable,

•

$295
million to expand capacity of liquid crystal display glass,

•

$265
million to expand capacity in photonics.

Research and Development

Corning's growth strategy is not solely dependent upon acquisitions, but also calls for a continuous commitment to internal growth through research and
development. Corning's dedication to excellence through research and development was evidenced in 2000 as Corning spent an unprecedented $540 million. Corning anticipates increasing research and
development to more than $700 million in 2001. In 2000 Corning introduced the following main products resulting from its discovery efforts:

•

MetroCor™,
a premium fiber solution for optical communications in the metropolitan marketplace.

•

Corning
microarray products for applications in human genome research.

•

EAGLE


,
fusion formed glass for applications in the liquid crystal display business.

•

PurePath™,
optical switches for wavelength division multiplexing systems in the optical networking business.

Outlook

Looking forward to 2001, Corning will continue to invest in new product development, capacity expansion and external growth. Corning expects its sales will
grow by 20% to 25% and that each segment's net income will show double-digit growth.

Other

The consolidated financial statements presented for 1999 and 1998 have been restated to include the financial position and results of operations of Oak to
reflect the pooling of interests accounting used in the Oak merger consummated on January 28, 2000.

All
share and per share amounts have been restated to reflect the three-for-one stock split of Corning common stock that became effective October 3, 2000.

RESULTS OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS

Consolidated sales in 2000 were $7.1 billion, a 50% increase over 1999. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, Corning's consolidated sales in 2000 increased
36% over 1999. In 1999, consolidated sales totaled $4.7 billion, a 24% increase over 1998. Strong demand for Corning's new premium fiber, cable and photonics products and the impact of acquisitions
contributed to the overall sales growth. Sales growth for 2000 was most pronounced in the Telecommunications Segment where the impact of acquisitions and demand for Corning's premium fiber, cable and
photonics products drove year over year sales growth of 73%. Excluding acquisitions, sales in Telecommunications grew 50% over 1999.

Corning's
income from continuing operations totaled $409.5 million in 2000, a decrease compared to $511.0 million in 1999, primarily due to substantial non-cash acquisition-related
charges. Income from continuing operations increased 44% from $354.8 million in 1998, a year in which results were adversely impacted by economic factors in Asia, to $511.0 million in 1999. Diluted
earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.46 per share in 2000 compared to $0.65 per share in 1999. In 1999,


diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 37% from $0.47 per share in 1998 to $0.65 per share.

Corning's
2000, 1999 and 1998 results were impacted by significant nonrecurring items including gains and losses on the disposition and restructuring of businesses, IPRD charges,
other acquisition-related charges and impairment losses. In addition, as a result of its acquisition strategy, Corning began to record significant amounts of amortization of purchased intangibles and
goodwill in 2000. These amounts will increase in 2001 as a result of transactions completed throughout 2000.

Corning
believes a better understanding of the changes in its operating results is provided by comparing its operating results on a pro forma basis excluding amortization of purchased
intangibles and goodwill, purchased IPRD costs, one-time acquisition costs and nonrecurring items. This measure is not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting
principles (GAAP) and may not be consistent with measures used by other companies. It should be considered supplemental data.

Pro
forma net income in 2000 totaled $1.1 billion and pro forma earnings per share was $1.23, an increase of 108% and 84%, respectively, over 1999. Pro forma net income in 1999 was
$524.7 million, or $0.67 per share, an increase of 32% and 26%, respectively, over 1998. Corning calculates pro forma net income from net income from continuing operations as follows (after tax and in
millions):

OPERATING SEGMENTS

Corning groups its products into three operating segments: Telecommunications, Advanced Materials and Information Display. Corning also includes the earnings
of equity affiliates that are closely associated with Corning's operating segments in segment net income. Information about the performance of Corning's operating segments is presented below. Segment
amounts exclude revenues, expenses and equity earnings not specifically identifiable to segments. In the first quarter of 2000, Corning changed the performance measurement of its operating segments to
a new metric—segment net income excluding amortization of purchased intangibles and goodwill, purchased IPRD costs, one-time acquisition costs and other nonrecurring items. This measure is
not in accordance with GAAP and may not be consistent with measures used by other companies. The segment results for 1999 and 1998 have been restated to conform to the new measure.

Corning
prepared the financial results for its three operating segments on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which Corning management internally disaggregates financial
information to assist in making internal operating decisions. Corning has allocated some common expenses among segments differently than it would for stand alone financial information prepared in
accordance with GAAP. The


nonrecurring items noted above are excluded from segment net income, but are described more fully in Non-Segment Results.

The
Telecommunications Segment produces optical fiber and cable, optical hardware and equipment, photonic modules and components and optical networking devices for the worldwide
telecommunications industry.

2000 vs. 1999

Sales in the Telecommunications Segment increased 73% over 1999 to $5.1 billion. Excluding acquisitions, sales growth was 50%. The sales growth in the segment
was led primarily by volume gains in the optical fiber and cable business, hardware and equipment and photonic technologies businesses. Segment net income more than doubled in 2000 compared to 1999.
The percentage increase in segment net income exceeds the increase in sales, reflecting an overall increase in segment gross margin percentage and a decrease in research, development and engineering
as a percentage of sales.

Sales
in the optical fiber and cable business in 2000 increased approximately 70% over 1999 to approximately $2.9 billion. The increase in sales resulted chiefly from the impact of
acquisitions and strong volume gains for LEAF® optical fiber. Volume growth continues to be driven by regional, local and long-haul telephone companies and cable television operators,
including significant European carriers benefiting from continued deregulation of the telecommunications industry throughout Europe. Approximately $460 million of the increase in optical fiber and
cable sales primarily resulted from the following acquisitions:

•

the
acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in Siecor GmbH and the cabling business previously owned by Siemens in the first quarter of 2000,

•

the
acquisition of the optical cable business from BICC, plc and the remaining 50% interest in Optical Waveguides Australia, Pty. Ltd. in the second
quarter of 1999.

Excluding
the impact of these acquisitions, sales in the optical fiber and cable business increased 42% for the year principally due to volume gains of almost 50%, reflecting
continued strong demand for Corning's premium fiber products. Volume of premium fiber and cable products, including Corning's LEAF optical fiber, more than doubled over the same period in 1999. Price
declines ranged between 5% and 10% for Corning's optical fiber and cable products in comparison with last year. The weighted-average optical fiber and cable price in 2000 remained relatively stable
compared to 1999. The rate of price declines for cabled products slowed throughout 2000 commensurate with the worldwide tightening of supply of optical fiber.


As a result of continued strong worldwide demand for optical fiber and cable, Corning continued to produce at maximum manufacturing capacity and invest capital to further expand
capacity. The following optical fiber capacity expansion announcements were made in 2000 (approximate amounts):

•

In
December, Corning announced plans to invest in a new optical fiber manufacturing facility in Oklahoma City, OK with construction to begin in 2001 and
production to start in 2004. In February 2001, Corning's board of directors approved a $400 million investment for the project.

•

In
December, Corning announced plans to invest an additional $450 million in its Concord, NC facility creating the largest optical fiber plant in the world
by 2004.

•

In
September, Corning announced plans to upgrade and expand its Deeside, North Wales facility by investing $50 million. This investment will increase
capacity for the optical fiber manufacturing facility by over 50%.

•

In
February, Corning announced a $750 million expansion of its Concord and Wilmington, NC fiber production facilities which are expected to come on-line in
late 2001 and 2002.

The
effect of all the expansions announced in 2000 will permit Corning to increase its manufacturing capacity for optical fiber 20% in 2001 and at least 25% per year from 2002 to
2004.

Net
income from the optical fiber and cable business increased approximately 84% in 2000 compared to 1999. The strong earnings performance is due to volume growth in high-data rate
products, relatively stable pricing and a shift to a higher premium product mix.

Sales
in the telecommunications hardware and equipment business, including the Gilbert Connectors business acquired in the Oak merger, increased over 82% in 2000 to approximately
$1.02 billion. This increase resulted from a higher volume of existing products, the Siemens transaction and particularly strong demand from cable television customers, offset in part by price
declines. Excluding acquisitions, sales increased 57% over 1999. Overall net income almost doubled over 1999 largely due to volume increases.

The
photonic technologies business, including the Lasertron business acquired in the Oak merger, manufactures photonic modules and components primarily for the optical amplification
market. Sales in this business more than doubled over 1999 to approximately $970 million. The business realized strong volume gains in 2000 led by new product sales, growth in amplifier sales and
acquisitions. The operating performance in this business improved in 2000 as the business became solidly profitable due to strong volume, productivity gains and more cost efficient access to pump
lasers achieved through the acquisition of Lasertron. Corning continues to invest heavily in research and development in this business.

Photonic
technologies is an integral part of Corning's capital spending plan. Corning is investing significant capital to support the business and in early 2001 and 2000 announced the
following capital expansion plans (approximate amounts):

•

In
February 2001, Corning announced plans to invest $150 million at Optical Technologies in Milan, Italy to increase capacity of the business purchased
from Pirelli.

•

In
December, Corning announced plans to invest $150 million at Benton Park, PA effectively increasing capacity of amplifier modules by 50% and dispersion
compensation modules over 200%.

•

In
August, Corning announced plans to invest $80 million in constructing a new passive components manufacturing facility in Henrietta, NY. The investment
will double production of fiber-based passive components and is expected to begin production in early 2001.


•

In
July, Corning announced a $225 million expansion of Corning Lasertron in Nashua, NH that combined with the $45 million expansion announced in April 2000
will increase the existing capacity of Corning Lasertron products by six times over the next two years.

•

In
June, Corning announced a $50 million investment in its Erwin, NY facility to bolster capacity for photonic modules.

•

In
April, Corning announced a $50 million investment for the addition of a second amplifier assembly plant in Benton Park, PA. Startup production began in
the third quarter with initial shipments in early October. This expansion will more than double Corning's module and amplifier manufacturing capacity.

•

In
February, Corning and Samsung Electronics announced the formation of an equity-venture to mass produce micro optic products. Samsung Corning
Micro-Optics will manufacture DWDM packaged components. In June, Corning and Samsung Electronics announced the approval of a $110 million capacity expansion in the equity-venture that will quadruple
its production of DWDM components.

During
the third quarter of 2000, the optical networking business which designs and manufactures wavelength management products and optical switch modules, began shipments of its
wavelength management products to customers. Sales for 2000 were approximately $10 million. This business operated at a loss due to significant research and development investments. In August, Corning
announced plans to invest $20 million to increase its capacity for the manufacture of wavelength management products. This investment will increase capacity of PurePath products by six times and is
expected to become operational in the third quarter of 2001.

The
other business in this segment is the Controls and Connectors business acquired in the Oak merger. This business manufactures control systems, switches, and encoders and also
designs and manufactures devices used in wireless, wireline and fiber-optic applications. Sales in this business increased 14% in 2000 to approximately $240 million. Net income from this business
improved slightly, moving from breakeven in 1999 to modest profitability in 2000, primarily due to volume increases.

Sales
to Corning's largest customer accounted for approximately 12% of the Telecommunications Segment sales in 2000, including a significant portion of total sales in the photonic
technologies business. Sales to this customer in 1999 were approximately 11% of the Telecommunication Segment sales.

1999 vs. 1998

Sales in the Telecommunications Segment increased 38% over 1998 to approximately $3.0 billion. The sales growth in the segment was led primarily by volume
gains in the optical fiber and cable and photonic technologies businesses. Segment net income rose 24% in 1999 compared to 1998. The percentage increase in net income is lower than that of sales
because of planned higher research and development spending and an increased volume of lower margin products.

Sales
in the optical fiber and cable business in 1999 increased 45% over 1998 to approximately $1.7 billion. The increase in sales resulted primarily from the impact of acquisitions
and volume gains. Approximately $220 million of the increase in optical fiber and cable sales resulted from the following acquisitions:

•

the
acquisition of the optical cable business from BICC, plc and the remaining 50% interest in Optical Waveguides Australia, Pty. Ltd. in the second
quarter of 1999,

•

the
acquisition of Optical Fibres in December 1998.


Excluding
the impact of these acquisitions, sales in the optical fiber and cable business increased approximately 38% for the year due to volume gains of approximately 40%, reflecting
continued strong demand for Corning's premium fiber products. Volume growth continues to be driven by regional, local and long-haul telephone companies and cable television operators, including large
European carriers. These operators and carriers are installing optical fiber and adding new services to increase network capacity, as well as reducing operating costs. Volume of premium fiber and
cable products, including Corning's new LEAF optical fiber, tripled over the same period in 1998. Price declines ranged between 10% and 20% for Corning's optical fiber and cable products in comparison
with 1998. However, the weighted-average optical fiber and cable price in 1999 declined approximately 5% compared to 1998, due to the higher mix of premium product sales. The rate of price declines
slowed during the second half of 1999 commensurate with the worldwide tightening of supply of optical fiber.

Net
income from the optical fiber and cable business increased more than 30% in 1999 compared to 1998. The percentage increase in net income is lower than that of sales because of
increased volume of lower margin products, start-up costs incurred at the Concord facility and lower equity earnings.

Sales
in the telecommunications hardware and equipment business increased 17% in 1999 to approximately $560 million. This increase resulted primarily from a higher volume of existing
products and particularly strong demand from cable television customers, offset in part by price declines. Overall net income increased only 7%, as increased volume was offset by lower margins due to
price declines.

The
photonic technologies business realized strong volume gains throughout 1999 led by new product sales. Sales in this business increased 64% in 1999 to approximately $475 million
compared to 1998
sales of approximately $295 million. The operating performance in this business improved substantially in 1999 as a result of manufacturing efficiencies and cost reductions. Due to continued
investment in research and development, this business incurred a loss; however, the overall results improved approximately 30% in comparison to 1998.

Corning
continues to invest significantly in the research and development of future technologies, including spending on products within the optical switching market. Corning invested
approximately $30 million in 1999 on these products.

The
other business in this segment, the controls and connectors business, reported a sales increase of 23% in 1999 to approximately $210 million. The increase was primarily a result
of the addition of sales from Tele Quarz, which was acquired in the fourth quarter of 1998. Excluding this acquisition, sales increased by 5%. Net income from these businesses declined 84%, primarily
due to costs associated with the reorganization of the business' North American operations and the inclusion of the results of Tele Quarz, whose products sell at lower margins.

Outlook:

Sales in the Telecommunications Segment are expected to trend upward by approximately 25% in 2001, led by the
following factors:

•

the
continued demand for Corning's cabled premium fiber products, including LEAF and MetroCor,

•

growth
in demand for Corning's photonic technology devices, particularly from new products and customers,

•

full
year contributions from acquisitions completed in 2000 including the Pirelli acquisition, the Siemens transaction, NetOptix, NZ Applied Technologies
(NZAT) and IntelliSense Corporation.

In
early 2001, several customers in both the optical fiber and photonic technologies businesses announced that their order rate may be lower than expected. In addition, capital
availability issues have caused the overall telecommunications market to soften. Corning has implemented a process to allocate fiber volume to previously unmet customer needs and has plans to add new
customers and control spending to mitigate the impact of market softness.


Segment net income is expected to continue its double-digit growth as sales gains, cost reductions in optical fiber and cable and photonics products, and the elimination of
integration costs related to the Siemens transaction should more than offset increased research and development spending and capacity expansion related costs.

The
Advanced Materials Segment manufactures specialized products with unique applications utilizing glass, glass ceramic and polymer technologies.

2000 vs. 1999

Sales in the Advanced Materials Segment increased 3% in comparison to 1999 to approximately $1.1 billion, chiefly due to growth in the semiconductor materials
business and the environmental technologies business, which more than offset sales declines due to the divestiture of the Quanterra business in January 2000. Excluding the impact of the divestiture,
sales improved almost 10%. Segment net income remained relatively flat in 2000 in comparison to last year as net income gains in most businesses were offset by losses in the life sciences business and
flat equity earnings.

Sales
in the environmental technologies business, the largest business in the segment and a manufacturer of catalytic converter substrates, increased almost 3% over 1999 to
approximately $410 million. The growth in sales resulted from a strong worldwide automotive market in 2000 and increased market penetration of Corning's thin-wall products coupled with increases in
the base substrate business that was partially offset by the weak Euro. Earnings in this business decreased approximately 12%, principally due to start-up costs of new plants in South Africa and China
and elevated research and development spending on diesel substrate programs. South Africa began to ship products in September and China is expected to start shipments in 2001.

Sales
in the life sciences business, a supplier of advanced microplates, high-density microarrays and other laboratory products, of approximately $250 million were down over 6% in
comparison to 1999 as the business continues to see a shift in spending in the pharmaceutical industry from traditional products to genomics. The business reported a small loss in 2000 compared to a
small profit in 1999. The loss was primarily due to an increased commitment to research and development and marketing costs associated with the launch of Corning's microarray technology products in
the third quarter of 2000. Excluding start-up costs related to microarrays, earnings were flat compared to 1999.

Sales
in Corning's other Advanced Materials businesses, including semiconductor materials and ophthalmic products, increased over 9% from 1999 to approximately $425 million. This
increase was led by elevated sales of high purity fused silica products in the semiconductor materials business which more than offset the impact of the divestiture of Quanterra in January. Excluding
the divestiture of Quanterra, sales improved over 32%. Earnings from these businesses more than doubled over 1999 due


largely to increased volume and despite flat performances from Eurokera and Keraglass, S.N.C., French based manufacturers of glass ceramic cooktops.

1999 vs. 1998

Sales in the Advanced Materials Segment increased 3% in comparison to 1998 to approximately $1.1 billion, primarily due to growth in the environmental
technologies business, offset by lower sales in the ophthalmic business. Segment net income increased 20% in 1999 in comparison to the prior year. This significant increase resulted from sales gains,
as well as manufacturing efficiencies, in the environmental technologies business. Increased equity earnings also contributed to segment results.

Sales
in the environmental technologies business increased 12% over 1998 to approximately $400 million. The increase in sales in this business resulted primarily from the introduction
of Corning's new thin-wall ceramic substrate product and strong sales in North America. Earnings in this business increased over 30%, reflecting the strong sales gains and manufacturing efficiencies.
To meet anticipated demands for emission control products, Corning started construction on a new $80 million wholly owned manufacturing facility in China and announced plans to build a finishing
facility in South Africa.

Sales
in the life sciences business in 1999 of approximately $265 million were flat in comparison to 1998 sales reflecting the impact of divestitures in 1998 and 1999. Excluding the
impact of divestitures, sales in this business increased 9% in 1999 as a result of strong volume gains in the advanced life science market. Earnings in this business decreased significantly in 1999,
primarily due to higher research and development spending on advanced life science products.

Sales
in Corning's other Advanced Materials businesses decreased 2% from 1998 to approximately $390 million. Sales of high purity fused silica products in the semiconductor materials
business continued to be impacted by softness in the semiconductor manufacturing equipment industry, particularly during the first half of the year. During the latter part of 1999, Corning brought a
portion of its manufacturing facility near Charleston, SC on-line as demand increased. Sales in the ophthalmic business in 1999 were impacted by the continued erosion in the worldwide demand for glass
optical products, due to the consumer's increased preference for plastic lenses. Earnings from the other Advanced Materials businesses remained flat in comparison to 1998, as these sales declines were
offset by increased equity earnings from Eurokera and Keraglass, S.N.C.

In
January 2000, Corning sold Quanterra Incorporated to Severn Trent Laboratories for $35 million. Concurrent with management's decision to dispose of this business, Corning
recognized an impairment loss in the third quarter of 1999 of $15.5 million ($10.0 million after tax) and a nonoperating gain of $6.8 million ($4.2 million after tax) in the first quarter of 2000.
Neither of these events are included in the results of the Advanced Materials Segment.

Outlook:

Segment sales in 2001 are expected to increase 8% to 10%. Volumes in high purity fused silica are expected to
increase. Sales of environmental technologies are expected to be flat due to the recent slowdown in the domestic automotive market. Life science products, particularly the new microarray products,
also are expected to continue to grow. Segment net income is expected to increase in 2001 reflecting these sales gains, aggressive cost reduction initiatives and the wind-down of startup


costs in environmental technologies offset in part by the continued investment in research and development spending on advanced life science products and diesel substrates.

The
Information Display Segment manufactures glass panels and funnels for televisions and CRTs (conventional video components), liquid crystal display glass for flat panel displays
(display technologies) and precision lens assemblies for projection video systems.

2000 vs. 1999

Sales in the Information Display Segment increased 28% in 2000 to approximately $895 million, primarily due to strong growth in the display technologies and
precision lens businesses. Segment net income more than doubled as did equity earnings, reflecting increased earnings in each business over 1999.

Sales
in the conventional video components business remained relatively flat in 2000 in comparison to 1999 at approximately $355 million due to slightly lower volumes offset in part
by price increases as the supply of television glass began to tighten. Earnings in this business increased 83% in comparison to 1999 primarily due to higher equity earnings, in addition to cost
reductions and the impact of volume and mix as a shift to higher premium products occurred in 2000. The increase in equity earnings reflects improved volume and stable pricing at Samsung Corning
Company Ltd. (Samsung Corning), a manufacturer based in South Korea that produces glass panels and funnels for television and display monitors.

Sales
in the display technologies business in 2000 increased 76% over 1999 to approximately $335 million. This significant increase was the result of continued strong demand for the
business' liquid crystal glass for flat panel displays, led by increased penetration into the desktop display market. Earnings in this business more than doubled compared to 1999, reflecting strong
volume gains and stable pricing. Also equity earnings from Samsung Corning Precision Glass Company Ltd. (Samsung Corning Precision), a Korean manufacturer of liquid crystal display glass, more than
doubled largely due to strong volume gains in the Korean marketplace.

The
market for flat panel displays continues to grow annually in double digits. As a result, Corning continued to produce at maximum manufacturing capacity. In 2000, capacity doubled
at Corning's facility in Japan and at Samsung Corning Precision's facility in Korea. The previously announced construction of a new finishing facility in Taiwan is on schedule to begin production in
2001. Corning invested approximately $295 million in the display technologies business in 2000 to increase capacity of liquid crystal glass.

Sales
in the precision lens business increased 32% in 2000 to over $205 million as a result of strong volume growth for projection televisions driven by demand for larger size digital
television sets


in the entertainment market sector. Earnings in this business increased 59% over 1999 primarily due to volume gains, manufacturing efficiencies and the refocusing of product lines. In October, Corning
announced a $55 million investment in this business to increase capacity of projection television assemblies by more than 60%.

During
the fourth quarter of 2000, Samsung Corning recognized a nonoperating gain of $23.4 million from the divestment of its 40% interest in Samsung Corning Precision. Corning's
$11.7 million share of this gain is excluded from segment equity earnings.

1999 vs. 1998

Sales in the Information Display Segment increased 9% in 1999 to approximately $700 million in comparison to 1998, primarily due to growth in the display
technologies business, partially offset by declines in the conventional video components business. Segment net income almost doubled, reflecting strong equity earnings and gains within the display
technologies business.

Sales
in the conventional video components business declined 6% in 1999 to approximately $355 million, primarily due to volume declines and price reductions caused by a surplus of
television glass. Earnings in this business decreased approximately 5% as the impact of volume and price declines more than offset higher equity earnings, cost reductions and the elimination of tank
repair costs incurred in the prior year. The increase in equity earnings reflects strong volume and stable pricing at Samsung Corning.

Sales
in the display technologies business in 1999 increased almost 60% compared to 1998 to approximately $190 million. This significant increase was the result of strong demand for
the business' liquid crystal glass for flat panel displays, led by increased penetration into the desktop display market. Earnings in this business increased substantially in 1999, compared to 1998,
reflecting volume gains, stable pricing and manufacturing improvements, along with significant equity earnings from Samsung Corning Precision. The increase in earnings from Samsung Corning Precision
was primarily due to strong volume gains in the Korean marketplace and favorable exchange rates.

Sales
in the precision lens business increased 8% in 1999 to approximately $155 million as a result of strong volume growth for projection televisions driven by demand for larger size
televisions in the
entertainment market sector. Earnings in this business increased approximately 25% in 1999 compared to 1998, primarily due to volume gains and manufacturing efficiencies.

Outlook:

Sales in the Information Display Segment are expected to increase by approximately 20% in 2001 and segment net
income is expected to increase by double-digit growth rates. These expected improvements are primarily led by the liquid crystal display business but with solid support from the precision lens
business. Capacity expansions will come on-line in 2001 in both businesses to meet strong anticipated demand. In addition to increased volume, cost reduction programs in each business will contribute
to the anticipated improvement in earnings.

NON-SEGMENT RESULTS

Corning's non-segment results include the operations of Steuben, a crystal manufacturer, and equity earnings from small strategic investments that are not
aligned with Corning's three operating segments. In addition, the results of operating segments do not include nonoperating gains, amortization of purchased intangibles and goodwill,
acquisition-related expenses including IPRD charges, or restructuring and impairment charges.


Nonoperating gains

In 2000, Samsung Corning recorded a fourth quarter nonoperating gain of $23.4 million from the divestment of its 40% interest in Samsung Corning Precision.
Corning's $11.7 million share of this gain is included in equity in earnings of associated companies.

In
2000, Corning recorded a first quarter nonoperating gain of $6.8 million ($4.2 million after tax) on the sale of Quanterra Incorporated to Severn Trent Laboratories for
approximately $35 million.

In
1999, Corning recorded a third quarter nonoperating gain of $30.0 million ($9.5 million after tax and minority interest) as a result of the sale by Siecor Corporation of Republic
Wire and Cable for approximately $52 million in cash and short-term notes.

In
1998, Corning recorded a second quarter nonoperating gain of $20.5 million ($13.2 million after tax) as a result of the merger between Molecular Simulations, Inc. and Pharmacopeia,
Inc. The 1998 results also include a fourth quarter nonoperating gain of $19.2 million ($9.7 million after tax) related to the divestiture of several small life sciences businesses.

Amortization of purchased intangibles and goodwill

Amortization of purchased intangibles and goodwill totaled $245.0 million ($218.4 million after tax) in 2000 compared to $27.8 million ($21.8 million after
tax) in 1999 and $22.2 million ($17.4 million after tax) in 1998. Amortization of purchased intangibles and goodwill primarily relates to purchase business combinations. See Note 2 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on purchase business combinations. Amortization of purchased intangibles and goodwill will increase in 2001 and will include charges for the
entire year related to transactions completed late in 2000.

Acquisition-related expenses

In the fourth quarter of 2000, Corning recorded a non-tax deductible IPRD charge of $322.9 million related to the Pirelli acquisition.

In
the second quarter of 2000, Corning recorded a non-tax deductible IPRD charge of $50.7 million related to the acquisitions of IntelliSense ($6.7 million) and NZAT ($44.0 million).

In
the first quarter of 2000, Corning recorded an IPRD charge of $42.0 million ($25.7 million after tax) related to the acquisition of Photonics Technology Research Center (PTRC).

In
the first quarter of 2000, Corning recorded a charge for acquisition costs related to the merger of Oak of $47.0 million ($43.4 million after tax) primarily comprised of legal and
investment banking fees.

Charges
for IPRD are described in more detail beginning on page 26.

Restructuring and impairment charges

In the first quarter of 2000, Corning discontinued recognition of equity earnings from Pittsburgh Corning Corporation (PCC) and recorded a charge to impair its
investment for $36.3 million due to PCC's decision to file for bankruptcy protection and reorganization under Chapter 11 for asbestos litigation. See page 10 for further detail.

In
the third quarter of 1999, Corning recognized an impairment charge of $15.5 million ($10.0 million after tax) in connection with management's decision to sell Quanterra
Incorporated.

In
the second quarter of 1998, Corning recorded a restructuring charge of $84.6 million ($49.2 million after tax and minority interest). The charge was comprised of early retirement
incentives


offered to certain salaried non-union employees 55 years old or older satisfying service criteria and severance costs associated with workforce reductions of other non-union employees. The
restructuring charge related to approximately 650 employees, all of whom were terminated as of June 30, 1999. Corning determined in the fourth quarter of 1999 that the total costs of the incentive
package would be less than anticipated. Consequently, Corning released restructuring reserves totaling $14.1 million ($8.6 million after tax) in the fourth quarter of 1999. All payments associated
with this program have been made at December 31, 2000. Management estimates that the annualized cost savings related to these programs is approximately $30 million per year after taxes.

TAXES

Corning's effective tax rate for continuing operations was 58.9% in 2000, 30.7% in 1999 and 31.0% in 1998. The increase in 2000 was primarily due to the large
amounts of nondeductible amortization of purchased intangibles and goodwill along with nondeductible purchased IPRD charges associated with acquisitions occurring in 2000. Excluding the impact of
these and other nonrecurring items, the effective income tax rate was 32.4% in 2000, 30.0% in 1999 and 30.8% in 1998. The higher 2000 rate in comparison to 1999 was due to a higher percentage of
Corning's earnings resulting from consolidated entities with higher effective tax rates. Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements reconciles the effective tax rate to the statutory tax
rate.

RESULTS OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

On December 31, 1996, Corning distributed shares of Quest Diagnostics Incorporated and Covance Inc., which collectively comprised Corning's Health Care
Services Segment, to its shareholders on a pro rata basis (the Distributions). Corning agreed to indemnify Quest Diagnostics on an after-tax basis for the settlement of certain government claims and
against certain other claims that were pending at December 31, 1996. Coincident with the Distributions, Corning recorded a payable to Quest Diagnostics of approximately $25 million, which was
management's best estimate of amounts which were probable of being paid by Corning to Quest Diagnostics to satisfy the remaining indemnified claims on an after-tax basis. Quest Diagnostics settled a
significant matter with the Department of Justice late in 2000 requiring Corning to reimburse Quest Diagnostics $9 million. As a result, in the fourth quarter Corning released reserves totaling $12.5
million after tax in excess of the indemnified settlement between Quest Diagnostics and the Department of Justice.

On
April 1, 1998, Corning completed the recapitalization and sale of a controlling interest in its consumer housewares business (the Consumer transaction). Corning's Consolidated
Financial Statements report the consumer housewares business as discontinued operations.

Results
of discontinued operations in 1999 and 1998 pertain to the consumer housewares business and include operating results through March 31, 1998. During the fourth quarter of
1999, certain indemnification agreements related to this transaction expired. As a result, Corning recorded income from discontinued operations in 1999 of $4.8 million after tax from the release of
reserves provided at the date of the transaction. Income from discontinued operations in 1998 totaled $66.5 million and included an after-tax gain from the transaction of $67.1 million recognized in
the second quarter.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Corning's working capital increased from $430.2 million at the end of 1999 to $2,685.7 million at the end of 2000. The ratio of current assets to current
liabilities was 2.4 at the end of 2000 compared to 1.3 at the end of 1999. The increase in working capital is due primarily to financing transactions, higher accounts receivable and inventory balances
and a reduction in short term debt. Corning's long-term debt as a percentage of total capital decreased from 35% at year-end 1999 to 27% at the end of


2000. The decrease is largely due to equity offerings totaling 79.35 million shares and over 90 million shares issued in business combinations during 2000.

Corning
has ready access to capital markets and issues stock and debt from time to time to fund its growth. In 2000, Corning completed the following significant financing
transactions:

•

In
November, Corning issued 34.5 million shares of Corning common stock to generate net proceeds of approximately $2.4 billion.

•

In
November, Corning offered $2.7 billion of senior unsecured zero coupon convertible debentures due in 2015. The net proceeds from the debentures
approximated $2 billion.

A
portion of the proceeds from both November offerings were used to finance the approximate $3.6 billion cash portion of the Pirelli acquisition in December 2000. The remaining
proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes.

•

In
January 2000, Corning issued 44.85 million shares of Corning common stock to generate net proceeds of approximately $2.2 billion.

•

In
February 2000, Corning completed an offering of 500 million Euro-denominated securities which generated net proceeds of approximately $485 million.

A
portion of the proceeds from both the January and February financing transactions were used to fund the Siemens acquisition, repay debt assumed in the merger with Oak and satisfy
all of Corning's outstanding commercial paper obligations.

Also
in support of Corning's growth strategy and to enhance its financial flexibility, in August 2000, Corning renegotiated a revolving line of credit totaling $2 billion, which
expires August 17, 2005. As of December 31, 2000 there were no borrowings under the facility.

Corning
filed a $4 billion global shelf registration statement in August 2000 that was later amended to $4.8 billion. The November financing transactions have substantially depleted
its capacity. Corning will file a shelf registration in the first quarter of 2001 in accordance with its policy to readily access capital markets.

Corning
believes that its financial condition is strong and that its cash, short-term investments, operating cash flows and access to equity capital markets and borrowing capacity,
taken together, provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements, future capital expenditures related to the expansion of existing businesses and external growth.

CASH FLOWS

Cash and short-term investments at the end of 2000 increased from 1999 by $1.5 billion. This increase is the result of operating and financing activities which
provided cash of $1.4 billion and $6.7 billion, respectively, offset by investing activities which used $6.6 billion of cash. Cash and short-term investments at the end of 1999 increased from 1998 by
$221.2 million. This increase is the result of operating and financing activities which provided cash of $866.9 million and $303.9 million, respectively, offset partially by investing activities which
used $932.9 million of cash.

Net
cash provided by operating activities was $1,421.2 million, $866.9 million and $682.2 million in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. The increase in net cash provided by operating
activities in 2000 primarily resulted from significant non-cash acquisition-related charges, higher depreciation and amortization of purchased intangibles and goodwill, increased tax benefits related
to stock options offset by an increase in accounts receivable and inventory. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 1999 as compared to 1998 primarily resulted from the increase
in net income from continuing operations before depreciation and amortization.


Net cash used in investing activities was $6,549.1 million, $932.9 million and $182.8 million in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. The increase in net cash used in investing
activities in 2000 was primarily attributable to increased net cash used for capital expenditures and acquisitions of businesses including the Pirelli acquisition, the Siemens transaction, Champion
Products Inc. and PTRC. The increase in net cash used in investing activities in 1999 as compared to 1998 primarily resulted from capital expenditures.

Corning
has invested significant cash in capital expansions in the last three years. Capital spending in 2000 totaled $1.7 billion, $196 million of which was unpaid at year-end and
recorded in accounts payable at December 31, 2000. Capital spending totaled $757.1 million and $730.4 million in 1999 and 1998, respectively. The high level of capital spending since 1998 relates
primarily to capacity expansions in Corning's growth businesses and expanded research and development facilities. Corning's 2001 capital spending program anticipates a requirement of approximately
$2.5 billion.

Net
cash provided by or (used in) financing activities was $6,648.2 million, $303.9 million and $(378.2) million in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. The increase in net cash
provided by financing activities was primarily due to proceeds from issuance of common stock related to two common stock offerings in 2000 and proceeds from issuance of debt generated by the offering
of Euro denominated debt and zero coupon convertible debentures. The increase in net cash provided by financing activities in 1999 from 1998 was primarily due to an increase in proceeds from issuance
of debt.

Corning
did not repurchase any of its common stock in 2000. Cash used to repurchase stock totaled $96.2 million and $74.3 million in 1999 and 1998, respectively. These amounts include
Oak's historical repurchases of its stock. Corning repurchased 4.2 million and 6.0 million shares of its common stock in 1999 and 1998, respectively.

Dividends
paid to common shareholders in 2000 totaled $210.7 million compared with $175.7 million in 1999 and $166.8 million in 1998. The increase is due to an increase in the number
of shares outstanding.

Cash
used in discontinued operations totaled $1.6 million, $12.5 million and $172.0 million in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. The high level of cash used in discontinued
operations in 1998 is primarily a result of transaction costs and tax payments related to the Consumer transaction.

IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

Corning completed a number of purchase acquisitions in 2000. As part of analyzing each of these acquisitions, Corning made a decision to buy technology that
had not yet been commercialized rather than develop the technology internally. Corning based this decision on a number of factors, including the amount of time it would take to bring the technology to
market. Corning also considered its internal research resource allocation and its progress on comparable technology, if any. Corning expects to use the same decision process in the future.

In
connection with the acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method, management is responsible for estimating the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired. Management
has made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses resulting from such acquisitions.

Amounts
allocated to purchased IPRD were established through recognized valuation techniques in the high technology communications industry. Certain projects were acquired for which
technological feasibility had not been established at the date of acquisition and for which no alternative future uses existed. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 2,
"Accounting for Research and Development Costs" as interpreted by FASB Interpretation No. 4, "Applicability of FASB Statement No. 2 to Business Combinations Accounted for by the Purchase Method,"
amounts assigned


to IPRD meeting the above criteria must be charged to expense at the date of consummation of the purchase.

The
value allocated to projects for which a charge was recorded was determined by the traditional income approach, which discounts expected future debt-free income to present value.
The discount
rates used were specific to each project and were derived from a cost of capital for each specific acquisition target, adjusted upward for the stage of completion of each project.

Expected
future debt-free income was derived with the following considerations:

•

Revenues
were estimated based on relevant market size, growth trends in the industry and individual product sales cycles.

•

Estimated
operating expenses included cost of goods sold, selling, general and administrative expenses, and research and development expenses to maintain
the products once they have been introduced.

•

Estimated
tax expenses were specific to each acquired entity and its tax profile.

•

For
certain projects, as appropriate, a return on core technology was deducted based upon market standards for licensed existing technology and a return on
assets was deducted based upon industry comparisons.

The
nature of the efforts to develop the acquired technology into commercially viable products consists principally of planning, designing and testing activities necessary to
determine that the product can meet market expectations. Corning expects that products incorporating the acquired technology from these projects will be completed and will begin to generate cash flows
over the next five years following integration.

Management
expects to continue supporting these research and development efforts. This support is not expected to change Corning's research and development expense trends. However,
the timing and success of development of these technologies remains a risk due to the remaining effort to achieve technical viability, rapidly changing customer markets, uncertain standards for new
products and significant competition in the marketplace.

The
following is a more detailed discussion of the valuations associated with acquisitions for which such charges have been recorded:

Optical Technologies USA (OTUSA)

On December 12, 2000, Corning completed the acquisition of Pirelli's optical components and devices business based in Milan, Italy. This business had
significant research and development projects ongoing at the time of the acquisition. Twelve of these projects were valued as IPRD projects. Projected debt-free income was initially discounted using a
rate of 17% to reflect the weighted-average cost of capital (entity risk) for this entity. Each product was also discounted to account for the research project's stage of development. Corning recorded
a non-tax deductible IPRD charge of $322.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2000.

Failure
to achieve the expected levels of revenue and net income from these products could negatively impact the return on investment expected at the time that the acquisition was
completed and potentially result in impairment of other assets related to this investment.


Costs to complete the in-process research programs are expected to approximate $25 million to $30 million. These projects have been categorized into four product technologies as
follows:

Lithium Niobate Modulators

OTUSA is developing a number of different lithium niobate modulators. Lithium niobate modulators are ideally suited for use in high-speed, long-haul optical
communications networks. The technology has been chosen by a majority of long-haul equipment suppliers because it has the best combination of optical, electronic and reliability performance. Five of
the research projects qualified as IPRD projects, and the completion percentages of these five projects ranged from 10%-90%. A non-tax deductible charge of $235.0 million was recognized and the value
of individual modulator projects in-process ranged from $18.8 million to $82.5 million.

Submarine Products

OTUSA's optical components and devices business is continuing to develop high reliability 980 nanometer (nm) pump laser chips and modules for submarine use.
These devices are components
within an optical amplifier. At the acquisition date, two IPRD projects with completion percentages of 10% and 50% were valued. A non-tax deductible charge of $25.6 million resulted from 980 nm pump
laser submarine projects in process. Individual research values were $2.9 million and $22.7 million.

Gratings

At the date of acquisition, three qualifying gratings programs with completion percentages ranging from 20%-85% were valued. A non-tax deductible IPRD charge
of $16.6 million resulted from gratings programs. Individual in-process projects were valued between $2.4 million and $10.6 million.

Specialty Fiber

Two specialty fiber programs at OTUSA's optical components and devices business met the definition of IPRD. Specialty fibers are used in conjunction with
several other components to make an erbium doped fiber amplifier, which boosts the strength of the optical signal. At the acquisition date, these projects were 40% and 60% complete. A non-tax
deductible IPRD charge of $45.7 million resulted from specialty fiber programs, with the largest program being valued at $42.0 million.

IntelliSense

On June 12, 2000, Corning completed the acquisition of the remaining shares of IntelliSense, a manufacturer and developer of micro-electro-mechanical systems
(MEMs), or small electro-mechanical, micro-fabricated devices. MEMs technology, when integrated with optics and packaging expertise, enables the development of optical add-drop switches and optical
cross connects, that are expected to play a key role in the development and build out of the optical networking layer. As of the acquisition date, IntelliSense had three qualifying research projects
underway. These research and development projects are anticipated to result primarily in the development of new telecommunications products. Projected debt-free income was initially discounted using a
rate of 20% to reflect the weighted-average cost of capital (entity risk) for IntelliSense. Each product was also discounted to account for the research project's stage of development. The completion
percentages ranged from 10%-90%. At the acquisition date, the projected costs to complete the IPRD programs approximated $20 million. Corning recorded a $6.7 million IPRD charge in the second quarter
of 2000. No project valued exceeded $4.5 million.

If
none of the projects are successfully completed, Corning may lose an opportunity to capitalize on emerging markets. Failure of any single project would not materially impact
Corning's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.


In all material respects, the research projects have progressed as planned at acquisition.

NZ Applied Technologies

On May 5, 2000, Corning completed the acquisition of NZAT. NZAT was developing a line of high speed, solid-state components for DWDM systems, such as variable
optical attenuators, that will meet industry demands for speed and quality. Of these projects, four were determined to meet the criteria for purchased IPRD as of the acquisition date. Projected
debt-free income was initially discounted using a rate of 21% to reflect the weighted-average cost of capital (entity risk) for NZAT. Each product was also discounted to account for the research
project's stage of development. The completion percentages ranged from 10%-80%. At the acquisition date, the projected costs to complete the IPRD programs approximated $10 million. A $44.0 million
non-tax deductible IPRD charge was recognized and the value of individual projects ranged from $0.5 million to $29.3 million.

If
none of the projects are successfully completed, Corning may lose an opportunity to capitalize on emerging markets. Failure of any single project would not materially impact
Corning's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

In
the fourth quarter of 2000, NZAT completed certain product development milestones for its variable optical attenuator products.

Photonics Technology Research Center

On February 14, 2000, Corning acquired British Telecommunication's PTRC. Located in Suffolk, UK, the PTRC had extensive research and development efforts
underway at the acquisition date including work on planar integrated optics, semiconductor optical amplifiers, electro-absorption modulators, and optical networking devices. Seven projects were
determined to meet the criteria for purchased IPRD. Projected debt-free income was determined for each of the projects and initially discounted using a rate
of 35% to reflect the weighted-average cost of capital (entity risk) for PTRC. Each product was also discounted to account for the research project's stage of development. The completion percentages
ranged from 50%-80%. At the acquisition date, the projected costs to complete the IPRD programs approximated $40 million. A $42.0 million ($25.7 million after tax) IPRD charge was recognized and the
value of individual projects ranged from $0.1 million to $16.0 million.

If
none of the projects are successfully completed, Corning may lose an opportunity to capitalize on emerging markets. Failure of any single project would not materially impact
Corning's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

Overall,
substantial progress has been made on these projects, and the assumptions used to value these projects have not substantially changed since the acquisition date.

DOW CORNING CORPORATION

Corning is a 50% owner of Dow Corning Corporation (Dow Corning), a manufacturer of silicones. The other 50% of Dow Corning is owned by The Dow Chemical Company
(Dow Chemical).

On
May 15, 1995, Dow Corning sought protection under the reorganization provisions of Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, as a result of several negative developments
related to the breast implant litigation. At that time, Corning management believed it was impossible to predict if and when Dow Corning would successfully emerge from Chapter 11 proceedings. As a
result, Corning recorded an after-tax charge of $365.5 million to fully reserve its investment in Dow Corning and discontinued recognition of equity earnings from Dow Corning in 1995. The bankruptcy
proceeding is pending in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, Northern Division (Bay City, Michigan). The bankruptcy filing stayed the prosecution against Dow
Corning of approximately 19,000 breast-implant product liability lawsuits, including 45 class actions. In the period


from December 1996 through February 1998, Dow Corning filed a plan of reorganization and two amended plans, each of which was opposed by creditor representatives. In 1998, Dow Corning and the Tort
Claimants Committee engaged in extended negotiations and reached certain compromises. On November 8, 1998, Dow Corning and the Tort Claimants Committee jointly filed a revised Plan of Reorganization
(Joint Plan). The Joint Plan and related disclosure materials were mailed to claimants for their approval. Following a favorable vote from all but four classes of creditors, a hearing to confirm the
Joint Plan was held in mid 1999.

On
November 30, 1999, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order confirming the Joint Plan and indicated that certain written opinions would follow. On December 21, 1999, the Bankruptcy
Court issued an opinion that approved the principal elements of the Joint Plan with respect to tort claimants, but construed the Joint Plan as providing releases for third parties (including Corning
and Dow Chemical as shareholders) only with respect to tort claimants who voted in favor of the Joint Plan. A number of parties opposing the Joint Plan filed appeals on a variety of grounds to the
United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. Dow Corning and the Committee of Tort Claimants filed a notice of appeal seeking review of the ruling limiting the scope of the
shareholder releases. Corning and Dow Chemical filed separate notices of appeal on this issue. On November 13, 2000, the District Court entered an Order affirming the Bankruptcy Court's November 30,
1999 Order confirming the Joint Amended Plan and reversing the Bankruptcy Court's December 21, 1999 Opinion on the release and injunction provisions. One group of plaintiffs filed a motion for
reconsideration in the District Court and the District Court entered a February 5, 2001 Opinion Denying Motion for Reconsideration, confirming that the Litigation Facility under the Joint Plan is the
defendant in place of Dow Corning, Corning and Dow Chemical, and that Corning and Dow Chemical are not named defendants for direct claims. Approximately 20 appeals were filed from the District Court's
Order and are pending in the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, which is expected to rule in the second half of 2001. After all appeals are exhausted, if the Joint Plan is upheld but the shareholder
releases are effective only for those voting in favor of the Joint Plan, Corning would expect to defend any remaining claims against it on the same grounds that led to a series of orders and judgments
dismissing all claims against Corning in the federal courts and the state courts as described under the heading Implant Tort Lawsuits (Item 3). With respect to the possibility of additional direct or
indirect claims against Corning if the full releases are not reinstated in the Joint Plan, management believes that such claims lack merit and that the breast implant litigation against Corning will
be resolved without material impact on Corning's financial statements.

Under
the terms of the Joint Plan, Dow Corning would be required to establish a Settlement Trust and a Litigation Facility to provide a means for tort claimants to settle or litigate
their claims. Dow Corning would have the obligation to fund the Trust and the Facility, over a period of up to 16 years, in an amount up to approximately $3.2 billion (nominal value), subject to the
limitations, terms and conditions stated in the Joint Plan. Dow Corning proposes to provide the required funding over the 16 year period through a combination of cash, proceeds from insurance, and
cash flow from operations. Corning and Dow Chemical have each agreed to provide a credit facility to Dow Corning of up to $150 million ($300 million in the aggregate), subject to the terms and
conditions stated in the Joint Plan. The Joint Plan also provides for Dow Corning to make full payment, through cash and the issuance of senior notes, to its commercial creditors. If and when Dow
Corning emerges from bankruptcy, Corning will likely begin to recognize equity earnings from Dow Corning. Corning does not expect to receive dividends from Dow Corning in the foreseeable future.

PITTSBURGH CORNING CORPORATION

Corning and PPG Industries, Inc. each own 50% of the capital stock of Pittsburgh Corning Corporation (PCC). PCC and several other defendants have been named in
numerous lawsuits involving claims alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos. As of the bankruptcy filing on


April 16, 2000 PCC had in excess of 240,000 open claims. In the first quarter of 2000, after incurring adverse verdicts in five trials involving 19 claimants, PCC filed for Chapter 11
reorganization in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. At the time of its Chapter 11 filing, PCC sought and obtained a temporary restraining order and filed a
motion for a preliminary injunction against the prosecution of asbestos actions against its two shareholders. The preliminary injunction has been extended by stipulation of the parties and by court
order to May 21, 2001 to enable the parties to negotiate a plan of reorganization for PCC. Upon expiration of the injunction on or after May 21, 2001, PCC, PPG Industries and Corning will have 90 days
to seek removal and transfer of stayed cases that have not been resolved through a plan of reorganization. As a result of PCC's bankruptcy filing, Corning recorded an after-tax charge of $36.3 million
in the first quarter of 2000 to impair its entire investment in PCC and discontinued recognition of equity earnings. At the time PCC filed for bankruptcy protection, there were approximately 12,400
claims pending against Corning alleging various theories of liability based on exposure to PCC's asbestos products, all of which are stayed pursuant to the injunction of the bankruptcy court. Before
PCC filed for bankruptcy protection, Corning was dismissed from similar claims as cases against PCC proceeded to trial. The Chapter 11 filing may lead to additional claims against Corning with related
costs of defense, charges and expenses. Although the outcome of litigation and the bankruptcy case is uncertain, management believes that the separate corporate status of PCC will continue to be
upheld. Management is continuing to investigate Corning's options for defending claims against it, which might include vigorously defending itself on all fronts or exploring a global settlement
through the bankruptcy process. The range of cost for these options (net of insurance) cannot be estimated at this time, although management believes these matters will be resolved without a
materially adverse impact on Corning's financial position.

ENVIRONMENT

Corning has been named by the Environmental Protection Agency under the Superfund Act, or by state governments under similar state laws, as a potentially
responsible party for 11 active hazardous waste sites. Under the Superfund Act, all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site, identified by such Agency, are jointly and
severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the Agency agrees otherwise. It is Corning's policy to accrue for its estimated liability related to Superfund sites and other environmental liabilities
related to property owned and operated by Corning based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants. Corning has accrued approximately $17.1 million for its
estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation at December 31, 2000. Based upon the information developed to date, management believes that the
accrued reserve is a reasonable estimate of Corning's estimated liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote.

EFFECTS OF INFLATION

Amounts reflected in the financial statements do not provide for the effect of inflation on operations or financial position. The expenses and asset values,
specifically those related to long-lived assets, reflect historical cost and do not necessarily represent replacement cost or charges to operations based on replacement cost. Corning's operations
provide funds which, along with other sources, are sufficient to replace fixed assets as necessary. Net income would be lower than reported if the effects of inflation were reflected by charging
operations for replacement costs.

MARKET RISK DISCLOSURES

Corning operates and conducts business in many foreign countries and as a result is exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Corning's exposure
to exchange rate effects includes:

•

Exchange
rate movements on financial instruments and transactions denominated in foreign currencies which impact earnings.


•

Exchange
rate movements upon conversion of net assets in foreign subsidiaries for which the functional currency is not the U.S Dollar which impact
Corning's net equity.

Corning's
most significant foreign currency exposures relate to Japan, Korea and Western European countries. Corning selectively enters into foreign exchange forward and option
contracts with durations generally 12 months or less to hedge its exposure to exchange rate risk on foreign source income and purchases. The hedges are scheduled to mature coincident with the timing
of the underlying foreign currency commitments and transactions. The objective of these contracts is to neutralize the impact of exchange rate movements on Corning's operating results. Corning also
enters into foreign exchange forward contracts when situations arise where its foreign subsidiaries or Corning Incorporated enter into lending situations, generally on an intercompany basis,
denominated in currencies other than their local currency. Corning does not hold or issue any derivative contracts that hedge its foreign currency
denominated net asset exposures. In addition, prior to July 2000 one of Corning's subsidiaries entered into revenue sales contracts for certain of its revenues generated in foreign currencies. Such
contracts were not subject to foreign currency gains or losses. Corning does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

Equity
in earnings of associated companies represented 36% of Corning's income from continuing operations in 2000. Excluding PCC, foreign-based affiliates comprised 100% of this
amount. Exchange rate fluctuations and actions taken by management of these entities to reduce this risk can affect the earnings of these companies.

Corning
uses a sensitivity analysis to assess the market risk associated with its foreign currency exchange risk. Market risk is defined as the potential change in fair value of
assets and liabilities resulting from an adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates. At December 31, 2000, Corning and its consolidated subsidiaries had open forward contracts, open option
contracts, foreign denominated debt and foreign cash and cash equivalent holdings with values exposed to exchange rate movements, all of which were designated as hedges at December 31, 2000. A 10%
adverse movement in quoted foreign currency exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of $86 million.

The
nature of Corning's foreign exchange rate risk exposures have not changed materially from December 31, 1999, however Corning's acquisition activity has expanded its presence in
international markets and thus increased the degree of its exposures overall.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission staff released Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements" (SAB
101), which provides guidance on the recognition, presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements. In June 2000, the implementation of SAB 101 was delayed until the end of 2000. Corning
was required to comply with SAB 101 in the fourth quarter of 2000 (retroactive to January 1, 2000). Corning's revenue recognition policy was in compliance with this guidance and as a result, SAB 101
had no effect on Corning's financial position or results of operations.

In
June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" (FAS 133), which establishes accounting
and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities. FAS 133 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial
position and measure those
instruments at fair value. In June 2000, the FASB issued Statement No. 138, "Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities" (FAS 138), an amendment of FAS 133. These
amendments include allowing foreign-currency denominated assets and liabilities to qualify for hedge accounting, permit the offsetting of certain inter-entity foreign currency exposures that reduce
the need for third party derivatives, redefines the nature of interest rate risk to avoid sources of


ineffectiveness and excludes from applicability any contract that would otherwise meet the definition of a derivative but provide for the purchase or sale of nonfinancial assets that will be delivered
in quantities expected to be used or sold by the reporting entity over a reasonable period in the normal course of business and/or which physical delivery is probable. Corning currently enters into
derivatives in the form of foreign currency hedge instruments to reduce its exposure to exchange rate risk on foreign source income and purchases. Corning will adopt FAS 133 effective on January 1,
2001. At that time, Corning will record an unrealized gain of $2.3 million to other comprehensive income to recognize at fair value all derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedging instruments
at adoption. FAS 133 will have no effect on results of operations at the date of adoption.

of Raytheon Aircraft Company. He became chief executive officer and chairman of Raytheon Aircraft Company and executive vice president of Raytheon Company in 2000. From 1996 to 1999, he served as
president of Pratt & Whitney's Large Military Engines Group. From 1980 to 1996 he held a variety of positions at United Technologies Corp. including executive vice president of aircraft products.

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance

Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires Corning's directors and certain of its officers to file reports of their ownership of Corning
Common Stock and of changes in such ownership with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York Stock Exchange. Regulations also
require Corning to identify in this proxy statement any person subject to this requirement who failed to file any such report on a timely basis.

To
Corning's knowledge, based solely on its review of the copies of such reports furnished to Corning and written representations that no other reports were required, during the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2000, all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to its officers, directors and greater than ten-percent beneficial owners were met.


Item 11. Management Remuneration and Transactions

Report of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors on Executive Compensation

The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, composed entirely of non-employee directors, provides oversight for executive compensation at Corning.
The Compensation Committee reviews and recommends executive compensation levels, cash and equity incentives for executive officers and reports such recommendations to the Board for its consideration
and action. The following is the Committee's report.

Compensation Philosophy

The Committee believes that executive compensation should be based on objective measures of performance at the individual, corporate and applicable business
unit level, should be driven primarily by the long term interests of the shareholders and should be directly linked to corporate performance.

The
Committee further believes that competitive compensation offerings (within the many businesses that Corning operates) is a critical element of Corning's success in attracting,
developing and retaining its key executive, managerial and technical talent.

As
the markets in which Corning operates and recruits talent have changed dramatically over the last several years, so has Corning's approach to the compensation and retention of
talent. Corning is committed to providing meaningful incentives and resultant rewards to employees at all levels who are successful in delivering the long-term growth and results required to achieve
business goals and deliver sustained superior returns in shareholder value. Corning's compensation programs, along with other strong succession planning and human resource planning processes, have
been modified to ensure that Corning does not lose key members of its high performance management team.

Compensation Strategy

The Committee's basic strategic compensation principles are as follows:

•

Reward Performance

: Executive compensation will reward performance and contribution to shareholder value
and be competitive with positions of similar responsibility at other companies of comparable complexity and size, or which compete with Corning.

•

Variable Pay:

As employees assume greater responsibilities and have greater opportunity to increase
shareholder value, a greater share of their total compensation package will be derived from variable incentive compensation (both of a long and short-term nature) generated by achievement of
objectives producing long-term growth in corporate performance.

•

Alignment with Shareholder Interest:

Stock option grants will be used to align the long-term interests of
employees with those of shareholders.

•

Ownership:

Stock ownership fosters commitment to long-term shareholder value. Employees are encouraged to
become shareholders through the design of Corning's financial-based employee benefit programs, long-term equity plans and in communications which stress the commitment to long-term value.

The
executive compensation program consists of three elements: base salary; annual cash incentives; and long-term incentives, including restricted stock and stock options. The
Committee tests annually each element of the compensation program against market surveys provided by several independent compensation consultants. These surveys currently include companies engaged in
a variety of manufacturing and service businesses that are competitive with various Corning businesses.


The Year in Review

2000 was a year of substantial change, fast-paced innovation and record success for Corning. Corning's focus on profitable growth, rooted in technology, its
customers, its processes and its people, proved to be a winning combination in 2000. All of the compensation programs reflect this strong performance in 2000. Guided by its long-term growth strategy,
Corning continued to invest for the future through both internal development and acquisitions.

The
Committee believes that executive talent is a key factor in Corning's success and has enabled Corning to differentiate itself in its major markets. The rapid deployment of new
technologies and Corning's growth prospects in many of its major markets led to a thorough reassessment of all compensation programs in 2000. During 2000, Corning developed innovative compensation
programs that stress understandable systems sufficiently flexible to meet ever-changing business needs.

Recognizing
the competitiveness of the marketplace for key talent, Corning sought and obtained shareholder approval in November 2000 for a new equity participation program. The new
program will enable Corning to grant equity incentives (primarily stock options) to more of its high-performing employees each year and to more closely align the interests of its employees with its
shareholders at all levels of the organization.

As
reflected in the Summary Compensation Table, the Committee balanced the need for both annual and longer term incentives for key management talent, at both the corporate and
business levels. In light of the competitive market for key talent, the Committee initiated programs designed to retain individuals recruited by outside firms to ensure a solid continuity of its
management team and to attract key employees.

Compensation Program

The annual compensation of the named executives shown in the "Salary" and "Bonus" columns of the Summary Compensation Table, and the Committee's
recommendations to adjust salary levels and bonus targets, is based on an individual's responsibilities, overall corporate performance, external comparative compensation information and performance
against established financial goals, such as return on equity, net income and earnings per share.

Annual
variable incentives are paid in cash through the Variable Compensation Plan through which the Committee sets minimum, target and maximum awards based on position level. Awards
are earned based on achievement of annual predetermined net earnings goals set by the Committee. In 2000, actual performance was extremely strong and significantly exceeded the financial goals
established by the Committee.

In
2000, the Committee modified the long-term performance plan by removing the multi-year cash targets previously awarded under the program. Awards of long-term incentives made in
December 2000 for the 2001 year consisted only of stock option grants. The Committee believes this modification is consistent with the compensation practices in place at companies which compete with
Corning for management talent, is consistent with the direction that Corning has been taking over the past several years and more closely aligns the interests of executives and shareholders.

Special
grants of restricted stock and/or stock options were also made to certain named executive officers at various times during 2000 for purposes of retention and reward for
outstanding performance. In arriving at its grant recommendations, the Committee reviewed the executive's level and impact on Corning's performance, previously outstanding awards (both vested and
unvested), and the aggressive demand in the market for key executive talent. The number of stock option grants and restricted stock awards made to the Chief Executive Officer and the named executives
in 2000 are set forth in the Summary Compensation Table.


The pension and welfare benefits provided to executives are substantially similar to those provided to all salaried employees. Employees whose pensionable earnings exceed federal
limits, and who participate in the underlying qualified plans, are eligible to participate in non-qualified supplemental pension and supplemental investment plans.

Compensation Deductibility

As a matter of practice, the Committee intends to set performance-based goals annually under the Variable Compensation Plan and the long-term incentive plan
(known as the Corporate Performance Plan) and to deduct compensation paid under these Plans to the extent consistent with the provisions of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended. However, if complying with Section 162(m) conflicts with what the Committee believes to be in the best interests of Corning and its shareholders, the Committee may conclude that paying
non-deductible compensation is consistent with the compensation philosophy.

CEO Compensation Actions—2000

2000 was a year of extraordinary financial performance, and followed the success of 1999. All of the executive compensation programs reflect improved
performance over 1999.

Base Salary:

Effective January 1, 2000, the Committee increased Mr. Ackerman's base salary for 2000 by approximately
4.3% from $815,000 per annum to $850,000 per annum and increased his annual cash incentive target for 2000 from 85% to 90% of base salary. The Committee assessed Mr. Ackerman's individual performance
as highly effective in the overall achievement of a second consecutive year of record earnings and growth. The Committee believes that Mr. Ackerman has contributed to Corning's continuing financial
success as measured by earnings per share.

Annual Incentives:

Mr. Ackerman's bonus for 2000 was composed of two parts: First, Mr. Ackerman received 180% of his
2000 base salary under the Variable Compensation Plan. This award was based on Corning's achieving net profit after tax equivalent to 200% of the target opportunity the Committee established in
February 2000. Second, Mr. Ackerman received 8.03% (2000 minimum = 0%; maximum = 10%) of his base salary under Corning's GoalSharing Plan, a variable compensation plan available to almost all
employees.

Long-Term Incentives:

In recognition of Corning's outstanding performance in 1999 and 2000, the Committee awarded Mr.
Ackerman 60,000 shares of restricted stock in June 2000. In addition, in December 2000, the Committee granted Mr. Ackerman stock options covering 100,000 shares of Corning Common Stock. Mr. Ackerman
announced his intention to retire in mid-2001 and stepped down as Chief Executive Officer on January 1, 2001, while retaining his role as the Chairman of the Board.

Other Significant Actions—2000

The year 2000 also reflects a year of transition with the announced retirements of Messrs. Ackerman, Deneka and Garrity in 2001 and the election on December 6,
2000 of three senior executives to the Board of Directors—James B. Flaws, Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer; Peter F. Volanakis, President—Corning
Technologies; and Wendell P. Weeks, President—Corning Optical Communications. Mr. Loose was named Chief Executive Officer as of January 1, 2001.

The
significant increase in the number of stock options granted by the Committee to employees in 2000 reflects the significant increase in the number of eligible employees during the
course of 2000 as a result of significant acquisition and new hire activity, the changed executive organizational structure as well as the impact of the 3-for-1 stock split effected in October 2000.


Conclusion

2000 was a year of significant growth and change for Corning. The Committee believes that the quality of executive leadership significantly affects long term
performance and that it is in the best interest of the shareholders to compensate fairly executive leadership for achievements that meet or exceed the high standards set by the Committee, so long as
there is corresponding risk when performance falls short of such standards.

One
of the Committee's primary goals is to relate compensation to corporate performance. Based on Corning's performance in 2000, the Committee believes that Corning' current executive
compensation program meets such standards and has contributed, and will continue to contribute, to Corning's success and to the long-term success of its shareholders.

Performance Graph

The following graph illustrates the cumulative total shareholder return over the last five years of Corning's Common Stock, the S&P 500 and the S&P
Communications Equipment Companies (in which Corning is currently included) and the S&P Diversified Manufacturing Companies (in which Corning was previously included). Corning changed its line of
business index in fiscal 2001 to more
accurately reflect the change in Corning's business focus. The graph includes the capital weighted performance results of those companies both in the diversified manufacturing companies classification
and in the communications equipment companies classification that are also included in the S&P 500. Prior to 1997 Corning compared its shareholder return to the S&P Miscellaneous Industrial Companies
classification. This classification is no longer published.

Arrangements with Named Executive Officers

Employment Agreements with Named Executive Officers

Corning entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Weeks effective December 6, 2000. The employment agreement expires in December 2003. During the term of
the employment agreement, Mr. Weeks will receive a minimum annual base salary of $575,000. Additionally, Mr. Weeks will be eligible to (1) receive annually a bonus of up to 80% of his annual base

Severance Arrangements

Under an existing severance policy Corning will provide to all salaried employees in certain events compensation in amounts ranging between eight weeks (for
employees with at least one year of service) and fifty-two weeks (for employees with twenty or more years of service). In addition, Corning will provide to certain of its officers and senior
employees, including the named executive officers, in certain events up to three years of cash compensation in light of the length of time anticipated in securing comparable employment. These events
include a constructive termination of employment as a result of a substantial change in the employee's responsibilities, compensation levels, relocation and similar matters following a change in
Corning's ownership and management.

Pension Plan

Corning has a defined benefit Pension Plan under which it pays benefits based upon career earnings (regular salary and cash awards such as those paid under its
Variable Compensation Plans) and years of credited service. Employees are required to contribute 2% of compensation in excess of the social security wage base up to the compensation limits imposed by
the Internal Revenue Code. Salaried employees may contribute 2% of earnings up to the Social Security Wage Base to increase pension benefits.

Corning
amended its pension plan effective July 1, 2000, to include a cash balance component. All salaried and non-union hourly employees were given the choice of continuing to accrue
future benefits under the career earnings formula or, if the cash balance plan was elected, the cash balance formula. All salaried and non-union hourly employees hired after July 1, 2000 automatically
participate in the cash balance plan.

The
cash balance plan is expressed in the form of a hypothetical account balance. Each month a participant's cash balance account is increased by (a) pay credits based on the
participant's eligible pay for that month and (b) interest credits based on the participant's account balance as of the end of the prior month. Pay credits accrue annually at a rate between 3% and 8%.
Pension benefits under this plan may be distributed as a lump sum or as an annuity.

Corning
reviews and adjusts the benefit formula periodically for inflationary and other factors. Corning's contributions to the Plan are determined by the Plan's actuaries and are not
determined on an individual basis. The amount of benefits payable under the Plan and attributable to Corning's


contributions is subject to the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and the Internal Revenue Code.

Corning
maintains non-qualified supplemental pension plans pursuant to which it will pay amounts approximately equal to the difference between the benefits provided under the Pension
Plan and benefits which would have been paid thereunder but for the limitations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and the Internal Revenue Code. Certain employees, including the named
executive officers, participate in the Executive Supplemental Pension Plan which pays benefits based upon final average compensation (the highest five consecutive calendar years in the ten calendar
years immediately preceding retirement) and years of credited service. Certain of the benefits payable under the Executive Supplemental Pension Plan are presently funded and vested on an individual
basis.

The
table below sets forth the estimated annual amounts payable under the Pension Plan and the Executive Supplemental Pension Plan assuming retirement during 2001 of participants who
have met eligibility requirement for unreduced benefits. These amounts are based upon the straight life annuity option and are not subject to reduction for Social Security benefits or other payments
or offsets. Additional benefits may be payable to persons who contribute voluntarily to the Pension Plan. The Plans' normal retirement age is 65 with 5 years of credited service.

The
compensation covered by the Pension Plan and the Executive Supplemental Pension Plan for the named executive officers is the salary and bonus set forth in the Summary Compensation
Table. The bonus is included as compensation in the calendar year paid. Messrs. Ackerman, Deneka, Garrity, Loose and Weeks have 38, 28, 34, 36 and 17 years of credited service, respectively.


Matters Relating to Directors

Compensation

During 2000, Corning paid to non-employee directors an annual retainer of $30,000 and $1,200 for each meeting attended. In lieu of meeting fees, chairmen of
committees received an additional retainer ranging from $5,000 to $8,000, depending upon the committee chaired. In addition, during 2000, Mr. Brown attended two meetings of an ad hoc committee of
non-employees who reviewed developments and offered advice on a broad range of matters in the telecommunications area. Corning paid Mr. Brown $1,200 for each meeting attended.

Directors
may defer any portion of their compensation. Amounts deferred shall be paid only in cash and while deferred may be allocated to (i) an account earning interest, compounded
quarterly, at the rate equal to the greater of the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect on specified dates or the rate paid on the stable value fund under Corning's Investment Plans, (ii) an account
based upon the market value of Corning's Common Stock from time to time, or (iii) a combination of such accounts. At December 31, 2000 eight directors had elected to defer compensation.

During
2000, Corning issued to each non-employee director 750 shares of Common Stock under the Equity Plan for Non-Employee Directors. These shares are subject to forfeiture and
certain restrictions on transfer. In addition, Corning granted to each non-employee director options covering 2,250 shares of Common Stock under the Equity Plan for Non-Employee Directors. The options
vest ratably over a three-year period and expire on April 26, 2010.

Corning
has a Directors' Charitable Giving Program funded by insurance policies on the lives of the directors. In 2000, Corning paid a total of $421,790 in premiums on such policies.
Upon the death of a director, Corning will donate $1,250,000 (on behalf of a non-employee director) and $1,000,000 (on behalf of an employee director) to one or more qualified charitable organizations
recommended by such director and approved by Corning. The directors derive no financial benefit from the Program as all charitable deductions and cash surrender value of life insurance policies accrue
solely to the Corporation. One must be a director for five years to participate in the Program. Messrs. Ackerman, Brown, Foster, Garrity, Gund, Hennessy, Houghton, O'Connor, Ruding and Smithburg and
Ms. Rieman are eligible to participate in the Program.

Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management

The number of shares of Corning's Common Stock (and the voting equivalent represented by shares of Preferred Stock) owned by the directors and nominees for
directors, by the chief executive officer and the four other most highly compensated executive officers (the "named executive officers") and by all directors and executive officers as a group, as of

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP

To
the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Corning Incorporated

In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 14(a)(1) on page 49 present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Corning Incorporated and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2000 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 14 (a)
(1) on page 49 presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These financial statements and
financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our
audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the

provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Corning Incorporated and Subsidiary Companies

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(In millions, except share and per share amounts)

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all entities controlled by Corning. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are
eliminated.

The
equity method of accounting is used for investments in associated companies which are not controlled by Corning and in which Corning's interest is generally between 20% and 50%.

As
more fully described in Note 2, Corning merged with Oak Industries, Inc. (Oak) on January 28, 2000 in a pooling of interests transaction. The consolidated financial statements for
1999 and 1998 have been restated to include the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of Oak. No adjustments were needed to conform the accounting policies of Corning and Oak. In
addition, no adjustments have been made for transactions between Corning and Oak as such transactions were not significant.

All
share and per share amounts have been restated to reflect the three-for-one stock split of Corning common stock that became effective October 3, 2000.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect amounts reported therein. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results reported in future periods may be based upon amounts that could differ
from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition

Corning recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and has been earned. Product revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement
exists, the product has been delivered and legal title and all risks of ownership have been transferred, written contract and sales terms are complete, customer acceptance has occurred and payment is
reasonably assured. Corning reduces revenue for estimated product returns, allowances and price discounts based on experience.

Foreign Currencies

Balance sheet accounts of foreign subsidiaries are translated at current exchange rates and income statement accounts are translated at average exchange rates
for the year. Translation gains and losses are accumulated as a component of other accumulated comprehensive income. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses affecting cash flows are included in
current earnings.

Corning
enters into foreign exchange contracts primarily as hedges against identifiable foreign currency commitments. Gains and losses on contracts identified as hedges are deferred
and included in the measurement of the related foreign currency transactions. Gains and losses on foreign currency contracts which are not designated as hedges of foreign currency commitments are
included in current earnings.

Prior
to July 2000, Corning entered into revenue sales contracts for certain of its revenues generated in foreign currencies. Such contracts, because of their terms, were not subject
to foreign currency gains and losses.


Cash and Cash Equivalents

Short-term investments, comprised of repurchase agreements and debt instruments with original maturities of 90 days or less, are considered cash equivalents.

Supplemental
disclosure of cash flow information is as follows:

Marketable Securities

Corning's marketable securities consist of equity securities classified as available-for-sale which are stated at estimated fair value based primarily upon
market quotes. Unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, are computed on the basis of specific identification and are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income in
shareholders' equity until realized. A decline in the value
of any marketable security below cost that is deemed other than temporary is charged to earnings, resulting in a new cost basis for the security.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out basis) or market. Inventories at December 31, consisted of the following:

Property and Depreciation

Land, buildings and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is based on estimated useful lives of properties using straight-line and accelerated methods.
The estimated useful lives range from


20-40 years for buildings and 3-20 years for the majority of Corning's equipment. At December 31, plant and equipment consisted of the following:

Depreciation
expense for 2000, 1999 and 1998 was $516.2 million, $375.5 million and $292.6 million, respectively. Approximately $56.5 million, $41.3 million and $46.8 million of
interest costs were capitalized as part of plant and equipment in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Investment costs in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired are amortized over appropriate periods not exceeding 40 years, but principally ranging from
5 to 25 years for acquisitions over the past three years. Other intangible assets are recorded at cost and amortized over periods generally ranging from 5 to 20 years. Corning reviews the
recoverability of its long-lived assets, including goodwill and other intangible assets, when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be
recoverable. The assessment of possible impairment is based on
Corning's ability to recover the carrying value of the asset from the expected future pre-tax cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) of the related operations. If these cash flows are
less than the carrying value of such asset, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between estimated fair value and carrying value. The measurement of impairment requires management to
make estimates of these cash flows related to long-lived assets. It is reasonably possible that future events or circumstances could cause these estimates to change. Amortization expense for the years
ended December 31, was as follows:

Taxes on Income

Corning uses the asset and liability approach to account for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the
expected future tax consequences of differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the
differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period when the change is enacted.


2. Business Combinations and Divestitures

Pooling of Interests

On January 28, 2000, Corning merged with Oak in a pooling of interests transaction. Corning issued 44,293,491 shares of Corning common stock and 8,137,500
options to purchase Oak common shares to complete the transaction. The consolidated financial statements for 1999 and 1998 have been restated to include the financial position and results of
operations of Oak. During the first quarter of 2000, Corning recognized a charge of $47.0 million ($43.4 million after tax) for one-time acquisition costs related to Oak. The acquisition costs are
primarily related to investment banking, legal and other fees of approximately $30 million. The charge also includes approximately $17 million of severance and other termination benefits for Oak
corporate officers and headquarters employees. As of December 31, 2000, total severance benefits paid out were approximately $14 million. Separate revenue and income amounts of the merged companies
for the years ended December 31, are as follows (in millions):

Purchases

The transactions listed below were all accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. Management is responsible for estimating the fair value of the
assets and liabilities acquired. Management has made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses resulting from such acquisitions.

Amounts
allocated to purchased in-process research and development (IPRD) were established through recognized valuation techniques in the high technology communications industry.
Certain projects were acquired for which technological feasibility had not been established at the date of acquisition and for which no alternative future uses existed. In accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 2, "Accounting for Research and Development Costs" as interpreted by FASB Interpretation No. 4, "Applicability of FASB Statement No. 2 to Business Combinations
Accounted for by the Purchase Method," amounts assigned to IPRD meeting the above criteria must be charged to expense at the date of consummation of the purchase.

The
value allocated to projects for which a charge was recorded was determined by the traditional income approach which discounts expected future debt-free income to present value.
The discount rates used were specific to each project and were derived from a cost of capital for each specific acquisition target, adjusted upward for the stage of completion of each project. The
acquired entity discount rates ranged from 17% to 35%, and the stage of completion assigned to IPRD projects varied from 10% to 90%.

Corning
expects that products incorporating the acquired technology from these projects will be completed and will begin to generate cash flows over the next five years following
integration.


Optical Technologies USA

On December 12, 2000, Corning completed the acquisition of Optical Technologies USA, a manufacturer of lithium niobate modulators, pump lasers, certain
specialty fibers and fiber gratings used in optical networks from Pirelli S.p.A. (90%) and Cisco Systems Inc. (10%) for approximately $3.6 billion in cash consideration to Pirelli and 5,473,684 shares
of unregistered Corning stock to Cisco (the Pirelli acquisition). Based upon the average closing price of Corning common stock for a range of days
surrounding the agreement adjusted for a discount commensurate with restrictions on the shares the total purchase price was $4.0 billion. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value
of tangible assets acquired was allocated primarily to goodwill, other intangibles and IPRD. Goodwill of approximately $3,472 million is being amortized on a straight-line basis over 13 years. Patents
of approximately $152 million are also being amortized over 13 years. Corning recorded a non-tax deductible charge of $322.9 million for IPRD in the fourth quarter of 2000 associated with this
transaction. The allocation of the purchase price is based on preliminary data and could change when final valuation information is obtained.

Champion Products

On October 10, 2000, Corning completed the acquisition of Champion Products Inc., a manufacturer of enclosures, power pedestals, shelters and a unique patented
design for temperature controlled enclosures for telecommunications customers, for approximately $85 million in cash. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets
acquired was allocated primarily to goodwill. Purchased intangibles and goodwill of approximately $69 million are being amortized on a straight-line basis over 20 years.

IntelliSense

On June 12, 2000, Corning completed the acquisition of the remaining 67% interest in IntelliSense Corporation, a manufacturer of micro-electro-mechanical
devices in exchange for 6,050,259 shares of unregistered Corning common stock and the assumption of stock options convertible into 1,968,312 shares of Corning common stock. Based upon the average
closing price of Corning stock for a range of days surrounding the announcement adjusted for a discount commensurate with restrictions on the shares issued and a Black-Scholes valuation of the options
issued, the recorded purchase price approximated $410 million. An additional 1,019,763 shares were issued upon the achievement of certain product milestones in the fourth quarter. This additional
consideration was valued at approximately $77 million. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired was allocated primarily to goodwill. Goodwill of
approximately $483 million is being amortized on a straight-line basis over 13 years. Corning recorded a non-tax deductible charge of $6.7 million for IPRD in the second quarter of 2000.

NetOptix

On May 12, 2000, Corning completed the acquisition of NetOptix Corporation for 33,719,067 shares of Corning common stock and the assumption of stock options
convertible into 2,487,240 Corning shares.
Based on the average closing price of Corning stock for a range of days surrounding the announcement and a Black Scholes valuation of options issued, the recorded purchase price approximated $2.1
billion. NetOptix manufactures thin film filters for use in dense wavelength division multiplexing components.

The
excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired was allocated to goodwill. Goodwill of approximately $2,066 million is being amortized on a
straight-line basis over 10 years.


NZ Applied Technologies

On May 5, 2000, Corning completed the acquisition of the remaining 84% interest in NZ Applied Technologies (NZAT), a developer and manufacturer of photonic
components for optical telecommunications applications including the optical networks industry, in exchange for Corning common stock. Based upon a range of days surrounding May 1, 2000, the date on
which the number of shares became fixed, and adjusted for a discount commensurate with the restrictions on the shares, Corning issued 1,321,749 shares of unregistered common stock at closing with a
fair value of approximately $75 million. In addition, Corning placed an extra 1,321,749 shares in escrow to be earned over the next three years contingent upon NZAT achieving certain product
development and sales milestones. In the fourth quarter, NZAT achieved two milestones earning 528,702 shares of the escrowed stock valued at approximately $42 million. The remaining contingent
proceeds, if earned, will be recorded at the then current fair value of Corning common stock. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired was allocated
to goodwill and IPRD. Goodwill of approximately $73 million is being amortized on a straight-line basis over 10 years. Corning recorded a non-tax deductible charge of $44 million for IPRD in the
second quarter of 2000.

Photonics Technology Research Center

On February 14, 2000, Corning acquired British Telecommunication's Photonics Technology Research Center (PTRC) for approximately $66 million in cash. The
excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired was allocated to IPRD and purchased intangibles and goodwill. Purchased intangibles and goodwill of approximately
$24 million is being amortized over lives up to nine years. Corning recorded a charge of $42.0 million ($25.7 million after tax) for IPRD in the first quarter of 2000.

Siemens Transaction

On February 2, 2000, Corning acquired the worldwide optical cable and hardware business of Siemens AG and the remaining 50% in Siecor Corporation and Siecor
GmbH (the Siemens transaction). The purchase price of $1.4 billion (subject to customary purchase price adjustments) includes approximately $120 million in assumed debt and $145 million in contingent
performance payments to be paid, if earned, over a four-year period. At December 31, 2000, approximately $50 million of this contingent consideration has been earned. Less significant portions of the
transaction may close at various dates into 2001. At December 31, 2000, total cash paid to Siemens approximated $1.1 billion. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible
assets acquired, pending final determination of certain acquired balances, was allocated primarily to purchased intangibles and goodwill. Purchased intangibles and goodwill of approximately $650
million are being amortized over lives of 5 to 20 years.

Corning Japan K.K.

On September 29, 1999, Corning acquired the 21% interest in Corning Japan K.K. it did not own for cash consideration of approximately $32 million. The excess
purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired was allocated primarily to goodwill. Goodwill of approximately $18 million is being amortized on a straight-line basis over 20
years. Corning Japan K.K. produces flat panel display glass within the Information Display Segment, and will continue to be consolidated within Corning's operating results.

BICC and Optical Waveguides Australia

On April 30, 1999, Corning acquired BICC, plc's telecommunications cable business and the 50% equity interest in Optical Waveguides Australia, Pty. Ltd. (OWA)
it did not already own for cash


consideration of approximately $135 million. The excess purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired was allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets. Goodwill and
other intangible assets of approximately $37 million are being amortized over periods ranging from 5 to 25 years. During the third and fourth quarters of 1999, adjustments to purchase accounting
increased goodwill and primarily reduced property, plant and equipment. OWA became a wholly owned subsidiary as a result of this transaction and the results of its operations are included in the
consolidated financial statements from the date of the transaction.

Optical Fibres

On December 1, 1998, Corning acquired the 50% interest in Optical Fibres previously owned by BICC, plc. The consideration was comprised of approximately $47
million in cash and the assumption of $27 million in debt. During the fourth quarter of 1999, adjustments to purchase accounting eliminated intangible assets and increased property, plant and
equipment. Optical Fibres became a wholly owned subsidiary as a result of this transaction and the results of its operations are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of the
transaction.

Tele Quarz GmbH

On October 30, 1998, Oak completed the acquisition of Tele Quarz GmbH (Tele Quarz), a German manufacturer of frequency control products. The total purchase
price, including debt assumed and transaction costs, was approximately $63.5 million. The excess purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired was allocated primarily to
goodwill and other intangibles. Goodwill and other intangibles of approximately $18 million are being amortized over periods ranging from 12 to 30 years.

Other

Throughout 2000, Corning completed other acquisitions with an aggregate purchase price of approximately $67 million in cash. The excess purchase price over the
fair value of net tangible assets acquired totaled $64 million and is being amortized over periods of up to 20 years. These acquisitions were not significant to the consolidated financial statements.

In
December 1999, Corning completed other acquisitions with an aggregate purchase price of $17.5 million in cash. The excess purchase price over the fair value of net tangible assets
acquired totaled $8.5 million and is being amortized over periods of up to 10 years. These acquisitions were not significant to the consolidated financial statements.

Pro Forma Presentation

The foregoing acquisitions have been recorded under the purchase method of accounting and, accordingly, the results of the acquired businesses are included in
the consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition. The following unaudited pro forma financial information reflects the consolidated results of operations of Corning as if the
Pirelli, NetOptix and Siemens acquisitions took place at the beginning of January 1999. The effects of the other acquisitions on Corning's consolidated financial statements were not material on either
an individual or an aggregate basis. The pro forma information includes adjustments for interest expense and shares outstanding that would have been incurred to finance the transactions, additional
depreciation based on the fair market value of the property, plant and equipment acquired, amortization of purchased intangibles and goodwill and the elimination of minority interest related to
Siemens 50% ownership of Siecor Corporation. The pro


forma financial information is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations as they would have been had the transactions been effected on the assumed acquisition date.

Divestitures

On January 31, 2000, Corning sold Quanterra Incorporated to Severn Trent Laboratories for $35 million. In the first quarter of 2000, Corning recorded a
nonoperating gain of $6.8 million, ($4.2 million after tax), as a result of this transaction. Concurrent with management's decision to dispose of this business, Corning recognized an impairment loss
of $15.5 million ($10.0 million after tax), in the third quarter of 1999. The impairment loss reduced Corning's investment in these assets to an amount equal to management's current estimate of fair
value. The results of operations of this business were not material to Corning.

During
the third quarter of 1999, Corning sold Republic Wire and Cable, a manufacturer of elevator cables and a subsidiary of Siecor Corporation, for approximately $52 million in cash
and short-term notes. Corning recorded a nonoperating gain of $30 million ($9.5 million after tax and minority interest), as a result of this transaction.

In
the fourth quarter of 1998, Corning recorded a nonoperating gain of $19.2 million ($9.7 million after tax), related to the divestiture of several small businesses within the life
sciences business.

Other

In June 1998, Molecular Simulations, Inc. (MSI) merged with Pharmacopeia, Inc., a publicly traded company. Corning previously owned 35% of MSI and owned
approximately 15% of the combined entity at the time of the merger. Corning realized a nonoperating gain of $20.5 million ($13.2 million after tax), from this transaction.

3. Information by Operating Segment

Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief
operating decision maker, or decision making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Corning's chief operating decision-making group is comprised of the Chief
Executive Officer and the officers who report to him directly.

Corning's
reportable segments include Telecommunications, Advanced Materials and Information Display. The Telecommunications Segment produces optical fiber and cable, optical hardware
and equipment, photonic modules and components and optical networking devices for the worldwide telecommunications industry. The Advanced Materials Segment manufactures specialized products with
unique properties for customer applications utilizing glass, glass ceramic and polymer technologies. Businesses within this segment include environmental technologies, life sciences, semiconductor
materials and optical and lighting products. The Information Display Segment manufactures glass panels and funnels for televisions and CRTs, projection video lens assemblies and liquid crystal display
glass for flat panel displays.


In the first quarter of 2000, Corning changed the performance measurement of its operating segments to a new metric. Corning evaluates performance based on an after-tax profit
measure, which is identified as segment net income. Segment net income excludes amortization of purchased intangibles and goodwill, purchased IPRD costs, one-time acquisition costs and other
nonrecurring items. The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. The financial results for Corning's three
operating segments have been prepared on a basis which is consistent with the manner in which Corning management internally disaggregates financial information for the purposes of assisting in making
internal operating decisions. In this regard, certain common expenses have been allocated among segments differently than would be required for stand alone financial information prepared in accordance
with GAAP. Revenue attributed to geographic areas is based on the location of the customer. The segment results for 1999 and 1998 have been restated to conform to the new measure.

Dividends
received from Samsung Corning and Corning's other equity companies totaled $44.7 million, $50.9 million and $63.4 million in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. At December
31, 2000, approximately $436.6 million of equity in undistributed earnings of equity companies were included in Corning's retained earnings.

Samsung
Corning results include a nonoperating gain of $23.4 million from the sale of its interest in Samsung Corning Precision Glass Company Ltd. (Samsung Corning Precision).
Corning's 50% share of this gain is included in its equity earnings. Corning continues to maintain a 50% interest in Samsung Corning Precision.

Dow Corning Corporation

Corning is a 50% owner of Dow Corning Corporation (Dow Corning), a manufacturer of silicones. The other 50% of Dow Corning is owned by The Dow Chemical Company
(Dow Chemical).

On
May 15, 1995, Dow Corning sought protection under the reorganization provisions of Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, as a result of several negative developments
related to the breast implant litigation. At that time, Corning management believed it was impossible to predict if and when Dow Corning would successfully emerge from Chapter 11 proceedings. As a
result, Corning recorded an after-tax charge of $365.5 million to fully reserve its investment in Dow Corning and discontinued recognition of equity earnings from Dow Corning in 1995. The bankruptcy
proceeding is pending in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, Northern Division (Bay City, Michigan). The bankruptcy filing stayed the prosecution against Dow
Corning of approximately 19,000 breast-implant product liability lawsuits, including 45 class actions. In the period from December 1996 through February 1998, Dow Corning filed a plan of
reorganization and two amended plans, each of which was opposed by creditor representatives. In 1998, Dow Corning and the Tort Claimants Committee engaged in extended negotiations and reached certain
compromises. On November 8, 1998, Dow Corning and the Tort Claimants Committee jointly filed a revised Plan of Reorganization (Joint Plan). The Joint Plan and related disclosure materials were mailed
to claimants for their approval. Following a favorable vote from all but four classes of creditors, a hearing to confirm the Joint Plan was held in mid 1999.


On November 30, 1999, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order confirming the Joint Plan and indicated that certain written opinions would follow. On December 21, 1999, the Bankruptcy
Court issued an opinion that approved the principal elements of the Joint Plan with respect to tort claimants, but construed the Joint Plan as providing releases for third parties (including Corning
and Dow Chemical as shareholders) only with respect to tort claimants who voted in favor of the Joint Plan. A number of parties opposing the Joint Plan filed appeals on a variety of grounds to the
United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. Dow Corning and the Committee of Tort Claimants filed a notice of appeal seeking review of the ruling limiting the scope of the
shareholder releases. Corning and Dow Chemical filed separate notices of appeal on this issue. On November 13, 2000, the District Court entered an Order affirming the Bankruptcy Court's November 30,
1999 Order confirming the Joint Amended Plan and reversing the Bankruptcy Court's December 21, 1999 Opinion
on the release and injunction provisions. One group of plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration in the District Court and the District Court entered a February 5, 2001 Opinion Denying Motion for
Reconsideration, confirming that the Litigation Facility under the Joint Plan is the defendant in place of Dow Corning, Corning and Dow Chemical, and that Corning and Dow Chemical are not named
defendants for direct claims. Approximately 20 appeals were filed from the District Court's Order and are pending in the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, which is expected to rule in the second half of
2001. After all appeals are exhausted, if the Joint Plan is upheld but the shareholder releases are effective only for those voting in favor of the Joint Plan, Corning would expect to defend any
remaining claims against it on the same grounds that led to a series of orders and judgments dismissing all claims against Corning in the federal courts and the state courts as described under the
heading Implant Tort Lawsuits (Item 3). With respect to the possibility of additional direct or indirect claims against Corning if the full releases are not reinstated in the Joint Plan, management
believes that such claims lack merit and that the breast implant litigation against Corning will be resolved without material impact on Corning's financial statements.

Under
the terms of the Joint Plan, Dow Corning would be required to establish a Settlement Trust and a Litigation Facility to provide a means for tort claimants to settle or litigate
their claims. Dow Corning would have the obligation to fund the Trust and the Facility, over a period of up to 16 years, in an amount up to approximately $3.2 billion (nominal value), subject to the
limitations, terms and conditions stated in the Joint Plan. Dow Corning proposes to provide the required funding over the 16 year period through a combination of cash, proceeds from insurance, and
cash flow from operations. Corning and Dow Chemical have each agreed to provide a credit facility to Dow Corning of up to $150 million ($300 million in the aggregate), subject to the terms and
conditions stated in the Joint Plan. The Joint Plan also provides for Dow Corning to make full payment, through cash and the issuance of senior notes, to its commercial creditors. If and when Dow
Corning emerges from bankruptcy, Corning will likely begin to recognize equity earnings from Dow Corning. Corning does not expect to receive dividends from Dow Corning in the foreseeable future.

Dow
Corning's financial statements for 2000, 1999 and 1998 have been prepared in conformity with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants' Statement of Position 90-7,
"Financial Reporting by Entities in Reorganization under the Bankruptcy Code," (SOP 90-7). SOP 90-7 requires a segregation of liabilities subject to compromise by the Bankruptcy Court as of the filing
date (May 15, 1995) and identification of all transactions and events that are directly associated with the reorganization.

Dow
Corning's 1998 results reflect the impact of a pre-tax charge of approximately $1.1 billion, representing Dow Corning's best estimate of the anticipated financial consequences to
be incurred in resolving all claims arising from the Chapter 11 proceedings and from the breast implant controversy.

Dow
Corning's 1998 results have also been impacted by the suspension of interest payments and reorganization costs resulting from the Chapter 11 proceedings.

Pittsburgh Corning Corporation

Corning and PPG Industries, Inc. each own 50% of the capital stock of Pittsburgh Corning Corporation (PCC). PCC and several other defendants have been named in
numerous lawsuits involving claims alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos. As of the bankruptcy filing on April 16, 2000, PCC had in excess of 240,000 open claims. In the first quarter of
2000, after incurring adverse verdicts in five trials involving 19 claimants, PCC filed for Chapter 11 reorganization in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. At
the time of its Chapter 11 filing, PCC sought and obtained a temporary restraining order and filed a motion for a preliminary injunction against the prosecution of asbestos actions against its two
shareholders. The preliminary injunction has been extended by stipulation of the parties and by court order to May 21, 2001 to enable the parties to negotiate a plan of reorganization for PCC. Upon
expiration of the injunction on or after May 21, 2001, PCC, PPG Industries and Corning will have 90 days to seek removal and transfer of stayed cases that have not been resolved through a plan of
reorganization. As a result of PCC's bankruptcy filing, Corning recorded an after-tax charge of $36.3 million in the first quarter to impair its entire investment in PCC and discontinued recognition
of equity earnings. At the time PCC filed for bankruptcy protection, there were approximately 12,400 claims pending against Corning alleging various theories of liability based on exposure to PCC's
asbestos products, all of which are stayed pursuant to the injunction of the bankruptcy court. Before PCC filed for bankruptcy protection, Corning was dismissed from similar claims as cases against
PCC proceeded to trial. The Chapter 11 filing may lead to additional claims against Corning with related costs of defense, charges and expenses. Although the outcome of litigation and the bankruptcy
case is uncertain, management believes that the separate


corporate status of PCC will continue to be upheld. Management is continuing to investigate Corning's options for defending claims against it, which might include vigorously defending itself on all
fronts or exploring a global settlement through the bankruptcy process. The range of cost for these options (net of insurance) cannot be estimated at this time, although management believes these
matters will be resolved without a materially adverse impact on Corning's financial position.

Other Investments

Corning's other investments include equity securities, which are classified as available-for-sale. At December 31, 2000, the fair value and cost of Corning's
equity securities was $156.2 million and $89.5 million, respectively. The difference includes gross unrealized gains of $67.3 million and gross unrealized losses of $0.1 million. At December 31, 1999,
the fair value and cost of Corning's equity securities was $82.5 million and $51.4 million, respectively. The difference includes gross unrealized gains of $32.8 million and gross unrealized losses of
$1.7 million. The net change in the unrealized gain/(loss) on marketable securities classified as available-for-sale included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income was $36.1 million
and $31.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

Proceeds
from sales of marketable securities were $16.3 million and $0.8 million in 2000 and 1999, respectively, and related net realized gains included in income were $26.5 million
and $5.6 million in 2000 and 1999, respectively.

5. Employee Retirement Plans

Corning has defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic and international employees. Corning's funding policy has been to contribute as necessary
an amount determined jointly by Corning and its consulting actuaries, which provides for the current cost and amortization of prior service cost. In 2000, Corning amended its US pension plan to
include a cash balance pension feature. All salaried and non-union hourly employees hired before July 1, 2000 were given the choice of staying in the existing plan or participating in the cash balance
plan beginning January 1, 2001. Salaried employees hired after July 1, 2000 automatically became participants in the new cash balance plan. Under the cash balance plan, employee accounts are credited
monthly with a percentage of eligible pay based on age and years of service. Benefits remain 100% vested after five years of service.

Corning
and certain of its domestic subsidiaries also offer defined benefit postretirement plans that provide health care and life insurance benefits for retirees and eligible
dependents. Certain employees may become eligible for such postretirement benefits upon reaching retirement age. Corning's principal
retiree medical plans require retiree contributions each year equal to the excess of medical cost increases over general inflation rates.

Corning's

assumptions and health care cost trend rates. The health care cost trend rate for Corning's principal plan is assumed to be 7.08% in 2000 decreasing gradually to 5.0% in 2010 and thereafter.

The
change in the total valuation allowance for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, was a decrease of $5.6 million and an increase of $16.5 million, respectively.

Corning
currently provides income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries and associated companies to the extent such earnings are currently taxable or expected to be remitted.
Taxes have not been provided on $777.1 million of accumulated foreign unremitted earnings which are expected to remain invested indefinitely. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional
tax that might be payable on the foreign earnings; however, if these earnings were remitted, income taxes payable would be provided at a rate which is significantly lower than the effective tax rate.

Corning,
as required, provided for tax on undistributed earnings of its domestic subsidiaries and affiliated companies beginning in 1993 even though these earnings have been and will
continue to be reinvested indefinitely. Corning estimates that $32.1 million of tax would be payable on pre-1993 undistributed earnings of its domestic subsidiaries and affiliated companies should the
unremitted earnings reverse and become taxable to Corning. Corning expects these earnings to be reinvested indefinitely.

Deferred
income tax benefits totaling $172.6 million and $113.5 million were included in other current assets at year-end 2000 and 1999, respectively. At December 31, 2000, Corning
had tax benefits attributable to loss carryforwards and credits aggregating $114.0 million that expire at various dates through 2014.

7. Provision for Restructuring

In the second quarter of 1998, Corning recorded a restructuring charge of $84.6 million ($49.2 million after tax and minority interest). The charge was
comprised of early retirement incentives offered to certain salaried non-union employees 55 years old or older satisfying service criteria and severance costs associated with workforce reductions of
other non-union employees. The restructuring charge related to approximately 650 employees, all of whom were terminated as of June 30, 1999. Corning determined in the fourth quarter of 1999 that the
total costs of the incentive package would be less than anticipated. Consequently, Corning released restructuring reserves totaling $14.1 million ($8.6 million after tax), in the fourth quarter of
1999. All payments associated with this program have been


made at December 31, 2000. Management estimates that the annualized cost savings related to this program is approximately $30 million per year after taxes.

Based
on borrowing rates currently available to Corning for loans with similar terms and maturities, the fair value of long-term debt was $3.8 billion at year-end 2000.

In
February 1998, Oak issued $100 million of convertible subordinated notes bearing interest at 4.875% due in 2008. The notes are convertible into 6.3 million shares of Corning common
stock at a conversion price of approximately $16 per share.

In
January 2000, Corning called and retired two long-term note issues of Siecor Corporation, 6.73% due 2008 and 6.83% due 2009, in the aggregate principal amount of $60.0 million. In
January 2000, Corning repaid all outstanding indebtedness under Oak's revolving credit facility, which approximated $98 million, and terminated the remaining revolving credit commitment of $250
million with Oak's existing bank group.

In
February 2000, Corning issued EUR 500 million of Euro-denominated notes in two tranches: EUR 200 million at 5.625% due February 18, 2005 and EUR 300 million at 6.25% due February
18, 2010. Interest is payable on February 1 of each year beginning in 2001. The notes are not redeemable before they mature, unless Corning becomes obligated to pay additional amounts because of
changes in U.S. withholding tax requirements. The net proceeds of approximately $485 million were used to finance a portion of the Siemens transaction.

Corning
has available a revolving line of credit with a syndicate of banks for $2 billion. The line of credit expires in August 2005, unless extended. There were no borrowings
under the agreement at December 31, 2000. The revolving credit agreements provide for borrowing of U.S. dollars and Eurocurrency at various rates.

In
November 2000, Corning completed an offering of $2.7 billion (amount due at maturity) of zero coupon convertible debentures which generated net proceeds of approximately
$2 billion. The initial price of the debentures was $741.92 with a 2% yield annually. Interest is compounded semi-annually with a 25% conversion factor. The debentures mature on November 8,
2015, and are convertible into approximately 22.6 million shares of Corning common stock at the rate of 8.3304 per $1,000 principal amount. Corning may call the debentures at any time on or after
November 8, 2005. The debentures may be redeemed for $819.54 on November 8, 2005 and $905.29 on November 8, 2010. The holder can convert the debenture into Corning common stock at any time prior to
maturity or redemption. The proceeds were used to finance a portion of the Pirelli acquisition. Deferred financing costs totaled approximately $40.9 million and are being amortized ratably over the
term of the debentures.

10. Mandatorily Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock

Corning has 10 million authorized shares of Series Preferred Stock, par value $100 per share. Of the authorized shares, Corning has designated 2.4 million
shares as Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock for which no shares have been issued.

At
December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, 86,800, 134,700 and 178,700 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock were outstanding, respectively. Each Series B share is convertible into
14.37 shares of Corning common stock and has voting rights equivalent to 14 common shares. The Series B shares were sold exclusively to the trustee of Corning's existing employee investment plans,
based upon directions from plan participants. Participants may cause Corning to redeem the shares at 100% of par upon reaching age 55 or later, retirement, termination of employment or in certain
cases of financial hardship. The Series B shares are redeemable by Corning at $100 per share.


11. Common Shareholders' Equity

On January 31, 2000, Corning completed an equity offering of 44.85 million shares of common stock generating net proceeds to Corning of approximately $2.2
billion. On November 6, 2000, Corning completed an equity offering of 34.5 million shares of common stock generating net proceeds to Corning of approximately $2.4 billion.

On
April 27, 2000, the shareholders of Corning approved an increase to the authorized number of shares of common stock from 500 million to 1.2 billion shares and on November 8, 2000,
the shareholders of Corning approved an increase to the authorized number of shares of common stock from 1.2 billion to 3.8 billion shares. In August 2000, Corning authorized a three-for-one stock
split of its common stock, effected in the form of a stock dividend, which was distributed on October 3, 2000, to shareholders of record on September 5, 2000. All of the share and per share data in
these financial statements and footnotes have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split.

Corning
has established the Corning Stock Ownership Trust (CSOT) to fund a portion of future employee purchases and company contributions of common stock to Corning's Investment and
Employee Stock Purchase Plans (the Plans). Corning sold 12 million treasury shares to the CSOT. At
December 31, 2000, 4.5 million shares remained in the CSOT. Shares held by the CSOT are not considered outstanding for earnings per common share calculations until released to the Plans.

Corning
repurchased approximately 4.2 million and 6.0 million shares of its common stock in 1999 and 1998, respectively. No shares of common stock were repurchased in 2000.

In
June 1996, the Board of Directors approved the renewal of the Preferred Share Purchase Right Plan which entitles shareholders to purchase 0.01 of a share of Series A Junior
Participating Preferred Stock upon the occurrence of certain events. In addition, the rights entitle shareholders to purchase shares of common stock at a 50 percent discount in the event a person or
group acquires 20 percent or more of Corning's outstanding common stock. The preferred share purchase rights became effective July 15, 1996 and expire July 15, 2006.

12. Earnings Per Common Share

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders (the numerator) by the weighted-average number of common shares
outstanding (the denominator) for the period. Diluted earnings per share assumes that any dilutive convertible preferred shares, subordinated notes and convertible zero coupon debentures outstanding
at the beginning of the year were converted at those dates, with related preferred stock dividend requirements and outstanding common shares adjusted accordingly. It also assumes that outstanding
common shares were increased by shares issuable upon exercise of those stock options for which market price exceeds the exercise price, less shares which could have been purchased by Corning with the
related proceeds.

A
reconciliation of the basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations computations for 2000, 1999 and 1998 are as follows:

At December 31, 2000, the convertible shares from the preferred stock, the subordinated notes and the zero coupon convertible debentures were
not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share due to the anti-dilutive effect they would have had on earnings per share if converted. Also, the 2000 computation of diluted earnings per
share excluded 23.7 million options since the option exercise price was greater than the average market price of the common shares for the period.

During
the first quarter of 1999, the Convertible Monthly Income Preferred Securities (MIPS) were redeemed and converted into 34.5 million shares of Corning common stock. The MIPS
dividends paid prior to the date of the conversion are reflected within the dilutive earnings per share calculation for 1999.

At
December 31, 1998, 178,700 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock were outstanding. Each Series B share is convertible into 14.37 shares of Corning common stock. In
addition, the convertible subordinated notes were also outstanding. These notes were convertible into 5.4 million


weighted-average shares of Corning common stock. The convertible shares from the preferred stock and the subordinated notes were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share in 1998
due to the anti-dilutive effect they would have had on earnings per share if converted.

13. Stock Compensation Plans

At December 31, 2000, Corning's stock compensation programs are in accordance with the 2000 Employee Equity Participation Program and 2000 Equity Plan for
Non-Employee Directors Program (Programs). For calendar years beginning January 1, 2001, 3.5% of Corning's Common Stock Outstanding at the beginning of the year and any ungranted shares from prior
years will be available for grant in the current year. At December 31, 2000, 41.9 million shares will be available under the Programs for 2001. Any remaining shares available for grant but not yet
granted will be carried over and used in the following year.

Stock Option Plan

Corning stock option plans provide non-qualified and incentive stock options to purchase unissued or treasury shares at the market price on the grant date and
generally become exercisable in installments from one to five years from the grant date. The maximum term of non-qualified and incentive stock options is 10 years from the grant date.

Option
activity for the three years ended December 31, 2000 was:

Incentive Stock Plans

The Corning Incentive Stock Plan permits stock grants, either determined by specific performance goals or issued directly, in most instances, subject to the
possibility of forfeiture and without cash consideration.

In
2000, 1999 and 1998, grants of 1,429,000 shares, 1,236,000 shares and 2,094,000 shares, respectively, were made under this plan. The weighted-average price of the grants was $61.07
in 2000, $21.87 in 1999 and $11.17 in 1998, respectively. A total of 7.1 million shares issued remain subject to forfeiture at December 31, 2000.

In
October 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" (FAS 123). This statement defines a fair value-based
method of accounting for employee stock options and similar equity investments and encourages adoption of that method of accounting for employee stock compensation plans. However, it also allows
entities to continue to measure compensation cost for employee stock compensation plans using the intrinsic value-based method of accounting prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
"Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" (APB 25). Corning applies APB 25 accounting for its stock-based
compensation plans. Compensation expense is recorded for awards of shares or share rights over the period earned. Compensation expense of $31.0 million, $7.2 million and $5.4 million was recorded in
2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

Worldwide Employee Share Purchase Plan

In addition to the Stock Option Plan and Incentive Stock Plans, Corning has a Worldwide Employee Share Purchase Plan (WESPP). Under the WESPP, substantially
all employees can elect to have up to 10% of their annual wages withheld to purchase Corning common stock. The purchase price of the stock is 85% of the lower of the beginning-of-quarter or
end-of-quarter market price. The Corning Stock Ownership Trust is utilized to fund a portion of employee purchases of common stock under the WESPP.


Pro Forma Impact of FAS 123

Corning has adopted the disclosure-only provisions of FAS 123. If Corning had elected to recognize compensation expense under FAS 123, Corning's net income in
2000, 1999 and 1998 would have decreased by $113.8 million, $28.7 million and $19.0 million, respectively. Corning's diluted earnings per share amounts in 2000, 1999 and 1998 would have decreased by
$0.13, $0.04 and $0.02, respectively.

FAS
123 requires that reload options be treated as separate grants from the related original option grants. Under Corning's reload program, upon exercise of an option, employees may
tender unrestricted shares owned at the time of exercise to pay the exercise price and related tax withholding, and receive a reload option covering the same number of shares tendered for such
purposes at the market price on the date of exercise. The reload options vest in one year and are only granted in certain circumstances according to the original terms of the option being exercised.
The existence of the reload feature results in a greater number of options being measured.

For
purposes of FAS 123 the fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The following are weighted-average
assumptions used for grants under Corning stock plans and predecessor Oak plans in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively:

Total
rental expense amounted to approximately $72.1 million for 2000, $64.1 for 1999 and $58.3 million for 1998.

At
December 31, 2000, future minimum lease payments to be received under a noncancelable sublease to Quest Diagnostics totaled $53.5 million. Quest Diagnostics, in turn, has a
noncancelable sublease covering approximately $35.7 million of the minimum lease payments due to Corning. Corning has agreed to indemnify Quest Diagnostics should Quest Diagnostics' sublessee default
on the minimum lease payments. Additionally, Corning continues to guarantee certain obligations of Quest Diagnostics totaling $14.1 million.

In
January 1998, Corning completed a sale leaseback transaction related to certain equipment assets that resulted in gross proceeds of approximately $95 million. During 2000 Corning
elected to repurchase the assets for approximately $95 million.

The
ability of certain subsidiaries and associated companies to transfer funds is limited by provisions of certain loan agreements and foreign government regulations. At December 31,
2000, the amount of equity subject to such restrictions for consolidated subsidiaries totaled $55.1 million. While this amount is legally restricted, it does not result in operational difficulties
since Corning has generally permitted subsidiaries to retain a majority of equity to support their growth programs. At December 31,


2000, loans of equity affiliates guaranteed by Corning totaled $37.4 million. In addition, Corning and certain of its subsidiaries have provided other financial guarantees and contingent liabilities
in the form of loan guarantees, stand-by letters of credit and performance bonds. The amounts of these obligations
are represented in the following table. Corning believes that all of the guarantees and almost all of the other contingent liabilities will expire without being funded (in millions):

Hedging Activities

Corning operates and conducts business in many foreign countries. As a result, there is exposure to potentially adverse movement in foreign currency rate
changes. Corning enters into foreign exchange forward and option contracts with durations generally 12 months or less to reduce its exposure to exchange rate risk on foreign source income and
purchases. The objective of these contracts is to neutralize the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on Corning's operating results.

Corning
engages in foreign currency hedging activities to reduce the risk that changes in exchange rates will adversely affect the eventual net cash flows resulting from the sale of
products to foreign customers and purchases from foreign suppliers. The hedge contracts reduce the exposure to fluctuations in exchange rate movements because the gains and losses associated with
foreign currency balances and transactions are generally offset with gains and losses of the hedge contracts. Because the impact of movements in foreign exchange rates on hedge contracts offsets the
related impact on the underlying items being hedged, these financial instruments help alleviate the risk that might otherwise result from currency exchange rate fluctuations.

The
following table (in millions) summarizes the notional amounts and respective fair values of the derivative financial instruments at December 31, 2000. These contracts are held by
Corning and its subsidiaries and mature at varying dates:

In
December 1998, one of Corning's subsidiaries entered into financing agreements which provide for the sale of certain future yen based revenues, beginning February 1999 and expiring
in December 2001. These contracts were terminated in 2000. These contracts required the counterparty to advance U.S. dollars in amounts up to $10.1 million each month and Corning to repay the notes
only to the extent of future yen denominated revenues. The obligations under these contracts were not cancelable by either party. Borrowings under the agreements bore interest at a premium to the
Eurodollar rate. Transaction gains or losses related to these contracts were deferred and recognized as an adjustment to the revenue securing the note repayments. Borrowings were recorded on the
balance sheet only to the extent they were outstanding. The cumulative borrowings between January 2000 and July 2000 and those for February 1999 and December 1999 were $60.4 million and $95.0 million,
respectively. Cumulative repayments approximated 6.6 billion and 9.4 billion yen for the same periods.


15. Discontinued Operations

Distribution of shares of Quest Diagnostics and Covance Inc.

On December 31, 1996, Corning distributed shares of Quest Diagnostics Incorporated and Covance Inc., which collectively comprised Corning's Health Care
Services Segment, to its shareholders on a pro rata basis (the Distributions). Corning agreed to indemnify Quest Diagnostics on an after-tax basis for the settlement of certain government claims and
against certain other claims that were pending at December 31, 1996. Coincident with the Distributions, Corning recorded a payable to Quest Diagnostics of approximately $25 million, which was
management's best estimate of amounts which were probable of being paid by Corning to Quest Diagnostics to satisfy the remaining indemnified claims on an after-tax basis. Quest Diagnostics settled a
significant matter with the Department of
Justice late in 2000 requiring Corning to reimburse Quest Diagnostics $9 million. As a result, in the fourth quarter Corning released reserves totaling $12.5 million after tax in excess of the
indemnified settlement between Quest Diagnostics and the Department of Justice.

Recapitalization and sale of the consumer housewares business

On April 1, 1998, Corning completed the recapitalization and sale of a controlling interest in its consumer housewares business to an affiliate of Borden, Inc.
Corning received cash proceeds of $593 million and continues to retain a three percent interest in World Kitchen Inc., formerly Corning Consumer Products Company.

During
the fourth quarter of 1999 certain indemnification agreements related to this transaction expired. As a result, Corning recorded income from discontinued operations of $7.9
million ($4.8 million after tax), from the release of reserves provided at the date of the transaction.

Summarized
results of Corning's discontinued operations are as follows (in millions):

interest expense totaling $2.7 million in 1998. The allocation was based on the ratio of net assets of discontinued operations to consolidated net assets.
