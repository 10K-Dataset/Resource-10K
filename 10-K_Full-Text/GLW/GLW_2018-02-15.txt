Corporate

Investments

﻿

Dow Corning Corporation

and Hemlock Semiconductor Group.

Prior to

May

31, 2016, Corning and The Dow Chemical Company (“Dow Chemical”) each owned half of Dow Corning Corporation (“Dow Corning”), an equity company headquartered in Michigan that manufactures silicone products worldwide.  Dow Corning was the majority-owner of Hemlock Semiconductor Group (“HSG”), a market leader in the production of high purity polycrystalline silicon for the semiconductor and solar energy industries.

﻿

On

May

31, 2016, Corning completed the strategic realignment of its equity investment in Dow Corning pursuant to the Transaction Agreement announced in

December 201

5.  Under the terms of the Transaction Agreement, Corning exchanged with Dow Corning its 50% stock interest in Dow Corning for 100% of the stock of a newly formed entity, which holds an equity interest in

HSG

and approximately $4.8

billion

in cash.

﻿

Prior to realignment, HSG, a consolidated subsidiary of Dow Corning, was an indirect equity investment of Corning.  Upon completion of the exchange, Corning now has a direct equity investment in HSG.  Because our ownership percentage in HSG did not change as a result of the realignment, the investment in HSG is recorded at its carrying value, which had a negative carrying value of $383

million

at the transaction date.  The negative carrying value resulted from a one-time charge to this entity in 2014 for the permanent abandonment of certain assets.  Excluding this charge, the entity is profitable and is expected to recover its equity in the near term.

Raw Materials

﻿

Corning’s

manufacturing processes

and products

require

access to

uninterrupted power sources,

significant quantities of industrial water,

certain precious metals, and various batch materials.

Availability of resources (ores, minerals, polymers, helium and processed chemicals) required in manufacturing operations, appears to be adequate.  Corning’s suppliers, from time to time, may experience capacity limitations in their own operations, or may eliminate certain product lines.  Corning believes it has adequate programs to ensure a reliable supply of

raw and

batch materials

as well as

precious metals.  For many

of its

products, Corning has alternate

suppliers

that would allow operations to continue without interruption in the event of specific materials shortages.

﻿

Certain key materials and proprietary equipment used in the manufacturing of products are currently sole-sourced or available only from a limited number of suppliers.  To minimize this risk, Corning closely monitors raw materials and equipment with limited availability or which are sourced through one supplier.  However, any future difficulty in obtaining sufficient and timely delivery of components and

/or

raw materials

could result in lost sales due to delays or reductions in product shipments, or reductions in Corning’s gross margins.

﻿

Corning has a program to ensure that its facilities are in compliance with state, federal and foreign pollution-control regulations.  This program has resulted in capital and operating expenditures each year.  In order to maintain compliance with such regulations, capital expenditures for pollution control in operations were approximately

$39

million

in 2017 and are estimated to be $23

million

in 2018.

﻿

Corning’s 2017 consolidated operating results were charged with approximately $43

million

for depreciation, maintenance, waste disposal and other operating expenses associated with pollution control.  Corning believes that its compliance program

does not

place it at a competitive disadvantage.

Additional information in response to Item 1 is found in Note 20 (Reportable Segments) to the Consolidated Financial Statements and in Item 6 (Selected Financial Data).

Item 1A.  Risk Factors

﻿

We operate in rapidly changing economic

, political,

and technological environments that present numerous risks, many of which are driven by factors that we cannot control or predict.  Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows,

our ability to successfully execute our strategy and capital allocation framework,

and the trading price of our common stock or debt.  The following discussion of “risk factors” identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business, operations, financial position or future financial performance.  This information should be read in conjunction with MD&A and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated by reference into this report.  The following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider, as these factors could cause our future results to differ from those in

our

forward-looking statements and from historical trends.

﻿

As a global company, we face many risks which could adversely impact our operations and reported financial results

﻿

We are a global company and derive a substantial portion of our revenues from, and have significant operations, outside of the United States.  Our international operations include manufacturing, assembly, sales, research and development, customer support, and shared administrative service centers.

Compliance with laws and regulations increases our costs.

We are subject to both

U.S. laws and local laws which

, among other things,

include data privacy requirements, employment and labor laws, tax laws, anti-competition regulations, prohibitions on payments to governmental officials, import and trade restrictions and export requirements.  Non-compliance or violations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business.  Such violations could result in prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries and could also materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and our operating results.  Our success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate and manage these risks.

﻿

We are also subject to a variety of other risks in managing a global organization, including those related to

:

﻿

·

The e

conomic

and political

conditions in each country or region;

·

C

omplex regulatory requirements affecting international trade and investment, including anti-dumping laws, export controls, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local laws prohibiting improper payments.  Our operations may be adversely affected by changes in the substance or enforcement of these regulatory requirements, and by actual or alleged violations of them;

·

Fl

uctuations in currency exchange rates, convertibility of currencies and restrictions involving the movement of funds between jurisdictions and countries;

·

Governmental protectionist policies and sovereign and political risks that may adversely affect Corning’s profitability and assets;

·

T

ariffs, trade duties and other trade barriers including anti-dumping duties;

·

G

eographical concentration of our factories and operations

,

and regional shifts in our customer base;

·

P

eriodic health epidemic concerns;

·

P

olitical unrest, confiscation or expropriation of our assets by foreign governments, terrorism and the potential for other hostilities;

·

D

ifficulty in protecting intellectual property, sensitive commercial and operations data, and information technology systems;

·

Corning’s Display Technologies segment

generates a significant amount of the Company’s profits and cash flow

.  A

ny

significant decrease in LCD glass pricing

could have a material and negative impact on our financial results

﻿

Corning’s ability to generate profits and operating cash flow depends largely upon the profitability of our

LCD glass business

, which is subject to continuous

pricing pressure

due to

intense

industry

competition

, potential over

-capacity

, and

development of new

technologies.

If we are not

able to achieve proportionate reductions in costs or sustain our current rate of cost reduction to offset

potential

pricing pressures it

could have a material

adverse

impact on our financial results

.

﻿

Because we have a concentrated customer base in each of our businesses, o

ur sales could be negatively impacted by the actions

or insolvency

of one or more key customers

, as well as our ability to retain these customers

﻿

A relatively small number of customers accounted for a high percentage of net sales in our reportable segments.

M

ergers and consolidations between customers

could result in

further concentration of

Corning’s customer base.

If further concentration occurs or a key customer becomes insolvent, the loss of a key customer could result in a substantial loss of sales and reduction in anticipated in cash flows.  Unforeseen events or actions on the part of Corning could also result in the loss of customers, resulting in further customer concentration.

The following table details the number of combined customers of our segments that accounted for a large percentage of segment net sales:

﻿

﻿

Business disruptions could affect our operating results

﻿

A major earthquake, fire or other catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of

any of our critical facilities could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our future financial results could be materially and adversely affected.

For example, certain manufacturing sites require high quality, continuous, and uninterrupted power and access to industrial water.  Unplanned outages could have a material negative impact on our operations and ability to supply our customers.

﻿

Additionally, a significant amount of the specialized manufacturing capacity for our

reportable

segment

s

is concentrated in

single-site locations

and it is reasonably possible that the operations of one or more such facilities could be disrupted.  Due to the specialized nature of the assets, it may not be possible to find replacement capacity quickly or substitute production from

other

facilities.  Accordingly,

a disruption at a single-site manufacturing operation could significantly impact Corning’s ability to supply its customers and

could produce a near-term severe impact

on our

individual

business

es

and the Company as a whole.

﻿

Geopolitical events, as well as other events outside of Corning’s control, could cause a disruption to our manufacturing operations and adversely impact our customers, resulting in a negative impact to Corning’s net sales, net income, asset values and liquidity.

﻿

A natural disaster, epidemic, labor strike, war or political unrest may adversely affect Corning's ability to supply our customers and impact the value of our assets.  Such events may also impact our customers’ facilities and reduce our sales to such customers. For example, a sizeable portion of Corning’s glass manufacturing capacity is located in South Korea and we generate a significant portion of our sales through two South Korean customers.  Deterioration of the geopolitical climate in such a region could cause a disruption to our manufacturing operations and adversely impact our customers, resulting in a negative impact to Corning’s net sales, net income, asset values and liquidity.

﻿

We may experience difficulties in enforcing our intellectual property rights, which could result in loss of market share, and we may be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others

﻿

We rely on patent and trade secret laws, copyright, trademark, confidentiality procedures, controls and contractual commitments to protect our intellectual property rights.  Despite our efforts, these protections may be limited and we may encounter difficulties in protecting our intellectual property rights or obtaining rights to additional intellectual property necessary to permit us to continue or expand our businesses.  We cannot provide assurance that the patents that we hold or may obtain will provide meaningful protection against our competitors.  Changes in or enforcement of laws concerning intellectual property, worldwide, may affect our ability to prevent or address the misappropriation of, or the unauthorized use of, our intellectual property, potentially resulting in loss of market share.  Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights.  Litigation is inherently uncertain and outcomes are often unpredictable.  If we cannot protect our intellectual property rights against unauthorized copying or use, or other misappropriation, we may not remain competitive.

﻿

The intellectual property rights of others could inhibit our ability to introduce new products.  Other companies hold patents on technologies used in our industries and are aggressively seeking to expand, enforce and license their patent portfolios.  We periodically receive notices from, or have lawsuits filed against us by third parties claiming infringement, misappropriation or other misuse of their intellectual property rights and/or breach of our agreements with them.  These third parties often include entities that do not have the capabilities to design, manufacture, or distribute products or that acquire intellectual property like patents for the sole purpose of monetizing their acquired intellectual property through asserting claims of infringement and misuse.  Such claims of infringement or misappropriation may result in loss of revenue, substantial costs, or lead to monetary damages or injunctive relief against us.

Information technology dependency and

cyber

security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, liability claims, or competitive harm

﻿

The Company is dependent on information technology (“IT”)

systems

and infrastructure

for its business and manufacturing controls

.

Our IT systems may be vulnerable to disruptions from

human error, outdated applications,

computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access, cyber-attack and other similar disruptions.

Any significant

disruption,

breakdown, intrusion, interruption or corruption of these systems or data breaches could

caus

e the

loss of data, equipment damage, downtim

e, and/or safety related issues and could

have a material adverse effect on our business.  Like other global companies, we have, from time to time, experienced incidents related to our

IT

systems, and expect that such incidents will continue, including malware and computer virus attacks, unauthorized access, systems failures and disruptions.  We have measures and defenses in place against unauthorized access, but we may not be able to prevent, immediately detect, or remediate such events.

A material breach in the security of our IT systems could include the theft of our intellectual property or trade secrets.  Such disruptions or security breaches could result in the theft, unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property and/or confidential business information, harm our competitive position,

disrupt our manufacturing,

reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives, or otherwise adversely affect our business.

﻿

Additionally,

we believe that

utilities and other operators of critical infrastructure that serve our facilities face heightened security risks, including cyber-attack.  In the event of such an attack, disruption in service from our utility providers could disrupt our manufacturing operations which rely on a continuous source of power (electrical, gas, etc.).

﻿

We may not

earn a positive return

from our research

,

development

and engineering investments

﻿

Developing our products through

our innovation model of

research and development is expensive and often involves a long investment cycle.  We make significant

expenditures and

investments in research and development

and four process engineering platforms that may earn an economic return

.

If our investments do not provide a pipeline of new technologies that our customers demand or lower cost manufacturing platforms, it could negatively impact our revenues and operating margins both near- and long-term.

﻿

We have significant exposure to foreign currency movements

﻿

A large portion of our sales, profit and cash flows are transacted in non-U.S. dollar currencies and we expect that we will continue to realize gains or losses with respect to these exposures.  We will experience foreign currency gains and losses in certain instances if it is not possible or cost effective to hedge our currency exposures or should we elect not to hedge certain currency exposures.  Alternatively, we may experience gains or losses if the underlying exposure which we have hedged change (increases or decreases) and we are unable to reverse, unwind, or terminate the hedges concurrent with the change in the underlying notional exposure.

﻿

Our ultimate realized loss or gain with respect to currency fluctuations will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency exposures that we have, the exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, whether we have entered into foreign currency contracts to offset these exposures and other factors.  Our hedge portfolio may reduce our flexibility to respond to price moves by our Display Technologies segment competitors.

﻿

Foreign currency movements may also impact our competitive cost position relative to our largest, Japan-based competitors in the Display Technologies segment.  The profitability of customers may also be impacted as they typically purchase from us in Japanese yen and they sell in various currencies.

﻿

All of these factors could materially impact our results of operations, anticipated future results, financial position and cash flows, the timing of which is variable and generally outside of our control.

﻿

We have significant exposure to counterparties of our related derivatives portfolio

﻿

We maintain a significant portfolio of over the counter derivatives to hedge our projected currency exposure to the Japanese yen, New Taiwan dollar, South Korean won, Chinese yuan and euro.  We

are exposed to potential losses in the event of non-performance by our counterparties to these derivative contracts.

Any failure of a counterparty to pay on such a contract when due could materially impact our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

If

we are unable to obtain certain specialized equipment, raw and batch materials or natural resources required in

our products

or processes

, our business will suffer

﻿

Our ability to meet customer demand depends, in part, on our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of

equipment,

parts and components from our suppliers

.

We may experience shortages that could adversely affect our operations.  There can be no assurances that we will not encounter proble

ms in the future.  C

ertain manufacturing equipment

and

components are available only from single or limited sources

, and we

may not be able to find alternate sources in a timely manner.  A reduction, interruption or delay of supply, or a significant increase in the price for supplies, such as manufacturing equipment, precious metals, raw materials

, utilities including

energy

and industrial water

, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses.

﻿

We use specialized raw materials from single-source suppliers (e.g., specific mines or quarries) and natural resources (e.g., helium) in certain products and processes.  If a supplier is unable to provide the required raw materials or the natural resource is in scarce supply or not readily available, we may be unable to change our product composition or manufacturing process in order to prevent a disruption to our business.

﻿

We have incurred, and may in the future incur, goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges

﻿

At

December

31,


, Corning had goodwill and other intangible assets of

approximately

$

2.6

billion

.  While we believe the estimates and judgments about future cash flows used in the goodwill impairment tests are reasonable, we cannot provide assurance that additional impairment charges in the future will not be required if the expected cash flow estimates as projected by management do not occur, especially if an economic recession occurs and continues for a lengthy period or becomes severe, or if acquisitions and investments made by the Company fail to achieve expected returns.

﻿

Changes in our effective tax rate or tax liability may have an adverse effect on our results of operations

﻿

Our effective tax rate could be adversely impacted by several factors, including:

﻿

·

C

hanges in the relative amounts of income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates;

·

Changes in tax laws, tax treaties and regulations or the interpretation of them,

including the recent Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “2017 Tax Act”) passed by the U.S. Congress and signed into law on

December

22, 2017;

·

C

hanges to our assessment about the realizability of our deferred tax assets that are based on estimates of our future results, the prudence and feasibility of possible tax planning strategies, and the economic

and political

environments in which we do business;

·

T

he outcome of current and future tax audits, examinations, or administrative appeals;

·

C

hanges in generally accepted accounting principles that affect the accounting for taxes; and

·

L

imitations or adverse findings regarding our ability to do business in some jurisdictions.

﻿

We may have additional tax liabilities

﻿

We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions and are commonly audited by various tax authorities.  In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.  Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes.  Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the

final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.  The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made.

﻿

The recent 2017 Tax Act could significantly impact how U.S. global corporations are taxed.  We are in the process of evaluating the impact of this new legislation and certain

changes

could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flow.  Among other things, t

he 2017 Tax Act requires companies to pay a one-time mandatory tax on unrepatriated earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred (the “toll charge”) and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings.  The toll charge resulted in an additional $1.


billion

provisional tax expense.

However, s

ettlement of the toll charge will occur almost entirely through

the use

of existing

f

oreign

t

ax

c

redit carryovers of $1.


billion

.

﻿

Our innovation model depends on our

ability to attract and

retain specialized experts in our

core technologies

﻿

Our innovation model requires us to employ highly specialized experts in glass science, ceramic science, and optical physics to conduct our research and development and engineer our products and design our manufacturing facilities.

The loss of the services of any member of our key research and development or engineering

team

without adequate replacement, or the inability to attract new qualified personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance.

Index

We are subject to strict environmental regulations and regulatory changes that could result in fines or restrictions that interrupt our operations

﻿

Some of our manufacturing processes generate chemical waste, waste water, other industrial waste or greenhouse gases, and we are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of such substances.  We have installed anti-pollution equipment for the treatment of chemical waste and waste water at our facilities.  We have taken steps to control the amount of greenhouse gases created by our manufacturing operations.  However, we cannot provide assurance that environmental claims will not be brought against us or that government regulators will not take steps to adopt more stringent environmental standards.

﻿

Any failure on our part to comply with any present or future environmental regulations could result in the assessment of damages or imposition of fines against us, or the suspension/cessation of production or operations.  In addition, environmental regulations could require us to acquire costly equipment, incur other significant compliance expenses or limit or restrict production or operations and thus materially and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.

﻿

Changes in regulations and the regulatory environment in the U.S. and other countries, such as those resulting from the regulation and impact of global warming and CO


abatement, may affect our businesses and their results in adverse ways by, among other things, substantially increasing manufacturing costs, limiting availability of scarce resources, especially energy, or requiring limitations on production and sale of our products or those of our customers.

﻿

Current or future litigation or regulatory investigations may harm our financial condition or results of operations

﻿

As a global technology and manufacturing company, w

e are engaged in

various

litigation and regulatory matters.  Litigation and regulatory proceedings may be uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, resulting in significant liabilities, penalties or damages.  Such current or future substantial legal liabilities or regulatory actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and reputation.

﻿

Our global operations are subject to extensive trade and anti-corruption laws and regulations

Due to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of import- and export-related laws and regulations, including U.S. regulations issued by Customs and Border Protection, the Bureau of Industry and Security, the Office of Anti

-

boycott Compliance, the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls and the Office of Foreign Assets Control, as well as the counterparts of these agencies in other countries.  Any alleged or actual violation

by an employee or the Company

may subject us to government scrutiny, investigation and civil and criminal penalties, and may limit our ability to import or export our products or to provide services outside the United States.  We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.

﻿

In addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, or obtaining an unfair advantage.  Recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws.  Our continued operation and expansion outside the United States, including in developing countries, could increase the risk of alleged violations.  Violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our business, and result in an adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition.

International trade policies may

negatively

impact

our ability to sell and manufacture our products outside of the U.S.

Government policies on international trade and investment such as import quotas,

tariffs, and

capital controls, whether adopted by individual governments or addressed by regional trade blocs, can affect the demand for our products and services, impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us (including our equity affiliates/

joint ventures

) from being able to sell

and/or manufacture

products in certain countries.  The implementation of more restrictive trade policies, such as higher tariffs or new barriers to entry, in countries in which we sell large quantities of products and services could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.  For example, a government’s adoption of “buy national” policies or retaliation by another government against such policies could have a negative impact on our results of operations.  These policies also affect our equity companies.

Item 3.  Legal Proceedings

﻿

Environmental Litigation.

Corning has been named by the Environmental Protection Agency (the Agency) under the Superfund Act, or by state governments under similar state laws, as a potentially responsible party for 15 active hazardous waste sites.  Under the Superfund Act, all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site, identified by the Agency, are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the Agency agrees otherwise.  It is Corning’s policy to accrue for its estimated liability related to Superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned by Corning based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants.  At

December

31, 2017 and

December

31, 2016, Corning had accrued approximately $38

million

(undiscounted

) and $


million

(undiscounted), respectively, for the estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation.  Based upon the information developed to date, management believes that the accrued reserve is a reasonable estimate of the Company’s liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote.

OVERVIEW

﻿

Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework

﻿

In October 2015, Corning announced a strategy and capital allocation framework (the “Framework”) that reflects the Company’s financial and operational strengths, as well as its ongoing commitment to increasing shareholder value.  The Framework outlines our leadership priorities, and articulates the opportunities we see across our businesses.  We designed the Framework to create significant value for shareholders by focusing our portfolio and leveraging our financial strength.  Under the Framework we target generating $26 billion to $30 billion of cash through 2019, returning more than $12.5 billion to shareholders and investing $10 billion to extend our leadership positions and deliver growth.

﻿

Our probability of success increases as we invest in our world-class capabilities.  Corning is concentrating approximately 80% of its research, development and engineering investment and capital spending on a cohesive set of three core technologies, four manufacturing and engineering platforms, and five market-access platforms.  This strategy will allow us to quickly apply our talents and repurpose our assets as needed.

﻿

Performance against the Framework

﻿

Since introducing the Fra

mework, we have distributed $9 billion

to shareholders

through share repurchases and dividends, and increased the annual

dividend by

16.1%

in 2018, 14.8% in 2017 and 12.5% in 2016 as part of our ongoing commitment to return cash to our investors.

﻿

We also utilized our financial strength in 2017 to continue our focus on innovation, advancing key programs across our market platforms.  Some of

our

achievements in 2017 included:

﻿

·

C

elebrat

ing

a major milestone with the production of our one

billion

th kilometer of optical fiber. We also continued our technology leadership with the introduction of a new multi

-

use platform to simplify installation and reduce the costs of deploying 4G and 5G networks.

·

S

hipping the world’s first Gen 10.5 glass. In addition, we captured new

opportunities for Corning Iris™ Glass, which is featured in new ultra-slim, ultra-bright lines of monitors.

·

Expanding

into new Corning® Gorilla® Glass applications and

increasing

the amount of our glass on

mobile electronic

devices.

Additionally,

the superior drop performance of Gorilla Glass 5 has enabled new smartphone designs that feature g

lass on both the front and back

.

·

S

ecur

ing

an exclusive global supply agreement for gas particulate filters. We also won new customers for Gorilla Glass for Automotive, which is featured on

thirty-five

aut

o

motive

platforms globally.

·

Launching Valor™ Glass, a revolutionary new pharmaceutical packaging solution that dramatically reduces

particle contamination, breaks, and cracks. As a result, Valor helps protect patients, while increasing manufacturing throughput.

Results

﻿

Net sales in the year ended

December

31, 2017 were $10,116

million

, an increase of $726

million

, or 8%, when compared to the year ended

December

31, 2016.  The increase was driven by the Optical Communications and the Specialty Materials segment

s

, up $540

million

and $279

million

, respectively.  The

Environmental Technologies

and Life Sciences

segments also increased, up $74 million

and $

40 million

, respectively.

A decline in net sales of $241 million in the Display Technologies segment partially offset these increases, driven by price declines of approximately 10%.

﻿

For the year ended

December

31, 201


, we generated

a

net

loss

of $

497 million

, or $

(0.66)

per share, compared to net income of $

3,695 million

, or $

3.23

per share, for 201


.  When compared to last year, the $

4.2 billion

de

crease in net income was due to the following items (amounts presented after tax):

﻿

·

The absence of a $2.7 billion non-taxable gain and $105 million positive tax adjustment on the strategic realignment of our ownership interest in Dow Corning recorded in the second quarter of 2016;

·

The impact of the passage of the


Tax Act, including

a

provisional amount related to the one-time mandatory tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings of $1.1 billion and a provisional amount related to the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities of $347 million

;

·

The change in the amounts recorded for tax law changes, valuation allowance adjustments and other discrete tax items in the amount of $186 million;

·

Higher research, development and engineering expenses, driven by

the absence of the impact of a 2016 joint development agreement in the Display Technologies segment, as well as higher costs associated with new product launches in the Optical Communications, Specialty Materials and Environmental Technologies segments; and

·

A decrease of $104 million in net income in the Display Technologies segment, primarily driven by price declines of approximately 10%, the absence of a gain of $24 million recorded in 2016 from the contingent consideration fair value adjustment and the negative

impact of

movements in

the Japanese yen and South Korean won

in the amount of $59 million.

﻿

Partially offsetting these events were the following items:

﻿

·

A decrease in unrealized losses from our translated earnings contracts in the amount of $162 million;

·

Higher net income in the Optical Communications segment, up $96 million, driven by an 18% increase in net sales;

·

Higher net income in the Specialty Materials segment, up $75 million, driven by a 25% increase in net sales;

·

The absence of a charge of $86 million related to the resolution of an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice and related costs;

·

Higher equity earnings of affiliated

companies,

driven by an increase of $90 million in equity earnings from HSG, offset somewhat by the absence of $76 million in equity earnings from Dow Corning’s silicones business.  The HSG increase was due to higher volume, which added $33 million, and an increase of approximately $78 million in settlements of long-term sales agreements, partially offset by higher restructuring and impairment charges of $17 million;

·

A decrease in restructuring, impairment and other charges, largely due to the absence of charges incurred in 2016 associated with restructuring activity and the disposal of long-lived assets; and

·

Lower acquisition-related expenses, down $48 million, driven by the absence of costs related to the realignment of our equity interests in Dow Corning completed in the second quarter of 2016, offset slightly by several small acquisitions occurring in 2017.

﻿

The translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including the impact of hedges realized in 2017, did not materially impact Corning’s consolidated net income in the year ended December 30, 2017 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.

Corporate Outlook

We believe 2018 will be another year of strong growth and investment, consistent with our Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework, and anticipate that core sales will grow to approximately $11 billion.  In our Display Technologies segment, we expect pricing to continue to improve, with year-over-year declines reaching mid-single digits, an important milestone toward our goal of stabilizing returns.  We anticipate Corning’s LCD glass volume will grow faster than the expected LCD glass market growth of mid-single digits, driven by television screen size growth and the ramp of our Gen 10.5 facility in China.  In the Optical Communications segment, we expect sales to increase by about 10%, excluding any contribution from the pending acquisition of 3M’s Communications Market Division, driven by strong demand from carrier and enterprise network customers.  We expect high-single digit sales growth in our Environmental Technologies segment, driven by continued strength in automotive product sales, on-going improvements in the heavy-duty diesel market and from the commercial launch of gas-particulate filters.  We expect growth in the Specialty Materials segment, the rate of which will depend on new model launches and the adoption of our innovations, and anticipate mid-single digit growth in the Life Sciences segment.

The following table presents net sales by reportable segment (in

millions

):

﻿

﻿

For the year ended

December

31, 2017, net sales increased by $726

million

, or 8%, when compared to the same period in 2016.  The primary sales drivers by segment were as follows:

﻿

·

A

decrease of $241

million

in the Display Technologies segment, driven by price declines of approximately 10% and the negative impact from the weakening of the Japanese yen in the amount of $79

million

, partially offset by an increase in volume in the mid-single digits in percentage terms;

·

An increase of

$540

million

in the Optical Communications segment, due to higher sales of carrier and enterprise network products,

up $446

million

and $94

million

, respectively,

combined with the absence of production issues related to the implementation of new manufacturing software in the first quarter of 2016

and the impact of several small acquisitions completed in 2017

.  Strong growth in the North American market drove the increase in carrier network products;

·

An increase of $74

million

in the Environmental Technologies segment,

driven by higher sales of a

utomotive product

s, up

$42

million

, due to market strength in Europe, China and Asia, and initial commercial sales of gas particulate filters.  Diesel product sales increased

$32

million

with higher demand for heavy-duty diesel products in North America and Asia

;

·

An increase of $279

million

in the Specialty Materials segment, driven by strong growth in sales of Corning Gorilla Glass products, combined with an increase of $4


million

in advanced optics products;

·

An increase of $40

million

in the Life Sciences segment, driven by higher sales in North America and China; and

·

An increase of $34

million

in the All Other segment,

driven by an increase in sales in our emerging

businesses

.

﻿

Movements in foreign exchange rates did not materially impact Corning’s consolidated net sales in the year ended

December

31, 2017, respectively, when compared to the same period in 2016.

﻿

For the year ended

December

31, 2016, net sales increased by $279

million

, or 3%, when compared to the same period in 2015.  The following items drove the increase:

﻿

·

An increase of $152

million

in the Display Technologies segment, driven by the positive impact from the strengthening of the Japanese yen in the amount of $370

million

and a mid-single digit percentage volume increase, offset somewhat by LCD glass price declines slightly

higher

than 10%;

·

An increase of $25

million

in the Optical Communications segment, driven primarily by an increase of $76

million

in sales of carrier products and the impact of a small acquisition completed in the second quarter of 2016, partially offset by production issues related to the

implementation

of new manufacturing software, which constrained our ability to manufacture product in the first half of 2016;

·

A decrease of $21

million

in the Environmental Technologies segment driven by a decline of $78

million

in sales of diesel products due to the weakening of the North American truck market, offset partially by an increase of $57

million

in sales of light-duty substrates, driven by strength in the North American, European and Chinese markets;

·

An increase of $17

million

in the Specialty Materials segment, driven by an increase in sales of Corning Gorilla Glass 5 and advanced optics products;

·

An increase of $18

million

in the Life Sciences segment, driven by volume growth in Europe, North America and China; and

·

An increase of $88

million

in the All Other segment, driven primarily by our glass tubing business acquired in the fourth quarter of 2015.

﻿

In the year ended

December

31, 2016, the translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily the Japanese yen, positively affected Corning’s consolidated net sales in the amount of $330

million

when compared to the same period in 2015.

,


and


, sales in international markets accounted

for 69%, 72

% and 70%

, respectively, of total net sales.

﻿

Cost of Sales

﻿

The types of expenses included in the cost of sales line item are: raw materials consumption, including direct and indirect materials; salaries, wages and benefits; depreciation and amortization; production utilities; production-related purchasing; warehousing (including receiving and inspection); repairs and maintenance; inter-location inventory transfer costs; production and warehousing facility property insurance; rent for production facilities; and other production overhead.

﻿

Gross Margin

﻿

In the year

ended

December

31, 2017, gross margin dollars increased by $286

million

, or 8%, and gross margin as a percentage of net sales remained consistent at 40%, when compared to the same period last year.  The increase in gross margin dollars was primarily driven by

the following items:

﻿

·

H

igher volume in the Optical Communications

segment, driven by growth in North America and Europe, partially offset by higher manufacturing expenses related to capacity expansion;

·

An increase in Gorilla Glass and advanced optics product volume

, slightly offset by

higher raw materials costs; and

·

Higher light-duty substrate demand in Europe, China and Asia, offset somewhat by lower North America demand, as well as an increase in demand for heavy-duty diesel products in North America and Asia.  Partially offsetting the increase in demand was a decline in manufacturing efficiency due to the use of higher-cost manufacturing facilities and sales of lower margin products.

﻿

LCD glass price declines of approximately 10% and the

negative

impact of

movements in

the Japanese yen and South Korean won in the amount of $73

million

, which

primarily

impacted the Display Technologies segment, partially offset the increase.

﻿

In the year ended

December

31, 2016, gross margin dollars increased $93

million

, and gross margin as a percentage of net sales remained consistent at 40% when compared to the same period last year.  The increase in gross margin dollars was primarily driven by the positive impact from the strengthening of the Japanese yen in the amount of $266

million

, an increase in manufacturing efficiency and cost reductions in our Display Technologies and Optical Communications segments which added approximately $160

million

, a more favorable mix of products sold in the Optical Communications segment and an increase in volume in the mid-single digit percentage in the Display Technologies segment. Display Technologies segment price declines slightly above 10% partially offset the increase.

﻿

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

﻿

When compared to the year ended

December

31, 2016, selling, general and administrative expenses

decreased by $5

million

in the year ended

December

31, 2017.

The decrease was due to the following items:

﻿

·

A decrease of $52

million

in acquisition-related costs, driven by the absence of costs related to the realignment of our equity interests in Dow Corning completed in the second quarter of 2016, offset slightly by several small acquisitions occurring in 2017;

·

A decrease of $64

million

in litigation, regulatory and other legal costs, primarily driven by the absence of events occurring in the second quarter of 2016.  In this period, we recorded litigation and other expenses related to the resolution of an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice and an environmental matter in the amount of $98

million

, offset somewhat by the gain on the contribution of our equity interests in PCC and PCE as partial settlement of the asbestos litigation in the amount of $56

million

; and

·

A decrease of $46

million

in the mark-to-market of our defined benefit pension plans.

Offsetting these events were the following items:

﻿

·

A decrease of $32

million

in gains from the contingent consideration fair value adjustment;

·

An increase of $51

million

in the Optical Communications segment due to costs associated with

acquisitions

and growth initiatives; and

·

An increase of $24

million

in the Specialty Materials segment

in support of new product launches

.

﻿

In the year ended

December

31, 2016, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $36

million

when compared to the same period in 2015, driven primarily by the following items:

﻿

·

A decrease of $94

million

in the loss on the mark-to-market of our defined benefit pension plans;

·

The positive impact of the change in the contingent consideration fair value adjustment of $43

million

; and

·

The absence of $25

million

of post-combination expenses incurred in 2015.

﻿

Partially offsetting these events were:

﻿

·

An increase of $59

million

in acquisition-related costs primarily related to the realignment of our equity interest in Dow Corning and an acquisition completed in the second quarter of 2016;

·

An increase of $49

million

in litigation, regulatory and other legal costs, driven by the resolution of an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice and an environmental matter in the amount of $98

million

, partially offset by the gain of $56

million

on the contribution of our equity interests in PCC and PCE as partial settlement of the asbestos litigation; and

·

Higher operating expenses in the Optical Communications, Environmental Technologies and Specialty Materials segments.

﻿

When compared to the same period in 2015, as a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by 1%.

﻿

The types of expenses included in the selling, general and administrative expenses line item are: salaries, wages and benefits; travel; professional fees; and depreciation and amortization, utilities, and rent for administrative facilities.

﻿

Research, Development and Engineering Expenses

﻿

In the year ended

December

31,

2017, research, development and engineering expenses

increased by $118

million

, or 16%, when

compared to the same period last year,

driven by the absence of the impact of a 2016 joint development agreement in the Display Technologies segment, as well as higher costs associated with new product launches in the Optical Communications, Specialty Materials and Environmental Technologies segments, up $20

million

, $11

million

and $


million

, respectively.  As a percentage of sales, these expenses increased one percent when compared to the same period last year.

﻿

In the year ended

December

31, 2016, research, development and engineering expenses declined $27

million

when compared to the same period in 2015 driven by the impact of a joint development agreement with a Display Technologies customer, offset partially by project development spending in the Optical Communications, Environmental Technologies and Specialty Materials segments.  As a percentage of net sales, research, development and engineering expenses remained consistent with the same period in 2015.

Equity in Earnings of Affiliated Companies

﻿

The following provides a summary of equity earnings of affiliated companies (in

millions

):

﻿

﻿

(1)

Results include equity earnings for Dow Corning, which includes the silicones business and Hemlock Semiconductor business, through

May

(2)

Results include equity earnings for Hemlock Semiconductor Group beginning on

June

1, 2016.

﻿

On

May

31, 2016, Corning completed the strategic realignment of its equity investment in Dow Corning Corporation (“Dow Corning”) pursuant to the Transaction Agreement announced on

December

10, 2015.  Under the terms of the Transaction Agreement, Corning exchanged with Dow Corning its 50% stock interest in Dow Corning for 100% of the stock of a newly formed entity, which holds an equity interest in Hemlock Semiconductor Group and approximately $4.8

billion

in cash.

﻿

The equity in earnings line on our income statement for the

year ended

December


, 2016 reflects both the equity earnings from the silicones and polysilicones (Hemlock Semiconductor) businesses of Dow Corning from

January

1, 2016 through

May

31, 2016, the closing date of th

e Transaction Agreement, and seven

month

s

of equity earnings from Hemlock Semiconductor Group.  Prior to the realignment of Dow Corning, equity earnings from the Hemlock Semiconductor business were reported on the equity in earnings line in Corning’s income statement, net of Dow Corning’s 35% U.S. tax.  Additionally, Corning reported its tax on equity earnings from Dow Corning on the tax provision line on its income statement at a U.S. tax provision rate of 7%.  As part of the realignment, Hemlock Semiconductor Group was converted to a partnership.  Each of the partners is responsible for the taxes on their portion of equity earnings.  Therefore, post-realignment, Hemlock Semiconductor Group’s equity earnings is reported before tax on the equity in earnings line and Corning’s tax is reported on the tax provision line.

Corning’s results for the year

ending

December

31, 2017 included a total $2.


billion

worldwide tax provision, inclusive of tax on normal operations and the impacts of the 2017 Tax Act.  Given

the significant complexity of the 2017 Tax Act and anticipated future guidance from the U. S. Treasury, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) related to the 2017 Tax Act, the Se

curities Exchange Commission has issued its Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 (“SAB 118”) to provide registrants additional time to analyze and report the effects of tax reform during the “measurement period”.  Under SAB 118, the registrant is required to record those items where ASC 740 analysis is complete; include reasonable estimates and label them as provisional where ASC 740 analysis is incomplete; and if reasonable estimates cannot be made, record items under the previous tax law.  The measurement period ends on the date the entity has obtained, prepared, and analyzed the information that was needed in order to complete the accounting requirements under ASC Topic 740 and is not to exceed 1 year.

﻿

In addition to SAB 118, the FASB has issued guidance regarding how to account for tax reform as well as a proposal to reclassify stranded tax costs from AOCI to retained earnings.  Furthermore, to date, the U.S. Treasury has issued Notice 2018-07 on

December

29, 2017 and Notice 2018-13 on

January

19, 2018 with additional guidance on how to compute the toll charges.

﻿

At

December

31, 2017, we have not completed our accoun

ting for the tax effects of the enactment of the 2017 Tax Act; however, we have made a reasonable estimate of the effects on our U.S. deferred tax balances

in the amount of $347

million

, the one-time toll charge

of $1.1

billion

and the impact on our state valuation allowances

and recorded these as provisional amounts

.  The initial accounti

ng is incomplete as we need additional time and information to analyze all aspects of the newly enacted law and how it impacts our worldwide operations.

The additional information that needs to be obtained, prepared or analyzed in order to complete the accounting requirements includes receiving further guidance from the

tax

authorities; additional time to prepare basis calculations; post-enactment impacts, and further time to validate our assumptions.

﻿

We re-measured the U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, which is generally 21%.  However, we are still analyzing certain aspects of the 2017 Tax Act and refining our calculations, which could potentially affect the measurement of these balances or potentially give rise to new deferred tax amounts.  The provisional amount recorded related to the re-measurement of our deferred tax balances was $34


million

.

﻿

The one-time toll charge is based on our unrepatriated earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously deferred.  This charge resulted in an additional

provisional tax expense amount of $1.


billion

. We have not yet completed our calculation of the toll charge.  This amount may change when we finalize the calculation of unrepatriated earnings that w

ere

previously deferred from U.S. federal taxation and finalize the amounts held in cash or other specified assets.  Settlement of the toll charge will occur almost entirely t

hrough the use of existing f

oreign

t

ax

c

redit carryovers.

﻿

Corning has not made sufficient progress on estimating the impact

of tax reform on its assertion

regarding its indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings so the Company will continue to follow its historic position while it continues to analyze this issue. As of

December

31, 2017, Corning estimates that its unremitted foreign earnings were $16.9

billion

.  While Corning is not changing its assertion at this time, the Company

has

distribute

d

approximately $2

billion

in

January 201

8 from two of its foreign subsidiaries to the U.S. parent of those subsidiaries.  There are no incremental taxes beyond the toll charge due with respect to this distribution of cash.

﻿

Under its historic policy,

Corning will continue to indefinitely reinvest substantially all of its foreign earnings, with the exception of an immaterial amount of current earnings that have very low or no tax cost associated with their repatriation.  Our current analysis indicates that we have sufficient U.S. liquidity, including borrowing capacity, to fund foreseeable U.S. cash needs without requiring the repatriation of foreign cash.

﻿

Corning’s accounting for the impact of the global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) provisions of the 2017 Tax Act is incomplete and, as a result, it has not yet elected a policy to account for the GILTI provisions.

﻿

We will continue to monitor future guidance and to assess the impacts of the 2017 Tax Act.

It is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change due to one or more of the following events during the next twelve months: audit activity, tax payments, or final decisions in matters that are the subject of controversy in various jurisdictions within which we operate.  We believe we have provided adequate contingent reserves for these

events

.  However, if upon conclusion of these matters, the ultimate determination of taxes owed is for an amount materially different than our current reserves, our overall tax expense and effective tax rate could be materially impacted in the period of adjustment.

Comprehensive Income

﻿

﻿

﻿

2017 vs. 2016

For the year ended

December

31, 2017, comprehensive income decreased by $3.5

billion

, when compared to the same period in 2016, driven by a decrease in net income of $4.2

billion

and a de

crease in unamortized actuarial gains for postretirement benefit plans

.   The significant decrease in net income was largely driven by the absence of a $2.7

billion

non-taxable gain and a $105

million

positive tax adjustment on the strategic realignment of our ownership interest in Dow Corning recorded in the second quarter of 2016, combined with the impact of the passage of the


Tax Act

, which included a provisional toll charge of $1.1

billion

and a provisional charge of $347

million

as a result of the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities.  Our unamortized actuarial gains decreased driven by a decrease in the discount rates used to value our postretirement benefit obligations.

﻿

Partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in the gain

on foreign currency translation adjustments

in the amount of $850

million

(after-tax)

, largely

driven by the

weakening of foreign currencies, most significantly the South Korean won, Japanese

yen and the euro, which impacted comprehensive income in the amounts of $420

million

, $164

, respectively.

﻿

2016 vs. 2015

For the year ended

December

31, 2016, comprehensive income increased by $2,995

million

when compared to the same period in 2015, driven by an increase of $2,356

million

in net income, the positive impact of the change in foreign currency translation adjustments and an increase in unamortized actuarial gains for postretirement benefit plans.

﻿

The decrease in the loss on foreign currency translation adjustments for the year ended

December

31, 2016 in the amount of $486

million

(after-tax) was driven by the following items:  1) the decrease in the loss on the translation of Corning’s consolidated subsidiaries in the amount of $398

million

, largely driven by the strengthening of the Japanese yen; and 2) the decrease in the loss in the translation of Corning’s equity method investments in the amount of $88

million

, driven by the realignment of our ownership interests in Dow Corning.

﻿

The increase in unamortized actuarial gains for postretirement benefit plans in the amount of $120

million

(after-tax) is due to the following:  1) the decrease of $65

million

related to the reclassification of actuarial gains to the income statement, largely due to higher pension asset returns; 2) an increase in actuarial losses of $3

million

; and 3) a decrease of $188

million

in unamortized losses related to our equity companies. The significant change was driven by the release of Dow Corning’s unamortized actuarial loss, which was included in the gain on the realignment of our ownership interests in Dow Corning.

CORE PERFORMANCE MEASURES

﻿

In managing the Company and assessing our financial performance, we supplement certain measures provided by our consolidated financial statements with measures adjusted to exclude certain items, to arrive at core performance measures.  We believe

that

reporting core performance measures provides investors greater transparency to the information used by our management team to make financial and operational decisions.  Corning has adopted the use of constant currency reporting for the Japanese yen and South Korean won, and uses an internally derived yen-to-dollar management rate of ¥99 and won-to-dollar management rate of ₩1,100.

The Company believes that the use of constant currency

reporting

allows investors to

understand

our results without the volatility of currency fluctuations

, and reflects the underlying economics of the translated earnings contract

s

used to mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on our earnings and cash flows

.

﻿

Net sales, equity in earnings of affiliated companies and net income are adjusted to exclude the impacts of changes in the Japanese yen and the South Korean won, gains and losses on our translated earnings

contracts

, acquisition-related costs,

certain

discrete tax items, restructuring and restructuring-related charges, certain litigation-related expenses, pension mark-to-market adjustments and other items which do not reflect on-going operating results of the Company or our equity affiliates.  Management’s discussion and analysis on our reportable segments has also been adjusted for these items, as appropriate.  These measures are not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States (“GAAP”).  We believe investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in evaluating our results as they are more indicative of our core operating performance and how management evaluates our operational results and trends.  These measures are not, and should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP reporting measures.  With respect to the Company’s outlooks for future periods, it is not able to provide reconciliations for these non-GAAP measures because the Company does not forecast the movement of the Japanese yen and South Korean won against the U.S. dollar, or other items that do not reflect ongoing operations, nor does it forecast items that have not yet occurred or are out of the Company’s control.  As a result, the Company is unable to provide outlook information on a GAAP basis.

﻿

Core Net Sales

﻿

The following table presents core net sales by reportable segment (in

﻿

﻿

In all segments except Display Technologies, core net sales are consistent with GAAP net sales.  Because a significant portion of revenues in the Display Technologies segment are denominated in Japanese yen, this segment’s net sales are adjusted to remove the impact of translating yen into dollars.  As of

January

1, 2015, we use an internally derived management rate of ¥99, which is closely aligned to our current yen-denominated hedges

related to translated earnings.

Core Earnings

﻿

2017 vs. 2016

In the year ended December 31, 2017, we generated core earnings

of $1,756

million

or $1.72 per share, compared to core earnings generated in the year ended

December

31, 2016 of $1,774

million

, or $1.55 per share.  The decrease in core

earnings of $18 million was driven by the following items:

﻿

·

T

he absence of equity earnings of $102

million from Dow Corning’s silicones business due to our 2016 realignment of our ownership interest in Dow Corning;

·

A decrease of $62 million in the Display Technologies segment, driven by

LCD glass price declines of approximately 10%

,

partially offset by an increase in volume in the mid-single digits in percentage terms

;

·

An increase in corporate project expenses and variable compensation of $29 million and $25 million, respectively.

﻿

The decline was offset by an increase in core earnings in the Optical Communications segment of $99

million

, due to higher sales of carrier and enterprise network products, combined with the absence of the production issues in the first half of 2016 related to the implementation of new software and an increase in the Specialty Materials segment of $61

million

, driven by an increase in Corning Gorilla Glass and advanced optics products.

﻿

Although core net earnings decreased in the year ended December 31, 2017, core earnings per share increased $0.17 per share, driven by lower weighted average shares outstanding due to repurchases of our common stock in 2017.

﻿

2016 vs. 2015

In the year ended

December

31, 2016, we generated core earnings of $1,774

million

, or $1.55 per share, compared to $1,882

million

, or $1.40 per share, in the year ended

December

31, 2015.  The decrease was due to declines in the Display Technologies and Environmental Technologies segments.  Slightly offsetting the decline was higher core earnings in the Optical Communications segment, up $16

million

, driven by higher sales volume in carrier network products, the favorable translation impact from movements in foreign currency exchange rates, excluding the Japanese yen and South Korean won, of $13

million

and manufacturing efficiencies gained through cost reductions.

﻿

Included in core

earnings for the years ended

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures

We utilize certain financial measures and key performance indicators that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP to assess our financial and operating performance.  A non-GAAP financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of a company’s financial performance that (i) excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of income or statement of cash flows, or (ii) includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the comparable measure as calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statement of income or statement of cash flows.

﻿

Core net sales, core equity in earnings of affiliated companies and core earnings are non-GAAP financial measures utilized by our management to analyze financial performance without the impact of items that are driven by general economic conditions and events that do not reflect the underlying fundamentals and trends in the Company’s operations.

Our reportable segments are as follows:

﻿

·

Display Technologies – manufactures glass substrates primarily for flat panel liquid crystal displays.

·

Optical Communications – manufactures carrier and enterprise network components for the telecommunications industry.

·

Environmental Technologies – manufactures ceramic substrates and filters for automotive and diesel emission control applications.

·

Specialty Materials – manufactures products that provide more than 150 material formulations for glass, glass ceramics and fluoride crystals to meet demand for unique customer needs.

·

Life Sciences – manufactures glass and plastic labware, equipment, media and reagents enabling workflow solutions for scientific applications.

﻿

All other segments that do not meet the quantitative threshold for separate reporting have been grouped as “All Other.”

This group is primarily comprised of the results of the pharmaceutical technologies business and new product lines and development projects, as well as certain corporate investments such as Eurokera and Keraglass equity affiliates.

﻿

We prepared the financial results for our reportable segments on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information to assist in making internal operating decisions.  We included the earnings of equity affiliates that are closely associated with our reportable segments in the respective segment’s net income.  We have allocated certain common expenses among our reportable segments differently than we would for stand-alone financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.  Our reportable segments include non-GAAP measures which are not prepared in accordance with GAAP.  We believe investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in evaluating our results as they are more indicative of our core operating performance and how management evaluates our operational results and trends.  These measures are not, and should not be viewed as a substitute for GAAP reporting measures.

As Reported

﻿

2017 vs. 2016

Net sales decreased by $241 million, or 7%, in the year ended December 31, 2017, when compared to the same period in 2016, driven by price declines of

approximately 10% and

the negative impact from the weakening of the Japanese yen in the amount of $79 million, partially offset by an increase in volume in

·

A reduction of $24 million

in the gain on the fair value

adjustment of the contingent consideration resulting from the acquisition of Corning Precision Materials;

and

·

An increase of $40

﻿

·

A mid-single digit percentage increase in volume;

·

Improvements in manufacturing efficiency, which added $68

2016 vs. 2015

Core net sales decreased by $218

million

, or 6%, in the year ended

December

31, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015, driven by LCD glass price declines slightly higher than 10%, partially offset by a mid-single digit percentage volume increase.  Core earnings also decreased in this period, down $69

million

, or 6%, driven by LCD glass price declines slightly higher than 10%, partially offset by a mid-single digit percentage volume increase, improvements in manufacturing efficiency and a decline in operating expenses.

The Display Technologies segment has a concentrated customer base comprised of LCD panel and color filter makers primarily located in Japan, South Korea, China and Taiwan.  In 2017, 2016 and 2015, three customers of the Display Technologies segment, which individually accounted for more than 10% of segment net sales, accounted for a

combined 62%,



% and 6


% of total segment sales in those years.  Our near-term sales and profitability would be impacted if any of these significant customers were unable to continue to purchase our products.

﻿

Corning has invested to expand capacity to meet the projected demand for LCD glass substrates.  In 2017, 2016 and 2015, capital spending in this segment

was $795 million

, $464

million

and $594

million

, respectively.

﻿

Outlook:

For full-year 2018, Corning expects LCD glass market growth to be in the mid-single digit percentages, similar to 2017. The company expects Corning’s volume to grow faster than the market as Corning ramp

s

up the world’s first Gen 10.5 fab

$540 million, or 18%, in the year ended December 31, 2017, when compared to the same period in 2016,

due to higher sales of carrier and enterprise network products, combined with the absence of production issues related to the implementation of new manufacturing software in the first half of 2016 and the impact of several small acquisitions completed in the 2017.  Strong growth in the North American fiber-to-the-home market drove the increase in carrier network products.

﻿

Net income in the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $


million, or 39%, driven by the increase in sales described above and a decrease of $10 million in restructuring and asset write-off expenses, partially offset by capacity expansion spending and an increase in acquisition-related expenses.

2016 vs. 2015

In the year ended

December

31, 2016, net sales of the Optical Communications segment increased $25

million

, or 1%, when compared to the same period in 2015, driven by an increase in carrier network sales.  The sales increase was driven by fiber-to-the-home products in North America, higher sales of optical fiber and the impact of an acquisition completed in the second quarter of 2016.  These increases were partially offset by production issues related to the implementation of new manufacturing software, which constrained our ability to manufacture product in the first half of 2016.  Production returned to normal levels at the end of the second quarter.  The translation impact from movements in foreign currency exchange rates in 2016 negatively impacted Optical Communications net sales in the amount of $8

million

, when compared to the same period in 2015.

﻿

Net income in the Optical Communications segment increased $8

million

, or 3%, in the year ended

December

31, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015.  The increase was driven by cost reductions and the continuation of the favorable shift toward sales of our solutions products, partially offset by the impact of the production issues described above, costs incurred related to a small acquisition completed in the second quarter of 2016 and restructuring and asset write-off expenses.  Movements in foreign exchange rates positively impacted net income in the amount of $12

million

when compared to 2015.

As Reported

﻿

2017 vs. 2016

Net sales increased $74

million

, or 7% in the year ended

December

31, 2017. Automotive product sales increased by $42

million

, due to market strength in Europe, China and Asia, and initial commercial sales of gas particulate filters.  Diesel product sales increased

$32 million

with higher demand for heavy-duty diesel products in North America and Asia.

Net income in the year ended

December

31, 2017 decreased by $6

million

, or 5%, driven by expenses in support of new product launches and charges related to the disinvestment of an equity company.

Net sales in the Environmental Technologies segment decreased by $21

million

, or 2%, in the year ended

December

31, 2016 when compared to the same period in 2015, driven by a decrease of $78

million

in sales of diesel products due to the weakening of the heavy-duty diesel truck market in North America, offset partially by an increase of $57

million

in light-duty substrates sales, driven by strength in the North American, European and Chinese markets.

﻿

Net income decreased by $28

million

, or 17%, driven by lower sales of heavy-duty diesel products and our investment in capacity for our gas particulate filters.  Movements in foreign exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales and net income in this segment in the amounts of $22

Core Performance

﻿

2017 vs. 2016

In the year ended December 31, 2017, core earnings increased by $3 million, or 2%, when compared to the same period in 2016, driven by higher volume in both automotive and diesel products, offset by expenses in support of new product launches and a decline in manufacturing efficiency due to the use of higher-cost manufacturing facilities and sales of lower margin products.

﻿

2016 vs. 2015

Core earnings decreased by $25

million

, or 16%, in the year ended

December

31, 2016, driven by the items impacting our “As Reported” results described above.

﻿

The Environmental Technologies segment sells to a concentrated customer base of catalyzer and emission control systems manufacturers, who then sell to automotive and diesel engine manufacturers.  Although our sales are to the emission control systems manufacturers, the use of our substrates and filters is generally required by the specifications of the automotive and diesel vehicle or engine manufacturers.  For

﻿


In the third quarter of 2017, Corning issued ¥78 billion Japanese yen-denominated debt securities in tranches of 7, 10 and 20 years. The proceeds from these notes were received in Japanese yen and immediately converted to U.S. dollars on the date of issuance. The net proceeds received in U.S. dollars, after deducting offering expenses, was approximately $700 million.  Payments of principal and interest on the notes will be in Japanese yen, or should yen be unavailable due to circumstances beyond Corning’s control, a U.S. dollar equivalent.

﻿

In the fourth quarter of 2017, Corning issued $750

million

of 4.375% senior unsecured notes that mature on

November

15, 2057. The net proceeds of $743

million

will be used for general corporate purposes. We can redeem these notes at any time, subject to certain terms and conditions.

﻿


In the third quarter of 2016, Corning’s Board of Directors approved a $1

billion

increase to our commercial paper program, raising it to $2

billion

.  If needed, this program is supported by our $2

billion

revolving credit facility that expires in 2019.  Corning did not have outstanding commercial paper at

Fixed Rate Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, Series A

﻿

Corning has 2,300 outstanding shares of Fixed Rate Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, Series A.  The Preferred Stock is convertible at the option of the holder and the Company upon certain events, at a conversion rate of 50,000 shares of Corning’s common stock per one share of Preferred Stock, subject to certain anti-dilution provisions.  As of December 31, 2017, the Preferred Stock has not been converted, and none of the anti-dilution provisions have been triggered.

Customer Deposits

﻿

In

December 201

5, Corning announced that

with the support of the Hefei government

it will locate a Gen 10.5 glass manufacturing facility in the Hefei XinZhan General Pilot Zone in Anhui Province, China.  Glass substrate production from the new facility is expected to support mass production of LCD panels for large-size televisions beginning in 2018.

﻿

As part of this investment, Corning and a Chinese customer have entered into a long-term supply agreement that commits the customer to the purchase of Gen 10.5 glass substrates from the Corning manufacturing facility in Hefei.  This agreement stipulates that the customer will

provide a

non-refundable cash deposit in the amount of approximately $400

million

to Corning to secure rights to an amount of glass that is produced by Corning over the next 10 years.  Corning has collected the full amount of this deposit, adjusted for foreign exchange movements, receiving $185

million

of this deposit in 2016 and $197

million

in 2015.  As glass is shipped to the customer, Corning will recognize revenue and issue credit memoranda to reduce the amount of the customer deposit liability, which are applied against customer receivables resulting from the sale of glass.  In 2017, 2016 and 2015, no credit memoranda

were

issued.

﻿

Capital Spending

Capital spending

totaled $1.8

billion

Cash Flows

﻿

Summary of cash flow data (in

):

﻿

﻿

2017 vs. 2016

Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $533 million

in

the year ended December 31, 2017 when compared to the same period last year, driven by $501 million of unfavorable movements in working capital.  The negative impact of working capital changes was largely driven by an increase

of $143

million in VAT receivables in Asia, a payment of $70 million related to our obligation under the plan of reorganization for PCC (refer to Note 2 (Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information), an increase in accounts receivable and inventory to support growth in the Optical Communications, Environmental Technologies and Specialty Materials segments.

﻿

Net cash used in investing activities increased by $5.4 billion

in the year ended December 31, 2017,

when compared to the

same period last year, driven by the absence of $4.8 billion of cash received in the second quarter of 2016 on the realignment of Dow Corning, coupled with an increase of $674 million in capital expenditures largely due to capacity expansions and a decline of $92 million in liquidations of short-term investments.  A decline of $162 million in acquisition spending partially offset these events.

Net cash used in financing activities

in the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by $3.7 billion

when compared to the same period last year, driven by lower share repurchases, down $1.8 billion, proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $1.4 billion, the absence of $481 million of commercial paper repayments made in 2016 and an increase of $171 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options.

2016 vs. 2015

Net cash provided by ope

rating activities decreased $292 million

﻿

To manage interest rate exposure, the Company, from time

to time, enters into interest rate swap agreements.  We are currently party to two interest rate swaps that are designated as fair value hedges and economically exchange a notional amount of $


million

of previously issued fixed rate long-term debt to floating rate debt.  Under the terms of the swap agreements, we pay the counterparty a floating rate that is indexed to the one-month LIBOR rate.

Corning also has a commercial paper program pursuant to which we may issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes.

In the third quarter of

2016, Corning’s Board of Directors approved an increase to the allowable maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding at any time from $1

﻿

We complete comprehensive reviews of our significant customers and their creditworthiness by analyzing their financial strength at least annually or more frequently for customers where we have identified a measure of increased risk.  We closely monitor payments and developments which may signal possible customer credit issues.  We currently have not identified any potential material impact on our liquidity resulting from customer credit issues.

﻿

Our major source of funding for 2017 and beyond will be our operating cash flow, our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents and proceeds from any issuances of debt.  We believe we have sufficient liquidity for the next several years to fund operations, acquisitions, the asbestos litigation, capital expenditures, scheduled debt repayments, dividend payments and share repurchase programs.

﻿

Corning also has access to a $2

billion

unsecured committed revolving credit facility.

This credit facility

includes a leverage ratio financial covenant.  The required leverage ratio, which measures debt to total capital, is a maxim

um of 50%.  At December

31, 2017

, our leverage using this measure was

25%

and we are in compliance with the financial covenant.

﻿

Our debt instruments contain customary event of default provisions, which allow the lenders the option of accelerating all obligations upon the occurrence of certain events.  In addition, some of our debt instruments contain a cross default provision, whereby an uncured default in excess of a specified amount on one debt obligation of the Company, also would be considered a default under the terms of another debt instrument.  As of

December

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

﻿

Off balance sheet arrangements are transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which Corning has an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements.

﻿

Corning’s off balance sheet arrangements include guarantee contracts.  At the time a guarantee is issued, the Company is required to recognize a liability for the fair value or market value of the obligation it assumes.  In the normal course of our business, we do not routinely provide significant third-party guarantees.  Generally, third-party guarantees provided by Corning are limited to certain financial guarantees, including stand-by letters of credit and performance bonds, and the incurrence of contingent liabilities in the form of purchase price adjustments related to attainment of milestones.  These guarantees have various terms, and none of these guarantees are individually significant.

﻿

Refer to Note 14 (Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

﻿

For variable interest entities, we assess the terms of our interest in each entity to determine if we are the primary beneficiary.  The primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is the party that absorbs a majority of the entity’s expected losses, receives a majority of its expected residual returns, or both, as a result of holding variable interests, which are the ownership, contractual, or other pecuniary interests in an entity that change with changes in the fair value of the entity’s net assets excluding variable interests.

﻿

Corning has

identified ten entities that

qualify

as a variable interest

entity.  These entities

are

not considered to be significant to Corning’s consolidated statements of position.

﻿

Corning does not have retained interests in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serve as credit, liquidity or market risk support to that entity.

ENVIRONMENT

﻿

Corning has been named by the Environmental Protection Agency (the Agency) under the Superfund Act, or by state governments under similar state laws, as a potentially responsible party for 15 active hazardous waste sites.  Under the Superfund Act, all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site, identified by the Agency, are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the Agency agrees otherwise.  It is Corning’s policy to accrue for its estimated liability related to Superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned by Corning based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants.  At

December

31, 2017 and

December

31, 2016, Corning had accrued approximately $38

million

(undiscounted

) and $


million

(undiscounted), respectively, for the estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation.  Based upon the information developed to date, management believes that the accrued reserve is a reasonable estimate of the Company’s liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

﻿

The preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein.  The estimates that required us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments, including future projections of performance and relevant discount rates, are set forth below.

﻿

Impairment of assets held for use

﻿

We are required to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets when an indicator of impairment has been identified.  We review our long-lived assets in each quarter to assess whether impairment indicators are present.  We must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event of impairment has occurred.

﻿

Manufacturing equipment includes certain components of production equipment that are constructed of precious metals, primarily platinum and rhodium.  These metals are not depreciated because they have very low physical losses and are repeatedly reclaimed and reused in our manufacturing process over a very long useful life.  Precious metals are reviewed for impairment as part of our assessment of long-lived assets.  This review considers all of the Company’s precious metals that are either in place in the production process; in reclamation, fabrication, or refinement in anticipation of re-use; or awaiting use to support increased capacity.  Precious metals are only acquired to support our operations and are not held for trading or other non-manufacturing related purposes.

﻿

Examples of events or circumstances that may be indicative of impairments include, but are not limited to:

﻿

·

A significant decrease in the market price of an asset;

·

A significant change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset is being used or in its physical condition;

·

A significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the asset, including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator;

·

An accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of an asset;

·

A current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of an asset; and

·

A current expectation that, more likely than not, an asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life.

﻿

For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss, a long-lived asset or assets is grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.  We must exercise judgment in assessing the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.

Our assessment is performed at the reportable segment level.  For

the majority of our reportable segments, we concluded that locations or businesses

within these segments

which share production along the supply chain must be combined in order to appropriately identify cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.

﻿

For long-lived assets, when impairment indicators are present, we compare estimated undiscounted future cash flows, including the eventual disposition of the asset group at market value, to the assets’ carrying value to determine if the asset group is recoverable.  This assessment requires the exercise of judgment in assessing the future use of and projected value to be derived from the assets to be held and used.  Assessments also consider changes in asset utilization, including the temporary idling of capacity and the expected timing for placing this capacity back into production.  If there is an impairment, a loss is recorded to reflect the difference between the assets’ fair value and carrying value.  This may require judgment in estimating future cash flows and relevant discount rates and residual values in estimating the current fair value of the impaired assets to be held and used.

﻿

For an asset group that fails the test of recoverability, the estimated fair value of long-lived assets is determined using an “income approach” that starts with the forecast of all the expected future net cash flows including the eventual disposition at market value of long-lived assets, and also considers the fair market value of all precious metals.  We assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.  If there is an impairment, a loss is recorded to reflect the difference between the assets’ fair value and carrying value.  Our estimates are based upon our historical experience, our commercial relationships, and available external information about future trends.  We believe fair value assessments are most sensitive to market growth and the corresponding impact on volume and selling prices and that these are also more subjective than manufacturing cost and other assumptions.  The Company believes its current assumptions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate.

At

December

31, 2017 and

December

31, 2016, the carrying value of precious metals was higher than the fair market value by $711

million

and $890

million

, respectively.  The

majority of these

precious metals are utilized by the Display Technologies and Specialty Materials segments.  Corning believes these precious metal assets to be recoverable due to the significant positive cash flow in both segments.  The potential for impairment exists in the future if negative events significantly decrease the cash flow of these segments.  Such events include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in demand for products or a significant decrease in profitability in our Display Technologies or Specialty Materials segments.

﻿

Impairment of Goodwill

﻿

We are required to make certain subjective and complex judgments in assessing whether an event of impairment of goodwill has occurred, including assumptions and estimates used to determine the fair value of our reporting units.  We test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level and our reporting units are the operating segments or the components of operating segments which constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and is regularly reviewed by segment management.

﻿

Corning adopted

ASU 2017-04, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other

, on January 1, 2017, which

simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by removing the second step of the two-step impairment test.  The amendment requires an entity to perform its annual, or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount.  An impairment charge should be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value.

Corning has recorded goodwill in the Display Technologies,

Optical Communications

, Specialty Materials, Life Sciences and All Other operating segments.  On a quarterly basis

, or if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying amount may be impaired

, management performs a qualitative assessment of factors in each reporting unit within these operating segments to determine

if

there have been any triggering events.

We also perform a detailed quantitative impairment test every three years if no indicators suggest a test should be performed in the interim.  We use this calculation as quantitative validation of the qualitative process; this process does not represent an election to perform the quantitative impairment test in place of the qualitative review.

﻿

The following events and circumstances are considered when evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount:

﻿

·

Macroeconomic conditions, such as a deterioration in general economic conditions, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and/or other developments in equity and credit markets;

·

Market capital in relation to book value;

·

Industry and market considerations, such as a deterioration in the environment in which an entity operates, material loss in market share and significant declines in product pricing;

·

Cost factors, such as an increase in raw materials, labor or other costs;

·

Overall financial performance, such as negative or declining cash flows or a decline in actual or forecasted revenue;

·

Other relevant entity-specific events, such as material changes in management or key personnel; and

·

Events affecting a reporting unit, such as a change in the composition or carrying amount of its net assets including acquisitions and dispositions.

﻿

The examples noted above are not all-inclusive, and the Company will consider other relevant events and circumstances that affect the fair value of a reporting unit in determining whether to perform the

quantitative

goodwill impairment test.

﻿

Our goodwill recoverability assessment is based on our annual strategic planning process.  This process includes an extensive review of expectations for the long-term growth of our businesses and forecasted future cash flows.  Our valuation method is an “income approach” using a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods, plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon, are discounted to their present value using an appropriate rate of return.  Our estimates are based upon our historical experience, our current knowledge from our commercial relationships, and available external information about future trends.

If the fair value is less than the carrying value, a loss is recorded to reflect the difference between the fair value and carrying value.

﻿

Display Technologies

﻿

Goodwill for the Display Technologies segment is tested at the reporting unit level, which is also the operating segment level consisting of two components.  For the purposes of the annual goodwill impairment assessment, we have aggregated these two components into one reporting unit based upon their similar economic characteristics.

On a quarterly basis in


, management performed a qualitative assessment of factors and determined there had not been any triggering events which would indicate that the

Display Technologies

reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount.

Index

In addition to assessing qualitative factors each quarter, we performed a quantitative goodwill recoverability test in 2015 for this reporting unit.

A discount rate of 5.8% and a growth rate of 1% were used in 2015.  The results of our impairment test indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its book value by a significant amount, and as such, further goodwill impairment testing was not necessary.  We determined a range of discount rates between 3.8% and 7.8% and growth rates between 0% and 3% would not have affected our conclusion.

﻿

In addition to assessing qualitative factors each quarter, we performed a quantitative goodwill recoverability test in 2015 for this reporting unit.

A discount rate of 5.6% and a growth rate of 3% were used in 2015.  The results of our impairment test indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its book value by a significant amount, and as such, further goodwill impairment testing was not necessary.  We determined a range of discount rates between 3.6% and 7.6% and growth rates between 0% and 3% would not have affected our conclusion.

﻿

Specialty Materials

﻿

Goodwill for the Specialty Materials segment is tested at the reporting unit level, which is one level below an operating segment, as the goodwill is the result of transactions associated with a certain business within this operating segment.

On a quarterly basis in


, management performed a qualitative assessment of factors and determined there had not been any triggering events which would indicate that the Specialty Materials reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount.

﻿

In addition to assessing qualitative factors each quarter, we performed a quantitative goodwill recoverability test in 2015 for this reporting unit.

A discount rate of 5.8% and a growth rate of 3% were used in 2015.  The results of our impairment test indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its book value by a significant amount, and as such, further goodwill impairment testing was not necessary.  We determined a range of discount rates between 3.8% and 7.8% and growth rates between 0% and 3% would not have affected our conclusion.

﻿

Life Sciences

﻿

Goodwill for the Life Sciences segment is tested at the reporting unit level, which is also the operating segment level.

On a quarterly basis in


, management performed a qualitative assessment of factors and determined there had not been any

triggering events which would indicate that the Life Sciences reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount.

﻿

In addition to assessing qualitative factors each quarter, we performed a quantitative goodwill recoverability test in 2015 for this reporting unit.

A discount rate of 6% and a growth rate of 3% were used in 2015.  The results of our impairment test indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its book value by a significant amount, and as such, further goodwill impairment testing was not necessary.  We determined a range of discount rates between 4% and 8% and growth rates between 0% and 3% would not have affected our conclusion.

﻿

All Other

﻿

All Other segment is comprised of various operating segments and corporate investments that do not meet the quantitative threshold for separate reporting.  Goodwill for the All Other segment is tested at the reporting unit level, which is also the operating segment level.  For the purposes of the annual goodwill impairment assessment, we have identified two reporting units in this segment that require an assessment of their goodwill.

On a quarterly basis in


, management performed a qualitative assessment of factors and determined there had not been any triggering events which would indicate that the reporting units’ fair

value is less than the carrying amount.

﻿

In addition to assessing qualitative factors each quarter, we performed a quantitative goodwill recoverability test

s

in 2015.

A discount rate of 7.4% and a growth rate of 3% were used in 2015.  The results of our impairment test indicated that the book value of one of the reporting units exceeded its fair value by 80%.  We determined a range of discount rates between 5.4% and 9.4% and growth rates between 0% and 3% would not have affected our conclusion.  Corning concluded that a Step 2 analysis was required to measure the impairment loss for this reporting unit.

﻿

© 2018 Corning Incorporated. All Rights Reserved


Index

Our Step 2 test consisted of identifying the underlying net assets in the reporting unit, allocating the implied purchase price to the asset and liabilities of the reporting unit and the calculation of the implied fair value of goodwill and the resulting impairment loss.  In

December 201

5, we recorded a goodwill impairment loss of $29

million

related to this reporting unit.

﻿

Restructuring charges and impairments resulting from restructuring actions

﻿

We are required to assess whether and when a restructuring event has occurred and in which periods charges related to such events should be recognized.  We must estimate costs of plans to restructure including, for example, employee termination costs.  Restructuring charges require us to exercise judgment about the expected future of our businesses, of portions thereof, their profitability, cash flows and in certain instances eventual outcome.  The judgment involved can be difficult, subjective and complex in a number of areas, including assumptions and estimates used in estimating the future profitability and cash flows of our businesses.

﻿

Restructuring events often give rise to decisions to dispose of or abandon certain assets or asset groups which, as a result, require impairment.  We are required to carry assets to be sold or abandoned at the lower of cost or fair value.  We must exercise judgment in assessing the fair value of the assets to be sold or abandoned.

﻿

Income taxes

﻿

We are required to exercise judgment about our future results in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets.  Inherent in this estimation process is the requirement for us to estimate future book and taxable income and possible tax planning strategies.  These estimates require us to exercise judgment about our future results, the prudence and feasibility of possible tax planning strategies, and the economic environments in which we do business.  It is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to allowances.

﻿

Corning accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes

, which requires that companies

only record tax benefits for technical positions that

are

believe

d to

have a greater than 50% likelihood of being sustained on their technical merits and then only to the extent of the amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement.  In estimating these amounts, we must exercise judgment around factors such as the weighting of the tax law in our favor, the willingness of a tax authority to aggressively pursue a particular position, or alternatively, consider a negotiated compromise, and our willingness to dispute a tax authorities assertion to the level of appeal we believe is required to sustain our position.  As a result, it is possible that our estimate of the benefits we will realize for uncertain tax positions may change when we become aware of new information affecting these judgments and estimates.

﻿

At

December

31, 2017, Corning has not completed its accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the 2017 Tax Act.  Pursuant to SAB 118, the Company has made a reasonable estimate of the effects on its U.S. deferred tax balances, the one-time toll charge and the impact on its state valuation allowances.  In addition,

Corning has not made sufficient progress on estimating the impact of tax reform on its assertion

regarding its indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings so the Company will continue to follow its historic position while it continues to analyze this issue.

In addition,

Corning’s accounting for the impact of the global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) provisions of the 2017 Tax Act is incomplete and, as a result, it has not yet elected a policy to account for the GILTI provisions.

﻿

The initial accounting is incomplete as we need additional time and information to analyze all aspects of the newly enacted law and how it impacts our worldwide operations.

The additional information that needs to be obtained, prepared or analyzed in order to complete the accounting requirements includes receiving further guidance from the tax authorities; additional time to prepare basis calculations; post enactment impacts and further time to validate of our assumptions.

Equity method investments

﻿

On

May

31, 2016, Corning completed the strategic realignment of its equity investment in Dow Corning pursuant to the Transaction Agreement announced on

December

10, 2015.  Under the terms of the Transaction Agreement, Corning exchanged with Dow Corning its 50% stock interest in Dow Corning for 100% of the stock of a newly formed entity, which holds an equity interest in Hemlock Semiconductor Group and approximately $4.8

billion

in cash.

The equity in earnings line on our income statement for the year ended

31, 2016 reflects the equity earnings from the silicones and polysilicones (Hemlock Semiconductor) businesses of Dow Corning from

January

1, 2016 through

May

31, 2016, the closing date of the Transaction Agreement, and seven months of equity earnings from Hemlock Semiconductor Group.  Prior to the realignment of Dow Corning, equity earnings from the Hemlock Semiconductor business were reported on the equity in earnings line in Corning’s income statement, net of Dow Corning’s 35% U.S. tax.  Additionally, Corning reported its tax on equity earnings from Dow Corning on the tax provision line on its income statement at a U.S. tax provision rate of 7%.  As part of the realignment, Hemlock Semiconductor Group was converted to a partnership.  Each of the partners is responsible for the taxes on their portion of equity earnings.  Therefore, post-realignment, Hemlock Semiconductor Group’s equity earnings is reported before tax on the equity in earnings line and Corning’s tax is reported on the tax provision line.

﻿

At December

31, 2017

and


, the carrying value

of our equity method investment assets

was $280

million and

$

269 million, respectively.  In addition, we also have an equity investment (HSG) with a negative carrying value of $105 million.

The negative carrying value resulted from a one-time charge to this entity in 2014 for the permanent abandonment of certain assets.

We review our equity method investments for indicators of impairment on a periodic basis or if events or circumstances change to indicate the carrying amount may be other-than-temporarily impaired.  When such indicators are present, we then perform an in-depth review for impairment.  An impairment assessment requires the exercise of judgment related to key assumptions such as forecasted revenue and profitability, forecasted tax rates, foreign currency exchange rate movements, terminal value assumptions, historical experience, our current knowledge from our commercial relationships, and available external information about future trends.  As of

December

31, 2017

and


, we have not identified any instances where the carrying values of our equity method investments were not recoverable.

﻿

Fair value measures

﻿

As required, Corning uses two kinds of inputs to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities: observable and unobservable.  Observable inputs are based on market data or independent sources, while unobservable inputs are based on the Company’s own market assumptions.  Once inputs have been characterized, we prioritize the inputs used to measure fair value into one of three broad levels.  Characterization of fair value inputs is required for those accounting pronouncements that prescribe or permit fair value measurement.  In addition, observable market data must be used when available and the highest-and-best-use measure should be applied to non-financial assets.  Corning’s major categories of financial assets and liabilities required to be measured at fair value are short-term and long-term investments, certain pension asset investments and derivatives.  These categories use observable inputs only and are measured using a market approach based on quoted prices in markets considered active or in markets in which there are few transactions.

﻿

Derivative assets and liabilities may include interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts that are measured using observable quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities.  Included in our forward exchange contracts are foreign currency hedges that hedge our translation exposure resulting from movements in the Japanese yen, South Korean won

,

euro

, New Taiwan dollar and Chinese yuan

.  These contracts are not designated as accounting hedges, and changes in their fair value are recorded in earnings in the

translated earnings contract (loss)

gain, net line of the Consolidated Statements of

(Loss)

Income.  In arriving at the fair value of Corning’s derivative assets and liabilities, we have considered the appropriate valuation and risk criteria, including such factors as credit risk of the relevant party to the transaction.  Amounts related to credit risk are not material.

﻿

Refer to Note 16 (Fair Value Measurements) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

﻿

Probability of litigation outcomes

﻿

We are required to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain.  In making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters, we consider the evaluation of legal counsel knowledgeable about each matter, case law, and other case-specific issues.  See Part II – Item 3. Legal Proceedings for a discussion of

Corning’s

material litigation matters.

﻿

Other possible liabilities

﻿

We are required to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain.  In making determinations of likely outcomes of certain matters, including certain tax planning and environmental matters, these judgments require us to consider events and actions that are outside our control in determining whether probable or possible liabilities require accrual or disclosure.  It is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to accruals.

Pension and other postretirement employee benefits (OPEB)

﻿

Corning offers employee retirement plans consisting of defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic and international employees and postretirement plans that provide health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retirees and dependents.  The costs and obligations related to these benefits reflect the Company’s assumptions related to general economic conditions (particularly interest rates), expected return on plan assets, rate of compensation increase for employees and health care trend rates.  The cost of providing plan benefits depends on demographic assumptions including retirements, mortality, turnover and plan participation.  While management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect Corning’s employee pension and other postretirement obligations, and current and future expense.

﻿

Costs for our defined benefit pension plans consist of two elements:  1) on-going costs recognized quarterly, which are comprised of service and interest costs, expected return on plan assets and amortization of prior service costs; and 2) mark-to-market gains and losses outside of the corridor, where the corridor is equal to 10% of the greater of the benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets at the beginning of the year, which are recognized annually in the fourth quarter of each year.  These gains and losses result from changes in actuarial assumptions for discount rates and the differences between actual and expected return on plan assets.  Any interim remeasurements triggered by a curtailment, settlement or significant plan changes, as well as any true-up to the annual valuation, are recognized as a mark-to-market adjustment in the quarter in which such event occurs.

﻿

Costs for our OPEB plans consist of on-going costs recognized quarterly, and are comprised of service and interest costs, amortization of prior service costs and amortization of actuarial gains and losses.  We recognize the actuarial gains and losses resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions for discount rates as a component of Stockholders’ Equity on our consolidated balance sheets on an annual basis and amortize them into our operating results over the average remaining service period of employees expected to receive benefits under the plans, to the extent such gains and losses are outside of the corridor.

﻿

Prior to the

December

31, 2015 valuation of its defined benefit pension and OPEB plans, Corning used the traditional, single weighted-average discount rate approach to develop the obligation, interest cost and service cost components of net periodic benefit cost for its defined benefit pension and OPEB plans.  The individual spot rates from the yield curve are used in measuring the pension plan projected benefit obligation (PBO) or OPEB plan accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) at the measurement date.  The benefit obligation is effectively calculated as the aggregate present value at the measurement date of each future benefit payment related to past service, with each payment discounted using a spot rate from a high-quality corporate bond yield curve that matches the duration of the benefit payment.  Under Corning’s traditional, single weighted-average discount rate approach, a single weighted-average rate is developed from the approach described above and rounded to the nearest 25 basis points.  Traditionally, the weighted-average discount rate is determined at the plan measurement date, based on the same projected future benefit payments used in developing the benefit obligation.  The traditional single weighted-average discount rate represents the constant annual rate that would be required to discount all future benefit payments related to past service from the date of expected future payment to the measurement date such that the aggregate present value equals the benefit obligation.

﻿

Beginning with the

December

31, 2015 valuation of its defined benefit pen

sion and OPEB plans, Corning changed

its methodology of determining the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs to a more granular approach.  Under the new approach, the cash flows from each applicable pension and OPEB plan are used to directly calculate the benefit obligation, service cost and interest cost using the spot rates from the applicable yield curve.

﻿

Moving to a more granular approach has a limited impact on the determination of the respective benefit obligations.  The only impacts

are

as a result of the elimination of the rounding of the discount rate that occurred in the traditional approach and the use of specific cash flows for Corning’s non-qualified pension plans, while separately applying the yield curve to each separate OPEB plan instead of aggregating the OPEB plan cash

flows.  For

Corning’s pension plans, this change will increase the immediate recognition of actuarial losses (or decrease the immediate recognition of actuarial gains), due to Corning’s previous election to immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses outside of the corridor.  For Corning’s OPEB plans, this change will increase the accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) account balance due to the accumulation of lower actuarial gains or higher actuarial losses.  Over time, the amortization of the actuarial losses from AOCI will begin to reduce the savings from the lower interest cost and service cost.

﻿

This change

was

a change in accounting estimate and therefore

was applied prospectively

beginning with the measurement date of

December

31, 2015.  No restatement of prior periods is required.

Revenue recognition

﻿

The Company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned.  In certain instances, revenue recognition is based on estimates of fair value of deliverables as well as estimates of product returns, allowances, discounts, and other factors.  These estimates are supported by historical data.  Corning also has contractual arrangements with certain customers in which we recognize revenue on a completed contract basis.  Revenues under the completed-contract method are recognized upon substantial completion, defined as acceptance by the customer and compliance with performance specifications as agreed upon in the contract, which in certain instances require

s

estimates and judgments in determining the timing of substantial completion of the contract.  While management believes that the estimates used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in estimates may affect Corning’s future results.

﻿

Share-Based Compensation

﻿

Share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period.  Determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating expected dividends.  In addition, judgment is also required in estimating the amount of share-based awards that are expected to be forfeited.  If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, share-based compensation expense and our results of operations could be impacted.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

﻿

The statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, in reports subsequently filed by Corning with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K, and related comments by management that are not historical facts or information and contain words such as

“will,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “seek,” “see,” “would,” and “target” and similar expressions are forward-looking statements.  Such statements relate to future events that by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain.

﻿

Although the company believes that these forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions regarding, among other things, current estimates and forecasts, general economic conditions, its knowledge of its business, and key performance indicators that impact the company, actual results could differ materially.  The company does not undertake to update forward-looking statements.  Some of the risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to:

﻿

-

Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks

﻿

We operate and conduct business in many foreign countries and as a result are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates.  Our exposure to exchange rates has the following effects:

﻿

·

Exchange rate movements on financial instruments and transactions denominated in foreign currencies that impact earnings; and

·

Exchange rate movements upon conversion of net assets and net income of foreign subsidiaries for which the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, which impact our net equity.

﻿

Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the Japanese yen, South Korean won, New Taiwan dollar, Chinese

yuan

, and the euro.  We seek to mitigate the impact of exchange rate movements in our income statement by using over-the-counter (OTC) derivative instruments including foreign exchange forward and option contracts.  In general, these hedges expire coincident with the timing of the underlying foreign currency commitments and transactions.

﻿

We are exposed to potential losses in the event of non-performance by our counterparties to these derivative contracts.  However, we minimize this risk by maintaining a diverse group of highly-rated major international financial institutions as our counterparties.  We do not expect to record any losses as a result of such counterparty default.  Neither we nor our counterparties are required to post collateral for these financial instruments.

﻿

Our cash flow hedging activities utilize OTC foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that movements in exchange rates will adversely affect the net cash flows resulting from the sale of products to foreign customers and purchases from foreign suppliers.  We also use OTC foreign exchange forward and option contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes.  The undesignated hedges limit exposures to foreign functional currency fluctuations related to certain subsidiaries’ monetary assets, monetary liabilities and net earnings in foreign currencies.  A significant portion of the Company’s non-U.S. revenues are denominated in Japanese yen.  When these revenues are translated back to U.S. dollars, the Company is exposed to foreign exchange rate movements in the Japanese yen.  To protect translated earnings against movements in the Japanese yen, the Company has entered into a series of average rate forwards

and other derivative instruments

.

﻿

We use a sensitivity analysis to assess the market risk associated with our foreign currency exchange risk.  Market risk is defined as the potential change in fair value of assets and liabilities resulting from an adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates.  At

December

31, 201


, with respect to open foreign exchange forward and option contracts, and foreign denominated debt with values exposed to exchange rate movements, a 10% adverse movement in quoted foreign currency exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of $

1.4

billion

compared to $

1.6

billion

at

December

31, 201


.  Specific to the Japanese

yen, a 10% adverse movement in quoted yen exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of $1,


million

compared to $1,458

million

at

December

31, 2016.  Specific to the South Korean won, a 10% adverse movement in quoted South Korean won exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of $88

million

compared to $79

million

at

December

31, 2016.  The Company expects that these

hypothetical losses from a 10% adverse movement in quoted foreign currency exchange rates on the derivative financial instruments should

largely

offset gains and losses on the assets, liabilities and future transactions being hedged.

﻿

Because we derive

approximately

69%

of our net sales from outside the U.S., our sales and net income could be affected if the U.S. dollar significantly strengthens or weakens against foreign currencies, most notably the Japanese yen, South Korean won, and euro.  As an example of the impact that changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have on our financial results, we compare 201


actual sales in yen, won and euro transaction currencies at an average currency exchange rate during the year to a 10% change in the currency exchange rate.  A plus or minus 10

% movement in the U.S. dollar – Japanese yen exchange rate would result in a change to 2017 net sales of approximately $300

million

.  A plus or minus 10% movement in the U.S. dollar – South Korean won and U.S. dollar – euro exchange rates would result in a change to 2017 net sales of approximately $6

million

and $96

million

, respectively.  We estimate that a plus or minus 10% movement in the U.S. dollar – Japanese yen exchange rate would result in a change to 2017 net income attributable to Corning Incorporated of approximately $187

million

.  A plus or minus 10% movement in the U.S. dollar – South Korean won and U.S. dollar – euro exchange rates would result in a change to 2017 net income attributable to Corning Incorporated of approximately $63

million

and $5

million

, respectively

.

﻿

Interest Rate Risk Management

﻿

To manage interest rate exposure, the Company, from time to time, enters into interest rate swap agreements.  We are currently party to two interest rate swaps that are designated as fair value hedges and economically exchange a notional amount of $


million

of previously issued fixed rate long-term debt to floating rate debt.  Under the terms of the swap agreements, we pay the counterparty a floating rate that is indexed to the one-month LIBOR rate.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our principal executive and principal financial officers, after evaluating the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this report, have concluded that based on the evaluation of these controls and procedures required by paragraph (b) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15, that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

﻿

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

﻿

(a)

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

﻿

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate disclosure controls and procedures and adequate internal control over financial reporting for Corning.  Management is also responsible for the assessment of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.

﻿

Disclosure controls and procedures mean controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms.  Corning’s disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by Corning in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to Corning’s management, including Corning’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or other persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

﻿

Corning’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Corning’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of Corning’s assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that Corning’s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of Corning’s management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of Corning’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.

﻿

Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the system of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

(2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  Management’s assessment of internal control over financial reporting includes controls over recognition of equity earnings and equity investments by Corning.  Internal control over financial reporting for

Hemlock Semiconductor Group

is the responsibility of

its

management.

Based on this evaluation, management concluded that Corning’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of

December

31, 201


.  The effectiveness of Corning’s internal control over financial reporting as of

December

31, 201


, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Corning Incorporated:

﻿

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting

﻿

We have audited the accompanying

consolidated

balance sheets of Corning Incorporated and its subsidiaries

as of

December

31, 2017

and 2016

,

and the related

consolidated

statements of (loss) income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended

December

31, 2017, including the related notes and schedule of valuation accounts and reserves for each of the three years in the period ended

December

31, 2017 appearing under Item 15 (a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”).

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of

December

31, 2017, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

(2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

﻿

In our opinion, the consolidated

financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of

December

31, 2017

and 2016

,

and the results of its

operations and its

cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended

December

31, 2017

in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of

December

31, 2017, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

(2013)

issued by the COSO.

﻿

Basis for Opinions

﻿

The Company's management is responsible for these

consolidated

financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting

, included in Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A

.  Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s

consolidated

financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our

audits.  We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

﻿

We conducted our

audits i

n accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the

consolidated

financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

﻿

Our audits of the

consolidated

financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the

consolidated

financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.  Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the

consolidated

financial statements.  Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the

consolidated

financial statements.  Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.  Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

﻿

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

﻿

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

﻿

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Corning Incorporated is a provider of high-performance glass for notebook computers, flat panel desktop monitors, LCD televisions, and other information display applications; carrier network and enterprise network products for the telecommunications industry; ceramic substrates for gasoline and diesel engines in automotive and heavy duty vehicle markets; laboratory products for the scientific community and specialized polymer products for biotechnology applications; advanced optical materials for the semiconductor industry and the scientific community; and other technologies.  In these notes, the terms “Corning,” “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our” mean Corning Incorporated and subsidiary companies.

﻿

Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation

﻿

Our consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. and include the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of all majority-owned subsidiaries over which Corning exercises control.

﻿

The equity method of accounting is used for investments in affiliated companies that are not controlled by Corning and in which our interest is generally between

20%

and

50%

and we have significant influence over the entity.  Our share of earnings or losses of affiliated companies, in which at least

20%

of the voting securities is owned and we have significant influence but not control over the entity, is included in consolidated operating results.

﻿

We use the cost method to account for our investments in companies that we do not control and for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies.  In accordance with the cost method, these investments are recorded at cost or fair value, as appropriate.

﻿

All material intercompany accounts, transactions and profits are eliminated in consolidation.

﻿

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current-year presentation.  These reclassifications had no impact on our results of operations, financial position, or changes in shareholders’ equity.

﻿

Dow Corning

﻿

Prior to

May

31, 2016, Corning and Dow Chemical each owned half of Dow Corning, an equity company headquartered in Michigan that manufactures silicone products worldwide.  Dow Corning was the majority-owner of HSG, a market leader in the production of high purity polycrystalline silicon for the semiconductor and solar energy industries.  On

May

31, 2016, Corning completed the strategic realignment of its equity investment in Dow Corning pursuant to the Transaction Agreement announced in

December 201

5.  Under the terms of the Transaction Agreement, Corning exchanged with Dow Corning its

50%

stock interest in Dow Corning for

100%

of the stock of a newly formed entity, which holds an equity interest in HSG and approximately

$4.8

billion

in cash.  Prior to realignment, HSG, a consolidated subsidiary of Dow Corning, was an indirect equity investment of Corning.  Upon completion of the exchange, Corning now has a direct equity investment in HSG.

﻿

Use of Estimates

﻿

The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes.  Significant estimates and assumptions in these consolidated financial statements include estimates of fair value associated with revenue recognition, restructuring charges, goodwill and long-lived asset impairment tests, estimates of acquired assets and liabilities, estimates of fair value of investments, equity interests, environmental and legal liabilities, income taxes and deferred tax valuation allowances, assumptions used in calculating pension and other postretirement employee benefit expenses and the fair value of share-based compensation.  Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results reported in future periods may be different from these estimates.

﻿

Revenue Recognition

﻿

Revenue for sales of goods is recognized when a firm sales agreement is in place, delivery has occurred and sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured.  If customer acceptance of products is not reasonably assured, sales are recorded only upon formal customer acceptance.  Sales of goods typically do not include multiple product and/or service elements.

﻿

At the time revenue is recognized, allowances are recorded, with the related reduction to revenue, for estimated product returns, allowances and price discounts based upon historical experience and related terms of customer arrangements.  Where we have offered product warranties, we also establish liabilities for estimated warranty costs based upon historical experience and specific warranty provisions.  Warranty liabilities are adjusted when experience indicates the expected outcome will differ from initial estimates of the liability.

﻿

In addition, Corning also has contractual arrangements with certain customers in which we recognize revenue on a completed contract basis.  Revenues under the completed-contract method are recognized upon substantial completion, defined as acceptance by the customer and compliance with performance specifications as agreed upon in the contract.  The Company acts as a principal under the contracts, and recognizes revenues with corresponding cost of revenues on a gross basis for the full amount of the contract.

﻿

Research and Development Costs

﻿

Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred.  Research and development costs totaled

$689

million

in 2017,

$637

million

in 2016 and

$638

million

in 2015.

﻿

Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions

﻿

The determination of the functional currency for Corning’s foreign subsidiaries is made based on the appropriate economic factors.  For most foreign operations, the local currencies are generally considered to be the functional currencies.  Corning’s most significant exception is our Taiwanese subsidiary, which uses the Japanese yen as its functional currency.  For all transactions denominated in a currency other than a subsidiary’s functional currency, exchange rate gains and losses are included in income for the period in which the exchange rates changed.  We recorded foreign currency transaction gains of

$20

million

and

$21

million

for the years ended

December

31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and foreign currency transaction losses of

$22

million

for the year ended

December

31, 2015.  These amounts were recorded in the line item Other expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of

(Loss)

Income.

﻿

Foreign subsidiary functional currency balance sheet accounts are translated at current exchange rates, and statement of operations accounts are translated at average exchange rates for the year.  Translation gains and losses are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders’ equity.  The effects of remeasuring non-functional currency assets and liabilities into the functional currency are included in current earnings, except for those related to intra-entity foreign currency transactions of a long-term investment nature, which are recorded together with translation gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders’ equity.  Upon sale or substantially complete liquidation of an investment in a foreign entity, the amount of net translation gains or losses that have been accumulated in other comprehensive income attributable to that investment are reported as a gain or loss for the period in which the sale or liquidation occurs.

﻿

Share-Based Compensation

﻿

Corning’s share-based compensation programs include employee stock option grants, time-based restricted stock awards and time-based restricted stock units, as more fully described in Note 19 (Share-based Compensation) to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

﻿

The cost of share-based compensation awards is equal to the fair value of the award at the date of grant and compensation expense is recognized for those awards earned over the vesting period.  Corning estimates the fair value of share-based awards using a multiple-point Black-Scholes option valuation model, which incorporates assumptions including expected volatility, dividend yield, risk-free rate, expected term and departure rates.

﻿

Cash and Cash Equivalents

﻿

Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash.  We consider securities with contractual maturities of three months or less, when purchased, to be cash equivalents.  The carrying amount of these securities approximates fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments.

﻿

Supplemental disclosure of cash flow information follows (in

millions

):

﻿

﻿

(1)

Included in this amount are approximately

$36

million

,

$23

million

and

$35

million

of interest costs that were capitalized as part of property, plant and

equipment

, net of accumulated depreciation, in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

﻿

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

﻿

The Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts is determined based on a variety of factors that affect the potential collectability of the related receivables, including length of time receivables are past due, customer credit ratings, financial stability of customers, specific one-time events and past customer history.  In addition, in circumstances where the Company is made aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations, a specific allowance is established.  The majority of accounts are individually evaluated on a regular basis and appropriate reserves are established as deemed appropriate based on the above criteria.

﻿

Environmental Liabilities

﻿

The Company accrues for its environmental investigation, remediation, operating and maintenance costs when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.  For environmental matters, the most likely cost to be incurred is accrued based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site, current laws and regulations and prior remediation experience.  For sites with multiple potential

ly

responsible parties, the Company considers its likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation costs and the ability of the other parties to fulfill their obligations in establishing a provision for those costs.  Where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely to occur than another, the minimum amount is accrued.  When future liabilities are determined to be reimbursable by insurance coverage, an accrual is recorded for the potential liability and a receivable is recorded related to the insurance reimbursement when reimbursement is virtually certain.

﻿

The uncertain nature inherent in such remediation and the possibility that initial estimates may not reflect the final outcome could result in additional costs being recognized by the Company in future periods.

﻿

Inventories

﻿

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out basis) or market.

﻿

Property, Plant and Equipment, Net of Accumulated Depreciation

﻿

Land, buildings, and equipment, including precious metals, are recorded at cost.  Depreciation is based on estimated useful lives of properties using the straight-line method.  Except as described in Note 9 (Property, Plant and Equipment, Net of Accumulated Depreciation) to the Consolidated Financial Statements related to the depletion of precious metals, the estimated useful lives range from


to


years for buildings and


to


years for equipment.

﻿

Included in the subcategory of equipment are the following types of assets (excluding precious metals):

﻿

﻿

Manufacturing equipment includes certain components of production equipment that are constructed of precious metals.  These assets are not depreciated because they have very low physical losses and are repeatedly reclaimed and reused in our manufacturing process over a very long useful life.  We treat the physical loss of precious metals in the manufacturing and reclamation process as depletion and account for these losses as a period expense based on actual units lost.  Precious metals are integral to many of our glass production processes.  They are only acquired to support our operations and are not held for trading or other purposes.

﻿

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

﻿

Goodwill is the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination.  Goodwill relates to and is assigned directly to a specific reporting unit.  Reporting units are either operating segments or one level below the operating segment.  Impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level.  Goodwill is reviewed for indicators of impairment quarterly or if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired.  Corning also performs a detailed quantitative impairment test every three years if no indicators suggest a test should be performed in the interim.  We use this calculation as quantitative validation of the qualitative process; this process does not represent an election to perform the quantitative impairment test in place of the qualitative review.

﻿

The qualitative process includes an extensive review of expectations for the long-term growth of our businesses and forecasting future cash flows.  If we are required to perform the quantitative impairment analysis, our valuation method is an “income approach” using a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods, plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon, are discounted to their present value using an appropriate rate of return.  Our estimates are based upon our historical experience, our current knowledge from our commercial relationships, and available external information about future trends.  If the fair value is less than the carrying value, a loss is recorded to reflect the difference between the fair value and carrying value.

﻿

Other intangible assets include patents, trademarks, and other intangible assets acquired from an independent party.  Such intangible assets have a definite life and are amortized on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives ranging from


to


years.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

﻿

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

﻿

We review the recoverability of our long-lived assets, such as plant and equipment and intangible assets, when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable.  When impairment indicators are present, we compare estimated undiscounted future cash flows, including the eventual disposition of the asset group at market value, to the assets’ carrying value to determine if the asset group is recoverable.  For an asset group that fails the test of recoverability, the estimated fair value of long-lived assets is determined using an “income approach” that starts with the forecast of all the expected future net cash flows including the eventual disposition at market value of long-lived assets, and also considers the fair market value of all precious metals.  We assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.  If there is an impairment, a loss is recorded to reflect the difference between the assets’ fair value and carrying value.  Refer to Note 2 (Restructuring, Impairment and Other Charges) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more detail.

﻿

Employee Retirement Plans

﻿

Corning offers employee retirement plans consisting of defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic and international employees and postretirement plans that provide health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retirees and dependents.  The costs and obligations related to these benefits reflect the Company’s assumptions related to general economic conditions (particularly interest rates), expected return on plan assets, rate of compensation increase for employees and health care trend rates.  The cost of providing plan benefits depends on demographic assumptions including retirements, mortality, turnover and plan participation.

﻿

Costs for our defined benefit pension plans consist of two elements:  1) on-going costs recognized quarterly, which are comprised of service and interest costs, expected return on plan assets and amortization of prior service costs; and 2) mark-to-market gains and losses outside of the corridor, where the corridor is equal to

10%

of the greater of the benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets at the beginning of the year, which are recognized annually in the fourth quarter of each year.  These gains and losses result from changes in actuarial assumptions for discount rates and the differences between actual and expected return on plan assets.  Any interim remeasurements triggered by a curtailment, settlement or significant plan changes, as well as any true-up to the annual valuation, are recognized as a mark-to-market adjustment in the quarter in which such event occurs.

﻿

Costs for our postretirement benefit plans consist of on-going costs recognized quarterly, and are comprised of service and interest costs, amortization of prior service costs and amortization of actuarial gains and losses.  We recognize the actuarial gains and losses resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions for discount rates as a component of Shareholders’ Equity on our consolidated balance sheets on an annual basis and amortize them into our operating results over the average remaining service period of employees expected to receive benefits under the plans, to the extent such gains and losses are outside of the corridor.

﻿

Refer to Note 13 (Employee Retirement Plans) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.

﻿

Income Taxes

﻿

The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method.  Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and for differences between the carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.

﻿

The effective income tax rate reflects our assessment of the ultimate outcome of tax audits.  In evaluating the tax benefits associated with our various tax filing positions, we record a tax benefit for uncertain tax positions using the highest cumulative tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized.  Adjustments are made to our liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the period in which we determine the issue is effectively settled with the tax authorities, the statute of limitations expires for the return containing the tax position or when new information becomes available.  Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits, including accrued penalties and interest, is included in other accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets an

﻿

Discrete events such as audit settlements or changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur.  Valuation allowances are established when management is unable to conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will ultimately be realized.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

﻿

At

December

31, 2017, Corning has not completed its accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the 2017 Tax Act.  Pursuant to SAB 118, the Company has made a reasonable estimate of the effects on its U.S. deferred tax balances, the one-time toll charge and the impact on its state valuation allowances.  In addition,

Corning has not made sufficient progress on estimating the impact of tax reform on its assertion

regarding its indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings so the Company will continue to follow its historic position while it continues to analyze this issue. In addition,

Corning’s accounting for the impact of the global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) provisions of the 2017 Tax Act is incomplete and, as a result, it has not yet elected a policy to account for the GILTI provisions.

The initial accounting is incomplete as we need additional time and information to analyze all aspects of the newly enacted law and how it impacts our worldwide operations.

The additional information that needs to be obtained, prepared or analyzed in order to complete the accounting requirements includes receiving further guidance from the tax authorities; additional time to prepare basis calculations; post enactment impacts and further time to validate of our assumptions.

﻿

Equity Method Investments

﻿

Our equity method investments are reviewed for impairment on a periodic basis or if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying amount may be impaired.  This assessment is based on a review of the equity investments’ performance and a review of indicators of impairment to determine if there is evidence of a loss in value of an equity investment.  Factors we consider include:

﻿

·

Absence of our ability to recover the carrying amount;

·

Inability of the equity affiliate to sustain an earnings capacity which would justify the carrying amount of the investment; and

·

Significant litigation, bankruptcy or other events that could impact recoverability.

﻿

For an equity investment with impairment indicators, we measure fair value on the basis of discounted cash flows or other appropriate valuation methods, depending on the nature of the company involved.  If it is probable that we will not recover the carrying amount of our investment, the impairment is considered other-than-temporary and recorded in earnings, and the equity investment balance is reduced to its fair value accordingly.  We require our material equity method affiliates to provide audited financial statements.  Consequently, adjustments for asset recoverability are included in equity earnings.  We also utilize these financial statements in our recoverability assessment.

﻿

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

﻿

Major categories of financial assets and liabilities, including short-term investments, other assets and derivatives are measured at fair value on a recurring basis.  Certain assets and liabilities including long-lived assets, goodwill, asset retirement obligations, and cost and equity investments are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.

﻿

Fair value is the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required to be recorded at fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions, and risk of nonperformance.

﻿

Derivative Instruments

﻿

We participate in a variety of foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign exchange option contracts entered into in connection with the management of our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.  We utilize interest rate swaps to reduce the risk of changes in a benchmark interest rate from the probable forecasted issuance of debt and to swap fixed rate interest payments into floating rate interest payments.  These financial exposures are managed in accordance with corporate policies and procedures.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

﻿

All derivatives are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet.  Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and hedges of net investments in foreign operations are not recognized in current operating results but are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.  Amounts related to cash flow hedges are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income when the underlying hedged item impacts earnings.  This reclassification is recorde

﻿

New Accounting Standards

﻿

In

May 201

4, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as a new Topic, Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606.  The new revenue recognition standard relates to revenue from contracts with customers, which, along with amendments issued in 2015 and 2016, will supersede nearly all current U.S. GAAP guidance on this topic and eliminate industry-specific guidance.  The underlying principle is to use a five-step analysis of transactions to recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services.  Corning has evaluated its material contracts, and has concluded that the impact of adopting the standard on its financial statements and related disclosure will not be material.  The standard, as amended, will be effective for annual periods beginning after

December

15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period.  We will adopt the standard on a modified retrospective basis in 2018.

﻿

One of Corning’s equity affiliates is currently assessing the potential impact of adopting ASU 2014-09 on its financial statements and

will

adopt the standard on

January

1, 2019.  Preliminary analysis indicates that the impact of adoption will not have a material impact on Corning’s financial statements.

﻿

In

February 201

6, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which supersedes all existing guidance on accounting for leases in ASC Topic 840.  ASU 2016-02 is intended to provide enhanced transparency and comparability by requiring lessees to record right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities on the balance sheet.  ASU 2016-02 will continue to classify leases as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the statement of income.  ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after

December

15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted.  ASU 2016-02 is required to be applied with a modified retrospective approach to each prior reporting period presented with various optional practical expedients.  We are currently assessing the potential impact of adopting ASU 2016-02 on our financial statements and related disclosures.

﻿

One of Corning’s equity affiliates is currently assessing the potential impact of adopting ASU 2016-02 on its financial statements and elected to adopt the standard on

January

1, 2020.

﻿

In

August 201

6, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.  ASU 2016-15 refines how companies classify certain aspects of the cash flow statement in regards to debt prepayment, settlement of debt instruments, contingent consideration payments, proceeds from insurance claims and life insurance policies, distribution from equity method investees, beneficial interests in securitization transactions and separately identifiable cash flows.  ASU 2016-15 is effective for annual periods beginning after

December

15, 2017, and for interim periods within those fiscal years. We have determined that the impact of this standard will not be material.  We will adopt this standard in 2018.

﻿

In

October 201

6, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory, which reduces the complexity in the accounting standards by allowing the recognition of current and deferred income taxes for an intra-entity asset transfer, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs.  Historically, recognition of the income tax consequence was not recognized until the asset was sold to an outside party.  This amendment should be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption.  ASU 2016-16 is effective for annual periods beginning after

December

15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods.  Early adoption is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an annual reporting period for which financial statements (interim or annual) have not been issued or made available for issuance.  That is, earlier adoption should be in the first interim period if an entity issues interim financial statements.  We have determined that the impact of this standard will not be material.  We will adopt this standard in 2018.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

﻿

In

January 201

7, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other (Topic 350).  ASU 2017-04 simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by removing the second step of the two-step impairment test.  The amendment requires an entity to perform its annual, or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount.  An impairment charge should be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.  An entity still has the option to perform the qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary.  The amendment should be applied on a prospective basis.  ASU 2017-04 is effective for fiscal years beginning after

December

15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after

January

1, 2017.  The Company adopted the ASU on

January

1, 2017.

﻿

In

March 201

7, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-07, Compensation—Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost. ASU 2017-07 requires entities to (1) disaggregate the current-service-cost component from the other components of net benefit cost (the “other components”) and present it with other current compensation costs for related employees in the income statement and (2) present the other components elsewhere in the income statement and outside of income from operations if that subtotal is presented.  In addition, the ASU requires entities to disclose the income statement lines that contain the other components if they are not presented on appropriately described separate lines.  The amendment should be applied retrospectively for the presentation of the service cost component and prospectively for the capitalization of the service cost component.  ASU 2017-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after

December

15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted at the beginning of any annual period for which an entity’s financial statements have not been issued or made available for issuance.  We have determined that the impact of this standard will not be material.  We will adopt this standard in 2018.

Given

the significant complexity of the 2017 Tax Act and anticipated future guidance from the U. S. Treasury, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) related to the 2017 Tax Act, the Securities Exchange Commission has issued its Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 (“SAB 118”) to provide registrants additional time to analyze and report the effects of tax reform during the “measurement period”.  Under SAB 118, the registrant is required to record those items where ASC 740 analysis is complete; include reasonable estimates and label them as provisional where ASC 740 analysis is incomplete; and if reasonable estimates cannot be made, record items under the previous tax law.  The measurement period ends on

the

date

the

entity has obtained, prepared, and analyzed the information that was needed in order to complete the accounting requirements under ASC Topic 740 and is not

to

exceed 1 year.

﻿

In addition to SAB 118, the FASB has issued some guidance regarding how to account for tax reform as well as a proposal to reclassify stranded tax costs from AOCI to retained earnings.  Furthermore,

to date,

the U.S. Treasury has issued Notice 2018-07 on

December

29, 2017 and Notice 2018-13 on

January

19, 2018 with additional guidance on how to compute the toll charges.

﻿

At

December

31, 2017, we have not completed our accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the 2017 Tax Act; however, we have made a reasonable estimate of the effects on our U.S. deferred tax balances, the one-time toll charge and the impact on our state valuati

on allowances.  We recognized

provisional amount

s

which

are

included as a component of income tax expense from continuing operations.  The initial accounting is incomplete as we need additional time and information to analyze all aspects of the newly enacted law and how it impacts our worldwide operations.

The additional information that needs to be obtained, prepared or analyzed in order to complete the accounting requirements includes receiving further guidance from the tax authorities; additional time to prepare basis calculations; post

-

enactment impacts

,

and further time to validate our assumptions.

﻿

We re-measured the U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, which is generally

21%

.  However, we are still analyzing certain aspects of the 2017 Tax Act and refining our calculations, which could potentially affect the measurement of these balances or potentially give rise to new deferred tax amounts.  The provisional amount recorded related to the re-measurement of our deferred tax balances was

$34


million

.

﻿

The one-time toll charge is based on

our unrepatriated earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously deferred.  This charge resulted in an additional provisional tax expense amount of

$1.1

billion

. We have not yet completed our calculation of the toll charge.  This amount may change when we finalize the calculation of unrepatriated earnings that w

ere

previously deferred from U.S. federal taxation and finalize the amounts held in cash or other specified assets.  Settlement of the toll charge will occur almost entirely through the

use

of existing foreign tax credit carryovers.

Income Taxes (continued)

﻿

Corning has not made sufficient progress on estimating the impact

of tax reform on its assertion

regarding its indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings so the Company will continue to follow its historic position while it continues to analyze this

item

. As of

December

31, 2017, Corning estimates that its unremitted foreign earnings were

$16.9

billion

.  While Corning is not changing its assertion at this time, the Company

has

distribute

d

approximately

$2

billion

in

January 201

8 from two of its foreign subsidiaries to the U.S. parent of those subsidiaries.  There are no incremental taxes beyond the toll charge due with respect to this distribution of cash.

﻿

Under its historic policy,

Corning will continue to indefinitely reinvest substantially all of its foreign earnings, with the exception of an immaterial amount of current earnings that have very low or no tax cost associated with their repatriation.  Our current analysis indicates that we have sufficient U.S. liquidity, including borrowing capacity, to fund foreseeable U.S. cash needs without requiring the repatriation of foreign cash.

﻿

Corning’s accounting for the impact of the global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) provisions of the 2017 Tax Act is incomplete and, as a result, it has not yet elected a policy to account for the GILTI provisions.

﻿

We will continue to monitor for future guidance and to assess the impacts of the 2017 Tax Act.

Tax benefit associated with rate differences on foreign earnings is primarily

t

he income of subsidiaries with lower statutory rates than the U.S.

for 2017 and for 2016 and 2015 includes the benefit of excess foreign tax credits resulting from the inclusion of foreign earnings in U.S. income.

﻿

During 2016, a realignment of Dow Corning interest took place.  Refer to Note 7 (Investments) of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.

﻿

﻿

Deferred tax assets are to be reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available positive and negative evidence, it is more likely than not (a likelihood of greater than 50 percent) that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  Corning has valuation allowances on certain shorter-lived deferred tax assets such as those represented by capital loss and state tax net operating loss carryforwards, as well as other foreign net operating loss carryforwards, because we cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that we will earn income of the character required to utilize these assets before they expire.  The amount of U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets that have remaining valuation allowances at

December

31, 2017 and 2016 was

$4


million

and

$270

million

, respectively.

﻿

The 2017 Tax Act makes the following key changes to U.S. tax law which will potentially impact Corning’s deferred tax assets. Corporate alternative minimum tax (“AMT”) has been eliminated.  Taxpayers with AMT credit carryovers can use credits to offset regular tax liability for any tax year or

such credits will be

fully refundable by year 2022.  Corning has

$28

million

of AMT carryover.   Net operating losses (“NOL’s”)  generated prior to the 2017 Tax Act may still be carried back

two

years and forward


years.  Corning has

$34

million

of Federal NOL’s that are subject to these provisions.   The 2017 Tax Act limits and in some cases eliminates foreign tax credits.  Corning has

$49

million

of foreign tax credit carryforwards that may be subject to these restrictions.

﻿

In 2017, we adopted ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.  As a result, cumulative tax benefits totaling

$233

million

were recorded as an adjustment to beginning retained earnings.

﻿

The following is a tabular reconciliation of the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits (in

﻿

We recognize accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of tax expense.  For the years ended

December

31, 2017 and 2016 the amount recognized in interest expense is not material.  The amounts accrued at

December

Income Taxes (continued)

﻿

It is possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change due to one or more of the following events during the next twelve months: audit activity, tax payments, or final decisions in matters that are the subject of controversy in various jurisdictions within which we operate.  The majority of the potential change relates to tax litigation in Korea as well as our ongoing U.S. tax audit.  We believe we have provided adequate contingent reserves for these matters.  However, if upon conclusion of these matters, the ultimate determination of taxes owed is for an amount materially different than our current reserves, our overall tax expense and effective tax rate could be materially impacted in the period of adjustment.

﻿

Corning Incorporated, as the common parent company, and all

80%

nsolidated U.S. federal income tax returns.  The statute of limitations is closed for all periods ending through

December

31, 2012.  All returns for periods ended through

December

31, 2004, have been audited by and settled with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

﻿

Corning Incorporated and its U.S. subsidiaries file income tax returns on a combined, unitary or stand-alone basis in multiple state and local jurisdictions, which generally have statutes of limitations ranging from

years.  Various state income tax returns are currently in the process of examination or administrative appeal.

﻿

Our foreign subsidiaries file income tax returns in the countries in which they have operations.  Generally, these countries have statutes of limitations ranging from

Corning is currently appealing certain tax assessments resulting from audits performed by the South Korean tax authorities covering periods 2006 through 2015.  The Company is required to deposit the disputed tax amounts with the South Korean government as a condition of its appeal of these assessments.  Because we believe that it is more likely than not that we will prevail in the appeals process, we have recorded a non-current receivable of

$319

HSG and Dow Corning

﻿

On

May

31, 2016, Corning completed the strategic realignment of its equity investment in Dow Corning Corporation (”Dow Corning”) pursuant to the Transaction Agreement announced in

December 201

5.  Under the terms of the Transaction Agreement, Corning exchanged with Dow Corning its

50%

stock interest in Dow Corning for

100%

of the stock of a newly formed entity, which holds an equity interest in Hemlock Semiconductor Group (“HSG”) and approximately

$4.8

billion

in cash.

﻿

Prior to realignment, HSG, a consolidated subsidiary of Dow Corning, was an indirect equity investment of Corning.  Upon completion of the exchange, Corning now has a direct equity investment in HSG.  Because our ownership percentage in HSG did not change as a result of the realignment, the investment in HSG is recorded at its carrying value, which had a negative carrying value of

$383

million

at the transaction date.  The negative carrying value resulted from a one-time charge to this entity in 2014 for the permanent abandonment of certain assets.  Excluding this charge, the entity is profitable and is expected to recover its equity in the near term.

Corning offers postretirement plans that provide health care and life insurance benefits for retirees and eligible dependents.  Certain employees may become eligible for such postretirement benefits upon reaching retirement age and service requirements.  For current retirees (including surviving spouses) and active employees eligible for the salaried retiree medical program, we have placed a “cap” on the amount we will contribute toward retiree medical coverage in the future.  The cap is equal to

120%

of our 2005 contributions toward retiree medical benefits.  Once our contributions toward salaried retiree medical costs reach this cap, impacted retirees will have to pay the excess amount in addition to their regular contributions for coverage.  This cap was attained for post-65 retirees in 2008 and

attained for

pre-65 retirees in 2010.  Furthermore, employees hired or rehired on or after

January

1, 2007 will be eligible for Corning retiree medical benefits upon retirement; however, these employees will pay

100%

of the cost.

﻿

Corning uses a hypothetical yield curve and associated spot rate curve to discount the plan’s projected benefit payments.  Once the present value of projected benefit payments is calculated, the suggested discount rate is equal to the level rate that results in the same present value.  The yield curve is based on actual high-quality corporate bonds across the full maturity spectrum, which also includes private placements as well as Eurobonds that are denominated in U.S. currency.  The curve is developed from yields on approximately


-


bonds from four grading sources, Moody’s, S&P, Fitch and the Dominion Bond Rating Service.  A bond will be included if at least half of the grades from these sources are Aa, non-callable bonds.  The very highest

10%

yields and the lowest

40%

yields are excluded from the curve to eliminate outliers in the bond population.

﻿

Mortality is one of the key assumptions used in valuing liabilities of retirement plans. It is used to assign a probability of payment for future plan benefits that are contingent upon participants’ survival. To make this assumption, benefit plan sponsors typically use a base mortality table and an improvement scale that adjusts the rates of mortality for future anticipated changes to historical death rates.

﻿

Corning last revised its mortality assumption for its U.S. benefits plans at year-end 2014 subsequent to the Society of Actuaries publication of the RP-2014 base mortality tables and MP-2014 mortality improvement scales.  At that time, a review of Corning’s actual mortality experience for its retiree population was undertaken and consideration given to Corning’s view of future mortality improvements.  As a result of that study, Corning adopted the RP-2014 base mortality tables (white collar table for its non-union population and blue collar table for its union population) with adjustments to those tables that would calibrate for Corning’s experience to the extent credible.  Based on Corning’s view of future mortality experience, it adopted the BB-2D mortality improvement scale as it felt that scale represented the best available data to predict future improvement experience.

﻿

In 2017, Corning refreshed its analysis of its own retiree mortality experience.  As a result of that review, Corning decided to update the adjustment factors applied to its base mortality assumption (RP-2014 white collar table and RP-2014 blue collar table for non-union and union participants respectively) to value its U.S. benefit plan obligations as of

December

31, 2017.  In addition, as the Society of Actuaries has published additional mortality improvement scales (MP-2015, MP-2016 and MP-2017), Corning has considered these revised improvement scales in setting its future mortality improvement assumption.  As of

December

31, 2017, Corning decided to update its future improvement scale to the MP-2017 scale.

﻿

Furthermore, Corning has updated the mortality assumption applied to disabled participants to be the RP-2014 disabled mortality base table with future improvements using MP-2017.

﻿

Beginning with the

December

31, 2015 valuation of its defined benefit pension and OPEB plans, Corning changed its methodology of determining the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs to a more granular approach.  Under the new approach the cash flows from each applicable pension and OPEB plan will be used to directly calculate the benefit obligation, service cost and interest cost using the spot rates from the applicable yield curve.

﻿

Moving to a more granular approach has a limited impact on the determination of the respective benefit obligations.  The only impacts will be as a result of the elimination of the rounding of the discount rate that occurred in the traditional approach and the use of specific cash flows for Corning’s non-qualified pension plans, while separately applying the yield curve to each separate OPEB plan instead of aggregating the OPEB plan cash flows.  This change will result in a decrease in the interest cost and service cost components of net periodic pension and OPEB costs.  For the year ended

December

31, 2017, net periodic pension and OPEB costs will be lower by approximately

$23

million

and

$5

million

, respectively, due to this change.  For Corning’s pension plans, this change will increase the immediate recognition of actuarial losses (or decrease the immediate recognition of actuarial gains), due to Corning’s previous election to immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses outside of the corridor.  For Corning’s OPEB plans, this change will increase the accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) account balance due to the accumulation of lower actuarial gains or higher actuarial losses.  Over time, the amortization of the actuarial losses from AOCI will begin to reduce the savings from the lower interest cost and service cost.

﻿

This change is a change in accounting estimate and therefore applied prospectively (beginning with the next measurement date of

December

31, 2015).  No restatement of prior periods is required.

Plan Assets

Corning’s expected long-term rates of return on plan assets reflect the average rates of earnings expected on the funds invested to provide for the benefits included in our domestic and international projected benefit obligations.  We based these rates on asset/liability forecast modeling, which is based on our current asset allocation, the return and standard deviation for each asset class, current market conditions and transitions from current conditions to long-term returns.

﻿

The Company’s overall investment strategy is to obtain sufficient return to offset or exceed inflation and provide adequate liquidity to meet the benefit obligations of the pension plan.  Investments are made in public securities to ensure adequate liquidity to support benefit payments.  Domestic and international stocks and bonds provide diversification to the portfolio.  The target allocation range for global equity investment is

20%-25%

which includes large, mid and small cap companies and investments in both developed and emerging markets.  The target allocation for bond investments is

60%

, which predominately includes corporate bonds.  Long duration fixed income assets are utilized to mitigate the sensitivity of funding ratios to changes in interest rates.  The target allocation range for non-public investments in private equity and real estate is

5%-15%

, and is used to enhance returns and offer additional asset diversification.  The target allocation range for commodities is

0%-5%

, which provides some inflation protection to the portfolio.

Credit Risk

60%

of domestic plan assets are invested in long duration bonds.  The average rating for these bonds is A.  These bonds are subject to credit risk, such that a decline in credit ratings for the underlying companies, countries or assets (for asset-backed securities) would result in a decline in the value of the bonds.  These bonds are also subject to default risk.

Currency Risk

14%

of domestic assets are valued in non-U.S. dollar denominated investments that are subject to currency fluctuations.  The value of these securities will decline if the U.S. dollar increases in value relative to the value of the currencies in which these investments are denominated.

Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees (continued)

﻿

We are required, at the time a guarantee is issued, to recognize a liability for the fair value or market value of the obligation it assumes.  In the normal course of our business, we do not routinely provide significant third-party guarantees.  Generally, third-party guarantees provided by Corning are limited to certain financial guarantees, including stand-by letters of credit and performance bonds, and the incurrence of contingent liabilities in the form of purchase price adjustments related to attainment of milestones.  These guarantees have various terms, and none of these guarantees are individually significant.

Corning and

PPG

Industries, Inc. each owned

became effective in

April 201

December

31, 2015, the Company’s liability under the Plan was

estimated to be

$528

million.

At December 31, 2016, this estimated liability was

$290

million, due to the Company’s contribution, in the second quarter of 2016, of its equity interests in PCC and Pittsburgh Corning Europe N.V. in the total amount of

$238

million, as required by the Plan.  Corning recognized a gain of

$56

million in the second quarter of 2016 in the selling, general and administrative expenses line of the Company’s Consolidated Statements of (Loss) Income for the difference between the fair value of the asbestos litigation liability and carrying value of the investment.  This gain includes the release of foreign translation losses in the amount of

$25

million reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income.  The remaining

$290

million liability is for the series of fixed payments required by the Plan.  At December 31, 2017, the liability was reduced to

$220

million due to a cash payment of

$70

million in the second quarter of 2017, as required by the Plan.  The total amount of the payments due in years 2019 through 2022 is

$185

million and is classified as a non-current liability at December 31, 2017.  The remaining

$35

million payment is due in the second quarter of 2018 and is classified as a current liability.

Asbestos Litigation

﻿

Corning is a defendant in certain cases alleging personal injuries from exposure to asbestos.  Corning has been defending the claims in these cases, which are covered in part by insurance, without material impact to Corning to date.

Corning previously established a

$150

million

reserve for these non-PCC asbestos claims.  The estimated reserve represents the undiscounted projection of claims and related legal fees.  The amount may need to be adjusted in future periods as more data becomes available; however, we cannot estimate any lesser or greater liabilities at this time.

Several of Corning’s insurers have commenced litigation in state courts for a declaration of the rights and obligations of the parties under insurance policies related to asbestos claims.  Corning has resolved these issues with all of its solvent insurers and some of its insolvent insurers.  Corning continues to seek resolution with the remaining insolvent insurers.  Management is unable to predict the outcome of the litigation with these remaining insolvent insurers.

Dow Corning Chapter 11 Related Matters

﻿

Until June 1, 2016, Corning and The Dow Chemical Company (“Dow”) each owned

50%

of the common stock of Dow Corning Corporation (“Dow Corning”). On May 31, 2016, Corning and Dow realigned their ownership interest in Dow Corning.  In connection with the realignment, Corning retained its indirect ownership interest in the Hemlock Semiconductor Group and acquired HS Upstate, Inc. (now known as Corning Research & Development Corporation) which had been capitalized by Dow Corning with

$4.8

billion

.  Following the realignment, Corning no longer owns any interest in Dow Corning.  In connection with the realignment, Corning  agreed to indemnify Dow Corning for  50% of Dow Corning’s non-ordinary course, pre-closing liabilities to the extent such liabilities exceed the amounts reserved for them by Dow Corning as of May 31, 2016, including two legacy Dow Corning matters: the Dow Corning Breast Implant Litigation, and the Dow Corning Bankruptcy Pendency Interest Claims.

﻿

Dow Corning Breast Implant Litigation

﻿

In May 1995, Dow Corning filed for bankruptcy protection to address pending and claimed liabilities arising from many thousands of breast implant product lawsuits.  On June 1, 2004, Dow Corning emerged from Chapter 11 with a Plan of Reorganization (the “Plan”) which provided for the settlement or other resolution of implant claims.  The Plan also includes releases for Corning and Dow as shareholders in exchange for contributions to the Plan.

﻿

Under the terms of the Plan, Dow Corning has established and is funding a Settlement Trust and a Litigation Facility

to provide a means for tort claimants to settle or litigate their claims.  Inclusive of insurance, Dow Corning has paid approximately

$

1.8

billion

to the Settlement Trust.  As of

May

31, 2016, Dow Corning had recorded a reserve for breast implant litigation of

$


million

.  In the event Dow Corning’s total liability for these claims exceeds such amount, Corning may be required to indemnify Dow Corning

for up

50%

of the excess liability.

Dow Corning Bankruptcy Pendency Interest Claims

﻿

As a separate matter arising from the bankruptcy proceedings, Dow Corning is defending claims asserted by a number of commercial creditors who claim additional interest at default rates and enforcement costs, during the period from May 1995 through June 2004.  As of December 31, 2017, Dow Corning has estimated the liability to commercial creditors to be within the range

of

$77

million

to

$260

million

.  As of

May

31, 2016, Dow Corning had recorded a reserve for these claims of

$107

million

.  In the event

Dow Corning’s liability for these claims exceeds such amount, Corning may be required to indemnify Dow Corning for up

50%

of the excess liability, subject to certain conditions and limits.

﻿

Environmental Litigation

﻿

Corning has been named by the Environmental Protection Agency (the Agency) under the Superfund Act, or by state governments

under similar state laws, as a pote

ntially responsible party for 15

active hazardous waste sites.  Under the Superfund Act, all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site, identified by the Agency, are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the Agency agrees otherwise.  It is Corning’s policy to accrue for its estimated liability related to Superfund

sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned by Corning based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants.  At

December

31, 2017 and

December

31, 2016, Corning had accrued approximately

$38

million

(undiscounted) and

$43

million

(undiscounted),

respectively, for the estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation.  Based upon the information developed to date, management believes that the accrued reserve is a reasonable estimate of the Company’s liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote.

Hedging Activi

ties

﻿

Corning is exposed to interest rate and foreign currency risks due to the movement of these rates.

﻿

The areas in which exchange rate fluctuations affect us include:

﻿

·

Financial instruments and transactions

denominated

in foreign currencies, which impact earnings; and

·

The translation of net assets in foreign

subsidiaries

for which the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, which impacts our net equity.

﻿

Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the Japanese yen, South Korean won, New Taiwan dollar, Chinese yuan, and the euro.  We seek to mitigate the impact of exchange rate movements in our income statement by using over-the-counter (OTC) derivative instruments including foreign exchange forward and option contracts.  In general, these hedges expire coincident with the timing of the underlying foreign currency commitments and transactions.

Index

15.

Hedging Activities (continued)

﻿

We are exposed to potential losses in the event of non-performance by our counterparties to these derivative contracts.  However, we minimize this risk by maintaining our portfolio with a diverse group of highly-rated major international financial institutions.  We do not expect to record any losses as a result of such counterparty default.  Neither we nor our counterparties are required to post collateral for these financial instruments.  The Company qualified for and elected the end-user exception to the mandatory swap clearing requirement of the Dodd-Frank Act.

﻿

Cash Flow Hedges

Our cash flow hedging activities utilize OTC foreign exchange forward contracts and options to reduce the risk that movements in exchange rates will adversely affect the net cash flows resulting from the sale of products to foreign customers and purchases from foreign suppliers.  Our cash flow hedging activity also uses interest rate swaps to reduce the risk of increases in benchmark interest rates on the probable issuance of debt and associated interest payments.  In the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge against the variability in cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate related to an anticipated issuance.  The instruments were designated as cash flow hedges.

In the first quarter of 2015, these interest rate swaps were settled prior to the issuance of the anticipated debt.  Because the Company continued to anticipate that the debt issuance would occur, it entered into two interest rate swap agreements in the first quarter of 2015 to hedge against the variability in cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate related to an anticipated issuance.  The instruments were designated as cash flow hedges, and were settled on

May

5, 2015.  Concurrent with the settlement of the interest rate swap agreements, Corning issued

$375

million

of

1.50%

senior unsecured notes that mature on

May

8, 2018 and

$375

million

of

2.90%

senior unsecured notes that mature on

May

15, 2022.

﻿

Corning uses a regression analysis to monitor the effectiveness of its cash flow hedges both prospectively and retrospectively.  Through

December

31, 2017, the hedge ineffectivenes

s related to these instruments wa

s not material.  Corning defers net gains and losses related to effective portion of cash flow hedges into accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheet until such time as the hedged item impacts earnings.  At

December

31, 2017, the amount expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months is a pre-tax net gain of

$2


million

.

﻿

Fair Value Hedges

In

October

of 2012, we entered into

two

interest rate swaps that are designated as fair value hedges and economically exchange a notional amount of

$550

million

of previously issued fixed rate long-term debt to floating rate debt.  Under the terms of the swap agreements, we pay the counterparty a floating rate that is indexed to the one-month LIBOR rate.

﻿

Corning utilizes the long haul method for effectiveness analysis, both retrospectively and prospectively.  The analysis excludes the impact of credit risk from the assessment of hedge effectiveness.  The amount recorded in current period earnings in the other (expense) income, net component, relative to ineffectiveness, is nominal for the year ended

December

31, 2017.

﻿

Net gains and losses from fair value hedges and the effects of the corresponding hedged item are recorde

d on the same line item in the Consolidated S

tatements of

(Loss) I

ncome.

﻿

Undesignated Hedges

Corning also uses OTC foreign exchange forward and option contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes.  The undesignated hedges limit exposures to foreign functional currency fluctuations related to certain subsidiaries’ monetary assets

, monetary liabilities and net earnings

in foreign currencies.

﻿

A significant portion of the Company’s non-U.S. revenues and expenses are denominated in Japanese yen, South Korean won, New Taiwan dollar, Chinese yuan and euro.  When these revenues and expenses are translated back to U.S. dollars, the Company is exposed to foreign exchange rate movements.  To protect translated earnings against movements in these currencies, the Company has entered into a series of average rate forwards and other derivative instruments.

﻿

The Company continued to extend its foreign exchange hedge program in 2017 and entered into a series of average rate forwards.  These will hedge a significant portion of its projected yen exposure for the period of 2018-2022.  As of

December

31, 2017, the U.S. dollar net notional value of the yen average rate forwards program is

$12

billion

.  The average rate forward program was also expanded to partially hedge the impact of the South Korean won, New Taiwan dollar, Chinese yuan and euro translation on the Company’s projected net income.  As of

December

31, 2017 these average rate forwards have a total notional value of

$1

billion

.  The entire average rate forward program will settle net without obligation to deliver Japanese yen, Korean won, New Taiwan dollar, Chinese yuan and euro.

Fair Value Meas

urements

﻿

Fair value standards under U.S. GAAP define fair value, establish a framework for measuring fair value in applying generally accepted accounting principles, and require disclosures about fair value measurements.  The standards also identify two kinds of inputs that are used to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities: observable and unobservable.  Observable inputs are based on market data or independent sources while unobservable inputs are based on the Company’s own market assumptions.  Once inputs have been characterized, the inputs are prioritized into one of three broad levels (provided in the table below) used to measure fair value.  Fair value standards apply whenever an entity is measuring fair value under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurement and require the use of observable market data when available.

Fair Value Measurements (continued)

﻿

As a result of the acquisition of Samsung Corning Precision Materials in

January 201

4, the Company has contingent consideration that was measured using unobservable (Level 3) inputs.  This contingent consideration arrangement requires additional consideration to be paid between the parties in 2018: one based on projections of future revenues generated by the business of Corning Precision Materials for the period between the acquisition date and

December

31, 2017, which is subject to a cap of

$665

million

; and another based on the volumes of certain sales during the same period, which is subject to a separate cap of

$100

million

.  The fair value of the contingent consideration in 2018 in the amount of

$196

million

recognized on the acquisition date was estimated by applying an option pricing model using the Company’s projection of future revenues generated by Corning Precision Materials.  Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration in future periods are valued using an option pricing model and are recorded in Corning’s results in the period of the change.

﻿

On

December

29, 2015, Corning and Samsung Display entered into an agreement pursuant to which Corning exchanged the amount of contingent consideration in excess of

$300

million

(net present fair value:

$246

million

), as consideration for the incremental fair value associated with a number of commercial agreements, including the amendment of its long-term supply agreement with Samsung Display.  As of

December

29, 2015, the net present fair value of the contingent consideration receivable was

$458

million

.  The net present fair value of the commercial benefit associated with the amended long-term supply agreement exceeds the value exchanged by Corning pursuant to this agreement (net present fair value:

$212

million

).  Consequently, Corning reclassified this amount to the other asset line of the Consolidated Balance Sheet and will amortize the amount over the remaining term of the long-term supply agreement as a reduction in revenue.

﻿

As of

December

31, 2017, the fair value of the contingent consideration in 2018 was

$300

$2

billion

share repurchase program (the “

July 201

5 Repurchase Program”) and on

October

26, 2015 the Board of Directors authorized an additional

$4

billion

share repurchase program (together with the

July 201

5 Repurchase Program, the “2015 Repurchase Programs”).  The 2015 Repurchase Programs permit Corning to effect repurchases from time to time through a combination of open market repurchases, privately negotiated transactions, advance repurchase agreements and/or other arrangements.

﻿

On

October

28, 2015, Corning entered into an ASR to repurchase

$1.25

billion

of Corning’s common stock (the “2015 ASR agreement”).  The 2015 ASR was executed under the

July 201

5 Repurchase Program.  Under the 2015 ASR agreement, Corning made a

$1.25

billion

(Loss) Earnings Per Com

mon Share

﻿

Basic (loss) earnings per common share are computed by dividing income attributable to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period.  Diluted (loss) earnings per common share assumes the issuance of common shares for all potentially dilutive securities outstanding.

﻿

The reconciliation of the amounts used to compute basic and diluted (loss) earnings per common share from operations follows (in

For the year ended

December

Share-based C

ompensation

﻿

Stock Compensation Plans

﻿

Corning maintains long-term incentive plans (the “Plans”) for key employees and non-employee members of our Board of Directors.  The Plans allow us to grant equity-based compensation awards, including stock options, stock appreciation rights, performance share units, restricted stock units, restricted stock awards or a combination of awards (collectively, share-based awards).  At

December

31, 2017, there were approximately


million

unissued common shares available for future grants under the Plans.

﻿

The Company measures and recognizes compensation cost for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values.

﻿

The fair value of awards granted that are expected to ultimately vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods.  The number of options expected to vest equals the total options granted less an estimation of the number of forfeitures expected to occur prior to vesting.  The forfeiture rate is calculated based on


years of historical data and is adjusted if actual forfeitures differ significantly from the original estimates.  The effect of any change in estimated forfeitures would be recognized through a cumulative adjustment that would be included in compensation cost in the period of the change in estimate.

﻿

Total share-based compensation cost of

$46

million

,

$42

million

and

$46

million

was disclosed in operating activities on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended

December

31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The income tax benefit realized from share-based compensation was not significant for the years ended

December

Share-based Compensation (continued)

﻿

Stock Options

﻿

Corning’s stock option plans provide non-qualified and incentive stock options to purchase authorized but unissued shares, or treasury shares, at the market price on the grant date and generally become exercisable in installments from

one

to

five

years from the grant date.  The maximum term of non-qualified and incentive stock options is


years from the grant date.

﻿

The following table summarizes information concerning stock options outstanding including the related transactions under the stock option plans for the year ended

December

31, 2017:

﻿

﻿

The aggregate intrinsic value (market value of stock less option exercise price) in the preceding table represents the total pretax intrinsic value, based on the Company’s closing stock price on

December

29, 2017, which would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their “in-the-money” options as of that date.  The total number of “in-the-money” options exercisable on

December

31, 2017, was approximately


million

.

﻿

The weighted-average grant-date fair value for options granted for the years ended

December

31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was

$8.40

,

$6.31

and

$7.99

, respectively.  The total fair value of options that vested during the years ended

December

31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was approximately

$13

million

,

$22

million

and

$36

million

, respectively.  Compensation cost related to stock options for the years ended

December

31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, was approximately

$12

million

,

$11

million

and

$14

million

, respectively.

﻿

As of

December

31, 2017, there was approximately

$6

million

of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options granted under the Plans.  The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of

1.8

years.

﻿

Proceeds received from the exercise of stock options were

$309

million

for the year ended

December

31, 2017, which were included in financing activities on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.  The total intrinsic value of options exercised for the years ended

December

31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was approximately

$103

million

,

$53

million

and

$48

million

, respectively.

﻿

An award is considered vested when the employee’s retention of the award is no longer contingent on providing subsequent service (the “non-substantive vesting period approach”).  Awards to retirement eligible employees are fully vested at the date of grant, and the related compensation expense is recognized immediately upon grant or over the period from the grant date to the date of retirement eligibility for employees that become age


during the vesting period.

﻿

Corning uses a multiple-point Black-Scholes valuation model to estimate the fair value of stock option grants.  Corning utilizes a blended approach for calculating the volatility assumption used in the multiple-point Black-Scholes valuation model defined as the weighted average of the short-term implied volatility, the most recent volatility for the period equal to the expected term, and the most recent


-year historical volatility.  The expected term assumption is the period of time the options are expected to be outstanding, and is calculated using a combination of historical exercise experience adjusted to reflect the current vesting period of options being valued, and partial life cycles of outstanding options.  The risk-free rates used in the multiple-point Black-Scholes valuation model are the implied rates for a zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bond with a term equal to the option’s expected term.  The ranges given below reflect results from separate groups of employees exhibiting different exercise behavior.

Share-based Compensation (continued)

The following inputs were used for the valuation of option grants under our Stock Option Plans:

﻿

﻿

Incentive Stock Plans

﻿

The Corning Incentive Stock Plan permits restricted stock and restricted stock unit grants, either determined by specific performance goals or issued directly, in most instances, subject to the possibility of forfeiture and without cash consideration.  Restricted stock and restricted stock units under the Incentive Stock Plan are granted at the closing market price on the grant date, contingently vest over a period of generally

one

to

ten

years, and generally have contractual lives of

one

to

ten

years.  The fair value of each restricted stock grant or restricted stock unit awarded under the Incentive Stock Plan is based on the grant date closing price of the Company’s stock.

﻿

Time-Based Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units:

﻿

Time-based restricted stock and restricted stock units are issued by the Company on a discretionary basis, and are payable in shares of the Company’s common stock upon vesting.  The fair value is based on the closing market price of the Company’s stock on the grant date.  Compensation cost is recognized over the requisite vesting period and adjusted for actual forfeitures before vesting.

﻿

The following table represents a summary of the status of the Company’s non-vested time-based restricted stock and restricted stock units as of

December

31, 2016, and changes which occurred during the year ended

December

31, 2017:

﻿

﻿

As of

December

31, 2017, there was approximately

$41

million

of unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested time-based restricted stock and restricted stock units compensation arrangements granted under the Plan.  The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of

2.6

years.  The total fair value of time-based restricted stock that vested during the years ended

December

31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was approximately

$30

million

,

$27

million

and

$32

We included the earnings of equity affiliates that are closely associated with our reportable segments in the respective segment’s net income.  We have allocated certain common expenses among reportable segments differently than we would for stand-alone financial information.  Segment net income may not be consistent with measures used by other companies.  The accounting policies of our reportable segments are the same as those applied in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
