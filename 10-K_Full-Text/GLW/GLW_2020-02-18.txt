Additional explanation regarding Corning and its five reportable segments, as well as financial information about geographic areas, is presented in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 18 (Reportable Segments) to the consolidated financial statements.

Corporate Investments

Hemlock Semiconductor Group (“HSG”)

In 2016, Corning realigned its ownership interest in Dow Corning, exchanging its 50% interest in the joint venture between Corning and Dow Chemical for a newly formed company that holds a 49.9% interest in Hemlock Semiconductor LLC and a 40.25% interest in Hemlock Semiconductor Operations LLC which are recorded as equity method investments of Corning and are affiliated companies of HSG.

HSG manufactures polysilicon products for the semiconductor and solar industries.  HSG’s solar business primarily serves the solar power panel industry.

In prior years, HSG’s solar and semiconductor customers entered into long-term “take or pay” contracts which included up-front cash payments to secure capacity.  During the last few years, and more significantly in 2019, the solar power panel industry experienced significant over-capacity in the market, resulting in declining sales volumes and market prices.  As a result, HSG’s solar business experienced lower market penetration, overall price declines, and settled contracts with customers that had committed volume and fixed pricing above the current market price.  While

Index

these settlements positively impacted HSG’s cash flow in 2019, they reduced expectations for future sales in HSG’s solar business.

Due to the adverse change in HSG’s solar business, HSG was required to assess the recoverability of its long-lived assets in the fourth quarter.  Based on this assessment, HSG determined that the carrying values of HSG’s solar asset group significantly exceeded its fair values.  HSG engaged a third-party appraiser to assist in determining the fair value of the assets within in the solar asset group based on the highest and best use of the asset group.  As a result of the fair value determination, HSG recognized a pre-tax asset impairment charge of $916 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.  Corning’s share of the pre-tax impairment was $369 million.

Due to the adverse changes above, the carrying values of HSG’s solar business inventories were also affected resulting in an inventory write-down of $257 million for the year.  Corning’s pre-tax share of the provision was $105 million.

HSG adopted the new revenue standard on January 1, 2019 and the timing of HSG’s revenue recognition for certain remaining performance obligations measured at January 1, 2019 was deferred for recognition.  This deferral reduced the carrying amount of Corning’s investment in HSG by $239 million.  During the fourth quarter, a significant number of the performance obligations were satisfied and $434 million was recognized into HSG’s net income.  Corning’s share of the equity earnings was $208 million.

In addition, HSG settled certain revenue contracts in the fourth quarter, resulting in settlement gains of $383 million in net income.  Corning’s share of the settlement gains was $185 million.

Additional information about corporate investments is presented in Note 6 (Investments) to the consolidated financial statements.

Raw Materials

Corning’s manufacturing processes and products require access to uninterrupted power sources, significant quantities of industrial water, certain precious metals and various batch materials.  Availability of resources (ores, minerals, polymers, helium and processed chemicals) required in manufacturing operations, appear to be adequate.  From time to time, Corning’s suppliers may experience capacity limitations in their own operations, or may eliminate certain product lines.  Corning believes it has adequate programs to ensure a reliable supply of raw and batch materials as well as precious metals.  For many of its materials, Corning has alternate suppliers that would allow operations to continue without interruption in the event of specific materials shortages.

Certain key materials and proprietary equipment used in the manufacturing of products are currently sole-sourced or available only from a limited number of suppliers.  To minimize this risk, Corning closely monitors raw materials and equipment with limited availability or sole-sourced suppliers.  However, any future difficulty in obtaining sufficient and timely delivery of components and/or raw materials could result in lost sales due to delays or reductions in product shipments, or reductions in Corning’s gross margins.

Patents and Trademarks

Inventions by members of Corning’s research and engineering staff continue to be important to the Company’s growth.  Patents have been granted on many of these inventions in the United States and other countries.  Some of these patents have been licensed to other manufacturers.

Other

Additional information in response to Item 1 is found in Note 18 (Reportable Segments) to the consolidated financial statements and in Item 6 (Selected Financial Data).

Item 1A.  Risk Factors

We operate in rapidly changing economic, political, and technological environments that present numerous risks.  Our operations and financial results are subject to risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, our ability to successfully execute our Strategy & Growth framework and the trading price of our common stock or debt.  The following discussion identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business, operations, financial position or future financial performance.  This information should be read in conjunction with our MD&A and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated by reference into this report.  The following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider, as these factors could cause our future results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements and from historical trends.

As a global company, we face many risks which could adversely impact our operations and financial results

We are a global company and derive a substantial portion of our revenues from, and have significant operations, outside of the United States.  Our international operations include manufacturing, assembly, sales, research and development, customer support, and shared administrative service centers.  Additionally, we rely on a global supply chain for key components and capabilities that are central to our ability to invent, make and sell products.

Compliance with laws and regulations increases our costs.  We are subject to both U.S. laws and the local laws where we operate which, among other things, include data privacy requirements, employment and labor laws, tax laws, anti-competition regulations, prohibitions on payments to governmental officials, import and trade restrictions and export requirements.  Non-compliance or violations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or employees, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business.  Such violations could result in prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries and could also materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and operating results.  Our success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate and manage these risks.

Index

We are also subject to a variety of other risks in managing a global organization, including those related to:



The economic and political conditions in each country or region and among countries;



Complex regulatory requirements affecting international trade and investment, including anti-dumping laws, export controls, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local laws prohibiting improper payments.  Our operations may be adversely affected by changes in the substance or enforcement of these regulatory requirements, and by actual or alleged violations of them;



Fluctuations in currency exchange rates, convertibility of currencies and restrictions involving the movement of funds between jurisdictions and countries;



Governmental protectionist policies and sovereign and political risks that may adversely affect Corning’s profitability and assets;



Tariffs, trade duties and other trade barriers including anti-dumping duties;



Geographical concentration of our factories and operations, and regional shifts in our customer base;



Periodic health epidemic concerns;



Political unrest, confiscation or expropriation of assets by foreign governments, terrorism and the potential for other hostilities;



Difficulty in protecting intellectual property, sensitive commercial and operations data, and information technology systems;



Differing legal systems, including protection and treatment of intellectual property and patents;



Complex, changing or competing tax regimes;



Difficulty in collecting obligations owed to us;



Natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes, tsunamis and windstorms; and



Potential loss of utilities or other disruption affecting manufacturing.

Corning’s Display Technologies segment generates a significant amount of the Company’s profits and cash flow.  Any significant decrease in display glass pricing or market share could have a material and negative impact on our financial results

Corning’s ability to generate profits and operating cash flow depends largely on the profitability of our

display glass business, which is subject to continuous

pricing pressure due to industry competition, potential over-capacity, and development of new technologies.  If we are not able to achieve proportionate reductions in costs and increases in volume to offset ongoing pricing pressure it

could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.

Because we have a concentrated customer base in each of our businesses, our sales could be negatively impacted by the actions or insolvency of one or more key customers, as well as our ability to retain these customers

A relatively small number of end customers accounted for a high percentage of net sales in each of our reportable segments.  Mergers and consolidations between customers could result in further concentration of Corning’s customer base.  Further concentration, or the loss or insolvency of a key customer, could result in a substantial loss of sales and reduction in anticipated in cash flows.

The following table details the number of combined customers of our segments that accounted for a large percentage of segment net sales:

Business disruptions could affect our operating results

A major earthquake, weather event, fire or other catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical facilities, or our suppliers’ or customers’ facilities, could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our financial results could be materially and adversely affected.  For example, certain manufacturing sites require high quality, continuous, and uninterrupted power and access to industrial water.  Unplanned outages could have a material negative impact on our operations and ability to supply our customers.

We have been closely monitoring the outbreak of the coronavirus that originated in Wuhan, China. We have operations in Wuhan and other areas of China. We have taken steps to protect our employees and operations.  The coronavirus may impact the global economy, our ability, as well as the ability of our customers and suppliers, to manufacture products and may reduce demand in our markets which could result in an impact to our financial results. We are taking steps to mitigate potential financial impacts, including supplying customers from other regions when appropriate.  Currently, it is not possible for us to determine the financial impact of the coronavirus, if any.

Additionally, a significant amount of the specialized manufacturing capacity for our reportable segments is concentrated in single-site locations.  Due to the specialized nature of the assets, in the event such a location experiences disruption, it may not be possible to find replacement capacity quickly or substitute production from other facilities.  Accordingly, disruption at a single-site manufacturing operation could significantly impact Corning’s ability to supply its customers and could produce a near-term severe impact on our individual businesses and the Company as a whole.

Geopolitical events, as well as other events outside of Corning’s control, could cause a disruption to our manufacturing operations and adversely impact our customers, resulting in a negative impact to Corning’s net sales, net income, asset values and liquidity

A natural disaster, epidemic, labor strike, war and social or political unrest in regions where we operate could adversely affect Corning’s ability to supply our customers and impact the value of our assets.  Such events may also impact our customers’ facilities and reduce our sales to such customers.  For example, a sizeable portion of Corning’s glass manufacturing capacity is in South Korea and we generate a significant portion of our sales through two South Korean customers.  Deterioration of the geopolitical climate in such a region could cause a disruption to our manufacturing operations and adversely impact our customers, resulting in a negative impact to Corning’s net sales, net income, asset values and liquidity.

Given the geographical concentration of certain of our plants, the highly engineered nature of our facilities and the globally dispersed talent required to run these facilities, any event that adversely affects or restricts movement into or out of a specific geographic area where we, our suppliers, or our customers have a presence, could adversely impact our results.

We may experience difficulties in enforcing our intellectual property rights, which could result in loss of market share, and we may be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others

We rely on patent and trade secret laws, copyright, trademark, confidentiality procedures, controls and contractual commitments to protect our intellectual property rights.  Despite our efforts, these protections may be limited and we may encounter difficulties in protecting our intellectual property rights or obtaining rights to additional intellectual property necessary to permit us to continue or expand our businesses.  We cannot provide assurance that the patents that we hold or may obtain will provide meaningful protection against our competitors.  Changes in or enforcement of laws concerning intellectual property may affect our ability to prevent or address the misappropriation of, or the unauthorized use of, our intellectual property, potentially resulting in loss of market share.  Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights.  Litigation is inherently uncertain and outcomes are unpredictable.  If we cannot protect our intellectual property rights against unauthorized copying or use, or other misappropriation, we may not remain competitive.

Index

The intellectual property rights of others could inhibit our ability to introduce new products.  Other companies hold patents on technologies used in our industries and are aggressively seeking to expand, enforce and license their patent portfolios.  We periodically receive notices from, or have lawsuits filed against us by third parties claiming infringement, misappropriation or other misuse of their intellectual property rights and/or breach of our agreements with them.  These third parties often include entities that do not have the capabilities to design, manufacture, or distribute products or that acquire intellectual property like patents for the sole purpose of monetizing their acquired intellectual property through asserting claims of infringement and misuse.  Such claims of infringement or misappropriation may result in loss of revenue, substantial costs, or lead to monetary damages or injunctive relief against us.

Information technology dependency and cyber security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, liability claims, or competitive harm

The Company is dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure, including cloud-based services, (“IT systems”) to conduct its business.  Our IT systems may be vulnerable to disruptions from human error, outdated applications, computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access, cyber-attack and other similar disruptions.  We have measures and defenses in place against such events, but we may not be able to prevent, immediately detect, or remediate all instances of such events.  Any significant disruption, breakdown, intrusion, interruption or corruption of these systems or data breaches could cause the loss of data or intellectual property, equipment damage, downtime, and/or safety related issues and could have a material adverse effect on our business.  A material security breach or disruption of our IT systems could result in theft, unauthorized use, or publication of our intellectual property and/or confidential business information, harm our competitive position, disrupt our manufacturing, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives, impair our ability to access vendors, suppliers and cloud-based services, or otherwise adversely affect our business.

Additionally, we believe that utilities and other operators of critical infrastructure that serve our facilities face heightened security risks, including cyber-attack.  In the event of such an attack, disruption in service from our utility providers could disrupt our manufacturing operations which rely on a continuous source of power (electrical, gas, etc.).

We may not earn a positive return from our research, development and engineering investments

Developing our products through our innovation model of research and development is expensive and often involves a long investment cycle.  We make significant expenditures and investments in research, development and engineering that may not earn an economic return.  If our investments do not provide a pipeline of products or technologies that our customers demand or lower our manufacturing costs, it could negatively impact our revenues and operating margins both near- and long-term.

We have significant exposure to foreign currency movements

A large portion of our sales, profit and cash flows are transacted in non-U.S. dollar currencies and we expect that we will continue to experience fluctuations in the U.S. dollar value of these activities if it is not possible or cost effective to hedge our currency exposures or should we elect not to hedge certain currency exposures.  Alternatively, we may experience gains or losses if the underlying exposure which we have hedged increases or decreases significantly and we are unable to reverse, unwind, or terminate the hedges concurrent with changes in the underlying notional exposure.

Our ultimate realized loss or gain with respect to currency fluctuations will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency exposures that we have, the exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, whether we have entered into foreign currency contracts to offset these exposures and other factors.

Our hedge portfolio may reduce our ability to respond to price moves by our Display Technologies segment competitors.  Foreign currency movements may impact our competitive cost position relative to our largest, Japan-based competitors in the Display Technologies segment.  The profitability of customers may also be impacted as they typically purchase from us in Japanese yen and sell in various currencies.

Index

These factors, which are variable and generally outside of our control, could materially impact our results of operations, anticipated future results, financial position and cash flows.

We may have significant exposure to counterparties of our related derivatives portfolio

We maintain a significant portfolio of over the counter derivatives to hedge our projected currency exposure to the Japanese yen, new Taiwan dollar, South Korean won, Chinese yuan and euro.  We are exposed to potential losses in the event of non-performance by our counterparties to these derivative contracts.  Any failure of a counterparty to pay on such a contract when due could materially impact our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

If we are unable to obtain certain specialized equipment, raw and batch materials or natural resources required in our products or processes, our business will suffer

Our ability to meet customer demand depends, in part, on our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of equipment, parts, components and raw materials from our suppliers.  We may experience shortages that could adversely affect our operations.  Certain manufacturing equipment, components and raw materials are available only from single or limited sources, and we may not be able to find alternate sources in a timely manner.  A reduction, interruption or delay of supply, or a significant increase in the price for supplies, such as manufacturing equipment, precious metals, raw materials, utilities including energy and industrial water, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses.

We use specialized raw materials from single-source suppliers (e.g., specific mines or quarries) and natural resources (e.g., helium) in certain products and processes.  If a supplier is unable to provide the required raw materials or the natural resource is in scarce supply or not readily available, we may be unable to change our product composition or manufacturing process to prevent disruption to our business.

We may have additional tax liabilities

We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions, and are commonly audited by various tax authorities.  There are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax treatment is uncertain.  Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes.  Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.  The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made.

The 2017 Tax Act significantly impacted how U.S. global corporations are taxed.  Significant guidance has been issued with the intention of clarifying the new tax provisions.  To date, some of the regulations had been finalized and clarified but a considerable amount of this guidance is still in the form of proposed regulations.  Due to volume and complexity of both of final and proposed regulations, we continue to evaluate any development and impact of the 2017 Tax Act that could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flow.  In addition to the 2017 Tax Act, other foreign countries and international organizations such as Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) may have law changes and issue new international tax standards that may also impact our taxes.

Our innovation model depends on our ability to attract and retain specialized experts in our core technologies

Our innovation model requires us to employ highly specialized experts in glass science, ceramic science, and optical physics to conduct our research and development and engineer our products and design our manufacturing facilities.  The loss of the services of any member of our key research and development or engineering team without adequate replacement, or the inability to attract new qualified personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance.

Index

We are subject to strict environmental regulations and regulatory changes that could result in fines or restrictions that interrupt our operations

Some of our manufacturing processes generate chemical waste, waste water, other industrial waste or greenhouse gases, and we are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of such substances.  We have installed anti-pollution equipment for the treatment of chemical waste and waste water at our facilities.  We have taken steps to control the amount of greenhouse gases created by our manufacturing operations.  However, we cannot provide assurance that environmental claims will not be brought against us or that government regulators will not take steps to adopt more stringent environmental standards.

Any failure on our part to comply with any present or future environmental regulations could result in the assessment of damages or imposition of fines against us, or the suspension/cessation of production or operations.  In addition, environmental regulations could require us to acquire costly equipment, incur other significant compliance expenses or limit or restrict production or operations and thus materially and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Changes in regulations and the regulatory environment in the U.S. and other countries, such as those resulting from the regulation and impact of global warming and CO


abatement, may affect our businesses and their results in adverse ways by, among other things, substantially increasing manufacturing costs, limiting availability of scarce resources, especially energy, or requiring limitations on production and sale of our products or those of our customers.

Current or future litigation or regulatory investigations may harm our financial condition or results of operations

As a global technology and manufacturing company, we are engaged in various litigation and regulatory matters.  Litigation and regulatory proceedings may be uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, resulting in significant liabilities, penalties or damages.  Any such substantial legal liability or regulatory action could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and reputation.

Our global operations are subject to extensive trade and anti-corruption laws and regulations

Due to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of import- and export-related laws and regulations, including U.S. regulations issued by Customs and Border Protection, the Bureau of Industry and Security, the Office of Anti-boycott Compliance, the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls and the Office of Foreign Assets Control, as well as the counterparts of these agencies in other countries.  Any alleged or actual violation by an employee or the Company may subject us to government scrutiny, investigation and civil and criminal penalties, and may limit our ability to import or export our products or to provide services outside the United States.  We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the way existing laws might be administered or interpreted.

In addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, or obtaining an unfair advantage.  Recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws.  Our continued operation and expansion outside the United States, including in developing countries, could increase the risk of alleged violations.  Violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our business, and result in an adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition.

Moreover, several of our key customers are domiciled in areas of the world with laws, rules and business practices that may notably differ from those in the United States, and we face the reputational and legal risk that our related partners may violate applicable laws, rules and business practices.

International trade policies may negatively impact our ability to sell and manufacture our products outside of the U.S.

Government policies on international trade and investment such as import quotas, tariffs, and capital controls, whether adopted by individual governments or addressed by regional trade blocs, can affect the demand for our products and services, impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us (including our equity affiliates/joint ventures) from being able to sell and/or manufacture products in certain countries.  The implementation of more restrictive trade policies, such as higher tariffs or new barriers to entry, in countries in which we sell large quantities of products and services could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.  For example, a government’s adoption of “buy national” policies or retaliation by another government against such policies could have a negative impact on our results of operations.  These policies also affect our equity companies.

Environmental Litigation.

Corning has been named by the Environmental Protection Agency (the Agency) under the Superfund Act, or by state governments under similar state laws, as a potentially responsible party for 15 active hazardous waste sites.  Under the Superfund Act, all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site, identified by the Agency, are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the Agency agrees otherwise.  It is Corning’s policy to accrue for its estimated liability related to Superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned by Corning based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants.  At December 31, 201


and 201


, Corning had accrued approximately $41 million (undiscounted) and $30 million (undiscounted), respectively, for the estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation.  Based upon the information developed to date, management believes that the accrued reserve is a reasonable estimate of the Company’s liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote.

OVERVIEW

Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework

and recently introduced Strategy & Growth Framework

On June 14, 2019, Corning introduced its 2020-2023 Strategy & Growth Framework.  From 2020 to 2023, the company plans to invest $10 billion to $12 billion for growth and to return $8 billion to $10 billion to shareholders.

In October 2015, Corning announced a strategy and capital allocation framework (the “Framework”) that reflects the Company’s financial and operational strengths, as well as its ongoing commitment to increasing shareholder value.  The Framework outlined our leadership priorities and articulated the opportunities we saw across our businesses.  We designed the Framework to create significant value for shareholders by focusing our portfolio and leveraging our financial strength.  Under the Framework, we targeted generating $26 billion to $30 billion of cash through 2019, returning more than $12.5 billion to shareholders and investing $10 billion to extend our leadership positions and deliver growth.  As of June 30, 2019, Corning met its goal of returning more than $12.5 billion to shareholders.

As of December 31, 2019, Corning had invested almost $11 billion for growth and extended leadership.

Corning’s Frameworks outline the company’s leadership priorities.  With the completed Strategy and Capital Allocation Framework and new Strategy & Growth Framework, Corning plans to focus its portfolio and utilize its financial strength.  Our probability of success increases as we invest in our world-class capabilities.  Corning is concentrating approximately 80% of its research, development and engineering investment along with capital spending on a cohesive set of three core technologies, four manufacturing and engineering platforms, and five market-access platforms.  This strategy allows us to quickly apply our talents and repurpose our assets across the company, as needed, to capture high-return opportunities.

2019 Results

Net sales in the year ended December 31, 2019 were $11.5 billion, an increase of $213 million, or 2%, when compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, driven by increased sales in the Specialty Materials, Environmental Technologies and Life Sciences segments offset by decreased sales in the Display Technologies and Optical Communications segments.

For the year ended December 31, 2019, we generated net income of $960 million, or $1.07 per share, compared to a net income of $1,066 million, or $1.13 per share, for 2018.  When compared to 2018, the $106 million decrease in net income was primarily due to the following items (amounts presented after tax):



Lower equity earnings in affiliated companies of $284 million when compared to the prior period, primarily driven by asset impairments and an inventory provision, partially offset by the deferred revenue recognition associated with adoption of the new revenue standard, as well as one-time settlement gains from revenue contracts;



Higher costs of $238 million, primarily driven by accelerated depreciation and asset write-offs for our Display Technologies and Optical Communications segments; and



Lower segment net income of $83 million primarily driven by lower sales in our Display Technologies and Optical Communications segments.

Partially offsetting these events were the following items:



Translated earnings contract gains in the current period were $287 million higher than prior year losses;



Costs related to litigation, regulatory and other legal matters were $109 million lower, primarily driven by the absence of a $103 million charge related to legal matters recorded in 2018, including a ruling in an intellectual property lawsuit and developments in civil litigation;



A positive impact of $44 million resulting from a lower mark-to-market loss for our defined benefit pension plans; and



The positive impact of $42 million in tax adjustments primarily relating to the absence of a $172 million IRS audit settlement, or approximately $40 million of taxes payable after the utilization of tax attributes, recorded in the first quarter of 2018, netted against changes in tax reserves, changes in foreign valuation allowances and changes in the estimate of 2018 tax expense due to new tax reform guidance.

Diluted earnings per share decreased by $0.06 per share, or 5%, when compared to 2018, driven by the decrease in net income described above,

partially offset by the

repurchase of 31.0 million shares of common stock over the last twelve months.

The translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including the impact of hedges realized in the current year, negatively impacted Corning’s net income by approximately $44 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, when compared to the same period in 2018.

2020 Corporate Outlook

We believe 2020 will be another year of growth in several segments and continued investment in innovations, consistent with our Strategy & Growth Framework.

Corning expects its display glass volume to grow by a mid-single digit percentage, similar to the mid-single digit percentage growth expected in the display glass market.  The company expects glass price declines to remain moderate, down a mid-single digit percentage for the full year.  The company expects Optical Communications full-year sales to decline by 5% to 10%

.  We expect mid-single digit percentage sales growth in our Environmental Technologies and Life Sciences segments.

We expect high-single digit percentage sales growth in the Specialty Materials segment.

We have been closely monitoring the outbreak of the coronavirus that originated in Wuhan, China. We have operations in Wuhan and other areas of China. We have taken steps to protect our employees and operations.  The coronavirus may impact the global economy, our ability, as well as the ability of our customers and suppliers, to manufacture products and may reduce demand in our markets which could result in an impact to our financial results. We are taking steps to mitigate potential financial impacts, including supplying customers from other regions when appropriate.  Currently, it is not possible for us to determine the financial impact of the coronavirus, if any.

For the year ended December 31, 2019, segment net sales increased by $258 million, or 2%, when compared to the same period in 2018.  The primary sales drivers by segment were as follows:



Net sales in the Display Technologies segment decreased by $22 million, with glass volume up a mid-single digit percentage and low-single digit percentage display glass price declines; the combination of finished goods volume, unfinished glass sold to our equity affiliates and a low-single-digit percentage price decline resulted in a one percent sales decline;



Optical Communications net sales decreased $128 million, primarily due to lower sales in carrier products, down $199 million, partially offset by an increase of $71 million in enterprise network sales;



Specialty Materials segment net sales increased by $115 million, primarily driven by strong demand for Gorilla® Glass;



Net sales for Environmental Technologies increased $210 million, primarily driven by sales growth of gasoline particulate filters; and



Life Sciences net sales increased by $69 million, as sales volume continued to outpace market growth.

Movements in foreign exchange rates negatively impacted Corning’s consolidated net sales by $45 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, when compared to the same period in 2018.

In

2019,

sales in international markets accounted for 68% of total net sales.

Cost of Sales

The types of expenses included in the cost of sales line item are: raw materials consumption, including direct and indirect materials; salaries, wages and benefits; depreciation and amortization; production utilities; production-related purchasing; warehousing (including receiving and inspection); repairs and maintenance; inter-location inventory transfer costs; production and warehousing facility property insurance; rent for production facilities; and other production overhead.

Gross Margin

In the year ended December 31, 2019, gross margin dollars decreased by $426 million, or 10%, and gross margin as a percentage of net sales declined by 5% when compared to the same period last year.  Negative impacts to gross margin were primarily driven by accelerated depreciation, asset write-offs and lower sales in our Display Technologies and Optical Communications segments during 2019.  As volume declined in the second half of 2019, factory utilization was less efficient and negatively impacted gross margin.

Index

Movements in foreign exchange rates had a $33 million positive impact on Corning’s consolidated gross margin in the year ended December 31, 2019, when compared to the same period in 2018.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

When compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $214 million, or 12%, in the year ended December 31, 2019.  Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by 2% as a percentage of sales.

The decrease was primarily driven by the following items:



The absence of a $132 million charge related to legal matters in 2018, including a ruling in an intellectual property lawsuit and developments in civil litigation matters; and



Reduced variable compensation expenses of $85 million.

Research, Development and Engineering Expenses

For the year ended December 31, 2019, research, development and engineering expenses increased by $38 million, or 4%, when compared to the same period in prior year, driven by

higher costs associated with new product launches and our emerging businesses.  As a percentage of sales, these expenses were consistent when compared to the same period in the previous year.

Equity in Earnings of Affiliated Companies

The following provides a summary of equity earnings (losses) of affiliated companies (in millions):

Years ended December 31,

Total equity earnings

$

In 2016, Corning realigned its ownership interest in Dow Corning, exchanging its 50% interest in the joint venture between Corning and Dow Chemical for a newly formed company that holds a 49.9% interest in Hemlock Semiconductor LLC and a 40.25% interest in Hemlock Semiconductor Operations LLC which are recorded as equity method investments of Corning and are affiliated companies of HSG.  HSG manufactures polysilicon products for the semiconductor and solar industries.  HSG’s solar business primarily serves the solar power panel industry.

In prior years, HSG’s solar and semiconductor customers entered into long-term “take or pay” contracts which included up-front cash payments to secure capacity.   During the last few years, and more significantly in 2019, the solar power panel industry experienced significant over-capacity in the market, resulting in declining sales volumes and market prices.  As a result, HSG’s solar business experienced lower market penetration, overall price declines, and settled contracts with customers that had committed volume and fixed pricing above the current market price.  While these settlements positively impacted HSG’s cash flow in 2019, they reduced expectations for future sales in HSG’s solar business.

Due to the adverse change in HSG’s solar business, HSG was required to assess the recoverability of its long-lived assets in the fourth quarter.  Based on this assessment, HSG determined that the carrying values of HSG’s solar asset group significantly exceeded its fair values.  HSG engaged a third-party appraiser to assist in determining the fair value of the assets within in the solar asset group based on the highest and best use of the asset group.  As a result of the fair value determination, HSG recognized a pre-tax asset impairment charge of $916 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.  Corning’s share of the pre-tax impairment was $369 million.

Due to the adverse changes above, the carrying values of HSG’s solar business inventories were also affected resulting in an inventory write-down of $257 million for the year.  Corning’s pre-tax share of the provision was $105 million.

Index

HSG adopted the new revenue standard on January 1, 2019 and the timing of HSG’s revenue recognition for certain remaining performance obligations measured at January 1, 2019 was deferred for recognition.  This deferral reduced the carrying amount of Corning’s investment in HSG by $239 million.  During the fourth quarter, a significant number of the performance obligations were satisfied and $434 million was recognized into HSG’s net income.  Corning’s share of the equity earnings was $208 million.

In addition, HSG settled certain revenue contracts in the fourth quarter, resulting in settlement gains of $383 million in net income.  Corning’s share of the settlement gains was $185 million.

Additional information about corporate investments is presented in Note 6 (Investments) to the consolidated financial statements.

Translated earnings contracts

Included in the line item translated earnings contract gain (loss), net, is the impact of foreign currency hedges which hedge our translation exposure arising from movements in the Japanese yen, South Korean won, new Taiwan dollar, euro, Chinese yuan and British pound and its impact on our net income (loss).

Effective tax rate

21.1%

29.1%

130.0%

For the year ended December 31, 2019, the effective income tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the following:



Additional net provision of $102 million from changes to our tax reserves;



A net benefit of $45 million due to releases of foreign valuation allowances on foreign deferred tax assets that are now considered realizable; and



Additional net benefit, including a change in estimate from prior year, from the 2017 Tax Act attributable to foreign intangible income (FDII) deduction of $103 million offset by taxes for global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) of $15 million.

For the year ended December 31, 2018, the effective income tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the following:



Additional taxes of $55 million related primarily to the global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) provisions of the 2017 Tax Act; and



Incremental tax expense of $172 million related to a preliminary agreement with the IRS for the income tax audit of years 2013 and 2014.

Index

These items were partially offset by the following:



A benefit of $35 million related to the finalization of the one-time toll charge recorded in 2017; and



An $82 million benefit from the release of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets that are now considered realizable.

Generally, Corning will indefinitely reinvest the foreign earnings of: (1) any of its subsidiaries located in jurisdictions where Corning lacks the ability to repatriate its earnings, (2) any of its subsidiaries where Corning’s intention is to reinvest those earnings in operations, (3) legal entities for which Corning holds a non-controlling interest, (4) any subsidiaries with an accumulated deficit in earnings and profits, (5) any subsidiaries which have a positive earnings and profits balance but for which the entity lacks sufficient local statutory earnings or stock basis from which to make a distribution, and (6) future distribution would trigger a significant federal income inclusion to the U.S. shareholder.

During 2019, the Company distributed approximately $424 million from foreign subsidiaries to their respective U.S. parent companies.   As of December 31, 2019, Corning has approximately $2.5 billion of indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings.  It remains impracticable to calculate the tax cost of repatriating our unremitted earnings which are considered indefinitely reinvested.

Refer to Note 5 (Income Taxes) to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding income tax matters.

2019 vs. 2018

For the year ended December 31, 2019, comprehensive income decreased by $99 million, when compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to the following:



A decrease in net income of $106 million; and



An $83 million increase in unamortized actuarial losses for post-retirement benefit plans, $53 million of which was related to the adoption of the new standard for reclassification of stranded tax effects in AOCI with the remainder of the impact driven by decreases in the discount rates used to value our post-retirement obligations.

These losses were partially offset by the following:



A decrease in the loss on foreign currency translation adjustments in the amount of $42 million, most significantly impacted by the Chinese yuan, South Korean won and Japanese yen; and



The impact of a change to net unrealized gains on designated hedges of $46 million.

CORE PERFORMANCE MEASURES

In managing the Company and assessing our financial performance, we adjust certain measures provided by our consolidated financial statements to exclude specific items to report core performance measures.  These items include gains and losses on our translated earnings contracts, acquisition-related costs, certain discrete tax items and other tax-related adjustments, restructuring, impairment, and other charges or credits, certain litigation-related expenses, pension mark-to-market adjustments and other items which do not reflect on-going operating results of the Company or our equity affiliates.

Corning utilizes constant-currency reporting for our Display Technologies and Specialty Materials segments for the Japanese yen, South Korean won, Chinese yuan and new Taiwan dollar currencies.

Effective January 1, 2019, Corning also began using constant-currency reporting for our Environmental Technologies and Life Sciences segments for the euro, Japanese yen and Chinese yuan.  The Company believes that the use of constant-currency reporting allows investors to understand our results without the volatility of currency fluctuations and reflects the underlying economics of the translated earnings contracts used to mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on our earnings and cash flows.  Corning also believes that reporting core performance measures provides investors greater transparency to the information used by our management team to make financial and operational decisions.

Core performance measures are not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States (“GAAP”).  We believe investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in evaluating our results as they are more indicative of our core operating performance and how management evaluates our operational results and trends.  These measures are not, and should not be viewed as a substitute for, GAAP reporting measures.  With respect to the Company’s outlook for future periods, it is not possible to provide reconciliations for these non-GAAP measures because the Company does not forecast the movement of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar, or other items that do not reflect ongoing operations, nor does it forecast items that have not yet occurred or are out of the Company’s control.  As a result, the Company is unable to provide outlook information on a GAAP basis.

Effective July 1, 2019, we replaced the term “Core Earnings” with “Core Net Income”

.  The terms are interchangeable and the underlying calculations remain the same.

For a reconciliation of non-GAAP performance measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, please see “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures”.

Core Net Income

2019 vs. 2018

In the year ended December 31, 2019, we generated core net income of $1,578 million or $1.76 per share, compared to core net income generated in the year ended December 31, 2018 of $1,673 million, or $1.78 per share.  The decrease in core net income of $95 million was driven by the following items:



A decrease in the Optical Communications segment of $103 million primarily driven by decreases in volume;



A decrease in the Display Technologies segment of $49 million primarily driven by decreases in volume and glass shipments during the second half of 2019, resulting in lower factory utilization and negatively impacting profitability; and



A decrease of $11 million in the Specialty Materials segment, largely driven by the absence of customer support for new product development costs for the launch of new product innovations in 2019.

Partially offsetting these decreases in core net income were the following:



An increase in the Environmental Technologies segment of $55 million resulting from earnings growth driven by increased sales of gas particulate filters; and



An increase of $33 million in the Life Sciences segment resulting from higher volumes outpacing the underlying market.

Core earnings per share decreased in the year ended December 31, 2019 to $1.76 per share, driven by the decrease in core net income and partially offset by the repurchase of 31.0 million shares of common stock over the last twelve months.

Included in core net income for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, is net periodic pension expense in the amount of $84 million, $52 million and $49 million, which excludes the annual pension mark-to-market adjustments.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures

We utilize certain financial measures and key performance indicators that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP to assess our financial and operating performance.  A non-GAAP financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of a company’s financial performance that (i) excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the consolidated statements of income (loss) or statement of cash flows, or (ii) includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the comparable measure as calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the consolidated statements of income (loss) or statement of cash flows.

Core net sales, core equity in earnings of affiliated companies and core net income are non-GAAP financial measures utilized by our management to analyze financial performance without the impact of items that are driven by general economic conditions and events that do not reflect the underlying fundamentals and trends in the Company’s operations.

REPORTABLE SEGMENTS

Our reportable segments are as follows:



Display Technologies – manufactures glass substrates for flat panel liquid crystal displays and other high-performance display panels.



Optical Communications – manufactures carrier network and enterprise network components for the telecommunications industry.



Specialty Materials – manufactures products that provide more than 150 material formulations for glass, glass ceramics and fluoride crystals to meet demand for unique customer needs.



Environmental Technologies – manufactures ceramic substrates and filters for automotive and diesel applications.



Life Sciences – manufactures glass and plastic labware, equipment, media, serum and reagents enabling workflow solutions for drug discovery and bioproduction.

All other segments that do not meet the quantitative threshold for separate reporting have been grouped as “All Other.”  This group is primarily comprised of the results of pharmaceutical technologies, auto glass, new product lines and development projects, as well as certain corporate investments.

We prepared the financial results for our reportable segments on a basis consistent with our internal disaggregation of financial information to assist in making internal operating decisions.  We use a segment tax rate of 21% when presenting segment information.  The impact of changes in the Japanese yen, euro, South Korean won, Chinese yuan and new Taiwan dollar are excluded from segment sales and segment net income for the Display Technologies, Specialty Materials, Environmental Technologies and Life Science segments.  Certain corporate income and expenses are included in the unallocated amounts in the reconciliation of reportable segment net income to consolidated net income.  These include items that are not used by our CODM in evaluating the results of, or in allocating resources to, our segments and include the following items:  the impact of our translated earnings contracts; acquisition-related costs; discrete tax items and other tax-related adjustments; certain litigation, regulatory and other legal matters; restructuring, impairment and other charges or credits; adjustments relating to acquisitions; and other non-recurring non-operational items.  Although we exclude these amounts from segment results, they are included in reported consolidated results.

We included the earnings of equity affiliates that are closely associated with our reportable segments in the respective segment’s net income.  We have allocated certain common expenses among reportable segments differently than we would for stand-alone financial information.  Segment net income may not be consistent with measures used by other companies.

2019 vs. 2018

Net sales in the Display Technologies segment decreased by $22 million, or 1%, for the year ended December 31, 2019, when compared to the prior year.  Corning’s glass volume increased by a mid-single digit percentage, higher than the overall market, driven by increased Gen 10.5 output during the year.  The combination of finished goods volume, unfinished glass sold to our equity affiliates and a low-single-digit percentage price decline resulted in a one percent sales decline.

© 2020 Corning Incorporated. All Rights Reserved.


Index

Net income in the Display Technologies segment decreased by $49 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, driven by the decrease in sales outlined above.  Display Technologies shipped more glass in the first half of 2019 than in the latter half.  Due to lower glass volumes in the second half of 2019, factory utilization declined impacting profitability.

Outlook:

For full-year 2020,

Corning expects its display glass volume to grow by a mid-single digit percentage, similar to the mid-single digit percentage growth expected in the display glass market.  The company expects display glass price declines to remain moderate, down a mid-single percentage for the full year.

2019 vs. 2018

Net sales declined by $128 million, or 3%, in the year ended December 31, 2019, when compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to lower sales in carrier products, down $199 million, partially offset by an increase of $71 million in enterprise network sales.  Sales were lower than expected due to weakness in the optical market, highlighted by capital spending reductions at two of our significant customers in the latter half of 2019.

Net income in the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased by $103 million, or 17%.

Lower sales volumes in the latter half of 2019 drove less efficient

factory utilization negatively impacting profitability.

Movements in foreign currency exchange rates did not materially impact net income in this segment in the year ended December 31, 2019 when compared to the same period in 2018.

Outlook:

Full-year 2020 Optical Communications sales are expected to decrease by five to ten percent on a year-over-year basis.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Financing and Capital Structure

The following items discuss Corning’s financing and changes in capital structure during 2019 and 2018:


In the third quarter of 2019, Corning issued two Japanese yen-denominated debt securities (the “Notes”), as follows:



¥31.3 billion 1.153% senior unsecured notes with a maturity of 12 years; and



¥5.9 billion 1.513% senior unsecured notes with a maturity of 20 years.

The proceeds from the Notes were received in Japanese yen and converted to U.S. dollars on the date of issuance.  The net proceeds received in U.S. dollars, after deducting offering expenses, were approximately $349 million and will be used for general corporate purposes.  Payments of principal and interest on the Notes will be in Japanese yen, or should yen be unavailable due to circumstances beyond Corning’s control, a U.S. dollar equivalent.

In the fourth quarter of 2019, Corning issued two U.S. dollar-denominated debt securities (the “Notes”), as follows:



$400 million 3.90% senior unsecured notes with a maturity of 30 years; and



$1.1 billion 5.45% senior unsecured notes with a maturity of 60 years.

The net proceeds, after deducting offering expenses, were approximately $1.5 billion and will be used for general corporate purposes.  We can redeem these notes at any time, subject to certain terms and conditions.

In the fourth quarter of 2019, Corning redeemed $300 million of 4.25% notes due in 2020, paying a premium of $4.7 million by exercising our make-whole call.  The bond redemption resulted in an $8.4 million loss during the same quarter.

Common Stock Dividends

On February 6, 2018, Corning’s Board of Directors declared a 16.1% increase in the Company’s quarterly common stock dividend, which increased the quarterly dividend from $0.155 to $0.18 per share of common stock, beginning with the dividend to be paid in the first quarter of 2018.

On February 6, 2019, Corning’s Board of Directors declared an 11.1% increase in the Company’s quarterly common stock dividend, which increased the quarterly dividend from $0.18 to $0.20 per share of common stock, beginning with the dividend paid in the first quarter of 2019.

Index

On February 5, 2020, Corning’s Board of Directors declared an 10.0% increase in the Company’s quarterly common stock dividend, which increased the quarterly dividend from $0.20 to $0.22 per share of common stock, beginning with the dividend paid in the first quarter of 2020.  This increase marks the ninth dividend increase since October 2011.

Fixed Rate Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, Series A

Corning has 2,300 outstanding shares of Fixed Rate Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, Series A.  The preferred stock is convertible at the option of the holder and the Company upon certain events, at a conversion rate of 50,000 shares of Corning’s common stock per one share of preferred stock, subject to certain anti-dilution provisions.  As of December 31, 2019, the preferred stock has not been converted, and none of the anti-dilution provisions have been triggered.

Customer Deposits

As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, Corning had customer deposits of approximately $1.0 billion.  The majority of these represent non-refundable cash deposits for customers to secure rights to an amount of glass produced by Corning under long-term supply agreements.  The duration of these long-term supply agreements ranges up to ten years.  As glass is shipped to customers, Corning will recognize revenue and issue credit memoranda to reduce the amount of the customer deposit liability, which are applied against customer receivables resulting from the sale of glass.  Credit memoranda of $37 million were issued in 2019; no such memoranda were issued in 2018.

Capital Spending

Capital spending totaled $1,978 million in 2019, a decrease of $264 million when compared to 2018, primarily driven by lower spending in the Optical Communications and Display Technologies segments.  We expect our 2020 capital expenditures to be approximately $1.5 billion.

2019 vs. 2018

Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $888 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, when compared to the same period last year, primarily driven by a decrease in customer deposits received of $558 million and net unfavorable movements in working capital of $352 million.

In the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash used in investing activities decreased by $996 million, primarily driven by lower acquisition and capital expenditures of $842 million and $264 million, respectively, partially offset by the absence of cash received of $196 million for a contingent consideration asset, when compared to the prior year.

Net cash used in financing activities decreased by $1,948 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, when compared to the same period last year.  The primary drivers were lower share repurchases, down $1,287 million, lower debt repayments, down $329 million and increased borrowing, up $346 million.

Defined Benefit Pension Plans

We have defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic and international employees.  Our largest single pension plan is Corning’s U.S. qualified plan.  At December 31, 2019, this plan accounted for 76% of our consolidated defined benefit pension plans’ projected benefit obligation and 86% of the related plans’ assets.

Index

In 2019, we made no voluntary contributions to our domestic defined benefit pension plan and cash contributions of $2 million to our international pension plans.  During 2020, we anticipate making cash contributions of $85 million to our U.S. qualified pension plan and $54 million to our international pension plans.

Management Assessment of Liquidity

We ended the fourth quarter of 2019 with approximately $2.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents.  Our cash and cash equivalents are held in various locations throughout the world and are generally unrestricted.  We utilize a variety of strategies to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed.  At December 31, 2019, approximately 51% of the consolidated amount was held outside of the United States

.

To manage interest rate exposure, the Company, from time to time, enters into interest rate swap agreements.  As of December 31, 2019, there are no interest rate swaps outstanding.

Our Revolving Credit Agreement provides a committed $1.5 billion unsecured multi-currency line of credit and expires August 15, 2023.  At December 31, 2019, there were no outstanding amounts under the Revolving Credit Agreement.

Corning also has a commercial paper program pursuant to which we may issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding at any one time of $1.5 billion.  Under this program, the Company may issue the paper from time to time and will use the proceeds for general corporate purposes.  The Company’s Revolving Credit Agreement is available to support obligations under the commercial paper program, if needed.  At December 31, 2019, Corning did not have outstanding commercial paper.

Share Repurchases

During 2018, Corning repurchased 74.8 million shares for approximately $2.2 billion through open market repurchases

under the 2016 and 2018 Repurchase Programs.

During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company repurchased 31.0 million shares of common stock on the open market for approximately $0.9 billion as part of its 2018 and 2019 Repurchase Programs.

Other

We complete comprehensive reviews of our significant customers and their creditworthiness by analyzing their financial strength at least annually or more frequently for customers where we have identified a measure of increased risk.  We closely monitor payments and developments which may signal possible customer credit issues.  From time to time, we factor accounts receivable. During 2019, Corning participated in customer-initiated payment programs which resulted in accelerated collections of $143 million in accounts receivable.  We currently have not identified any potential material impact on our liquidity resulting from customer credit issues.

Our major source of funding for 2020 and beyond will be our operating cash flow, our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents and proceeds from any issuances of debt.  We believe we have sufficient liquidity to fund operations, acquisitions, capital expenditures, scheduled debt repayments, dividend payments and share repurchase programs.

Our Revolving Credit Agreement includes affirmative and negative covenants with which we must comply, including a leverage (debt to capital ratio) financial covenant.  The required leverage ratio is a maximum of 60%.  At December 31, 2019, our leverage using this measure was approximately 37%.  As of December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with this financial covenant.

Our debt instruments contain customary event of default provisions, which allow the lenders the option of accelerating all obligations upon the occurrence of certain events.  In addition, some of our debt instruments contain a cross default provision, whereby an uncured default exceeding a specified amount on one debt obligation of the Company, also would be considered a default under the terms of another debt instrument.  As of December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with all such provisions.

Management is not aware of any known trends or any known demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in a material decrease in our liquidity.  In addition, other than items discussed, there are no known material trends, favorable or unfavorable, in our capital resources and no expected material changes in the mix and relative cost of such resources.

Translated Earnings Contracts

Corning has hedged a significant portion of its projected yen exposure for the period 2019 through 2023, with average rate forwards and options.  In the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we recorded pre-tax net gains of $201 million and pre-tax net losses of $96 million, respectively, related to changes in the fair value of these instruments.  Included in these amounts are realized losses of $7 million and realized gains of $64 million, respectively.  The gross notional value outstanding for these instruments which hedge our exposure to the Japanese yen at December 31, 2019 and 2018, was $10.2 billion and $11.6 billion, respectively.

We have entered into average rate forwards to hedge our translation exposure resulting from movements in the South Korean won and its impact on our net income.  In the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we recorded a pre-tax net gain of $6 million and a pre-tax net loss of $26 million, respectively, related to changes in the fair value of these instruments.  Included in these amounts is a realized loss of $1 million and a realized gain of $46 million, respectively.  These instruments had a gross notional value outstanding at December 31, 2019 and 2018, of $0.4 and $0.1 billion, respectively.

We have entered into a portfolio of average rate forwards to hedge against our euro translation exposure.  In the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we recorded pre-tax gains of $37 million and $43 million, respectively.  Included in these amounts are realized gains of $29 million and realized losses of $14 million, respectively.  At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the euro-denominated average rate instruments had a gross notional amount of $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively.

These derivative instruments are not designated as accounting hedges, and changes in fair value are recorded in earnings in the translated earnings contract gain (loss), net line of the consolidated statements of income (loss).

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

Off balance sheet arrangements are transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which Corning has an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements.

Corning’s off balance sheet arrangements include guarantee and indemnity contracts.  At the time a guarantee is issued, the Company is required to recognize a liability for the fair value or market value of the obligation it assumes.  In the normal course of our business, we do not routinely provide significant third-party guarantees.  Generally, third-party guarantees provided by Corning are limited to certain financial guarantees, including stand-by letters of credit and performance bonds, and the incurrence of contingent liabilities in the form of purchase price adjustments related to attainment of milestones.  These guarantees have various terms, and none of these guarantees are individually significant.

Refer to Note 13 (Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

For variable interest entities, we assess the terms of our interest in each entity to determine if we are the primary beneficiary.  The primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is the party that absorbs a majority of the entity’s expected losses, receives a majority of its expected residual returns, or both, as a result of holding variable interests, which are the ownership, contractual, or other pecuniary interests in an entity that change with changes in the fair value of the entity’s net assets excluding variable interests.

Corning has identified ten entities that qualify as a variable interest entity and are not consolidated.  These entities are not considered to be significant to Corning’s consolidated financial statements.

Corning does not have retained interests in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serve as credit, liquidity or market risk support to that entity.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein.  The estimates that required us to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments, including future projections of performance and relevant discount rates, are set forth below.

Impairment of assets held for use

We are required to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets when an indicator of impairment has been identified.  We review our long-lived assets in each quarter to assess whether impairment indicators are present.  We must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event of impairment has occurred.

Manufacturing equipment includes certain components of production equipment that are constructed of precious metals, primarily platinum and rhodium.  These metals are not depreciated because they have very low physical losses and are repeatedly reclaimed and reused in our manufacturing process over a very long useful life.  Precious metals are reviewed for impairment as part of our assessment of long-lived assets.  This review considers all the Company’s precious metals that are either in place in the production process; in reclamation, fabrication, or refinement in anticipation of re-use; or awaiting use to support increased capacity.  Precious metals are only acquired to support our operations and are not held for trading or other non-manufacturing related purposes.

© 2020 Corning Incorporated. All Rights Reserved.


Index

Examples of events or circumstances that may be indicative of impairments include, but are not limited to:



A significant decrease in the market price of an asset;



A significant change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset is being used or in its physical condition;



A significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the asset, including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator;



An accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of an asset;



A current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of an asset; and



A current expectation that, more likely than not, an asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life.

For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss, a long-lived asset or assets is grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.  We must exercise judgment in assessing the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.  Our assessment is performed at the reportable segment level.  For the majority of our reportable segments, we concluded that locations or businesses within these segments which share production along the supply chain must be combined to appropriately identify cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.

For long-lived assets, when impairment indicators are present, we compare estimated undiscounted future cash flows, including the eventual disposition of the asset group at market value, to the assets’ carrying value to determine if the asset group is recoverable.  This assessment requires the exercise of judgment in assessing the future use of and projected value to be derived from the assets to be held and used.  Assessments also consider changes in asset utilization, including the temporary idling of capacity and the expected timing for placing this capacity back into production.

For an asset group that fails the test of recoverability, the estimated fair value of long-lived assets is determined using an “income approach” that starts with the forecast of all the expected future net cash flows including the eventual disposition at market value of long-lived assets, and considers the fair market value of all precious metals, if applicable.  We assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.  If there is an impairment, a loss is recorded to reflect the difference between the assets’ fair value and carrying value.  Our estimates are based upon our historical experience, our commercial relationships, and available external information about future trends.  We believe fair value assessments are most sensitive to market growth and the corresponding impact on volume and selling prices and that these are also more subjective than manufacturing cost and other assumptions.  The Company believes its current assumptions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate.

At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the carrying value of precious metals was lower than the fair market value by $849 million and higher than the fair market value by $719 million, respectively.  The majority of these precious metals are utilized by the Display Technologies and Specialty Materials segments.  Corning believes these precious metal assets to be recoverable due to the significant positive cash flow in both segments.  The potential for impairment exists in the future if negative events significantly decrease the cash flow of these segments.  Such events include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in demand for products or a significant decrease in profitability in our Display Technologies or Specialty Materials segments.

Income taxes

We are required to exercise judgment about our future results in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets.  Inherent in this estimation process is the requirement for us to estimate future book and taxable income and possible tax planning strategies.  These estimates require us to exercise judgment about our future results, the prudence and feasibility of possible tax planning strategies, and the economic environments in which we do business.  It is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to allowances.

Index

Corning accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, which requires that companies only record tax benefits for technical positions that are believed to have a greater than 50% likelihood of being sustained on their technical merits and then only to the extent of the amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement.  In estimating these amounts, we must exercise judgment around factors such as the weighting of the tax law in our favor, the willingness of a tax authority to aggressively pursue a particular position, or alternatively, consider a negotiated compromise, and our willingness to dispute a tax authorities’ assertion to the level of appeal we believe is required to sustain our position.  As a result, it is possible that our estimate of the benefits we will realize for uncertain tax positions may change when we become aware of new information affecting these judgments and estimates.

Fair value measures

As required, Corning uses two kinds of inputs to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities: observable and unobservable.  Observable inputs are based on market data or independent sources, while unobservable inputs are based on the Company’s own market assumptions.  Once inputs have been characterized, we prioritize the inputs used to measure fair value into one of three broad levels.  Characterization of fair value inputs is required for those accounting pronouncements that prescribe or permit fair value measurement.  In addition, observable market data must be used when available and the highest-and-best-use measure should be applied to non-financial assets.  Corning’s major categories of financial assets and liabilities required to be measured at fair value are short-term and long-term investments, certain pension asset investments and derivatives.  These categories use observable inputs only and are measured using a market approach based on quoted prices in markets considered active or in markets in which there are few transactions.

Derivative assets and liabilities may include interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts that are measured using observable quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities.  Included in our forward exchange contracts are foreign currency hedges that hedge our cash flow and translation exposure resulting from movements in the Japanese yen, South Korean won, euro, new Taiwan dollar, Chinese yuan and British pound.  Changes in the fair value of contracts designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders’ equity and reclassified into income when the underlying hedged item impacts earnings.  For contracts that are not designated as accounting hedges, changes in fair value are recorded in earnings in the translated earnings contract gain (loss), net line of the consolidated statements of income (loss).  In arriving at the fair value of Corning’s derivative assets and liabilities, we have considered the appropriate valuation and risk criteria, including such factors as credit risk of the relevant party to the transaction.  Amounts related to credit risk are not material.

Refer to Note 15 (Fair Value Measurements) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Probability of litigation outcomes

We are required to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain.  In making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters, we consider the evaluation of legal counsel knowledgeable about each matter, case law, and other case-specific issues.  See Part II – Item 3. Legal Proceedings for a discussion of Corning’s material litigation matters.

Other possible liabilities

We are required to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain.  In making determinations of likely outcomes of certain matters, including certain tax planning and environmental matters, these judgments require us to consider events and actions that are outside our control in determining whether probable or possible liabilities require accrual or disclosure.  It is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to accruals.

Pension and other postretirement employee benefits (OPEB)

Corning offers employee retirement plans consisting of defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic and international employees and postretirement plans that provide health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retirees and dependents.  The costs and obligations related to these benefits reflect the Company’s assumptions related to general economic conditions (particularly interest rates), expected return on plan assets, rate of compensation increase for employees and health care trend rates.  The cost of providing plan benefits depends on demographic assumptions including retirements, mortality, turnover and plan participation.  While management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect Corning’s employee pension and other postretirement obligations, and current and future expense.

Costs for our defined benefit pension plans consist of two elements:  1) on-going costs recognized quarterly, which are comprised of service and interest costs, expected return on plan assets and amortization of prior service costs; and 2) mark-to-market gains and losses outside of the corridor, where the corridor is equal to 10% of the greater of the benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets at the beginning of the year, which are recognized annually in the fourth quarter of each year.  These gains and losses result from changes in actuarial assumptions and the differences between actual and expected return on plan assets.  Any interim remeasurements triggered by a curtailment, settlement or significant plan changes, as well as any true-up to the annual valuation, are recognized as a mark-to-market adjustment in the quarter in which such event occurs.

Costs for our OPEB plans consist of on-going costs recognized quarterly, and are comprised of service and interest costs, amortization of prior service costs and amortization of actuarial gains and losses.  We recognize the actuarial gains and losses resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders’ equity on an annual basis and amortize them into our operating results over the average remaining service period of employees expected to receive benefits under the plans, to the extent such gains and losses are outside of the corridor.

The following table presents our actual and expected return on assets, as well as the corresponding percentages:

The above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time.  Note that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear.  These changes in assumptions would have no effect on Corning’s funding requirements.

In addition, at December 31, 2019, a 25 basis point decrease in each spot rate would decrease shareholders’ equity by $133 million before tax, and a 25 basis point increase in each spot rate would increase shareholders’ equity by $127 million.  In addition, the impact of greater than a 25 basis point decrease in each spot rate would not be proportional to the first 25 basis point decrease in each spot rate.

Revenue recognition

The Company recognizes revenue when all performance obligations under the terms of a contract with our customer are satisfied, and control of the product has been transferred to the customer.  If customer acceptance clauses are present and it cannot be objectively determined that control has been transferred, revenue is only recorded when customer acceptance is received and all performance obligations have been satisfied.  Sales of goods typically do not include multiple product and/or service elements.  Corning also has contractual arrangements with certain customers in which we recognize revenue over time.  The performance obligations under these contracts generally require services to be performed over time, resulting in either a straight-line amortization method or an input method using incurred and forecasted expense to predict revenue recognition patterns which follows satisfaction of the performance obligation.

On January 1, 2018, we adopted

the new revenue standard

and applied the modified retrospective method of accounting to those contracts which were not completed as of January 1, 2018.  Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting under ASC Topic 605 “Revenue Recognition”.

Because the impact of adopting the standard on Corning’s financial statements was immaterial,

we have not made an adjustment to opening retained earnings.

One of Corning’s equity affiliates adopted the new revenue standard on January 1, 2019.  The impact of adopting the new standard to Corning’s financial statements was a net reduction of $186 million to 2019 beginning retained earnings.  Timing of revenue recognition for certain open performance obligations as measured at January 1, 2019 under the new standard was approximately $239 million with offsetting deferred tax impacts of $53 million.

Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks

We operate and conduct business in many foreign countries and as a result are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates.  Our exposure to exchange rates has the following effects:



Exchange rate movements on financial instruments and transactions denominated in foreign currencies that impact earnings; and



Exchange rate movements upon conversion of net assets and net income of foreign subsidiaries for which the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, which impact our net equity.

Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the Japanese yen, South Korean won, new Taiwan dollar, Chinese yuan, and the euro.  We seek to mitigate the impact of exchange rate movements in our income statement by using over-the-counter (OTC) derivative instruments including foreign exchange forward and option contracts.  In general, these hedges expire coincident with the timing of the underlying foreign currency commitments and transactions.

We are exposed to potential losses in the event of non-performance by our counterparties to these derivative contracts.  However, we minimize this risk by maintaining a diverse group of highly-rated major financial institutions as our counterparties.  We do not expect to record any losses as a result of such counterparty default.  Neither we nor our counterparties are required to post collateral for these financial instruments.

Our cash flow hedging activities utilize OTC foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that movements in exchange rates will adversely affect the net cash flows resulting from the sale of products to foreign customers and purchases from foreign suppliers.  We also use OTC foreign exchange forward and option contracts that are not designated as hedged instruments.  These contracts are used to offset economic currency risks.  The undesignated hedges limit exposures to foreign functional currency fluctuations related to certain subsidiaries’ monetary assets, monetary liabilities and net earnings in foreign currencies.  A significant portion of the Company’s non-U.S. revenues are denominated in Japanese yen.  When these revenues are translated back to U.S. dollars, the Company is exposed to foreign exchange rate movements in the Japanese yen.  To protect translated earnings against movements in the Japanese yen, the Company has entered into a series of average rate forwards and other derivative instruments.

We use a sensitivity analysis to assess the market risk associated with our foreign currency exposures.  Market risk is defined as the potential change in fair value of assets and liabilities resulting from an adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates.  At December 31, 2019, with respect to open foreign exchange forward and option contracts, and foreign denominated debt with values exposed to exchange rate movements, a 10% adverse movement in quoted foreign currency exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of $1.3 billion compared to $1.1 billion at December 31, 2018.  Specific to the Japanese yen, a 10% adverse movement in quoted yen exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of $1.0 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018.  The Company expects that these hypothetical losses from a 10% adverse movement in quoted foreign currency exchange rates on the derivative financial instruments should largely offset gains on the assets, liabilities and future transactions being hedged.

Interest Rate Risk Management

To manage interest rate exposure, the Company, from time to time, enters into interest rate derivatives agreements.

In the second quarter of 2018, the Company entered into Treasury rate lock agreements with notional amounts of $300 million to hedge against the variability in cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate related to an anticipated debt issuance.  The instruments were designated as cash flow hedges, and were settled with $16 million received on October 31, 2018 concurrent with the debt issuance.  As of December 31, 2019, there were no interest rate derivatives agreements outstanding.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our principal executive and principal financial officers, after evaluating the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this report, have concluded that based on the evaluation of these controls and procedures required by paragraph (b) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15, that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

Disclosure controls and procedures mean controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms.  Corning’s disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by Corning in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to Corning’s management, including Corning’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or other persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

(a)

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for Corning.

Corning’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Corning’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of Corning’s assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that Corning’s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of Corning’s management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of Corning’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.

Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

(2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2019.  The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered accounting firm, as stated in their report and is included herein.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Corning Incorporated:

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the accompanying

consolidated

balance sheets of Corning Incorporated and its subsidiaries

as of December 31, 2019

and 2018, and the related

consolidated

s

tatements of income (loss), comprehensive income, changes in shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, including the related notes and schedule of valuation and qualifying accounts for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019 listed in the accompanying index (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”).

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

(2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

In our opinion, the consolidated

financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019

and 2018,

and the results of its

operations and its

cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019

in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

(2013)

issued by the COSO.

Basis for Opinions

The Company's management is responsible for these

consolidated

financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting

, included in Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A

. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s

consolidated

financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our

audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our

audits i

n accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the

consolidated

financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the

consolidated

financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the

consolidated

financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the

consolidated

financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the

consolidated

financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matters communicated below

are matters

arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the

consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated

financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Income Taxes - Receivables for South Korean Tax Disputes

As described in Notes 1, 5, and 10 to the consolidated financial statements, in evaluating the tax benefits associated with the Company’s various tax filing positions, management records a tax benefit for uncertain tax positions using the highest cumulative tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. Adjustments are made to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the period in which management determines the issue is effectively settled with the tax authorities, the statute of limitations expires for the return containing the tax position or when new information becomes available. The Company is currently appealing certain South Korean tax assessments and tax refund claims for tax years 2010 through 2018. The Company is required to deposit the disputed tax amounts with the South Korean government as a condition of its appeal of any tax assessments. Management believes that it is more likely than not that these tax positions will prevail in the appeal process and as a result, management recorded a non-current receivable of $415 million as of December 31, 2019 for the amount on deposit with the South Korean government. In the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company received a refund of $38 million from the South Korean government related to tax years 2006 through 2009.  As of December 31, 2019, management has also recorded a current receivable of $33 million for an amount refunded in January 2020 related to the same issue for the tax year 2015.

The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the receivables for South Korean tax disputes is a critical audit matter are there was significant judgment by management when applying the more likely than not recognition criteria to the Company’s uncertain tax positions based on the application of the tax law. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to management’s assumption that the Company will prevail in the appeal of any tax assessments. In addition, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in performing these procedures and evaluating the audit evidence obtained.

Index

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to uncertain tax positions, including management’s assessment of the South Korean tax disputes.

These procedures also included, among others, obtaining management’s assessment and evidence supporting the more-likely-than-not tax position on the South Korean tax disputes and evaluating the reasonableness of the likelihood that the tax positions will ultimately be sustained upon examination by the South Korean tax authorities and through the appeal process. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating management’s assessment and supporting evidence, including application of the tax law.

Impairment at the Equity Method Investee, Hemlock Semiconductor Group - The Long-lived Asset Impairment of the Solar Power Panel Asset Group (“Solar Group”)

As described in Notes 1 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s equity method investments are reviewed for impairment on a periodic basis or if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. This assessment is based on a review of the equity investments’ performance and a review of indicators of impairment to determine if there is evidence of a loss in value of an equity investment. Hemlock Semiconductor LLC and Hemlock Semiconductor Operations LLC, of which the Company has 49.9% and 40.25% ownerships respectively, are recorded as equity method investments and are affiliated companies of Hemlock Semiconductor Group (HSG). Due to the adverse change in HSG’s solar business, HSG was required to assess the recoverability of its long-lived assets in the fourth quarter. Based on this assessment, HSG determined that the carrying values of HSG’s Solar Group significantly exceeded its fair value. HSG engaged a third-party appraiser to assist in determining the fair value of the assets within the Solar Group based on the highest and best use of the asset group. As a result of the fair value determination, HSG recognized pre-tax asset impairment charges of $916 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The Company’s share of the pre-tax impairment was $369 million.

The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to HSG’s long-lived asset impairment of the Solar Group is a critical audit matter are there was a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to (i) management’s assessment of the impairment at HSG, and (ii) the determination of the asset groups and the fair value of the assets within HSG’s Solar Group, including the assumptions related to the highest and best use of the assets. In addition, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in performing these procedures and evaluating the audit evidence obtained.

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the equity method investment accounting, including controls over management’s recording of the Company’s share of the pre-tax impairment at HSG’s Solar Group. These procedures also included, among others, (i) evaluating management’s assessment of the impairment at HSG and the Company’s share of the pre-tax impairment, and (ii) testing HSG’s process for determining the fair value of the long-lived assets within HSG’s Solar Group. Testing the fair value of these long-lived assets included determining the appropriateness of the asset groups and reasonableness of the assumptions related to the determination of the fair value of the long-lived assets in the Solar Group based on their highest and best use.

Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the assumptions related to the highest and best use of the long-lived assets and evaluating the consistency of the assumptions with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.

Notes to Consolidated Fi

nancial Statements

Summary of Signif

icant Accounting Policies

Organization

Corning Incorporated is a provider of high-performance glass for notebook computers, flat panel desktop monitors, display televisions, and other information display applications; carrier network and enterprise network products for the telecommunications industry; ceramic substrates for gasoline and diesel engines in automotive and heavy duty vehicle markets; laboratory products for the scientific community and specialized polymer products for biotechnology applications; advanced optical materials for the semiconductor industry and the scientific community; and other technologies.  In these notes, the terms “Corning,” “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our” mean Corning Incorporated and subsidiary companies.

Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation

Our consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. and include the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of all majority-owned subsidiaries over which Corning exercises control.

The equity method of accounting is used for investments in affiliated companies that are not controlled by Corning and in which our interest is generally between


% and


% and we have significant influence over the entity.  Our share of earnings or losses of affiliated companies, in which at least


% of the voting securities is owned and we have significant influence but not control over the entity, is included in consolidated operating results.

For our investments in companies that we do not control and for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies, we use the fair value method to account for the investments if readily determinable fair values are available.  For the investments without readily determinable fair values, we measure them at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment.

All material intercompany accounts, transactions and profits are eliminated in consolidation.

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year’s presentation.  These reclassifications had no impact on our results of operations, financial position, or changes in shareholders’ equity.

Leases

Corning leases certain real estate, vehicles, and equipment from third parties.  On January 1, 2019 we adopted the new leasing standard.  Corning classifies leases as either financing or operating.

Operating leases are included in other assets with the corresponding liability in other accrued liabilities and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.  Finance leases are included in property, plant and equipment with the corresponding liability in the current portion and long-term debt line items on our consolidated balance sheets.

Leases where we are the

lessor are not significant.

Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term for operating leases.  Financing leases are recognized on the effective interest method for interest expense and straight-line method for asset amortization.  Renewals and terminations are included in the calculation of the Right of Use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities when considered to be reasonably certain to be exercised.  When the implicit rate is unknown, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.

Index

1.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Our leases do not include residual value guarantees.  We are not the primary beneficiary in or have other forms of variable interests with the lessor of the leased assets.  The impact to the balance sheet for operating leases is a gross-up for the addition of ROU assets and liabilities relating to the operating leases in the amount of $


million at adoption.

The impact to the balance sheet for financing leases was not material.

Corning elected the following practical expedients and accounting policy elections to apply the new lease accounting standard at its effective date as of January

1, 2019

:



Leases of less than 12 months in duration to be recorded as expense only

;



Account for lease and non-lease components of a contract as a single lease component; and



Comparative reporting of prior periods was not restated due to modified retrospective implementation.

At adoption, Corning recorded a nominal cumulative-effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings.

Refer to Note 4 (Leases) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Revenue

One of Corning’s equity affiliates adopted the new revenue standard on January 1, 2019.  The impact of adopting the new standard to Corning’s financial statements was a net reduction of $


million to 2019 beginning retained earnings.  Timing of revenue recognition for certain open performance obligations as measured at January 1, 2019 under the new standard was approximately $


million with offsetting deferred tax impacts of $


million.

Income Taxes

In February 2018, the FASB issued a new standard for Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income, which allows for reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.  We adopted this new standard effective January 1, 2019.  The impact of the new standard resulted in a reclassification of $


million from accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) to beginning retained earnings.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes.  Significant estimates and assumptions in these consolidated financial statements include estimates associated with revenue recognition, restructuring charges, goodwill and long-lived asset impairment tests, estimates of acquired assets and liabilities, estimates of fair value of investments, equity interests, environmental and legal liabilities, income taxes and deferred tax valuation allowances, assumptions used in calculating pension and other postretirement employee benefit expenses and the fair value of share-based compensation.  Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results reported in future periods may be different from these estimates.

Revenue Recognition

The majority of our revenues are generated by delivery of products to our customers and recognized at a point in time based on our evaluation of when the customer obtains control of the products.  Revenue is recognized when all performance obligations under the terms of a contract with our customer are satisfied, and control of the product has been transferred to the customer.  If customer acceptance clauses are present and it cannot be objectively determined that control has been transferred, revenue is only recorded when customer acceptance is received and all performance obligations have been satisfied.  Sales of goods typically do not include multiple product and/or service elements.

Index

1.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services.  Sales tax, value-added tax, and other taxes we collect concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue.  Incidental contract costs that are not material in the context of the delivery of goods and services are recognized as expense.

At the time revenue is recognized, allowances are recorded, with the related reduction to revenue, for estimated product returns, allowances and price discounts based upon historical experience and related terms of customer arrangements.  Where we have offered product warranties, we also establish liabilities for estimated warranty costs based upon historical experience and specific warranty provisions.  Warranty liabilities are adjusted when experience indicates the expected outcome will differ from initial estimates of the liability.

In addition, Corning also has contractual arrangements with certain customers in which we recognize revenue over time.  The performance obligations under these contracts generally require services to be performed over time, resulting in either a straight-line amortization method or an input method using incurred and forecasted expense to predict revenue recognition patterns which follows satisfaction of the performance obligation.

Research and Development Costs

Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred.  Research and development costs totaled $


million, $


million and $


million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions

The determination of the functional currency for Corning’s foreign subsidiaries is made based on the appropriate economic factors.  For most foreign operations, the local currencies are generally considered to be the functional currencies.  Corning’s most significant exception is our Taiwanese subsidiary, which uses the Japanese yen as its functional currency.  For all transactions denominated in a currency other than a subsidiary’s functional currency, exchange rate gains and losses are included in income for the period in which the exchange rates changed.  We recorded net losses of $


million and $


million for foreign currency transaction activity for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and a net gain of $


million for foreign currency transaction activity for the year ended December 31, 2017.  These amounts were recorded in the line item Other expense, net in the consolidated statements of income (loss).

Foreign subsidiary functional currency balance sheet accounts are translated at current exchange rates, and statement of operations accounts are translated at average exchange rates for the year.  Translation gains and losses are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders’ equity.  The effects of remeasuring non-functional currency assets and liabilities into the functional currency are included in current earnings, except for those related to intra-entity foreign currency transactions of a long-term investment nature, which are recorded together with translation gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss in shareholders’ equity.  Upon sale or substantially complete liquidation of an investment in a foreign entity, the amount of net translation gains or losses that have been accumulated in other comprehensive income attributable to that investment are reported as a gain or loss for the period in which the sale or liquidation occurs.

Share-Based Compensation

Corning maintains long-term incentive plans (the “Plans”) for key employees and non-employee members of our Board of Directors.  The Plans allow us to grant equity-based compensation awards, including stock options, stock appreciation rights, performance share units, restricted stock units, restricted stock awards or a combination of awards (collectively, share-based awards).  At December 31, 2019, there were approximately


million unissued common shares available for future grants authorized under the Plans.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

The Company measures and recognizes compensation cost for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values.

Total share-based compensation expense was $


million, $


million and $


million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  The income tax benefit realized from share-based compensation was not significant for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.  Refer to Note 5 (Income Taxes) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Stock Options

Corning’s stock option plans provide non-qualified and incentive stock options to purchase authorized but unissued common shares, or treasury shares, at the market price on the grant date and generally become exercisable in installments from

one year

to

five year

s from the grant date.  The maximum term of non-qualified and incentive stock options is


years from the grant date.

An award is considered vested when the employee’s retention of the award is no longer contingent on providing subsequent service (the “non-substantive vesting period approach”).  Awards to retirement eligible employees are fully vested at the date of grant, and the related compensation expense is recognized immediately upon grant or over the period from the grant date to the date of retirement eligibility for employees that become age 55 during the vesting period.

Corning uses a multiple-point Black-Scholes valuation model to estimate the fair value of stock option grants.  Corning utilizes a blended approach for calculating the volatility assumption used in the multiple-point Black-Scholes valuation model defined as the weighted average of the short-term implied volatility, the most recent volatility for the period equal to the expected term, and the most recent


-year historical volatility.  The expected term assumption is the period of time the options are expected to be outstanding, and is calculated using a combination of historical exercise experience adjusted to reflect the current vesting period of options being valued, and partial life cycles of outstanding options.  The risk-free rates used in the multiple-point Black-Scholes valuation model are the implied rates for a zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bond with a term equal to the option’s expected term.  The ranges given below reflect results from separate groups of employees exhibiting different exercise behavior.

Incentive Stock Plans

The Corning Incentive Stock Plan permits restricted stock and restricted stock unit grants, either determined by specific performance goals or issued directly, in most instances, subject to the possibility of forfeiture and without cash consideration.  Restricted stock and restricted stock units under the Incentive Stock Plan are granted at the closing market price on the grant date, contingently vest over a period of generally

one year

to

ten year

s, and generally have contractual lives of

one year

to

ten year

s.  The fair value of each restricted stock grant or restricted stock unit awarded under the Incentive Stock Plan is based on the grant date closing price of the Company’s stock.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash.  We consider securities

with contractual maturities of three months or less

, when purchased, to be cash equivalents.  The carrying amount of these securities approximates fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments.

Supplemental disclosure of cash flow information is as follows (in millions):

equipment

, net of accumulated depreciation, in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively

.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts is determined based on a variety of factors that affect the potential collectability of the related receivables, including length of time receivables are past due, customer credit ratings, financial stability of customers, specific one-time events and past customer history.  In addition, in circumstances where the Company is made aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations, a specific allowance is established.  The majority of accounts are individually evaluated on a regular basis and appropriate reserves are established as deemed appropriate based on the above criteria.

Environmental Liabilities

The Company accrues for its environmental investigation, remediation, operating and maintenance costs when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.  For environmental matters, the most likely cost to be incurred is accrued based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site, current laws and regulations and prior remediation experience.  For sites with multiple potentially responsible parties, the Company considers its likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation costs and the ability of the other parties to fulfill obligations in establishing a provision for those costs.  Where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely to occur than another, the minimum undiscounted amount is accrued.  When future liabilities are determined to be reimbursable by insurance coverage, an accrual is recorded for the potential liability and a receivable is recorded related to the insurance reimbursement when reimbursement is virtually certain.

The uncertain nature inherent in such remediation and the possibility that initial estimates may not reflect the outcome could result in additional costs being recognized by the Company in future periods.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out basis) or market.

Property, Plant and Equipment, Net of Accumulated Depreciation

Land, buildings, and equipment, including precious metals, are recorded at cost.  Depreciation is based on estimated useful lives of properties using the straight-line method.  Except as described in Note 8 (Property, Plant and Equipment, Net of Accumulated Depreciation) to the consolidated financial statements related to the depletion of precious metals, the estimated useful lives range from


to

40 year

s for buildings and


to

20 year

s for equipment.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Included in the subcategory of equipment are the following types of assets (excluding precious metals):

Asset type

Range of useful life

Computer hardware and software


to


years

Manufacturing equipment


to


years

Furniture and fixtures


to


years

Transportation equipment


to


years

Manufacturing equipment includes certain components of production equipment that are constructed of precious metals.  These assets are not depreciated because they have very low physical losses and are repeatedly reclaimed and reused in our manufacturing process over a very long useful life.  We treat the physical loss of precious metals in the manufacturing and reclamation process as depletion and account for these losses as a period expense based on actual units lost.  Precious metals are integral to many of our glass production processes.  They are only acquired to support our operations and are not held for trading or other purposes.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill is the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination.  Goodwill relates to and is assigned directly to a specific reporting unit.  Reporting units are either operating segments or one level below the operating segment.  Impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level.  Goodwill is reviewed for indicators of impairment quarterly or if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired.  Corning also performs a detailed quantitative impairment test every three years if no indicators suggest a test should be performed in the interim.  We use this calculation as quantitative validation of the qualitative process; this process does not represent an election to perform the quantitative impairment test in place of the qualitative review.

The qualitative assessment is performed by assessing various factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.  These factors include, but are not limited to, changes in macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, other relevant entity-specific events, or a sustained decrease in share price.

In 2018, we performed a quantitative goodwill impairment assessment in addition to assessing the qualitative factors each quarter.  Our assessment is based on our annual strategic planning process.  This process includes an extensive review of expectations for the long-term growth of our businesses and forecasted future cash flows.  Our valuation method is an “income approach” using a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods, plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon, are discounted to present value using an appropriate discount rate.  Our estimates are based upon our historical experience, our current knowledge from our commercial relationships, and available external information about future trends.  The quantitative assessment requires the exercise of significant judgment, including judgment about appropriate discount rates, growth rates and the timing of expected future cash flows of the respective reporting unit.

The quantitative assessment of goodwill resulted in fair values significantly exceeding the carrying values for all our reporting units.  We also performed a sensitivity analysis, using a range between


-


% for the discount rate and


%-


% for the growth rate, which had no material impact on our results.  Based on the quantitative test performed in 2018, no goodwill impairment was required.

Other intangible assets include patents, trademarks, and other intangible assets acquired from independent parties.  Such intangible assets have a definite life and are amortized on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives ranging from


to


years.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

We review the recoverability of our long-lived assets, such as plant and equipment and intangible assets, when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable.  When impairment indicators are present, we compare estimated undiscounted future cash flows, including the eventual disposition of the asset group at market value, to the assets’ carrying value to determine if the asset group is recoverable.  For an asset group that fails the test of recoverability, the estimated fair value of long-lived assets is determined using an “income approach” that starts with the forecast of all the expected future net cash flows including the eventual disposition at market value of long-lived assets, and considers the fair market value of all precious metals.  We assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.  If there is an impairment, a loss is recorded to reflect the difference between the assets’ fair value and carrying value.

Employee Retirement Plans

Corning offers employee retirement plans consisting of defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic and international employees and postretirement plans that provide health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retirees and dependents.  The costs and obligations related to these benefits reflect the Company’s assumptions related to general economic conditions (particularly interest rates), expected return on plan assets, rate of compensation increase for employees and health care trend rates.  The cost of providing plan benefits depends on demographic assumptions including retirements, mortality, turnover and plan participation.

Costs for our defined benefit pension plans consist of two elements:  1) on-going costs recognized quarterly, which are comprised of service and interest costs, expected return on plan assets and amortization of prior service costs; and 2) mark-to-market gains and losses outside of the corridor, where the corridor is equal to


% of the greater of the benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets at the beginning of the year, which are recognized annually in the fourth quarter of each year.  These gains and losses result from changes in actuarial assumptions and the differences between actual and expected return on plan assets.  Any interim remeasurements triggered by a curtailment, settlement or significant plan change, as well as any true-up to the annual valuation, are recognized as a mark-to-market adjustment in the quarter in which such event occurs.

Costs for our postretirement benefit plans consist of on-going costs recognized quarterly, and are comprised of service and interest costs, amortization of prior service costs and amortization of actuarial gains and losses.  We recognize the actuarial gains and losses resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders’ equity on an annual basis and amortize them into our operating results over the average remaining service period of employees expected to receive benefits under the plans, to the extent such gains and losses are outside of the corridor.

Refer to Note 12 (Employee Retirement Plans) to the consolidated financial statements for additional detail.

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method.  Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and for differences between the carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.

Index

1.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

The effective income tax rate reflects our assessment of the ultimate outcome of tax audits.  In evaluating the tax benefits associated with our various tax filing positions, we record a tax benefit for uncertain tax positions using the highest cumulative tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized.  Adjustments are made to our liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the period in which we determine the issue is effectively settled with the tax authorities, the statute of limitations expires for the return containing the tax position or when new information becomes available.  Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits, including accrued penalties and interest, is included in other accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets and in income tax expense in our consolidated statements of income (loss).

Discrete events such as audit settlements or changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur.  Valuation allowances are established when management is unable to conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will ultimately be realized.

Generally, Corning will indefinitely reinvest the foreign earnings of: (1) any of its subsidiaries located in jurisdictions where Corning lacks the ability to repatriate its earnings, (2) any of its subsidiaries where Corning’s intention is to reinvest those earnings in operations, (3) legal entities for which Corning holds a non-controlling interest, (4) any subsidiaries with an accumulated deficit in earnings and profits, (5) any subsidiaries which have a positive earnings and profits balance but for which the entity lacks sufficient local statutory earnings or stock basis from which to make a distribution, and (6) future distribution would trigger a significant federal income inclusion to the U.S. shareholder.

A company can make a policy election to account for the tax on GILTI as a period cost or to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities when basis differences exist that are expected to affect the amount of GILTI inclusion upon reversal.  Corning has elected to account for the GILTI provisions as a period cost.

Equity Method Investments

Our equity method investments are reviewed for impairment on a periodic basis or if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying amount may be impaired.  This assessment is based on a review of the equity investments’ performance and a review of indicators of impairment to determine if there is evidence of a loss in value of an equity investment.  Factors we consider include:



Absence of our ability to recover the carrying amount;



Inability of the equity affiliate to sustain an earnings capacity which would justify the carrying amount of the investment; and



Significant litigation, bankruptcy or other events that could impact recoverability.

For an equity investment with impairment indicators, we measure fair value on the basis of discounted cash flows or other appropriate valuation methods, depending on the nature of the company involved.  If it is probable that we will not recover the carrying amount of our investment, the impairment is considered other-than-temporary and recorded in earnings, and the equity investment balance is reduced to its fair value accordingly.  Consequently, adjustments for asset recoverability are included in equity earnings.  We require our material equity method affiliates to provide audited financial statements.  We also utilize these financial statements in our recoverability assessment.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Major categories of financial assets and liabilities, including short-term investments, other assets and derivatives are measured at fair value on a recurring basis.  Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when impaired, which include long-lived assets, goodwill, asset retirement obligations, equity method investments and other investments that we do not have significant influence.

Index

1.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Fair value is the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required to be recorded at fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions, and risk of non-performance.

Derivative Instruments

We participate in a variety of foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign exchange option contracts entered into in connection with the management of our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.  We utilize interest rate swaps to reduce the risk of changes in a benchmark interest rate from the probable forecasted issuance of debt and manage the mix of fixed and floating rate debt.  These financial exposures are managed in accordance with corporate policies and procedures.

All derivatives are recorded at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets.  Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and hedges of net investments in foreign operations are not recognized in current operating results but are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.  Amounts related to cash flow hedges are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income when the underlying hedged item impacts earnings.  This reclassification is recorded in the same line item of our consolidated statements of income (loss) as where the effects of the hedged item are recorded, typically sales, cost of sales or other expense, net.  Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are recorded in the consolidated statements of income (loss) in the translated earnings contract gain (loss), net and the other expense, net lines.

New Accounting Standards

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326).  The ASU introduces a new accounting model, the Current Expected Credit Losses model (CECL), which requires earlier recognition of credit losses and additional disclosures related to credit risk.  The CECL model utilizes a lifetime expected credit loss measurement objective for the recognition of credit losses at the time the financial asset is originated or acquired.  ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual period beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods.  We expect that the impact of adoption will not have a material impact on Corning’s financial statements.  Adoption of the new standard is effective January 1, 2020.

2.

Revenue

Product Revenue (Point in Time)

Most of our revenues are generated by delivery of products to our customers and recognized at a point in time based on our evaluation of when the customer obtains control of the products.  Revenue is recognized when all performance obligations under the terms of a contract with our customer are satisfied, and control of the product has been transferred to the customer.  If customer acceptance clauses are present and it cannot be objectively determined that control has been transferred, revenue is only recorded when customer acceptance is received and all performance obligations have been satisfied.  Sales of goods typically do not include multiple product and/or service elements.

Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services.  Sales tax, value-added tax, and other taxes we collect concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue.  Incidental contract costs that are not material in the context of the delivery of goods and services are recognized as expense.

Revenue (continued)

At the time revenue is recognized, allowances are recorded, with the related reduction to revenue, for estimated product returns, allowances and price discounts based upon historical experience and related terms of customer arrangements.  Where we have offered product warranties, we also establish liabilities for estimated warranty costs based upon historical experience and specific warranty provisions.  Warranty liabilities are adjusted when experience indicates the expected outcome will differ from initial estimates of the liability.  Product warranty liabilities were not material at December 31, 2019 and 2018.

Other Revenue (Over Time)

Corning’s over time revenues are mainly related to Telecommunications products, and are comprised of design, installation, training and software maintenance services.

The performance obligations under these contracts generally require services to be performed over time, resulting in either a straight-line amortization method or an input method using incurred and forecasted expense to predict revenue recognition patterns which follows satisfaction of the performance obligations.  Corning’s other revenue is inconsequential to our results.

Revenue Disaggregation Table

The following table shows revenues by major product categories, similar to our reportable segment disclosure.  Within each product category, contract terms, conditions and economic factors affecting the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty around revenue recognition and cash flows are substantially similar.  The commercial markets and selling channels are also similar.  Except for an inconsequential number of Telecommunications products, our product category revenues are recognized at point in time when control transfers to the customer.  Revenue recognized in the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, is presented based on ASC 606.  Amounts for the year ended December 31, 2017 are presented under the ASC 605 basis of revenue recognition.

Revenue (continued)

Contract Assets and Liabilities

Contract assets, such as incremental costs to obtain or fulfill contracts, are an insignificant component of Corning’s revenue recognition process.  Most of Corning’s cost of fulfillment as a manufacturer of products is classified as inventory, fixed assets and intangible assets, which are accounted for under the respective guidance for those asset types.  Other costs of contract fulfillment are immaterial due to the nature of our products and their respective manufacturing processes.

Contract liabilities include deferred revenues, other advanced payments and customer deposits.  Deferred revenue and other advanced payments are not significant to our operations and are classified as part of other accrued liabilities in our financial statements.  Customer deposits are predominately related to Display products and are classified as part of other accrued liabilities and other liabilities as appropriate, and are disclosed below.

Customer Deposits

As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, Corning had customer deposits of approximately $

1.0

billion.  The majority of these were non-refundable cash deposits for customers to secure rights to an amount of glass produced by Corning under long-term supply agreements.  The duration of these long-term supply agreements ranges up to

10 year

s.  As glass is shipped to customers, Corning will recognize revenue and issue credit memoranda to reduce the amount of the customer deposit liability, which are applied against customer receivables resulting from the sale of glass.  In the year ended December 31, 2019, a credit memorandum of $


million was issued; no such memorandums were issued in 2018.  As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, $


million and $


million were recorded as other long-term liabilities, respectively.  The remaining $


million and $


million, respectively, were classified as other current liabilities.

Practical Expedients and Exemptions

We do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed.

We treat shipping and handling fees as fulfillment costs and not as separate performance obligations under the terms of our revenue contracts due to the perfunctory nature of the shipping and handling obligations.

Significant Customers

For 2019, 2018 and 2017, no customer met or exceeded 10% of Corning’s consolidated net sales.

million and $


million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2019.  Short-term rental expense, for agreements less than one year in duration, was immaterial.  F

inancing lease cost is comprised of expenses for depreciation of right-of-use assets and interest on lease liabilities

, and these expenses were not material for the year ended December 31, 2019.

Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities totaled $

Generally, Corning will indefinitely reinvest the foreign earnings of: (1) any of its subsidiaries located in jurisdictions where Corning lacks the ability to repatriate its earnings, (2) any of its subsidiaries where Corning’s intention is to reinvest those earnings in operations, (3) legal entities for which Corning holds a non-controlling interest, (4) any subsidiaries with an accumulated deficit in earnings and profits, (5) any subsidiaries which have a positive earnings and profits balance but for which the entity lacks sufficient local statutory earnings or stock basis from which to make a distribution, and (6) future distribution would trigger a significant federal income inclusion to the U.S. shareholder.

During 2019, the Company distributed approximately $


million from foreign subsidiaries to their respective U.S. parent companies.  As of December 31, 2019, Corning has approximately $

2.5

billion of indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings.  It remains impracticable to calculate the tax cost of repatriating our unremitted earnings which are considered indefinitely reinvested.

During the year, Corning finalized agreements with various tax authorities, including the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) to resolve its 2013-2014 audit (which was preliminarily agreed to in 2018).  These agreements resulted in Corning reclassifying certain reserves from tax reserve liability to income tax payable and releasing certain tax reserves.  The net impact of these was a $


million reduction to the tabular roll-forward.

Income Taxes (continued)

Included in the balance at December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 are $


million, $


million and $


million, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits that would impact our effective tax rate if recognized.

We recognize accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of tax expense.  For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 the amount recognized in interest expense and accrued for the payment of interest and penalties were not material.

It is possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change due to one or more of the following events during the next twelve months: audit activity, tax payments, or final decisions in matters that are the subject of controversy in various jurisdictions within which we operate.  We believe we have provided adequate contingent reserves for these matters.  However, if upon conclusion of these matters, the ultimate determination of taxes owed is for an amount materially different than our current reserves, our overall tax expense and effective tax rate could be materially impacted in the period of adjustment.  As of December 31, 2019, the company is not expecting any significant movements in the uncertain tax benefits in the next twelve months.

Corning Incorporated, as the common parent company, and all

80%-or-more-owned of its U.S. subsidiaries

join in the filing of consolidated U.S. federal income tax returns.  The statute of limitations is closed for all periods ending through December 31, 2012.  All returns for periods ended through December 31, 2014, have been audited by and settled with the IRS.

Corning Incorporated and its U.S. subsidiaries file income tax returns on a combined, unitary or stand-alone basis in multiple state and local jurisdictions,

which generally have statutes of limitations ranging from 3 to 5 years

.  Various state income tax returns are currently in the process of examination or administrative appeal. We do not expect any material proposed adjustments from any of these audits.

Our foreign subsidiaries file income tax returns in the countries in which they have operations.  Generally,

these countries have statutes of limitations ranging from


to

10 year

s

.  The statute of limitations is closed through the following years in these major jurisdictions:  China (2008), Japan (2012), Taiwan (2013) and South Korea (2013).

CPM is currently appealing certain tax assessments and tax refund claims for tax years 2010 through 2018.  The Company is required to deposit the disputed tax amounts with the South Korean government as a condition of its appeal of any tax assessments.  We believe that it is more likely than not that we will prevail in the appeal process, and as a result we have recorded a non-current receivable of $


million as of December 31, 2019 for the amount on deposit with the South Korean government.  In the fourth quarter of 2019, we received a refund of $


million from the South Korean government related to tax years 2006 to 2009. As of December 31, 2019, we have also recorded a current receivable of $


million for an amount refunded in January 2020 related to the same issue for tax year 2015.

Investments (continued)

As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the undistributed earnings of equity companies included in our retained earnings were not material.

Hemlock Semiconductor Group (“HSG”)

In 2016, Corning realigned its ownership interest in Dow Corning, exchanging its


% interest in the joint venture between Corning and Dow Chemical for a newly formed company that holds a

49.9

% interest in Hemlock Semiconductor LLC and a

40.25

% interest in Hemlock Semiconductor Operations LLC which are recorded as equity method investments of Corning and are affiliated companies of HSG.  HSG manufactures polysilicon products for the semiconductor and solar industries.  HSG’s solar business primarily serves the solar power panel industry.

In prior years, HSG’s solar and semiconductor customers entered into long-term “take or pay” contracts which included up-front cash payments to secure capacity.   During the last few years, and more significantly in 2019, the solar power panel industry experienced significant over-capacity in the market, resulting in declining sales volumes and market prices.  As a result, HSG’s solar business experienced lower market penetration, overall price declines, and settled contracts with customers that had committed volume and fixed pricing above the current market price.  While these settlements positively impacted HSG’s cash flow in 2019, they reduced expectations for future sales in HSG’s solar business.

Due to the adverse change in HSG’s solar business, HSG was required to assess the recoverability of its long-lived assets in the fourth quarter.  Based on this assessment, HSG determined that the carrying values of HSG’s solar asset group significantly exceeded its fair values.  HSG engaged a third-party appraiser to assist in determining the fair value of the assets within in the solar asset group based on the highest and best use of the asset group.  As a result of the fair value determination, HSG recognized a pre-tax asset impairment charge of $


million for the year ended December 31, 2019.  Corning’s share of the pre-tax impairment was $


million.

Due to the adverse changes above, the carrying values of HSG’s solar business inventories were also affected resulting in an inventory write-down of $


million for the year.  Corning’s pre-tax share of the provision was $


million.

HSG adopted the new revenue standard on January 1, 2019 and the timing of HSG’s revenue recognition for certain remaining performance obligations measured at January 1, 2019 was deferred for recognition.  This deferral reduced the carrying amount of Corning’s investment in HSG by $


million.  During the fourth quarter, a significant number of the performance obligations were satisfied and $


million was recognized into HSG’s net income.  Corning’s share of the equity earnings was $


million.

In addition, HSG settled certain revenue contracts in the fourth quarter, resulting in settlement gains of $


million in net income.  Corning’s share of the settlement gains was $


million.

Acquisitions (continued)

Goodwill is related to the value of CMD’s product and customer portfolio and its combination with Corning’s existing optical communications platform, as well as synergies and other intangibles that do not qualify for separate recognition.  Other intangible assets consist primarily of $


million of customer relationships and $


million of other intangibles that are amortized over the weighted average useful life of approximately


and


years, respectively.  Acquisition-related costs of $


million for the year ended December 31, 2018, included costs for legal, accounting, valuation and other professional services and were included in selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of income (loss).  Supplemental pro forma information was not provided because the acquisition was not material to Corning’s consolidated financial statements.

Other Assets and Other Liabilities (continued)

South Korean tax deposits

CPM is currently appealing certain tax assessments and tax refund claims for tax years 2010 through 2018.  The Company is required to deposit the disputed tax amounts with the South Korean government as a condition of its appeal of any tax assessments.  We believe that it is more likely than not that we will prevail in the appeal process, and as a result we recorded a non-current receivable of $


million as of December 31, 2019 for the amount on deposit with the South Korean government.  In the fourth quarter of 2019, we received a refund of $


million from the South Korean government related to tax years 2006 to 2009. As of December 31, 2019, we have also recorded a current receivable of $


million for an amount refunded in January 2020 related to the same issue for tax year 2015.

Employee Retire

ment Plans

Defined Benefit Plans

We have defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic and international employees.  Our funding policy has been to contribute, as necessary, an amount exceeding the minimum requirements in order to achieve the Company’s long-term funding targets.  In 2019, we made

no

voluntary contributions to our domestic defined benefit pension plan and cash contributions of $


million to our international pension plans.  In 2018, we made voluntary cash contributions to our domestic defined benefit pension plan and our international pension plans in the amount of $


million and $


million, respectively.  During 2020, we anticipate making cash contributions of $


million to our U.S. qualified pension plan and $


million to our international pension plans.

Corning offers postretirement plans that provide health care and life insurance benefits for retirees and eligible dependents.  Certain employees may become eligible for such postretirement benefits upon reaching retirement age and service requirements.  For current retirees (including surviving spouses) and active employees eligible for the salaried retiree medical program, we have placed a “cap” on the amount we will contribute toward retiree medical coverage in the future.  The cap is equal to


% of our 2005 contributions toward retiree medical benefits.  Once our contributions toward salaried retiree medical costs reach this cap, impacted retirees will have to pay the excess amount in addition to their regular contributions for coverage.  This cap was attained for post-65 retirees in 2008 and attained for pre-65 retirees in 2010.  Furthermore, employees hired or rehired on or after January 1, 2007 will be eligible for Corning retiree medical benefits upon retirement; however, these employees will pay


% of the cost.

Corning uses a hypothetical yield curve and associated spot rate curve to discount the plan’s projected benefit payments.  Once the present value of projected benefit payments is calculated, the suggested discount rate is equal to the level rate that results in the same present value.  The yield curve is based on actual high-quality corporate bonds across the full maturity spectrum, which also includes private placements as well as Eurobonds that are denominated in U.S. currency.  The curve is developed from yields on hundreds of bonds from four grading sources, Moody’s, S&P, Fitch and the Dominion Bond Rating Service.  A bond will be included if at least half of the grades from these sources are Aa, non-callable bonds.  The very highest


% yields and the lowest


% yields are excluded from the curve to eliminate outliers in the bond population.

Mortality is one of the key assumptions used in valuing liabilities of retirement plans.  It is used to assign a probability of payment for future plan benefits that are contingent upon participants’ survival.  To make this assumption, benefit plan sponsors typically use a base mortality table and an improvement scale that adjusts the rates of mortality for future anticipated changes to historical death rates.

Corning last updated the adjustment factors applied to its base mortality assumption (RP-2014 white collar table and RP-2014 blue collar table for non-union and union participants respectively) to value its U.S. benefit plan obligations as of December 31, 2017.  In addition, Corning also updated to the MP-2017 projection scale at year-end 2017.  As the Society of Actuaries publishes additional mortality improvement scales (i.e. MP-2019) and base mortality tables (i.e. Pri-2012), each year Corning has considered these revised schedules in setting its mortality assumptions.  As of December 31, 2019, Corning decided to continue application of both its future improvement scale to the MP-2017 scale and base mortality assumptions to the RP-2014 tables.

Furthermore, Corning updated for the year ended 2017 the mortality assumption applied to disabled participants to be the RP-2014 disabled mortality base table with future improvements using MP-2017.  These assumptions were unchanged for the year ended 2019.

Measurement of postretirement benefit expense is based on assumptions used to value the postretirement benefit obligation at the beginning of the year.

Plan Assets

The Company’s primary objective is to ensure the plan has sufficient return on assets to fund the plan’s current and future obligations as they become due.  Investments are primarily made in public securities to ensure adequate liquidity to support benefit payments.  Domestic and international stocks provide diversification to the portfolio.  The target allocation range for global equity investment is


%-


% which includes large, mid and small cap companies and investments in both developed and emerging markets.  The target allocation for bond investments is


%, which predominately includes corporate bonds.  Long duration fixed income assets are utilized to mitigate the sensitivity of funding ratios to changes in interest rates.  The target allocation range for non-public investments in private equity and real estate is


%-


%, and is used to enhance returns and offer additional asset diversification.  The target allocation range for commodities is


%-


%, which provides some inflation protection to the portfolio.

Credit Risk


% of domestic plan assets are invested in long duration bonds.  The average rating for these bonds is A-.  These bonds are subject to credit risk, such that a decline in credit ratings for the underlying companies, countries or assets (for asset-backed securities) would result in a decline in the value of the bonds.  These bonds are also subject to default risk.

Currency Risk


% of domestic assets are valued in non-U.S. dollar denominated investments that are subject to currency fluctuations.  The value of these securities will decline if the U.S. dollar increases in value relative to the value of the currencies in which these investments are denominated.

Liquidity Risk


% of the domestic securities are invested in Level 3 securities.  These are long-term investments in private equity and private real estate investments that may not mature or be sellable in the near-term without significant loss.

We are required, at the time a guarantee is issued, to recognize a liability for the fair value or market value of the obligation it assumes.  In the normal course of our business, we do not routinely provide significant third-party guarantees.  Generally, third-party guarantees provided by Corning are limited to certain financial guarantees, including stand-by letters of credit and performance bonds, and the incurrence of contingent liabilities in the form of purchase price adjustments related to attainment of milestones.  These guarantees have various terms, and none of these guarantees are individually significant.  We believe a significant majority of these guarantees and contingent liabilities will expire without being funded.

Product warranty liability accruals at December 31, 2019 and 2018 were insignificant.

The ability of certain subsidiaries and affiliated companies to transfer funds is limited by provisions of foreign government regulations, affiliate agreements and certain loan agreements.  At December 31, 2019, the amount of equity subject to such restrictions for consolidated subsidiaries and affiliated companies was not significant.  While this amount is legally restricted, it does not result in operational difficulties since we have generally permitted subsidiaries to retain a majority of equity to support growth programs.

Corning is a defendant in various lawsuits and is subject to various claims that arise in the normal course of business, the most significant of which are summarized below.  In the opinion of management, the likelihood that the ultimate disposition of these matters will have a material adverse effect on Corning’s consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of operations, is remote.

Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees (continued)

Asbestos Claims

Corning and PPG Industries, Inc. each owned


% of the capital stock of Pittsburgh Corning Corporation (“PCC”).  PCC filed for Chapter 11 reorganization in 2000 and the Modified Third Amended Plan of Reorganization for PCC (the “Plan”) became effective in April 2016.  At December 31, 2016, the Company’s liability under the Plan was $


million, which is required to be paid through a series of fixed payments beginning in the second quarter of 2017.  Payments of $


million and $


million were made in June 2019 and June 2018, respectively.  The total amount of remaining payments due in years 2020 through 2023 is $


million, of which $


million will be paid in the second quarter of 2020 and is classified as a current liability.  The remaining $


million is classified as a non-current liability.

Non-PCC Asbestos Claims

Corning is a defendant in certain cases alleging injuries from asbestos unrelated to PCC (the “non-PCC asbestos claims”) which had been stayed pending the confirmation of the Plan.  The stay was lifted on August 25, 2016.  At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the amount of the reserve for these non-PCC asbestos claims was estimated to be $


million and $


million, respectively.  The change in reserve reflects post-stay claim experience and a reduction in expected defense costs.  The reserve balance as of December 31, 2019 represents the undiscounted projection of claims and related legal fees for the estimated life of the litigation.

Dow Corning Chapter 11 Related Matters

Until June 1, 2016, Corning and The Dow Chemical Company (“Dow”) each owned


% of the common stock of Dow Corning Corporation (“Dow Corning”).  On May 31, 2016, Corning and Dow realigned their ownership interest in Dow Corning.  Following the realignment, Corning no longer owned any interest in Dow Corning.  With the realignment, Corning agreed to indemnify Dow Corning for


% of Dow Corning’s non-ordinary course, pre-closing liabilities to the extent such liabilities exceed the amounts reserved for them by Dow Corning as of May 31, 2016, subject to certain conditions and limits.

Dow Corning Breast Implant Litigation

In May 1995, Dow Corning filed for bankruptcy protection to address pending and claimed liabilities arising from many thousands of breast implant product lawsuits.  On June 1, 2004, Dow Corning emerged from Chapter 11 with a Plan of Reorganization (the “Plan”) which provided for the settlement or other resolution of implant claims.  The Plan also includes releases for Corning and Dow as shareholders in exchange for contributions to the Plan.

Under the terms of the Plan, Dow Corning has established and funded a Settlement Trust and a Litigation Facility, referred to above, to provide a means for tort claimants to settle or litigate their claims.  Inclusive of insurance, Dow Corning has paid approximately $

1.8

billion to the Settlement Trust.  As of May 31, 2016, Dow Corning had recorded a reserve for breast implant litigation of $


million.  In the event Dow Corning’s total liability for these claims exceeds such amount, Corning may be required to indemnify Dow Corning for up to


% of the excess liability, subject to certain conditions and limits.  As of December 31, 2019, Dow Corning had recorded a reserve for breast implant litigation of $


million.  As a result, Corning does not believe its indemnity obligation for Dow Corning’s breast implant litigation liability, if any, will be material.

Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees (continued)

Dow Corning Bankruptcy Pendency Interest Claims

As a separate matter arising from the bankruptcy proceedings, Dow Corning has been defending claims asserted by commercial creditors who claimed additional compounded interest at default and state statutory judgment rates as well as attorneys’ fees and other enforcement costs, during the period from May 1995 through June 2004.  As of May 31, 2016, Dow Corning had recorded a reserve for these claims of $


million.  Dow Corning settled those claims as of September 30, 2019 and received approval of the settlement from the bankruptcy court.  Corning does not believe its indemnity obligation, if any, for Dow Corning’s liability to be material.

Dow Corning Environmental Claims

In September 2019, Dow Corning formally notified Corning of certain environmental matters for which Dow Corning asserts that it has or will experience losses arising from remediation and response at a number of sites.  In the event Dow Corning is liable for these claims, Corning may be required to indemnify Dow Corning for up to


% of that liability, subject to certain conditions and limits.  As of December 31, 2019, the Company cannot estimate the fair value of the indemnification owed to Dow Corning, if any.

Environmental Litigation

Corning has been named by the Environmental Protection Agency (the Agency) under the Superfund Act, or by state governments under similar state laws, as a potentially responsible

party for


active hazardous

waste sites.

Under the Superfund Act, all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site, identified by the Agency, are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the Agency agrees otherwise.  It is Corning’s policy to accrue for its estimated liability related to Superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned by Corning based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants.  At December 31, 2019 and 2018, Corning had accrued approximately $


million (undiscounted) and $


million (undiscounted), respectively, for the estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation.  Based upon the information developed to date, management believes that the accrued reserve is a reasonable estimate of the Company’s liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote.

14.

Hedging Activi

ties

Corning is exposed to interest rate and foreign currency risks due to the movement of these rates.

The areas in which exchange rate fluctuations affect us include:



Financial instruments and transactions denominated in foreign currencies, which impact earnings; and



The translation of net assets in foreign subsidiaries for which the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, which impacts our net equity.

Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the Japanese yen, South Korean won, new Taiwan dollar, Chinese yuan, the euro and British pound.  We seek to mitigate the impact of exchange rate movements in our income statement by using over-the-counter (OTC) derivative instruments including foreign exchange forward and option contracts.  In general, these hedge expirations coincide with the timing of the underlying foreign currency commitments and transactions.

We are exposed to potential losses in the event of non-performance by our counterparties to these derivative contracts.  However, we minimize this risk by maintaining our portfolio with a diverse group of highly-rated major financial institutions.  We do not expect to record any losses as a result of such counterparty default.  Neither we nor our counterparties are required to post collateral for these financial instruments.  The Company qualified for and elected the end-user exception to the mandatory swap clearing requirement of the Dodd-Frank Act.

Hedging Activities (continued)

Cash Flow Hedges

Our cash flow hedging activities utilize OTC foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that movements in exchange rates will adversely affect the net cash flows resulting from the sale of products to customers and purchases from suppliers.  The total gross notional values for foreign currency cash flow hedges are $

2.1

billion and $

0.4

billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  The majority of our foreign exchange forward contracts hedge a portion of the Company’s exposure to the Japanese yen denominated sales with maturities spanning the years 2020-2023 and with gross notional values of $

1.5

billion at December 31, 2019.

Our cash flow hedging activity also uses interest rate derivatives including Treasury rate lock agreements to reduce the risk of increases in benchmark interest rates on the probable issuance of debt.  In the second quarter of 2018, the Company entered into Treasury rate lock agreements to hedge against the variability in cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate related to an anticipated debt issuance.  The instruments were designated as cash flow hedges, and were settled on October 31, 2018 concurrent with the debt issuance.  The settlement amount of $


million received is released from accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings when the corresponding interest expense occurs each period.

Corning uses regression analysis or critical term match method to assess initial hedge effectiveness.  Following the inception of a hedging relationship, hedge effectiveness is assessed quarterly based on qualitative factors.  Corning defers gains and losses related to the cash flow hedges into accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheets until the hedged item impacts earnings.  At December 31, 2019, the amount expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months is a pre-tax net gain of $


million.

Undesignated Hedges

Corning also uses OTC foreign exchange forward and option contracts that are not designated as hedged instruments.  These contracts are used to offset economic currency risks.  The undesignated hedges limit exposures to foreign functional currency fluctuations related to certain subsidiaries’ monetary assets, monetary liabilities and net earnings in foreign currencies.

A significant portion of the Company’s non-U.S. revenues and expenses are denominated in Japanese yen, South Korean won, new Taiwan dollar, Chinese yuan and euro.  When these revenues and expenses are translated back to U.S. dollars, the Company is exposed to foreign exchange rate movements.  To protect translated earnings against movements in these currencies, the Company has entered into a series of average rate forwards and other derivative instruments.

The Company continued its foreign exchange hedge program in 2019 and entered into a series of average rate forwards, and purchased put or call options.  These will hedge a significant portion of its projected yen exposure for the period of 2020-2023.  As of December 31, 2019, the U.S. dollar gross notional value of the yen average rate forwards program is $

7.7

billion and $

2.5

billion for zero-cost collars and purchased put or call options.  The average rate forward program was also expanded to partially hedge the impact of the South Korean won, Chinese yuan, euro, new Taiwan dollar and British pound translation on the Company’s projected net income.  As of December 31, 2019, these average rate forwards have a total notional value of $

2.0

billion.  The entire average rate forward program will settle net without obligation to deliver Japanese yen, South Korean won, Chinese yuan, euro

and British pound

.

With respect to the zero-cost collars, the gross notional amount includes the value of both put and call options.  However, due to the nature of the zero-cost collars, only the put or the call option can be exercised at maturity.

The fair values of these derivative contracts are recorded as either assets (gain position) or liabilities (loss position) on the consolidated balance sheets.  Changes in the fair value of the derivative contracts are recorded currently in earnings in the translated earnings contract gain (loss), net line of the consolidated statements of income (loss).

Fair Value Meas

urements

Fair value standards under U.S. GAAP define fair value, establish a framework for measuring fair value in applying generally accepted accounting principles, and require disclosures about fair value measurements.  The standards also identify two kinds of inputs that are used to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities: observable and unobservable.  Observable inputs are based on market data or independent sources while unobservable inputs are based on the Company’s own market assumptions.  Once inputs have been characterized, the inputs are prioritized into one of three broad levels (provided in the table below) used to measure fair value.  Fair value standards apply whenever an entity is measuring fair value under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurement and require the use of observable market data when available.

The following tables provide fair value measurement information for the Company’s major categories of financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis:

Fair Value Measurements (continued)

For the year ended December 31, 2019, assets and liabilities that were measured using unobservable (Level 3) inputs resulted in unrealized gains recognized in earnings of $


million for a renewable energy derivative contract and the reversal of a liability for contingent consideration of $


million.

At December 31, 2019, HSG, one of the Company’s equity method affiliates, wrote down its long-lived assets to fair value on a nonrecurring basis. HSG engaged a third-party appraiser to assist in determining the fair value of its long-lived assets using unobservable (Level 3) inputs based on the highest and best use of the asset group. As a result, HSG recognized pre-tax asset impairment charges of $


million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Corning’s share of the pre-tax impairment was $


million. Refer to Note 6 (Investments) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

There were

Index

16.

Shareholders’ Equity (continued)

Dividends on the preferred stock are cumulative and accrue at the annual rate of

4.25

% on the per share issue price of $


million.  The dividends are payable quarterly as and when declared by the Company’s Board of Directors.  The preferred stock ranks senior to our common stock with respect to payment of dividends and rights upon liquidation.  The preferred stock is not redeemable except in the case of a certain deemed liquidation event, the occurrence of which is under the control of the Company.  The preferred stock is convertible at the option of the holder and the Company upon certain events, at a conversion rate of

50,000

shares of Corning’s common stock per one share of preferred stock, subject to certain anti-dilution provisions.  As of December 31, 2019, the preferred stock has not been converted, and none of the anti-dilution provisions have been triggered.  Following the seventh anniversary of the closing of the acquisition of Samsung Corning Precision Materials, the preferred stock will be convertible, in whole or in part, at the option of the holder.  The Company has the right, at its option, to cause some or all the shares of preferred stock to be converted into common stock, if, for


trading days (whether or not consecutive) within any period of


consecutive trading days, the closing price of common stock exceeds $


per share.  If the right becomes exercisable before the seventh anniversary of the closing, the Company must first obtain the written approval of the holders of a majority of the preferred stock before exercising its conversion right.  The preferred stock does not have any voting rights except as may be required by law.

Share Repurchases

2017 Share Repurchases

In December 2016, Corning’s Board of Directors approved a $


billion share repurchase program with no expiration (the “2016 Repurchase Program”).  In the second quarter of 2017, Corning entered into and finalized an accelerated share repurchase agreement under which we paid $


million for a total of

17.1

million shares.  In the third quarter of 2017, Corning entered into and finalized an additional accelerated share repurchase agreement under which we paid $


million for a total of

17.2

million shares.  Collectively, these two agreements represent the “2017 ASR agreements”.

In addition to the 2017 ASR agreements, during the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company repurchased

50.1

million shares of common stock on the open market for approximately $

1.4

billion, resulting in a total of

84.4

million shares repurchased for approximately $

2.4

billion during 2017.

2018 Share Repurchases

On April 26, 2018, Corning’s Board of Directors approved a $


billion share repurchase program with no expiration (the “2018 Repurchase Program”).  During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company repurchased

74.8

million shares of common stock on the open market for approximately $

2.2

billion as part of its 2016 and 2018 Repurchase Programs.

Reportable Segm

ents

Our reportable segments are as follows:



Display Technologies – manufactures glass substrates for flat panel liquid crystal displays and other high-performance display panels.



Optical Communications – manufactures carrier network and enterprise network components for the telecommunications industry.



Specialty Materials – manufactures products that provide more than


material formulations for glass, glass ceramics and fluoride crystals to meet demand for unique customer needs.



Environmental Technologies – manufactures ceramic substrates and filters for automotive and diesel applications.



Life Sciences – manufactures glass and plastic labware, equipment, media, serum and reagents enabling workflow solutions for drug discovery and bioproduction.

All other segments that do not meet the quantitative threshold for separate reporting have been grouped as “All Other.”  This group is primarily comprised of the results of the pharmaceutical technologies, auto glass and new product lines and development projects, as well as certain corporate investments.

Reportable Segments (continued)

We prepared the financial results for our reportable segments on a basis consistent with our internal disaggregation of financial information to assist our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) in making internal operating decisions.  The impact of changes in the Japanese yen, South Korean won, Chinese yuan and new Taiwan dollar are excluded from segment sales and segment net income for the Display Technologies and Specialty Materials segments.  The impact of changes in the euro, Chinese yuan and Japanese yen are excluded from segment sales and segment net income for our Environmental Technologies and Life Sciences segments.  In January 2019, we began presenting results of the Environmental Technologies and Life Sciences segments on a constant-currency basis to mitigate the translation impact on these segments’ sales and net income.  We have not recast prior periods as the impact of fluctuations in these currencies were not material as compared to prior periods.  Certain income and expenses are included in the unallocated amounts in the reconciliation of reportable segment net income to consolidated net income.  These include items that are not used by our CODM in evaluating the results of or in allocating resources to our segments and include the following items:  the impact of our translated earnings contracts; acquisition-related costs; discrete tax items and other tax-related adjustments; certain litigation, regulatory and other legal matters; restructuring, impairment and other charges or credits; adjustments relating to acquisitions; and other non-recurring non-operational items.  Although we exclude these amounts from segment results, they are included in reported consolidated results.

We included the earnings of equity affiliates that are closely associated with our reportable segments in the respective segment’s net income (loss).  We have allocated certain common expenses among reportable segments differently than we would for stand-alone financial information.  Segment net income (loss) may not be consistent with measures used by other companies.

Many of Corning’s administrative and staff functions are performed on a centralized basis.  Where practicable, Corning charges these expenses to segments based upon the extent to which each business uses a centralized function.  Other staff functions, such as corporate finance, human resources and legal are allocated to segments, primarily as a percentage of sales.

(4)

Segment assets include inventory, accounts receivable, property, plant and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation, and associated equity companies and cost investments.
