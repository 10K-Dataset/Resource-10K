ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

INTRODUCTION

STERIS plc is a leading provider of infection prevention and other procedural products and services. Our MISSION IS TO HELP OUR CUSTOMERS CREATE A HEALTHIER AND SAFER WORLD by providing innovative healthcare and life science product and service solutions around the globe. We offer our Customers a unique mix of innovative capital equipment products, such as sterilizers and washers, surgical tables, lights and equipment management systems and connectivity solutions such as operating room integration; consumable products including detergents and gastrointestinal endoscopy accessories and other products and services, including equipment installation and maintenance, microbial reduction of medical devices, instrument and scope repair solutions, laboratory services and outsourced instrument reprocessing.

On March 28, 2019, STERIS plc, a public limited company organized under the laws of England and Wales (“STERIS UK”), completed a redomiciliation from the United Kingdom to Ireland (the “Redomiciliation”). The Redomiciliation was achieved through the insertion of a new Irish public limited holding company (“STERIS Ireland”) on top of STERIS UK pursuant to a court-approved scheme of arrangement under English law (the “Scheme”).  Following the Scheme effectiveness, STERIS UK was re-registered as a private limited company with the name STERIS Limited, and STERIS Emerald IE Limited, a company established in Ireland and a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of STERIS Ireland, was interposed as the direct parent company of STERIS UK.

STERIS plc's registered office is located in Dublin, Ireland. STERIS plc has approximately 13,000 employees worldwide. Through our field sales and service and a network of dealers and distributors, we serve Customers in more than 100 countries around the world.

We operate and report in four reportable business segments: Healthcare Products, Healthcare Specialty Services, Life Sciences, and Applied Sterilization Technologies.

We disclose a measure of segment income that is consistent with the way management operates and views the business. The accounting policies for reportable segments are the same as those for the consolidated Company. In fiscal 2019, we ceased the allocation of certain corporate costs to our segments to align with internal management measures. The fiscal 2018 period operating income measures have been recast for comparability.

The bulk of our revenues are derived from healthcare provider, pharmaceutical and medical device Customers. Much of the growth in these industries is driven by the aging of the population throughout the world, as an increasing number of individuals are entering their prime healthcare consumption years, and are dependent upon advancement in healthcare delivery, acceptance of new technologies, government policies, and general economic conditions. The pharmaceutical industry has been impacted by increased regulatory scrutiny of cleaning and validation processes, mandating that manufacturers improve their processes. Within healthcare, there is concern regarding the level of hospital acquired infections around the world; increased demand for medical procedures, including preventive screenings such as endoscopies and colonoscopies; and a desire by our Customers to operate more efficiently, all of which are driving increased demand for many of our products and services. The COVID-19 pandemic is resulting in the deferral of certain elective medical procedures, which is negatively impacting the demand for some of our products and services.

INFORMATION RELATED TO BUSINESS SEGMENTS

Our chief operating decision maker is our President and Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”). The CEO is responsible for performance assessment and resource allocation. The CEO regularly receives discrete financial information about each reportable segment and uses this information to assess performance and allocate resources. The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in

Note 1

to the Consolidated Financial Statements titled, “Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” of this Annual Report.

INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO OUR BUSINESS IN GENERAL

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials.

We purchase raw materials, sub-assemblies, components, and other supplies needed in our operations from numerous suppliers in the United States and internationally. The principal raw materials and supplies used in our operations include stainless and carbon steel, organic and inorganic chemicals, fuel, and plastic components. These raw materials and supplies are generally available from several suppliers and in sufficient quantities that we do not currently expect any significant sourcing problems in fiscal


. We have long-term supply contracts for certain materials for which there are few suppliers, or those that are single-sourced in certain regions of the world, such as EO and cobalt-60, which are necessary to our AST operations. In addition, we have developed a plan to expand our irradiation processing capacity with accelerator-based technologies, which may reduce the potential supply risk.

Intellectual Property.

We protect our technology and products by, among other means, obtaining United States and foreign patents. There can be no assurance, however, that any patent will provide adequate protection for the technology, system, product, service, or process it covers. In addition, the process of obtaining and protecting patents can be long and expensive. We also rely upon trade secrets, technical know-how, and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position.

As of

March 31, 2020

, we held approximately 410 United States patents and approximately 1,640 in other jurisdictions and had approximately 145 United States patent applications and 360 patent applications pending in other jurisdictions. Patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of filing or grant and legal term of patents in various countries where a patent is obtained. The actual protection a patent provides varies from country to country and depends in part upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, and the availability of legal remedies in each country.

Our products are sold around the world under various brand names and trademarks. We consider our brand names and trademarks to be valuable in the marketing of our products. As of

March 31, 2020

, we had a total of approximately 1,430 trademark registrations worldwide.

Quality Assurance.

We manufacture, assemble, and package products in several countries. Each of our production facilities are dedicated to particular processes and products. Our success depends upon Customer confidence in the quality of our production process and the integrity of the data that supports our product safety and effectiveness. We have implemented quality assurance procedures to support the quality and integrity of scientific information and production processes.

Government Regulation.

Our business is subject to various degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which we operate. In the United States, the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (“NRC”), and other governmental authorities regulate the development, manufacture, sale, and distribution of our products and services. Our international operations also are subject to a significant amount of government regulation, including country-specific rules and regulations and U.S. regulations applicable to our international operations. Government regulations include detailed inspection of, and controls over, research and development, clinical investigations, product approvals and manufacturing, marketing and promotion, sampling, distribution, record-keeping, storage, and disposal practices.

Compliance with applicable regulations is a significant expense for us. Past, current or future regulations, their interpretation, or their application could have a material adverse impact on our operations. Also, additional governmental regulation may be passed that could prevent, delay, revoke, or result in the rejection of regulatory clearance of our products. We cannot predict the effect on our operations resulting from current or future governmental regulation or the interpretation or application of these regulations.

If we fail to comply with any applicable regulatory requirements, sanctions could be imposed on us. For more information about the risks we face regarding regulatory requirements, see Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report titled, "Risk Factors". We are subject to extensive regulatory requirements and must receive and maintain regulatory clearance or approval for many products and operations. Failure to receive or maintain, or delays in receiving, clearance or approvals may hurt our revenues, profitability, financial condition, or value.

In the past, we have received warning letters, paid civil penalties, conducted product recalls and field corrections, and been subject to other regulatory sanctions. We believe that we are currently compliant in all material respects with applicable



regulatory requirements. However, there can be no assurance that future or current regulatory, governmental, or private action will not have a material adverse affect on us or on our performance, results, or financial condition.

Environmental Matters.

We are subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in Ireland, the United States and other countries. We have made, and continue to make, significant investments to comply with these laws and regulations. We cannot predict the future capital expenditures or operating costs required to comply with environmental laws and regulations. We believe that we are currently compliant with applicable environmental, health, and safety requirements in all material respects. However, there can be no assurance that future or current regulatory, governmental, or private action will not have a material adverse affect on our performance, results, or financial condition. Please refer to

Note 10

of our consolidated financial statements titled, "Commitments and Contingencies" for further information.

In the future, if a loss contingency related to environmental matters, employee safety, health or conditional asset retirement obligations is significantly greater than the current estimated amount, we would record a liability for the obligation and it may result in a material impact on net income for the annual or interim period during which the liability is recorded. The investigation and remediation of environmental obligations generally occur over an extended period of time, and therefore we do not know if these events would have a material adverse affect on our financial condition, liquidity, or cash flow, nor can there be any assurance that such liabilities would not have a material adverse affect on our performance, results, or financial condition.

Competition.

The markets in which we operate are highly competitive and generally highly regulated. Competition is intense in all of our business segments and includes many large and small competitors. Brand, design, quality, safety, ease of use, serviceability, price, product features, warranty, delivery, service, and technical support are important competitive factors to us. We expect to face continued competition in the future as new infection prevention, sterile processing, contamination control, gastrointestinal and surgical support products and services enter the market. We believe many organizations are working with a variety of technologies and sterilizing agents. Also, a number of companies have developed disposable medical instruments and other devices designed to address the risk of contamination.

We believe that our long-term competitive position depends on our success in discovering, developing, and marketing innovative, cost-effective products and services. We devote significant resources to research and development efforts and we believe STERIS is positioned as a global competitor in the search for technological innovations. In addition to research and development, we invest in quality control, Customer programs, distribution systems, technical services, and other information services.

There can be no assurance that we will develop significant new products or services, or that the new products or services we provide or develop in the future will be more commercially successful than those provided or developed by our competitors. In addition, some of our existing or potential competitors may have greater resources than us. Therefore, a competitor may succeed in developing and commercializing products more rapidly than we do. Competition, as it relates to our business segments and product categories, is discussed in more detail in the section above titled, “Information Related to Business Segments.”

Employees.

As of

March 31, 2020

, we had approximately 13,000 employees throughout the world including certain locations subject to collective bargaining agreements and works council representation. We believe we generally have good relations with our employees.

Methods of Distribution.

Sales and service activities are supported by a staff of regionally based clinical specialists, system planners, corporate account managers, and in-house Customer service and field support departments. We also contract with distributors and dealers in select markets.

Customer training is important to our business. We provide a variety of courses at Customer locations, at our training and education centers, and over the internet. Our training programs help Customers understand the science, technology, and operation of our products and services. Many of our operator training programs are approved by professional certifying organizations and offer continuing education credits to eligible course participants.

Seasonality.

Our financial results have been, from time to time, subject to seasonal patterns. We cannot assure you that these patterns will continue.

Backlog.

We define backlog as the amount of unfilled capital equipment purchase orders at a point in time. At

March 31, 2020

, we had a backlog of

$242.5 million

. Of this amount,

$170.1 million

and

$72.4 million

related to our Healthcare Products and Life Sciences segments, respectively. At

March 31, 2019

, we had backlog orders of

$215.2 million

. Of this amount,

$154.5 million

and

$60.7 million

related to our Healthcare Products and Life Sciences segments, respectively.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL  CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

INTRODUCTION

In Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”), we explain the general financial condition and the results of operations for STERIS and its subsidiaries including:

•

what factors affect our business;

•

what our earnings and costs were;

•

why those earnings and costs were different from the year before;

•

where our earnings came from;

•

how this affects our overall financial condition;

•

what our expenditures for capital projects were; and

•

where cash will come from to fund future debt principal repayments, growth outside of core operations, repurchase ordinary shares, pay cash dividends and fund future working capital needs.

The MD&A also analyzes and explains the annual changes in the specific line items in the Consolidated Statements of Income. As you read the MD&A, it may be helpful to refer to information in Item 1, “Business,” Item 6, “Selected Financial Data,” and our consolidated financial statements, which present the results of our operations for fiscal


,


and 2018 as well as Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and

Note 10

of our consolidated financial statements titled, "Commitments and Contingencies" for a discussion of some of the matters that can adversely affect our business and results of operations. This information, discussion, and disclosure may be important to you in making decisions about your investments in STERIS.

Information on our financial condition and results of our operations for our 2018 fiscal year period can be found in Item 7 titled, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations", of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on May 30, 2019.

FINANCIAL MEASURES

In the following sections of the MD&A, we may, at times, refer to financial measures that are not required to be presented in the consolidated financial statements under U.S. GAAP. We sometimes use the following financial measures in the context of this report: backlog; debt-to-total capital; and days sales outstanding. We define these financial measures as follows:

•

Backlog

– We define backlog as the amount of unfilled capital equipment purchase orders at a point in time. We use this figure as a measure to assist in the projection of short-term financial results and inventory requirements.

•

Debt-to-total capital

– We define debt-to-total capital as total debt divided by the sum of total debt and shareholders’ equity. We use this figure as a financial liquidity measure to gauge our ability to borrow and fund growth.

•

Days sales outstanding (“DSO”)

– We define DSO as the average collection period for accounts receivable. It is calculated as net accounts receivable divided by the trailing four quarters’ revenues, multiplied by 365 days. We use this figure to help gauge the quality of accounts receivable and expected time to collect.

We, at times, may also refer to financial measures which are considered to be “non-GAAP financial measures” under SEC rules. We have presented these financial measures because we believe that meaningful analysis of our financial performance is enhanced by an understanding of certain additional factors underlying that performance. These financial measures should not be considered an alternative to measures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Our calculations of these measures may differ from calculations of similar measures used by other companies and you should be careful when comparing these financial measures to those of other companies. Additional information regarding these financial measures, including reconciliations of each non- GAAP financial measure, is available in the subsection of MD&A titled, "Non-GAAP Financial Measures."



REVENUES– DEFINED

As required by Regulation S-X, we separately present revenues generated as either product revenues or service revenues on our Consolidated Statements of Income for each period presented. When we discuss revenues, we may, at times, refer to revenues summarized differently than the Regulation S-X requirements. The terminology, definitions, and applications of terms that we use to describe revenues may be different from terms used by other companies. We use the following terms to describe revenues:

•

Revenues

– Our revenues are presented net of sales returns and allowances.

•

Product Revenues

– We define product revenues as revenues generated from sales of consumable and capital equipment products.

•

Service Revenues

– We define service revenues as revenues generated from parts and labor associated with the maintenance, repair, and installation of our capital equipment. Service revenues also include hospital sterilization services, instrument and scope repairs, and linen management as well as revenues generated from contract sterilization and laboratory services offered through our Applied Sterilization Technologies segment.

•

Capital Equipment Revenues

– We define capital equipment revenues as revenues generated from sales of capital equipment, which includes steam sterilizers, low temperature liquid chemical sterilant processing systems, including SYSTEM 1 and 1E, washing systems, VHP

®

technology, water stills, and pure steam generators; surgical lights and tables; and integrated OR.

•

Consumable Revenues

– We define consumable revenues as revenues generated from sales of the consumable family of products, which includes SYSTEM 1 and 1E consumables, V-PRO consumables, gastrointestinal endoscopy accessories, sterility assurance products, skin care products, cleaning consumables, barrier product solutions and surgical instruments.

•

Recurring Revenues

– We define recurring revenues as revenues generated from sales of consumable products and service revenues.

GENERAL OVERVIEW AND EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

STERIS plc is a leading provider of infection prevention and other procedural products and services. Our MISSION IS TO HELP OUR CUSTOMERS CREATE A HEALTHIER AND SAFER WORLD by providing innovative healthcare and life science product and service solutions around the globe. We offer our Customers a unique mix of innovative consumable products, such as detergents, gastrointestinal ("GI") endoscopy accessories, barrier product solutions, and other products and services, including: equipment installation and maintenance, microbial reduction of medical devices, instrument and scope repair solutions, laboratory testing services, on-site and off-site reprocessing, and capital equipment products, such as sterilizers and surgical tables, and connectivity solutions such as operating room (“OR”) integration.

On March 28, 2019, STERIS plc, a public limited company organized under the laws of England and Wales (“STERIS UK”), completed a redomiciliation from the United Kingdom to Ireland (the “Redomiciliation”). The Redomiciliation was achieved through the insertion of a new Irish public limited holding company (“STERIS Ireland”) on top of STERIS UK pursuant to a court-approved scheme of arrangement under English law (the “Scheme”).  Following the Scheme effectiveness, STERIS UK was re-registered as a private limited company with the name STERIS Limited, and STERIS Emerald IE Limited, a company established in Ireland and a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of STERIS Ireland, was interposed as the direct parent company of STERIS UK.

We operate and report in four reportable business segments: Healthcare Products, Healthcare Specialty Services, Life Sciences, and Applied Sterilization Technologies. We describe our business segments in

Note 11

to our consolidated financial statements, titled "Business Segment Information."

The bulk of our revenues are derived from the healthcare, medical device and pharmaceutical industries. Much of the growth in these industries is driven by the aging of the population throughout the world, as an increasing number of individuals are entering their prime healthcare consumption years, and is dependent upon advancement in healthcare delivery, acceptance of new technologies, government policies, and general economic conditions. The pharmaceutical industry has been impacted by increased regulatory scrutiny of cleaning and validation processes, mandating that manufacturers improve their processes. Within healthcare, there is increased concern regarding the level of hospital acquired infections around the world; increased demand for medical procedures, including preventive screenings such as endoscopies and colonoscopies; and a desire by our Customers to operate more efficiently, all which are driving increased demand for many of our products and services. The COVID-19 pandemic is resulting in the deferral of certain elective medical procedures, which is negatively impacting the demand for some of our products and services.

We completed several tuck in acquisitions and asset purchases in fiscal 2020 and 2019 that expanded our product and service offerings to our Customers.



During fiscal 2020, we sold the operations of our Healthcare Specialty Services business that were located in China with annual revenues of approximately $5.0 million.

We continue to invest in manufacturing in-sourcing projects and lean process improvements for the purpose of improving quality, cost and delivery of our products to our Customers.

U.S. Tax Reform.

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA”). The TCJA made broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code including, but not limited to, (1) reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate; (2) elimination of the corporate alternative minimum tax ("AMT"); (3) the creation of the base erosion anti-abuse tax ("BEAT"), a new minimum tax; (4) a general elimination of U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from non-U.S. subsidiaries; (5) a new provision designed to tax global intangible low-taxed income ("GILTI"), which allows for the possibility of using foreign tax credits ("FTCs") and a deduction of up to 50 percent to offset the income tax liability (subject to some limitations); (6) a new limitation on deductible interest expense; (7) the repeal of the domestic production activity deduction; (8) limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation; (9) limitations on the use of FTCs to reduce the U.S. income tax liability; and (10) limitations on net operating losses ("NOLs") generated after December 31, 2017, to 80.0 percent of taxable income.

Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan.

During the third quarter of fiscal year 2019, we adopted and announced a targeted restructuring plan (the “Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan”), which included the closure of two manufacturing facilities, one in Brazil and one in England, as well as other actions including, the rationalization of certain products. Fewer than 200 positions were eliminated. The Company has relocated the production of certain impacted products to other existing manufacturing operations during fiscal 2020. These restructuring actions were designed to enhance profitability and improve efficiency. For additional information on restructuring see the subsection titled "Restructuring Expenses", located in the Results of Operations section of this MD&A, or Note 2 of our Consolidated Financial Statements, titled "Restructuring".

Highlights.

Revenues increased

$248.7 million

, or

8.9%

, to

$3,030.9 million

for the year ended

March 31, 2020

, as compared to

$2,782.2 million

for the year ended

March 31, 2019

. This increase reflects organic growth in all business segments, which was partially offset by unfavorable fluctuations in currencies.

Fiscal 2020 operating income increased

30.5%

to

$537.0 million

over fiscal 2019 operating income of

$411.5 million

. The increase is primarily attributable to lower restructuring expenses, increased revenue volumes and higher gross margin attainment in fiscal 2020 over fiscal 2019.

Net cash flows from operations were

$590.6 million

and free cash flow was

$380.2 million

in fiscal 2020 compared to net cash flows from operations of

$539.5 million

and free cash flow of

$355.4 million

in fiscal 2019 (see subsection of MD&A titled, "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" for additional information and related reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures). The increase in free cash flow is primarily due to the improvement in cash from operations.

Our debt-to-total capital ratio was

25.3%

at

March 31, 2020

. During the year, we increased our quarterly dividend for the fourteenth consecutive year to $0.37 per share per quarter.

Outlook.

In fiscal 2021 and beyond, we expect to continue to manage our costs, grow our business with internal product and service development, invest in greater capacity, and augment these value creating methods with potential acquisitions of additional products and services.

However, the COVID-19 pandemic began to impact our business late in fiscal 2020. The coronavirus pandemic and related public health recommendations and mandated precautions to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, including deferral of medical procedures and treatments and shelter-in-place orders or similar measures, is negatively affecting, and is expected to continue to affect some of our operations which would impact our financial position and cash flows in fiscal 2021. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience unpredictable fluctuations in demand for certain of our products and services, including some products and services that are experiencing increased demand.

We cannot predict the ultimate impact that the COVID-19 pandemic and related actions will have on our Customers’ operations, financial position and cash flows and therefore, on the demand for our products and services.

Further, the broader economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic response could cause interest rate variability and generate unanticipated fluctuations in currency rates that impact our revenues and costs outside of the United States, creating variability in our results.

As a result, we are unable to estimate the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows for fiscal 2021 and beyond.



NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

We, at times, refer to financial measures which are considered to be “non-GAAP financial measures” under SEC rules. We, at times, also refer to our results of operations excluding certain transactions or amounts that are non-recurring or are not indicative of future results, in order to provide meaningful comparisons between the periods presented.

These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be, and should not be, considered separately from or as an alternative to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.

These non-GAAP financial measures are presented with the intent of providing greater transparency to supplemental financial information used by management and the Board of Directors in their financial analysis and operational decision-making. These amounts are disclosed so that the reader has the same financial data that management uses with the belief that it will assist investors and other readers in making comparisons to our historical operating results and analyzing the underlying performance of our operations for the periods presented.

We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered along with our GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide the reader with a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent this disclosure. It is important for the reader to note that the non-GAAP financial measure used may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, a similarly titled measure used by other companies.

We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities as presented in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows less purchases of property, plant, equipment, and intangibles plus proceeds from the sale of property, plant, equipment, and intangibles, which are also presented within investing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. We use this as a measure to gauge our ability to pay cash dividends, fund growth outside of core operations, fund future debt principal repayments, and repurchase shares. The following table summarizes the calculation of our free cash flow for the years ended

March 31, 2020

and

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The COVID-19 pandemic began to impact our business late in fiscal 2020 and therefore did not have a material impact on our fiscal 2020 results of operations.

In the following subsections, we discuss our earnings and the factors affecting them. We begin with a general overview of our operating results and then separately discuss earnings for our operating segments.



FISCAL 2020 AS COMPARED TO FISCAL 2019

Revenues.

The following table compares our revenues, in total and by type and geography, for the year ended

March 31, 2020

to the year ended

March 31, 2019

:

Revenues increased

$248.7 million

, or

8.9%

, to

$3,030.9 million

for the year ended

March 31, 2020

, as compared to

$2,782.2 million

for the year ended

March 31, 2019

. This increase reflects organic growth in all business segments and favorable pricing, which was partially offset by unfavorable fluctuations in currencies.

Service revenues for fiscal


increased

$142.0 million

, or

9.6%

over fiscal


, reflecting growth in all business segments. Consumable revenues for fiscal


increased

$66.7 million

, representing an increase of

$7.0 million

, or

12.4%

, over fiscal


revenues of

$56.8 million

, reflecting strong growth in service revenues.

United States revenues for fiscal


were

$2,211.7 million

, representing an increase of

$234.9 million

, or

11.9%

, over fiscal


revenues of

$1,976.8 million

, reflecting double digit growth in service, consumable and capital equipment revenues.

Revenues from other foreign locations for fiscal


were

$755.4 million

, representing an increase of

0.9%

over the fiscal


revenues of

$748.6 million

, reflecting strength in Canada and the Latin America region. The Europe, Middle East and Africa ("EMEA") region slightly declined primarily due to actions taken in conjunction with the 2019 Restructuring Plan.

Gross Profit.

The following table compares our gross profit for the year ended

March 31, 2020

to the year ended

March 31, 2019

:

Our gross profit is affected by the volume, pricing and mix of sales of our products and services, as well as the costs associated with the products and services that are sold. Our gross profit increased

$144.5 million

and gross profit percentage increased 130 basis points to

43.5%

for fiscal


as compared to

42.2%

for fiscal


. The increase in gross margin percentage is primarily due to the favorable impact of pricing (50 basis points), lower current period expenses related to the Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan (20 basis points), our recent divestitures (10 basis points) and mix and other adjustments (50 basis points). Productivity enhancements fully offset material, labor and facility cost increases.



Operating Expenses.

The following table compares our operating expenses for the year ended

March 31, 2020

to the year ended

March 31, 2019

:

NM - Not meaningful

Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses.

Significant components of total selling, general, and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) are compensation and benefit costs, fees for professional services, travel and entertainment, facilities costs, gains or losses from divestitures, and other general and administrative expenses. SG&A increased

7.0%

in fiscal


over fiscal


. Volume sensitive costs like commissions and third party purchasing organization fees increased 15% in fiscal 2020 over fiscal 2019, but continue to be approximately 3% of revenues. Higher compensation costs related to our annual employee bonus and additional operating expenses from our newly acquired businesses also contributed to the fiscal 2020 increase.

Research and Development.

Research and development expenses increased

$2.5 million

during fiscal


, as compared to fiscal


, due primarily to increased spending within the Healthcare Products segment. Research and development expenses are influenced by the number and timing of in-process projects and labor hours and other costs associated with these projects. Our research and development initiatives continue to emphasize new product development, product improvements, and the development of new technological platform innovations. During fiscal


, our investments in research and development continued to be focused on, but were not limited to, enhancing capabilities of sterile processing combination technologies, procedural products and accessories, and devices and support accessories used in gastrointestinal endoscopy procedures.

Restructuring Expenses

.

During the third quarter of fiscal 2019, we adopted and announced a targeted restructuring plan (the "Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan"), which included the closure of two manufacturing facilities, one in Brazil and one in England, as well as other actions including the rationalization of certain products. Fewer than


positions were eliminated. The Company has relocated the production of certain impacted products to other existing manufacturing operations during fiscal 2020. These restructuring actions were designed to enhance profitability and improve efficiency.

We have incurred pre-tax expenses totaling

$43.9 million

related to these restructuring actions, of which

$31.7 million

was recorded as restructuring expenses and

$12.2 million

was recorded in cost of revenues, with a total of

$31.2 million

,

$2.5 million

,

$0.7 million

, and

$7.8 million

related to the Healthcare Products, Healthcare Specialty Services, Life Sciences, and Applied Sterilization Technologies segments, respectively. Corporate related restructuring charges were

$1.7 million

. Additional restructuring expenses related to this plan are not expected to be material to our results of operations.

The following table summarizes our total pre-tax restructuring expenses for fiscal 2020 and 2019:

(1) Recorded in cost of revenues on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Non-Operating Expenses, Net.

Non-operating expense (income), net consists of interest expense on debt, offset by interest earned on cash, cash equivalents, short-term investment balances, and other miscellaneous expense. The following table



compares our non-operating expense (income), net for the year ended

March 31, 2020

to the year ended

March 31, 2019

:

Interest expense decreased

$4.7 million

during fiscal


, as compared to fiscal


, primarily due to lower outstanding debt levels in the fiscal 2020 period as compared to the same prior year period (refer to our

Note 6

to our consolidated financial statements, titled "Debt", for more information). Interest income and miscellaneous expense is not material.

Additional information regarding our outstanding debt is included in

The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2020 was

18.2%

as compared to

17.4%

for fiscal 2019. The fiscal 2020 effective tax rate increased when compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to an increased percentage of profits earned and taxed in jurisdictions with a higher tax rate.

Business Segment Results of Operations.

We operate and report in four reportable business segments: Healthcare Products, Healthcare Specialty Services, Life Sciences, and Applied Sterilization Technologies. Non-allocated operating costs that support the entire Company and items not indicative of operating trends are excluded from segment operating income.

Our Healthcare Products segment offers infection prevention and procedural solutions for healthcare providers worldwide, including consumable products, equipment maintenance and installation services, and capital equipment.

Our Healthcare Specialty Services segment provides a range of specialty services for healthcare providers including hospital sterilization services and instrument and scope repairs.

Our Life Sciences segment offers consumable products, equipment maintenance, specialty services and capital equipment primarily for pharmaceutical manufacturers.

Our Applied Sterilization Technologies ("AST") segment provides contract sterilization and testing services for medical device and pharmaceutical manufacturers.

We disclose a measure of segment income that is consistent with the way management operates and views the business. The accounting policies for reportable segments are the same as those for the consolidated Company.

For more information regarding our segments please refer to

Note 11

to our consolidated financial statements titled “Business Segment Information,” and Item 1, “Business”.

Healthcare Products revenues increased

6.3%

in fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, reflecting growth in consumable, service and capital equipment revenues of 9.5%, 6.1% and 4.2%, respectively.  The increase reflects organic growth, which was partially offset by unfavorable fluctuations in currencies.  At March 31, 2020, the Healthcare Products segment’s backlog amounted to $170.1 million, increasing $15.6 million, or 10.1%, as compared to the backlog of $154.5 million at March 31, 2019.

Healthcare Specialty Services revenues increased

10.5%

in fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019. The increase reflects organic growth, which was partially offset by the divestiture of our Healthcare Specialty Services business in China and unfavorable fluctuations in currencies.

Life Sciences revenues increased

10.1%

in fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019, reflecting growth in consumable, capital equipment and service revenues of 14.9%, 9.8% and 3.7%, respectively.

The increase reflects organic growth and favorable pricing, which were partially offset by unfavorable fluctuations in currencies. Life Sciences backlog at March 31, 2020 amounted to $72.4 million, increasing $11.7 million, or 19.3%, as compared to backlog of $60.7 million at March 31, 2019.

Applied Sterilization Technologies revenues increased

13.0%

in fiscal 2020, as compared to fiscal 2019. The increase reflects organic growth, which was primarily attributable to increased demand from medical device Customers, which was partially offset by unfavorable fluctuations in currencies.



The Healthcare Products segment’s operating income increased

$32.7 million

to

$356.4 million

in fiscal year 2020, as compared to

$323.7 million

in fiscal year 2019. The segment's operating margins were 25.0% for fiscal year 2020 and 24.2% for fiscal year 2019. The increases in the fiscal 2020 period were primarily due to increased volumes and favorable product mix.

The Healthcare Specialty Services segment’s operating income was flat at

$64.2 million

in fiscal years 2020 and 2019. The segment’s operating margins were 11.4% for fiscal year 2020 and 12.6% for fiscal year 2019. The fiscal 2020 operating margin benefited from increased volumes, which were more than offset by investments being made to add capacity in anticipation of continuing demand.

The Life Sciences business segment’s operating income increased

$12.0 million

to

$144.1 million

in fiscal year 2020, as compared to

$132.1 million

in fiscal year 2019,  primarily due to increased volumes. The segment’s operating margins were 34.6% for fiscal year 2020 and 34.9% for fiscal year 2019. The decline in the fiscal 2020 operating margin was primarily due to unfavorable product mix.

The Applied Sterilization Technologies segment’s operating income increased

$49.1 million

to

$270.9 million

in fiscal year 2020, as compared to

$221.8 million

in fiscal year 2019. The Applied Sterilization Technologies segment's operating margins were 43.2% for fiscal year 2020 and 40.0% for fiscal year 2019. The increases in the fiscal 2020 period were primarily due to increased volumes.

Effective April 1, 2020, and consistent with the way management will operate and view the business, the current Healthcare Products and Healthcare Specialty Services segments will be combined and reported as one segment, simply called Healthcare. Going forward we will operate and report in three business segments: Healthcare, Life Sciences and Applied Sterilization Technologies. Corporate will continue to be presented separately and contain the costs that are associated with being a publicly traded company and certain other corporate costs.

Cash Requirements.

We intend to use our existing cash and cash equivalent balances and cash generated from operations to fund capital expenditures and meet our other liquidity needs. Our capital requirements depend on many uncertain factors, including our rate of sales growth, our Customers’ acceptance of our products and services, the costs of obtaining adequate manufacturing capacities, the timing and extent of our research and development projects, changes in our operating expenses and other factors. To the extent that existing and anticipated sources of cash are not sufficient to fund our future activities, we may need to raise additional funds through additional borrowings or the sale of equity securities.

•

On March 23, 2018, STERIS UK and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with various financial institutions as lenders, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent. STERIS Ireland subsequently became a borrower and guarantor under the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement replaced a bank credit facility dated March 31, 2015. The Credit Agreement provides up to

$1.0 billion

of credit, in the form of a revolver facility, which may be utilized for revolving credit borrowings, swing line borrowings and letters of credit, with sublimits for swing line borrowings and letters of credit. The revolver facility may be increased in specified circumstances by up to

$500.0 million

. The Credit Agreement will mature on March 23, 2023, and all unpaid borrowings, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon, are repayable on that date. The Credit Agreement contains leverage and interest coverage covenants. Borrowings may be taken in U.S. dollars, euros, and pounds sterling and certain other specified currencies and bear interest at our option based upon either the Base Rate or the Eurocurrency Rate, plus the Applicable Margin in effect from time to time under the Credit Agreement. The Applicable Margin is determined based on the ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA (as such terms are defined in the Credit Agreement). Interest on Base Rate Advances is payable quarterly in arrears and interest on Eurocurrency Rate Advances is payable at the end of the relevant interest period therefor, but in no event less frequently than every three months. Borrowings at closing were used to repay outstanding balances of debt outstanding under the former bank credit facility dated March 31, 2015 that was scheduled to mature on March 31, 2020 and for other general corporate purposes.

•

The Credit Agreement was amended in March 2019, in connection with the Redomiciliation to permit the Redomiciliation. The amendments did not effect any material changes in the terms of the Credit Agreement regarding borrowings or the issuance of letters of credit.

Our outstanding Senior Notes at March 31, 2020 were as follows:



•

On February 27, 2017, STERIS UK issued and sold an aggregate principal amount of

$95.0 million

,

€99.0 million

, and

£75.0 million

, of senior notes in a private placement to certain institutional investors in an offering that was exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933.  These notes have maturities of between


and 15 years from the issue date. The agreement governing these notes contains leverage and interest coverage covenants.

•

On May 15, 2015, STERIS Corporation issued and sold

$350.0 million

of senior notes, in a private placement to certain institutional investors in an offering that was exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933. These notes have maturities of


to


years from the issue date. The agreement governing these notes contains leverage and interest coverage covenants.

•

The agreements governing certain senior notes issued and sold in February 2013, December 2012, and August 2008, were amended and restated in their entirety on March 31, 2015. All of these notes were issued and sold in private placements to certain institutional investors in offerings that were exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933. The amended and restated agreements, which have been consolidated into a single agreement for the 2013 and 2012 notes, and a separate single agreement for the 2008 notes, contain leverage and interest coverage covenants.

•

All of the note agreements were amended in March 2019, in connection with the Redomiciliation. The amendments waived certain repurchase rights of the note holders and increased the size of certain baskets to more closely align with Credit Agreement baskets.

As of

March 31, 2020

, a total of

$275.4 million

was outstanding under the Credit Agreement, based on currency exchange rates as of

March 31, 2020

.  At

March 31, 2020

, we had

$717.8 million

of unused funding available under the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement includes a sub-limit that reduces the maximum amount available to us by letters of credit outstanding. At

March 31, 2020

, there was

$6.8 million

in letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Agreement.

At

March 31, 2020

, we were in compliance with all financial covenants associated with our indebtedness. We provide additional information regarding our debt structure and payment obligations in the section of the MD&A titled, “Liquidity and Capital Resources” in the subsection titled, “Contractual and Commercial Commitments” and in

Note 6

to our consolidated financial statements titled, “Debt.”

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES

Our capital expenditure program is a component of our long-term strategy. This program includes, among other things, investments in new and existing facilities, business expansion projects, radioisotope (cobalt-60), and information technology enhancements and research and development advances. During fiscal


, our capital expenditures amounted to

$214.5 million

. We use cash provided by operating activities and our cash and cash equivalent balances to fund capital expenditures. In fiscal


, we expect to continue to invest in facility expansions, particularly within the Applied Sterilization Technologies segment and in ongoing maintenance for existing facilities. The outbreak of COVID-19 has become a global pandemic. We may choose to temporarily defer planned capital expenditures due to fluctuations in demand for our products and services resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and our Customers' needs.

CONTRACTUAL AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS

At

March 31, 2020

, we had commitments under non-cancelable operating leases totaling

$173.9 million

.



Our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of

March 31, 2020

are presented in the following tables. Commercial commitments include standby letters of credit, letters of credit required as security under our self-insured risk retention policies, and other potential cash outflows resulting from events that require us to fulfill commitments.

The table above includes only the principal amounts of our contractual obligations. We provide information about the interest component of our long-term debt in the subsection of MD&A titled, “Liquidity and Capital Resources,” and in

Note 6

to our consolidated financial statements titled, “Debt.”

Purchase obligations shown in the table above relate to minimum purchase commitments with suppliers for materials purchases and long term construction contracts.

The table above excludes contributions we make to our defined contribution plans. Our future contributions to the defined contribution plans depend on uncertain factors, such as the amount and timing of employee contributions and discretionary employer contributions. We provide additional information about our defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plan, and other post-retirement benefits plan in

Note 9

to our consolidated financial statements titled, “Benefit Plans."

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ESTIMATES, AND ASSUMPTIONS

The following subsections describe our most critical accounting policies, estimates, and assumptions. Our accounting policies are more fully described in

Note 1

to our consolidated financial statements titled, “Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.”

Estimates and Assumptions.

Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements that were prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. We make certain estimates and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable when preparing these financial statements. These estimates and assumptions involve judgments with respect to numerous factors that are difficult to predict and are beyond management’s control. As a result, actual amounts could be materially different from these estimates. We periodically review these critical accounting policies, estimates, assumptions, and the related disclosures with the Audit Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors.



Revenue Recognition.

Revenue is recognized when obligations under the terms of the contract are satisfied and control of the promised products or services has transferred to the Customer. Revenues are measured at the amount of consideration that we expect to be paid in exchange for the products or services.  Product revenue is recognized when control passes to the Customer, which is generally based on contract or shipping terms.  Service revenue is recognized when the Customer benefits from the service, which occurs either upon completion of the service or as it is provided to the Customer. Our Customers include end users as well as dealers and distributors who market and sell our products. Our revenue is not contingent upon resale by the dealer or distributor, and we have no further obligations related to bringing about resale.  Our standard return and restocking fee policies are applied to sales of products.  Shipping and handling costs charged to Customers are included in Product revenues.   The associated expenses are treated as fulfillment costs and are included in Cost of revenues. Revenues are reported net of sales and value-added taxes collected from Customers.

We have individual Customer contracts that offer discounted pricing. Dealers and distributors may be offered sales incentives in the form of rebates. We reduce revenue for discounts and estimated returns, rebates, and other similar allowances in the same period the related revenues are recorded.  The reduction in revenue for these items is estimated based on historical experience and trend analysis to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur.  Estimated returns are recorded gross on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

In transactions that contain multiple performance obligations, such as when products, maintenance services, and other services are combined, we recognize revenue as each product is delivered or service is provided to the Customer. We allocate the total arrangement consideration to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price, which is the price for the product or service when it is sold separately.

Payment terms vary by the type and location of the Customer and the products or services offered.  Generally, the time between when revenue is recognized and when payment is due is not significant.  We do not evaluate whether the selling price contains a financing component for contracts that have a duration of less than one year.

We do not capitalize sales commissions as substantially all of our sales commission programs have an amortization period of one year or less.

Certain costs to fulfill a contract are capitalized and amortized over the term of the contract if they are recoverable, directly related to a contract and generate resources that we will use to fulfill the contract in the future. At

March 31, 2020

assets related to costs to fulfill a contract were not material to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Receivable.

We maintain an allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable for estimated losses in the collection of amounts owed by Customers. We estimate the allowance based on analyzing a number of factors, including amounts written off historically, Customer payment practices, and general economic conditions. We also analyze significant Customer accounts on a regular basis and record a specific allowance when we become aware of a specific Customer’s inability to pay. As a result, the related accounts receivable are reduced to an amount that we reasonably believe is collectible. These analyses require judgment. If the financial condition of our Customers worsens, or economic conditions change, we may be required to make changes to our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable.

Allowance for Sales Returns.

We maintain an allowance for sales returns based upon known returns and estimated returns for both capital equipment and consumables. We estimate returns of capital equipment and consumables based upon historical experience.

Inventories and Reserves.

Inventories are stated at the lower of their cost or market value. We determine cost based upon a combination of the last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) and first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) cost methods. We determine the LIFO inventory value at the end of the year based on inventory levels and costs at that time. For inventories valued using the LIFO method, we believe that the use of the LIFO method results in a matching of current costs and revenues. Inventories valued using the LIFO method represented approximately

25.3%

and

25.2%

of total inventories at

March 31, 2020

and


, respectively. Inventory costs include material, labor, and overhead. If we had used only the FIFO method of inventory costing, inventories would have been

$16.9 million

and

$16.8 million

higher than those reported at

March 31, 2020

and


, respectively.

We review inventory on an ongoing basis, considering factors such as deterioration and obsolescence. We record an allowance for estimated losses when the facts and circumstances indicate that particular inventories will not be usable. If future market conditions vary from those projected, and our estimates prove to be inaccurate, we may be required to write-down inventory values and record an adjustment to cost of revenues.

Asset Impairment Losses.

Property, plant, equipment, and identifiable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. Impaired assets are recorded at the lower of carrying value or estimated fair value. We conduct this review on an ongoing basis and, if impairment exists, we record the loss in the Consolidated Statements of Income during that period.



When we evaluate assets for impairment, we make certain judgments and estimates, including interpreting current economic indicators and market valuations, evaluating our strategic plans with regards to operations, historical and anticipated performance of operations, and other factors. If we incorrectly anticipate these factors, or unexpected events occur, our operating results could be materially affected.

Asset Retirement Obligations.

We incur retirement obligations for certain assets. We record an initial liability for the asset retirement obligations (ARO) at fair value. Accounting for the ARO at inception and in subsequent periods includes the determination of the present value of a liability and offsetting asset, the subsequent accretion of that liability and depletion of the asset, and a periodic review of the ARO liability estimates and discount rates used in the analysis. We provide additional information about our asset retirement obligations in

Note 5

to our consolidated financial statements titled, “Property, Plant and Equipment.”

Restructuring.

We record specific accruals in connection with plans for restructuring elements of our business. These accruals include estimates principally related to employee separation costs, the closure and/or consolidation of facilities, and contractual obligations. Actual amounts could differ from the original estimates. We review our restructuring-related accruals on a quarterly basis and changes to plans are appropriately recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income in the period the change is identified.

Purchase Accounting and Goodwill.

Assets and liabilities of the business acquired are accounted for at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. Any excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. We supplement management expertise with valuation specialists in performing appraisals to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. These valuations require us to make estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. We generally amortize our intangible assets over their useful lives with the exception of indefinite lived intangible assets. We do not amortize goodwill, but we evaluate it annually for impairment. Therefore, the allocation of the purchase price to intangible assets and goodwill has a significant impact on future operating results.

We evaluate the recoverability of recorded goodwill amounts annually, or when evidence of potential impairment exists. We may consider qualitative indicators of the fair value of a reporting unit when it is unlikely that a reporting unit has impaired goodwill. We may also utilize a discounted cash flow analysis that requires certain assumptions and estimates be made regarding market conditions and our future profitability. In those circumstances, we test goodwill for impairment by reviewing the book value compared to the fair value at the reporting unit level. We calculate the fair value of our reporting units based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Management's judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value. Assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital, are consistent with internal projections and operating plans. We believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants.

As a result of our annual impairment review for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for fiscal year 2020 no indicators of impairment were identified.

We evaluate indefinite lived intangible assets annually, or when evidence of potential impairment exists. We evaluate several qualitative indicators and assumptions, and trends that influence the valuation of the assets to determine if any evidence of potential impairment exists. During the third quarter of fiscal 2019, management adopted a branding strategy that included phasing out the usage of a tradename associated with certain products in the Healthcare Products business segment. As a result, management recorded an impairment charge of

$16.2 million

, which is included within the Selling, general, and administrative line of the Consolidated Statements of Income. The remaining fair value of the asset was calculated using an income approach (the relief from royalty method). The remaining fair value was not material and was amortized over the asset's remaining useful life. Fair value calculated using this approach is classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy and requires several assumptions.

Income Taxes.

Our provision for income taxes is based on our current period income, changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities, income tax rates, changes in uncertain tax benefits, and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the respective governmental taxing authorities. We use judgment in determining our annual effective income tax rate and evaluating our tax positions. We prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations, and we record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations. We cannot be sure that the tax authorities will agree with all of the tax positions taken by us. The actual income tax liability for each jurisdiction in any year can, in some instances, ultimately be determined be several years after the tax return is filed and the financial statements are published.



We evaluate our tax positions using the recognition threshold and measurement attribute in accordance with current accounting guidance. We determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. In evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority and that the taxing authority will have full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The appropriate unit of account for determining what constitutes an individual tax position, and whether the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is met for a tax position, is a matter of judgment based on the individual facts and circumstances of that position evaluated in light of all available evidence. We review and adjust our tax estimates periodically because of ongoing examinations by and settlements with the various taxing authorities, as well as changes in tax laws, regulations and precedent.

We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences, and the implementation of tax planning strategies. If we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions, or if there is a material change in the effective income tax rates or time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible, we could be required to increase our valuation allowance, which would increase our effective income tax rate and could result in an adverse impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

We believe that adequate accruals have been made for income taxes. Differences between the estimated and actual amounts determined upon ultimate resolution, individually or in the aggregate, are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations or cash flows for any one period.

Additional information regarding income taxes is included in

Note 8

to our consolidated financial statements titled, “Income Taxes.”

Self-Insurance Liabilities.

We record a liability for self-insured risks that we retain for general and product liabilities, workers’ compensation, and automobile liabilities based on actuarial calculations. We use our historical loss experience and actuarial methods to calculate the estimated liability. This liability includes estimated amounts for both losses and incurred but not reported claims. We review the assumptions used to calculate the estimated liability at least annually to evaluate the adequacy of the amount recorded. We maintain insurance policies to cover losses greater than our estimated liability, which are subject to the terms and conditions of those policies. The obligation covered by insurance contracts will remain on the balance sheet as we remain liable to the extent insurance carriers do not meet their obligation. Estimated amounts receivable under the contracts are included in the "Prepaid expenses and other current assets" line, and the "Other assets" line of our consolidated balance sheets. Our accrual for self-insured risk retention as of

March 31, 2020

and


was

$23.2 million

and

$19.7 million

, respectively.

We are also self-insured for employee medical claims. We estimate a liability for incurred but not reported claims based upon recent claims experience. Our self-insured liabilities contain uncertainties because management must make assumptions and apply judgments to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date. If actual results are not consistent with these assumptions and judgments, we could be exposed to additional costs in subsequent periods.

Contingencies.

We are, and will likely continue to be, involved in a number of legal proceedings, government investigations, and claims, which we believe generally arise in the course of our business, given our size, history, complexity, and the nature of our business, products, Customers, regulatory environment, and industries in which we participate. These legal proceedings, investigations and claims generally involve a variety of legal theories and allegations, including, without limitation, personal injury (e.g., slip and falls, burns, vehicle accidents), product liability or regulation (e.g., based on product operation or claimed malfunction, failure to warn, failure to meet specification, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements), product exposure (e.g., claimed exposure to chemicals, asbestos, contaminants, radiation), property damage (e.g., claimed damage due to leaking equipment, fire, vehicles, chemicals), commercial claims (e.g., breach of contract, economic loss, warranty, misrepresentation), financial (e.g., taxes, reporting), employment (e.g., wrongful termination, discrimination, benefits matters), and other claims for damage and relief.

We record a liability for such contingencies to the extent we conclude that their occurrence is both probable and estimable. We consider many factors in making these assessments, including the professional judgment of experienced members of management and our legal counsel. We have made estimates as to the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and the amounts of such potential losses. In our opinion, the ultimate outcome of these proceedings and claims is not anticipated to have a material adverse affect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. However, the ultimate outcome of



proceedings, government investigations, and claims is unpredictable and actual results could be materially different from our estimates. We record expected recoveries under applicable insurance contracts when we are assured of recovery. Refer to

Note 10

of our consolidated financial statements titled, "Commitments and Contingencies" for additional information.

We are subject to taxation from federal, state and local, and foreign jurisdictions. Tax positions are settled primarily through the completion of audits within each individual tax jurisdiction or the closing of a statute of limitation. Changes in applicable tax law or other events may also require us to revise past estimates. The IRS of the United States routinely conducts audits of our federal income tax returns.

Additional information regarding our commitments and contingencies is included in

Note 10

to our consolidated financial statements titled, “Commitments and Contingencies.”

Benefit Plans.

We provide defined benefit pension plans for certain employees and retirees. In addition, we sponsor an unfunded post-retirement benefits plan for two groups of United States retirees. Benefits under this plan include retiree life insurance and retiree medical insurance, including prescription drug coverage.

Employee pension and post-retirement benefits plans are a cost of conducting business and represent obligations that will be settled in the future and therefore, require us to use estimates and make certain assumptions to calculate the expense and liabilities related to the plans. Changes to these estimates and assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts. Future actual experience may be significantly different from our current expectations. We believe that the most critical assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit costs and projected benefit obligations are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate. A summary of significant assumptions used to determine the

March 31, 2020

projected benefit obligations and the fiscal


net periodic benefit costs is as follows:

NA – Not applicable.

We develop our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumptions by evaluating input from third-party professional advisors, taking into consideration the asset allocation of the portfolios, and the long-term asset class return expectations. Generally, net periodic benefit costs increase as the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption decreases. Holding all other assumptions constant, lowering the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption for our funded defined benefit pension plans by 50 basis points would have increased the fiscal


benefit costs by less than $0.1 million.

We develop our discount rate assumptions by evaluating input from third-party professional advisers, taking into consideration the current yield on country specific investment grade long-term bonds which provide for similar cash flow streams as our projected benefit obligations. Generally, the projected benefit obligations and the net periodic benefit costs both increase as the discount rate assumption decreases. Holding all other assumptions constant, lowering the discount rate assumption for our defined benefit pension plans and for the other post-retirement benefits plan by 50 basis points would have decreased the fiscal


net periodic benefit costs by less than $0.1 million and would have increased the projected benefit obligations by approximately $10.5 million at

March 31, 2020

.



We have made assumptions regarding healthcare costs in computing our other post-retirement benefit obligation. The assumed rates of increase generally decline ratably over a five year-period from the assumed current year healthcare cost trend rate of

6.8%

to the assumed long-term healthcare cost trend rate. A 100 basis point change in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate (including medical, prescription drug, and long-term rates) would have had the following effect at

March 31, 2020

:

We recognize an asset for the overfunded status or a liability for the underfunded status of defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit plans in our balance sheets. This amount is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation (the projected benefit obligation for pension plans and the accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation for other post-retirement benefit plans). Changes in the funded status of the plans are recorded in other comprehensive income in the year they occur. We measure plan assets and obligations as of the balance sheet date.

Note 9

to our consolidated financial statements titled, “Benefit Plans,” contains additional information about our pension and other post-retirement welfare benefits plans.

Share-Based Compensation.

We measure the estimated fair value for share-based compensation awards, including grants of employee stock options, at the grant date and recognize the related compensation expense over the period in which the share-based compensation vests. We selected the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model as the most appropriate method for determining the estimated fair value of our share-based stock option compensation awards. This model involves assumptions that are judgmental and affect share-based compensation expense.

Share-based compensation expense was

$23.8 million

in fiscal


,

$24.0 million

in fiscal


and

$22.2 million

in fiscal


.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS IMPACTING THE COMPANY

Recently issued accounting standards that are relevant to us are presented in

Note 1

to our consolidated financial statements titled, “Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.”

INFLATION

Our business has not been significantly impacted by the overall effects of inflation. We monitor the prices we charge for our products and services on an ongoing basis and plan to adjust those prices to take into account future changes in the rate of inflation. However, we may not be able to completely offset the impact of inflation.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

In the ordinary course of business, we are exposed to various risks, including, but not limited to, interest rate, foreign currency, and commodity risks. These risks are described in the sections that follow.

INTEREST RATE RISK

As of

March 31, 2020

, we had

$878.4 million

in fixed rate senior notes outstanding. As of

March 31, 2020

, we had

$275.4 million

in outstanding borrowings under our Credit Agreement which are exposed to changes in interest rates. We monitor our interest rate risk, but do not engage in any hedging activities using derivative financial instruments. For additional information regarding our debt structure, refer to

Note 6

to our Consolidated Financial Statements titled, “Debt.”

FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK

We are exposed to the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations. This foreign currency exchange risk arises when we conduct business in a currency other than the U.S. dollar. For most operations, local currencies have been determined to be the functional currencies. The financial statements of subsidiaries are translated to their U.S. dollar equivalents at end-of-period exchange rates for assets and liabilities and at average currency exchange rates for revenues and expenses. Translation adjustments for subsidiaries whose local currency is their functional currency are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within equity.

Note 19

to our consolidated financial statements titled, “

Reclassifications out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)

,” contains additional information about the impact of translation on accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and equity. Transaction gains and losses arising from fluctuations in currency exchange rates on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Since we operate internationally and approximately 30% of our revenues and 40% of our cost of revenues are generated outside the United States, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations can significantly impact our financial position, results of operations, and competitive position.

We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, including inter-company transactions. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. At

March 31, 2020

, we held a foreign currency forward contract to buy

6.0 million

Canadian dollars.

COMMODITY RISK

We are dependent on basic raw materials, sub-assemblies, components, and other supplies used in our operations. Our financial results could be affected by the availability and changes in prices of these materials. Some of these materials are sourced from a limited number of suppliers or only a single supplier. These materials are also key source materials for our competitors. Therefore, if demand for these materials rises, we may experience increased costs and/or limited or unavailable supplies. As a result, we may not be able to acquire key production materials on a timely basis, which could impact our ability to produce products and satisfy incoming sales orders on a timely basis. In addition, the costs of these materials can rise suddenly and result in significantly higher costs of production. We believe that we have adequate sources of supply for many of our key materials and energy sources. Where appropriate, we enter into long-term supply contracts as a basis to guarantee a reliable supply. We may also enter into commodity swap contracts to hedge price changes in a certain commodity that impacts raw materials included in our cost of revenues. At

March 31, 2020

, we held commodity swap contracts to buy

715,200

pounds of nickel.



ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

1. NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Nature of Operations.

On March 28, 2019, STERIS plc, a public limited company organized under the laws of England and Wales (“STERIS UK”), completed a redomiciliation from the United Kingdom to Ireland (the “Redomiciliation”). The Redomiciliation was achieved through the insertion of a new Irish public limited holding company (“STERIS Ireland”) on top of STERIS UK pursuant to a court-approved scheme of arrangement under English law (the “Scheme”).  Following the Scheme effectiveness, STERIS UK was re-registered as a private limited company with the name STERIS Limited, and STERIS Emerald IE Limited, a company established in Ireland and a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of STERIS Ireland, was interposed as the direct parent company of STERIS UK.

STERIS plc is a leading provider of infection prevention and other procedural products and services. We offer our Customers a unique mix of innovative consumable products, such as detergents, gastrointestinal ("GI") endoscopy accessories, barrier product solutions, and other products and services, including: equipment installation and maintenance, microbial reduction of medical devices, instrument and scope repair solutions, laboratory testing services, on-site and off-site reprocessing, and capital equipment products, such as sterilizers and surgical tables, and connectivity solutions such as operating room (“OR”) integration.

We operate and report in four reportable business segments: Healthcare Products, Healthcare Specialty Services, Life Sciences, and Applied Sterilization Technologies. We describe our business segments in

Note 11

to our consolidated financial statements titled, "Business Segment Information."

Our fiscal year ends on March 31. References in this Annual Report to a particular "year," "fiscal," "fiscal year," or "year-end" mean our fiscal year. The significant accounting policies applied in preparing the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company are summarized below.

Principles of Consolidation.

We use the consolidation method to report our investment in our subsidiaries. Therefore, the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. We eliminate inter-company accounts and transactions when we consolidate these accounts. Investments in equity of unconsolidated affiliates, over which the Company has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating polices, are accounted for primarily using the equity method. These investments are immaterial to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.

Use of Estimates.

We make certain estimates and assumptions when preparing financial statements according to U.S. GAAP that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the financial statement dates and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. These estimates and assumptions involve judgments with respect to many factors that are difficult to predict and are beyond our control. Actual results could be materially different from these estimates. We revise the estimates and assumptions as new information becomes available.

Cash Equivalents and Supplemental Cash Flow Information.

Cash equivalents are all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased. We invest our excess cash in short-term instruments including money market funds and time deposits with major banks and financial institutions. We select investments in accordance with the criteria established in our investment policy. Our investment policy specifies, among other things, maturity, credit quality and concentration restrictions with the objective of preserving capital and maintaining adequate liquidity.


STERIS PLC AND SUBSIDIARIES

(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts and as noted)

Information supplementing our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows is as follows:

Revenue Recognition and Associated Liabilities.

We adopted Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2014-09 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” and the subsequently issued amendments on April 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective approach to contracts that were not completed as of April 1, 2018. Under this standard, certain capital equipment contracts are comprised of a single performance obligation, resulting in the deferral of the corresponding capital equipment revenue and cost of revenues until installation is complete.  Previously, these capital equipment revenues and cost of revenues were recognized based upon shipping terms. We recorded a cumulative effect adjustment in the beginning of fiscal 2019 to Retained earnings of

$

5,637

, based on the terms and conditions for certain open capital equipment contracts as of March 31, 2018.

Revenue is recognized when obligations under the terms of the contract are satisfied and control of the promised products or services have transferred to the Customer. Revenues are measured at the amount of consideration that we expect to be paid in exchange for the products or services.  Product revenue is recognized when control passes to the Customer, which is generally based on contract or shipping terms.  Service revenue is recognized when the Customer benefits from the service, which occurs either upon completion of the service or as it is provided to the Customer. Our Customers include end users as well as dealers and distributors who market and sell our products. Our revenue is not contingent upon resale by the dealer or distributor, and we have no further obligations related to bringing about resale.  Our standard return and restocking fee policies are applied to sales of products.  Shipping and handling costs charged to Customers are included in Product revenues.   The associated expenses are treated as fulfillment costs and are included in Cost of revenues. Revenues are reported net of sales and value-added taxes collected from Customers.

We have individual Customer contracts that offer discounted pricing. Dealers and distributors may be offered sales incentives in the form of rebates. We reduce revenue for discounts and estimated returns, rebates, and other similar allowances in the same period the related revenues are recorded.  The reduction in revenue for these items is estimated based on historical experience and trend analysis to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur.  Estimated returns are recorded gross on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

In transactions that contain multiple performance obligations, such as when products, maintenance services, and other services are combined, we recognize revenue as each product is delivered or service is provided to the Customer. We allocate the total arrangement consideration to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price, which is the price for the product or service when it is sold separately.

Payment terms vary by the type and location of the Customer and the products or services offered.  Generally, the time between when revenue is recognized and when payment is due is not significant.  We do not evaluate whether the selling price contains a financing component for contracts that have a duration of less than one year.

We do not capitalize sales commissions as substantially all of our sales commission programs have an amortization period of one year or less.

Certain costs to fulfill a contract are capitalized and amortized over the term of the contract if they are recoverable, directly related to a contract and generate resources that we will use to fulfill the contract in the future. At

March 31, 2020

, assets related to costs to fulfill a contract were not material to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Refer to Note


, titled "Business Segment Information" for disaggregation of revenue.

Product Revenue

Product revenues consist of revenues generated from sales of consumables and capital equipment. These contracts are primarily based on a Customer’s purchase order and may include a Distributor, Dealer or Group Purchasing Organization (GPO) agreement.

We recognize revenue for sales of product when control passes to the Customer, which generally occurs either when the products are shipped or when they are received by the Customer.  Revenue related to certain capital equipment products is deferred until installation is complete as the capital equipment and installation are highly integrated and form a single performance obligation.


STERIS PLC AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts and as noted)

Service Revenue

Within our Healthcare Products and Life Sciences segments, service revenues consist of revenue generated from parts and labor associated with the maintenance, repair and installation of capital equipment.  These contracts are primarily based on a Customer’s purchase order and may include a Distributor, Dealer, or GPO agreement.  For maintenance, repair and installation of capital equipment, revenue is recognized upon completion of the service.

We also offer preventive maintenance and separately priced extended warranty agreements to our Customers, which require us to maintain and repair our products over the duration of the contract.  Generally, these contract terms are cancelable without penalty and range from one to five years. Amounts received under these Customer contracts are initially recorded as a service liability and are recognized as service revenue ratably over the contract term using a time-based input measure.

Within our Healthcare Specialty Services segment, revenues relate primarily to outsourced reprocessing services and instrument repairs.  Contracts for outsourced reprocessing services are primarily based on an agreement with a Customer, ranging in length from several months to 15 years. Outsourced reprocessing services revenue is recognized ratably over the contract term using a time-based input measure, adjusted for volume and other performance metrics, to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur.  Contracts for instrument repairs are primarily based on a Customer’s purchase order, and the associated revenue is recognized upon completion of the repair.

Within our Applied Sterilization Technologies segment, service revenues include contract sterilization and laboratory services.  Sales contracts for contract sterilization and laboratory services are primarily based on a Customer’s purchase order and associated Customer agreement and revenues are generally recognized upon completion of the service.

Contract Liabilities

Payments received from Customers are based on invoices or billing schedules as established in contracts with Customers.  Deferred revenue is recorded when payment is received in advance of performance under the contract.  Deferred revenue is recognized as revenue upon completion of the performance obligation, which generally occurs within one year.  During fiscal 2020, we recognized revenue of

$

48,602

that was included in our contract liability balance at the beginning of the period. During fiscal 2019, we recognized revenue of

$

30,169

that was included in our contract liability balance at the beginning of the period.

Refer to Note


, titled  "Additional Consolidated Balance Sheet Information" for Deferred revenue balances.

Service Liabilities

Payments received in advance of performance for cancelable preventative maintenance and separately priced extended warranty contracts are recorded as service liabilities. Service liabilities are recognized as revenue as performance is rendered under the contract.  Prior to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 606, these amounts were included in Deferred revenues.

Refer to Note


, titled "Additional Consolidated Balance Sheet Information" for Service liability balances.

Remaining Performance Obligations

Remaining performance obligations reflect only the performance obligations related to agreements for which we have a firm commitment from a Customer to purchase, and exclude variable consideration related to unsatisfied performance obligations.  With regard to products, these remaining performance obligations include capital equipment and consumable orders which have not shipped.  With regard to service, these remaining performance obligations primarily include installation, certification, and outsourced reprocessing services. As of

March 31, 2020

, the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was approximately

$

940,000

. We expect to recognize approximately


%

of the transaction price within one year and approximately


%

beyond one year.  The remainder has yet to be scheduled for delivery.

Accounts Receivable.

Accounts receivable are presented at their face amount, less allowances for sales returns and uncollectible accounts. Accounts receivable consist of amounts billed and currently due from Customers and amounts earned but unbilled. We generally obtain and perfect security interest in products sold in the United States when we have a concern with the Customer's risk profile.


STERIS PLC AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts and as noted)

We maintain an allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable for estimated losses in the collection of amounts owed by Customers. We estimate the allowance based on analyzing a number of factors, including amounts written off historically, Customer payment practices, and general economic conditions. We also analyze significant Customer accounts on a regular basis and record a specific allowance when we become aware of a specific Customer’s inability to pay. As a result, the related accounts receivable are reduced to an amount that we reasonably believe is collectible.

We maintain an allowance for sales returns based upon known returns and estimated returns for both capital equipment and consumables. We estimate returns of capital equipment and consumables based upon recent historical experience

.

Inventories, net.

Inventories are stated at the lower of their cost or market value. We determine cost based upon a combination of the last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) and first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) cost methods. For inventories valued using the LIFO method, we believe that the use of the LIFO method results in a matching of current costs and revenues. Inventories valued using the LIFO method represented approximately

25.3

%

and

25.2

%

of total inventories at

March 31, 2020

and


, respectively. Inventory costs include material, labor, and overhead. If we had used only the FIFO method of inventory costing, inventories would have been

$

16,937

and

$

16,757

higher than those reported at

March 31, 2020

and


, respectively.

We review inventory on an ongoing basis, considering factors such as deterioration, obsolescence, and other items. We record an allowance for estimated losses when the facts and circumstances indicate that particular inventories will not be usable. If future market conditions vary from those projected, and our estimates prove to be inaccurate, we may be required to write-down inventory values and record an adjustment to cost of revenues.

Property, Plant, and Equipment.

Our property, plant, and equipment consists of land and land improvements, buildings and leasehold improvements, machinery and equipment, information systems, radioisotope (cobalt-60), and construction in progress. Property, plant, and equipment are presented at cost less accumulated depreciation and depletion. We capitalize additions and improvements. Repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as they are incurred.

Land is not depreciated and construction in progress is not depreciated until placed in service. Depreciation of most assets is computed on the cost less the estimated salvage value by using the straight-line method over the estimated remaining useful lives. Depletion of radioisotope is computed using the annual decay factor of the material, which is similar to the sum-of-the-years-digits method.

We generally depreciate or deplete property, plant, and equipment over the useful lives presented in the following table:

When we sell, retire, or dispose of property, plant, and equipment, we remove the asset’s cost and accumulated depreciation from our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We recognize the net gain or loss on the sale or disposition in the Consolidated Statements of Income in the period when the transaction occurs.

Interest.

We capitalize interest costs incurred during the construction of long-lived assets. We capitalized interest costs of

$


and

$


for the years ended

March 31, 2020

and


, respectively. Total interest expense for the years ended

March 31, 2020

,


, and 2018 was

$

40,279

,

$

45,015

, and

$

50,629

, respectively.

Identifiable Intangible Assets.

Our identifiable intangible assets include product technology rights, trademarks, licenses, and Customer and vendor relationships. We record these assets at cost, or when acquired as part of a business acquisition, at estimated fair value. We generally amortize identifiable intangible assets over periods ranging from


to


years using the straight-line method. Our intangible assets also include indefinite lived assets including certain trademarks and tradenames that were acquired in connection with business combinations. These assets are tested at least annually for impairment.

Investments.

Investments in marketable securities are stated at fair value and are included in "Other assets" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Following the fiscal 2019 adoption of ASU 2016-01, "Financial Instruments - Overall - Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Liabilities, changes in the fair value of these investments are recorded in the "Interest income and miscellaneous expense line" of the Consolidated Statement of Income.


STERIS PLC AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts and as noted)

Asset Impairment Losses.

Property, plant, equipment, and identifiable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when indicators of impairment exist and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. Impaired assets are recorded at the lower of carrying value or estimated fair value. We monitor for such indicators on an ongoing basis and if an impairment exists, we record the loss in the Consolidated Statements of Income during that period.

Asset Retirement Obligations.

We incur retirement obligations for certain assets. We record initial liabilities for the asset retirement obligations ("ARO") at fair value. Recognition of ARO includes: estimating the present value of a liability and offsetting asset, the subsequent accretion of that liability and depletion of the asset, and a periodic review of the ARO liability estimates and discount rates used in the analysis. We provide additional information about our asset retirement obligations in

Note 5

to our consolidated financial statements titled, “Property, Plant and Equipment.”

Acquisitions of Business.

Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are accounted for at fair value on the date of acquisition. Costs related to the acquisition are expensed as incurred.

Goodwill.

We perform our annual impairment test for goodwill in the third quarter of each year. We may consider qualitative indicators of the fair value of a reporting unit when it is unlikely that a reporting unit has impaired goodwill. We may also utilize a discounted cash flow analysis that requires certain assumptions and estimates be made regarding market conditions and our future profitability. We review the book value compared to the fair value at the reporting unit level. We calculate the fair value of our reporting units based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Management's judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value. Assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital, are consistent with internal projections, strategic plans, and operating plans. We believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other market place participants.

Self-Insurance Liabilities.

We record a liability for self-insured risks that we retain for general and product liabilities, workers’ compensation, and automobile liabilities based on actuarial calculations. We use our historical loss experience and actuarial methods to calculate the liability. This liability includes estimates for both losses and incurred but not reported claims. We review the assumptions used to calculate the estimated liability at least annually to evaluate the adequacy of the amount recorded. We maintain insurance policies to cover losses greater than our estimated liability, which are subject to the terms and conditions of those policies. We are also self-insured for certain employee medical claims. We estimate a liability for incurred but not reported claims based upon recent claims experience.

Benefit Plans.

We sponsor defined benefit pension plans. We also sponsor a post-retirement benefits plan for certain former employees. We determine our costs and obligations related to these plans by evaluating input from third-party professional advisers. These costs and obligations are affected by assumptions including the discount rate, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the annual rate of change in compensation for eligible employees, estimated changes in costs of healthcare benefits, and other factors. We review the assumptions used on an annual basis.

We recognize an asset for the overfunded status or a liability for the underfunded status of defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefits plans in our consolidated balance sheets. This amount is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation (the projected benefit obligation for pension plans and the accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation for other post-retirement benefit plans). Changes in the funded status of the plans are recorded in other comprehensive income in the year they occur. We measure plan assets and obligations as of the balance sheet date. We provide additional information about our pension and other post-retirement benefits plans in

Note 9

to our consolidated financial statements titled, “Benefit Plans.”

Fair Value of Financial Instruments.

Except for long-term debt, our financial instruments are highly liquid or have short-term maturities. We provide additional information about the fair value of our financial instruments in

Note 17

titled, “Fair Value Measurements.”

Foreign Currency Translation.

Most of our operations use their local currency as their functional currency. Financial statements of subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using the exchange rate at each balance sheet date for assets and liabilities and a weighted average exchange rate for each period for revenues, expenses, gains and losses. Translation adjustments for subsidiaries whose local currency is their functional currency are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within equity. Transaction gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in currency exchange rates on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are recognized as incurred in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Income, except for certain inter-company balances designated as long-term in nature.


STERIS PLC AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts and as noted)

Forward and Swap Contracts.

We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, including inter-company transactions.We may also enter into commodity swap contracts to hedge price changes in nickel that impact raw materials included in our cost of revenues. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. These contracts are marked to market, with gains and losses recognized within “Selling, general, and administrative expenses” or "Cost of revenues" in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.

Warranty.

Warranties are provided on the sale of certain of our products and services and an accrual for estimated future claims is recorded at the time revenue is recognized. We estimate warranty expense based primarily on historical warranty claim experience.

Shipping and Handling.

We record shipping and handling costs in costs of revenues. Shipping and handling costs charged to Customers are recorded as revenues in the period the product revenues are recognized.

Advertising Expenses.

Costs incurred for communicating, advertising and promoting our products are generally expensed when incurred as a component of Selling, General and Administrative Expense. We incurred

$

12,652

,

$

10,691

, and

$

10,886

of advertising costs during the years ended

March 31, 2020

,


, and 2018, respectively.

Research and Development.

We incur research and development costs associated with commercial products and expense these costs as incurred. If a Customer reimburses us for research and development costs, the costs are charged to the related contracts as costs of revenues.

Income Taxes.

We defer income taxes for all temporary differences between pre-tax financial and taxable income and between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities. We record valuation allowances to reduce net deferred tax assets to an amount that we expect will more-likely-than-not be realized. In making such a determination, we consider all available information, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and if applicable, any carryback claims that can be filed. In the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate.

We evaluate uncertain tax positions in accordance with a two-step process. The first step is recognition: The determination of whether or not it is more-likely-than-not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. In evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate tax authority and that the tax authority will have full knowledge of all relevant information. The second step is measurement: A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The measurement process requires the determination of the range of possible settlement amounts and the probability of achieving each of the possible settlements. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. No tax benefits are recognized for positions that do not meet the more-likely-than-not threshold. Tax positions that previously failed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met. Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which the threshold is no longer met. We describe income taxes further in

Note 8

to our consolidated financial statements titled, “Income Taxes.”

Share-Based Compensation.

We describe share-based compensation in

Note 14

to our consolidated financial statements titled, “Share-Based Compensation.” We measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award. We record liability awards at fair value each reporting period and the change in fair value is reflected as share-based compensation expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The expense is classified as cost of goods sold, selling, general and administrative expenses or research and development expenses in a manner consistent with the employee’s compensation and benefits. These costs are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award.

Restructuring.

We recognize restructuring expenses as incurred. Asset impairment and accelerated depreciation expenses primarily relate to inventory write-downs for rationalized products and adjustments in the carrying value of the related facilities and machinery and equipment to their estimated fair value. In addition, the remaining useful lives of other property, plant, and equipment associated with the related operations are reevaluated based on the respective restructuring plan, which may result in the acceleration of depreciation and amortization of certain assets

2. RESTRUCTURING

Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan.

During the third quarter of fiscal 2019, we adopted and announced a targeted restructuring plan (the "Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan"), which included the closure of two manufacturing facilities, one in Brazil and one in England, as well as other actions including the rationalization of certain products. Fewer than


positions were eliminated. The Company has relocated the production of certain impacted products to other existing manufacturing operations during fiscal 2020. These restructuring actions were designed to enhance profitability and improve efficiency.

Since inception of the Fiscal 2019 Restructuring Plan we have incurred pre-tax expenses totaling

$

43,851

related to these restructuring actions, of which

$

31,660

was recorded as restructuring expenses and

$

12,191

was recorded in cost of revenues, with a total of

$

31,162

,

$

2,518

,

$


, and

$

7,798

related to the Healthcare Products, Healthcare Specialty Services, Life Sciences, and Applied Sterilization Technologies segments, respectively. Corporate related restructuring charges were

Information regarding our intangible assets is as follows:

Certain trademarks and tradenames obtained as a result of business combinations are indefinite-lived assets. The approximate carrying value of these assets at

March 31, 2020

and

March 31, 2019

was

$

14,250

and

$

13,000

, respectively. We evaluate our indefinite-lived intangible assets annually during the third quarter, or when evidence of potential impairment exists.  No impairment was recognized for fiscal year 2020. During the third quarter of fiscal 2019, management adopted a branding strategy that included phasing out the usage of a tradename associated with certain products in the Healthcare Products business segment. As a result, management recorded an impairment charge of

$

16,249

, which is included within the Selling, general, and administrative line of the Consolidated Statements of Income. The remaining fair value of the asset was calculated using an income approach (the relief from royalty method). The remaining fair value was not material and will be amortized over the asset's remaining useful life. Fair value calculated using this approach is classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy and requires several assumptions.

Total amortization expense for intangible assets was

Asset Retirement Obligations

We provide contract sterilization services including Gamma irradiation which utilizes cobalt-60 in the form of cobalt pencils. We have incurred asset retirement obligations (ARO) associated with the future disposal of these assets once depleted. Recognition of ARO includes: the present value of a liability and offsetting asset, the subsequent accretion of that liability and depletion of the asset, and the periodic review of the ARO liability estimates and discount rates used in the analysis.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts and as noted)

subsequently became a borrower and guarantor under the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement replaced a bank credit facility dated March 31, 2015. The Credit Agreement provides up to

$

1,000,000

of credit, in the form of a revolver facility, which may be utilized for revolving credit borrowings, swing line borrowings and letters of credit, with sublimits for swing line borrowings and letters of credit. The revolver facility may be increased in specified circumstances by up to

$

500,000

. The Credit Agreement will mature on March 23, 2023, and all unpaid borrowings, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon, are repayable on that date. The Credit Agreement contains leverage and interest coverage covenants. Borrowings may be taken in U.S. dollars, euros, and pounds sterling and certain other specified currencies and bear interest at our option based upon either the Base Rate or the Eurocurrency Rate, plus the Applicable Margin in effect from time to time under the Credit Agreement. The Applicable Margin is determined based on the ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA (as such terms are defined in the Credit Agreement). Interest on Base Rate Advances is payable quarterly in arrears and interest on Eurocurrency Rate Advances is payable at the end of the relevant interest period therefor, but in no event less frequently than every three months. Borrowings at closing were used to repay outstanding balances of debt outstanding under the former bank credit facility dated March 31, 2015 that was scheduled to mature on March 31, 2020 and for other general corporate purposes. The Credit Agreement was amended in March 2019, in connection with the Redomiciliation to permit the Redomiciliation. The amendments did not effect any material changes in the terms of the Credit Agreement regarding borrowings or the issuance of letters of credit.

As of

7. ADDITIONAL CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET INFORMATION

Additional information related to our Consolidated Balance Sheet is as follows:

8. INCOME TAXES

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA”) was enacted on December 22, 2017. The TCJA reduced the maximum U.S. federal corporate income tax rate to

21.0

%

, required companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and created new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. The Company applied the guidance in Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act when accounting for the enactment-date effects of the TCJA.

We consider the tax expense recorded for the TCJA to be complete at this time. However, it is possible that additional legislation, regulations, interpretations and/or guidance may be issued in the future that may result in additional adjustments to the tax expense recorded related to the TCJA. We have continued to monitor these as they are published. While none have resulted in material adverse impacts through fiscal 2020, there are certain items, which were not yet considered law as of March 31, 2020, that if finalized as proposed, could result in an adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. Specifically, full retroactive application to April 1, 2019 of certain of the regulations relating to §267A, would require recognition of income tax expense up to

$

15,000

related to the period April 1, 2019 through December 4, 2019 when we restructured certain of our intercompany financing arrangements. This potential impact contains significant uncertainty and


STERIS PLC AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts and as noted)

could be impacted by various factors, including any differences between the proposed and finalized regulations, issued in April 2020, and their retroactive application.

Income from continuing operations before income taxes was as follows:

The components of the provision for income taxes related to income from continuing operations consisted of the following:


STERIS PLC AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts and as noted)

The total provision for income taxes can be reconciled to the tax computed at the Ireland statutory tax rate for 2020 and 2019, and the United Kingdom statutory rate for 2018 as follows:

Unrecognized Tax Benefits.

We classify uncertain tax positions and related interest and penalties as long-term liabilities within “Other liabilities” in our accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, unless they are expected to be paid within 12 months, in which case, the uncertain tax positions would be classified as current liabilities within “Accrued income taxes.” We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within “Income tax expense” in our accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

We recognized interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in the provision for income taxes. As of

March 31, 2020

, and 2019 we had

$


and

$


accrued for interest and penalties, respectively. If all unrecognized tax benefits were recognized, the net impact on the provision for income tax expense would be

$

1,118

. The decrease in unrecognized tax benefits from prior year is due to the release of expired positions. It is reasonably possible that during the next 12 months, there will be no material reductions in unrecognized tax benefits as a result of the expiration of various statutes of limitations or other matters.

We operate in numerous taxing jurisdictions and are subject to regular examinations by various United States federal, state and local, as well as foreign jurisdictions. We are no longer subject to United States federal examinations for years before fiscal 2016 and, with limited exceptions, we are no longer subject to United States state and local, or non-United States, income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before fiscal 2015. We remain subject to tax authority audits in various jurisdictions wherever we do business.


STERIS PLC AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts and as noted)

In May 2019, we received two notices of proposed tax adjustment from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) regarding the deductibility of interest paid on certain intercompany debt. The notices relate to fiscal years 2016 and 2017. In September 2019, we received another notice of proposed adjustment for the same issue, for the 2018 fiscal year. The IRS adjustments would result in a cumulative tax liability of approximately

$

40,000

. Notices have not been received for subsequent periods. We are contesting the IRS’s assertions, and intend to pursue available remedies such as appeals and litigation, if necessary. We have not established reserves related to these notices. An unfavorable outcome is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position but could be material to our consolidated results of operations and cash flows for any one period.

We estimate that the tax benefit from our Costa Rican Tax Holiday is

$

1,900

(or

$

0.02

per fully diluted share), annually.  The Tax Holiday runs fully exempt, from income tax, through 2025 and partially exempt through 2029.

Deferred Taxes.

The significant components of the deferred tax assets and liabilities recorded in our accompanying balance sheets at

March 31, 2020

and


were as follows:

(1) For more information regarding our operating leases, see Note 10 titled, "Commitments and Contingencies".

At

March 31, 2020

, we had U.S. federal operating loss carryforwards of

$

10,942

, which remain subject to a 20 year carryforward period. Additionally, we had non-U.S. operating loss carry forwards of

$

41,450

. Although the majority of the non-U.S. carryforwards have indefinite expiration periods, those carryforwards that have definite expiration periods will expire if unused between fiscal years 2021 and 2041. In addition, we have recorded pre-valuation allowance tax benefits of

$

2,042

related to state operating loss carryforwards. If unused, these state operating loss carryforwards will expire between fiscal years 2021 and 2040. At

March 31, 2020

, we had

$

2,547

of tax credit carryforwards. These credit carryforwards can be used through fiscal 2030.

We review the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance of

13,891

has been applied to a portion of the net deferred tax assets because we do not believe it is more-likely-than-not that we will receive future benefit. The valuation allowance increased during fiscal

Other than the tax expense recorded for the one-time transition tax on unremitted earnings of non-US subsidiaries, no additional provision has been made for income taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as the Company’s position is that these amounts continue to be indefinitely reinvested.  The amount of undistributed earnings of subsidiaries was approximately

$

1,600,000

at March 31, 2020.  It is not practicable to estimate the additional income taxes and applicable withholding taxes that would be payable on the remittance of such undistributed earnings.

In October 2015, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), in conjunction with the G20, finalized broad-based international tax policy guidelines that involve transfer pricing and other international tax subjects. While some member jurisdictions automatically adopt the new OECD guidelines, most member countries can adopt the guidelines only by new law or regulations. We are currently adopting processes to comply with the reporting requirements specified by the guidelines and are evaluating the other parts of the guidelines.

9. BENEFIT PLANS

In the United States, we sponsor an unfunded post-retirement welfare benefits plan for two groups of United States retirees. Benefits under this plan include retiree life insurance and retiree medical insurance, including prescription drug coverage.

During the second quarter of fiscal 2009, we amended our United States post-retirement welfare benefits plan, reducing the benefits to be provided to retirees under the plan and increasing their share of the costs. The amendments resulted in a decrease of

$

46,001

in the accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation. The impact of this change was recognized in our Consolidated Balance Sheets in fiscal 2009 and is being amortized as a component of the annual net periodic benefit cost over a period of approximately thirteen years.

We sponsor several defined benefit pension schemes outside the United States: two in the UK, one in the Netherlands, two in Germany, and one in Switzerland. The Synergy Health plc Retirement Benefit Scheme is a defined benefit (final salary) funded pension scheme. In previous years, Synergy sponsored a funded defined benefit arrangement in the Netherlands. This was a separate fund holding the pension scheme assets to meet long-term pension liabilities for past and present employees. Accrual of benefits ceased under the scheme effective January 1, 2013. The Synergy Radeberg and Synergy Allershausen Schemes are unfunded defined pension schemes and are closed to new entrants.  The Synergy Daniken Scheme is a defined benefit funded pension scheme. As a result of our fiscal 2018 acquisition of Harwell Dosimeters Ltd, we also sponsor in the Harwell Dosimeters Ltd Retirement Benefits Scheme which is a defined benefit funded pension scheme.

We recognize the funded status of our defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit plans in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax. The funded status is measured as of March 31 each year and is calculated as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation (which is the projected benefit obligation for pension plans and the accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation for post-retirement benefit plans). Accumulated comprehensive income (loss) represents the net unrecognized actuarial losses and unrecognized prior service cost. These amounts will be recognized in net periodic benefit cost as they are amortized. We will recognize future changes to the funded status of these plans in the year the change occurs, through other comprehensive income.

Assumptions Used in Calculating Benefit Obligations and Net Periodic Benefit Cost.

The following table presents significant assumptions used to determine the projected benefit obligations at March 31:

The following table presents significant assumptions used to determine the net periodic benefit costs for the years ended March 31:

The net periodic benefit cost and the actuarial present value of projected benefit obligations are based upon assumptions that we review on an annual basis. These assumptions may be revised annually based upon an evaluation of long-term trends, as well as market conditions that may have an impact on the cost of providing benefits.

We develop our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumptions by evaluating input from third-party professional advisers, taking into consideration the asset allocation of the portfolios and the long-term asset class return expectations.

We develop our discount rate assumptions by evaluating input from third-party professional advisers, taking into consideration the current yield on country specific investment grade long-term bonds which provide for similar cash flow streams as our projected obligations.

We have made assumptions regarding healthcare costs in computing our other post-retirement benefit obligation.

The assumed rates of increase generally decline ratably over a five-year period from the assumed current year healthcare cost trend rate to the assumed long-term healthcare cost trend rate noted below.

To determine the healthcare cost trend rates, we evaluate a combination of information, including ongoing claims cost monitoring, annual statistical analyses of claims data, reconciliation of forecasted claims against actual claims, review of trend


STERIS PLC AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts and as noted)

assumptions of other plan sponsors and national health trends, and adjustments for plan design changes, workforce changes, and changes in plan participant behavior.

A one-percentage-point change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates (including medical, prescription drug, and long-term rates) would have had the following effect on our other post-retirement benefit obligation at

March 31, 2020

:

Plan Assets.

The investment policies for our plans are generally established by the local pension plan trustees and seek to maintain the plans' ability to meet liabilities and to comply with local minimum funding requirements. Plan assets are invested in diversified portfolios that provide adequate levels of return at an acceptable level of risk. The investment policies are reviewed at least annually and revised, as deemed appropriate to ensure that the objectives are being met. At

March 31, 2020

, the targeted allocation for the plans were approximately


%

equity investments and


%

fixed income investments.

Financial instruments included in pension plan assets are categorized into three tiers. These tiers include a fair value hierarchy of three levels, based on the degree of subjectivity inherent in the valuation methodology as follows:

Level 1 - Quoted prices for identical assets in active markets.

Level 2 - Quoted prices for similar assets in active markets with inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly.

Level 3 - Unobservable prices or inputs in which little or no market data exists.

The fair value of our pension benefits plan assets at

March 31, 2020

and


by asset category is as follows:

Collective investment trusts are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient. These trusts have not been categorized in the fair value hierarchy and are being presented in the tables above to permit a reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the total plan assets.

The fair value measurement of plan assets using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) changed during fiscal year


due to the following:

Cash Flows.

We contribute amounts to our defined benefit pension plans at least equal to the minimum amounts required by applicable employee benefit laws and local tax laws. We expect to make contributions of approximately

$

3,839

during fiscal 2021.

Based upon the actuarial assumptions utilized to develop our benefit obligations at

March 31, 2020

, the following benefit payments are expected to be made to plan participants:

The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the “Act”) provides a prescription drug benefit for Medicare beneficiaries, a benefit we provide to Medicare eligible retirees covered by our post-retirement benefits plan. We have concluded that the prescription drug benefit provided in our post-retirement benefit plan is considered to be actuarially equivalent to the benefit provided under the Act and thus qualifies for the subsidy under the Act. Benefits are subject to a per capita per month cost cap and any costs above the cap become the responsibility of the retiree. Under the plan, the subsidy is applied to reduce the retiree responsibility. As a result, the expected future subsidy no longer reduces our accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost. We collected subsidies totaling approximately

$


and

$


, during fiscal


and fiscal


, respectively, which reduced the retiree responsibility for costs in excess of the caps established in the post-retirement benefit plan.

Defined Contribution Plans.

We maintain a 401(k) defined contribution plan for eligible U.S. employees, a 401(k) defined contribution plan for eligible Puerto Rico employees and similar savings plans for certain employees in Canada, United Kingdom, Ireland, and Finland. We provide a match on a specified portion of an employee’s contribution. The U.S. plan assets are held in trust and invested as directed by the plan participants. The Canadian plan assets are held by insurance companies. The aggregate fair value of the U.S. plan assets was

We also maintain a domestic non-qualified deferred compensation plan covering certain employees, which formerly allowed for the deferral of compensation for an employee-specified term or until retirement or termination. There have been no employee contributions made to this plan since fiscal 2012. The Plan was amended in fiscal 2012 to disallow deferrals of salary payable in 2012 and subsequent calendar years and of commissions and other incentive compensation payable in respect of the 2013 and subsequent fiscal years. We hold investments in mutual funds to satisfy future obligations of the plan. We account for these assets as available-for-sale securities and they are included in “Other assets” on our accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, with a corresponding liability for the plan’s obligation recorded in “Accrued expenses and other.” The aggregate value of the assets was

$

1,273

and

$

1,400

at

March 31, 2020

and

March 31, 2019

, respectively. Realized gains and losses on these investments are recorded in “Interest and miscellaneous income” within “Non-operating expenses” on our accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. Changes in the fair value of the assets are recorded in other comprehensive income on our accompanying balance sheets.

10. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

We are, and will likely continue to be, involved in a number of legal proceedings, government investigations, and claims, which we believe generally arise in the course of our business, given our size, history, complexity, and the nature of our business, products, Customers, regulatory environment, and industries in which we participate. These legal proceedings, investigations and claims generally involve a variety of legal theories and allegations, including, without limitation, personal injury (e.g., slip and falls, burns, vehicle accidents), product liability or regulation (e.g., based on product operation or claimed malfunction, failure to warn, failure to meet specification, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements), product exposure (e.g., claimed exposure to chemicals, asbestos, contaminants, radiation), property damage (e.g., claimed damage due to leaking equipment, fire, vehicles, chemicals), commercial claims (e.g., breach of contract, economic loss, warranty, misrepresentation), financial (e.g., taxes, reporting), employment (e.g., wrongful termination, discrimination, benefits matters), and other claims for damage and relief.

We believe we have adequately reserved for our current litigation and claims that are probable and estimable, and further believe that the ultimate outcome of these pending lawsuits and claims will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations taken as a whole. Due to their inherent uncertainty, however, there can be no assurance of the ultimate outcome or effect of current or future litigation, investigations, claims or other proceedings (including without limitation the matters discussed below). For certain types of claims, we presently maintain insurance coverage for personal injury and property damage and other liability coverages in amounts and with deductibles that we believe are prudent, but there can be no assurance that these coverages will be applicable or adequate to cover adverse outcomes of claims or legal proceedings against us.

On May 31, 2012, our Albert Browne Limited subsidiary received a warning letter from the FDA regarding chemical indicators manufactured in the United Kingdom. These devices are intended for the monitoring of certain sterilization and other processes.  The FDA warning letter stated that the agency had concerns regarding operational business processes. In the second half of calendar 2019, the FDA conducted a comprehensive inspection of the Albert Browne facility in question. In a May 12, 2020 email, the FDA provided the Company with a copy of the Inspection Report. In that same email the FDA advised the Company that the email would serve as a "No Action Indicated" notice and that it was finalizing a Warning Letter Closeout to be provided to the Company. These actions bring this matter to a favorable conclusion for the Company.

Civil, criminal, regulatory or other proceedings involving our products or services could possibly result in judgments, settlements or administrative or judicial decrees requiring us, among other actions, to pay damages or fines or effect recalls, or be subject to other governmental, Customer or other third party claims or remedies, which could materially effect our business, performance, prospects, value, financial condition, and results of operations.

For additional information regarding these matters, see the risks and uncertainties described under the title "product related regulations and claims" in Item 1A. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

From time to time, STERIS is also involved in legal proceedings as a plaintiff involving contract, patent protection, and other claims asserted by us. Gains, if any, from these proceedings are recognized when they are realized.

We are subject to taxation from United States federal, state and local, and foreign jurisdictions. Tax positions are settled primarily through the completion of audits within each individual jurisdiction or the closing of statutes of limitation. Changes in applicable tax law or other events may also require us to revise past estimates. We describe income taxes further in

Leases

We lease manufacturing, warehouse and office space, service facilities, vehicles, equipment and communication systems.  Certain leases contain options that provide us with the ability to extend the lease term.  Such options are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised.  We made an accounting policy election to not recognize lease assets or lease liabilities for leases with a lease term of twelve months or less.

We determine if an agreement contains a lease and classify our leases as operating or finance at the lease commencement date.  Finance leases are generally those leases for which we will pay substantially all the underlying asset’s fair value or will use the asset for all or a major part of its economic life, including circumstances in which we will ultimately own the asset.  Lease assets arising from finance leases are included in property, plant and equipment, net and the liabilities are included in other liabilities.  For finance leases, we recognize interest expense using the effective interest method and we recognize amortization expense on the lease asset over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of the asset. Our finance leases are not material as of March 31, 2020 and for the twelve month period then ended.

Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date of the lease based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term.  Lease assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease.  As most leases do not provide an implicit interest rate, we estimate an incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of lease payments. Our estimated incremental borrowing rate reflects a secured rate based on recent debt issuances, our estimated credit rating, lease term, as well as publicly available data for instruments with similar characteristics. For operating leases, we recognize lease cost on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.  When accounting for leases, we combine payments for leased assets, related services and other components of a lease.

The components of operating lease expense are as follows:

Our Applied Sterilization Technologies ("AST") segment provides contract sterilization and testing services for medical device and pharmaceutical manufacturers.

We disclose a measure of segment income that is consistent with the way management operates and views the business. The accounting policies for reportable segments are the same as those for the consolidated Company. In fiscal 2019, we ceased the allocation of certain corporate costs to our segments to align with internal management measures. The prior period operating income measures have been recast for comparability.

For the year ended

Assets include the current and long-lived assets directly attributable to the segment based on the management of the location or on utilization. Certain corporate assets were allocated to the reportable segments based on revenues. Assets attributed to sales and distribution locations are only allocated to the Healthcare Products and Life Sciences segments.

Individual facilities, equipment, and intellectual properties are utilized for production by both the Healthcare Products and Life Sciences segments at varying levels over time. As a result, an allocation of total assets, capital expenditures, and depreciation and amortization is not meaningful to the individual performance of the Healthcare Products and Life Sciences segments. Therefore, their respective amounts are reported together.

12. SHARES AND PREFERRED SHARES

Ordinary Shares

In connection with the Redomiciliation, STERIS UK shareholders received STERIS plc shares pursuant to a scheme of arrangement under UK law. Each STERIS UK ordinary shareholder received one ordinary share, par value

$

75.00

, of STERIS plc for each STERIS UK ordinary share held, which STERIS UK shares were canceled. On May 3, 2019, the par value of STERIS plc shares issued pursuit to the scheme of arrangement was reduced to

$

0.001

per share.

We calculate basic earnings per share based upon the weighted average number of shares outstanding. We calculate diluted earnings per share based upon the weighted average number of shares outstanding plus the dilutive effect of share equivalents calculated using the treasury stock method. The following is a summary of shares and share equivalents outstanding used in the calculations of basic and diluted earnings per share:

Options to purchase the following number of shares were outstanding but excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because the combined exercise prices, unamortized fair values, and assumed tax benefits upon exercise were greater than the average market price for the shares during the periods, so including these options would be anti-dilutive:

On August 9, 2016, STERIS UK announced that its Board of Directors had authorized the purchase of up to

$

300,000

(net of taxes, fees and commissions) of our ordinary shares. As a result of the Redomiciliation, that share repurchase authorization terminated.

On May 7, 2019, our Board of Directors authorized the continuation of the share repurchase program resulting in a share repurchase authorization of

$

78,979

(net of taxes, fees and commissions). As of March 31, 2020, there was approximately

$

338,979

(net of taxes, fees and commissions) of remaining availability under the authorization.

Under the authorizations, the Company may repurchase its shares from time to time through open market purchases, including 10b5-1 plans. Any repurchase program may be activated, suspended or discontinued at any time.

During fiscal 2020, we repurchased

273,259

14. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

We maintain a long-term incentive plan that makes available shares for grants, at the discretion of the Board of Directors or  Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, to officers, directors, and key employees in the form of stock options, restricted shares, restricted share units, stock appreciation rights and share grants. We satisfy share award incentives through the issuance of new ordinary shares.

Stock options provide the right to purchase our shares at the market price on the date of grant, or for options granted to employees in fiscal 2019 and thereafter, 110% of the market price on the date of grant, subject to the terms of the plan and agreements. Generally, one-fourth of the stock options granted to employees become exercisable for each full year of employment following the grant date. Stock options granted generally expire 10 years after the grant date, or in some cases earlier if the option holder is no longer employed by us. Restricted shares and restricted share units generally cliff vest after a four year period or vest in tranches of one-fourth of the number granted for each year of employment after the grant date.  As of

March 31, 2020

,

3,961,998

shares remained available for grant under the long-term incentive plan.

The fair value of share-based stock option compensation awards was estimated at their grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. This model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable, characteristics that are not present in our option grants. If the model permitted consideration of the unique characteristics of employee stock options, the resulting estimate of the fair value of the stock options could be different. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The expense is classified as cost of goods sold or selling, general and administrative expenses in a manner consistent with the employee’s compensation and benefits.


STERIS PLC AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(dollars in thousands, except per share amounts and as noted)

The following weighted-average assumptions were used for options granted during fiscal 2020, fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018:

The risk-free interest rate is based upon the U.S. Treasury yield curve. The expected life of options is reflective of historical experience, vesting schedules and contractual terms. The expected dividend yield of stock represents our best estimate of the expected future dividend yield. The expected volatility of stock is derived by referring to our historical stock prices over a time frame similar to that of the expected life of the grant. An estimated forfeiture rate of

2.77

%

,

2.37

%

and

2.25

%

was applied in fiscal


,


and 2018 respectively. This rate is calculated based upon historical activity and represents an estimate of the granted options not expected to vest. If actual forfeitures differ from this calculated rate, we may be required to make additional adjustments to compensation expense in future periods. The assumptions used above are reviewed at the time of each significant option grant, or at least annually.

A summary of share option activity is as follows:

We estimate that

857,860

of the non-vested stock options outstanding at

March 31, 2020

will ultimately vest.

The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pre-tax difference between the

$

139.97

closing price of our ordinary shares on

March 31, 2020

over the exercise prices of the stock options, multiplied by the number of options outstanding or outstanding and exercisable, as applicable. The aggregate intrinsic value is not recorded for financial accounting purposes and the value changes daily based on the daily changes in the fair market value of our ordinary shares.

The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the years ended

March 31, 2020

,


and 2018 was

$

57,683

,

$

25,371

and

$

,

$

13,308

and

$

15. FINANCIAL AND OTHER GUARANTEES

We generally offer a limited parts and labor warranty on capital equipment. The specific terms and conditions of those warranties vary depending on the product sold and the countries where we conduct business. We record a liability for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time product revenues are recognized. The amounts we expect to incur on behalf of our Customers for the future estimated cost of these warranties are recorded as a current liability on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Factors that affect the amount of our warranty liability include the number and type of installed units, historical and anticipated rates of product failures, and material and service costs per claim. We periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary.

Changes in our warranty liability during the periods presented are as follows:

16. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING

From time to time, we enter into forward contracts to hedge potential foreign currency gains and losses that arise from transactions denominated in foreign currencies, including inter-company transactions. We may also enter into commodity swap contracts to hedge price changes in nickel that impact raw materials included in our cost of revenues. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and do not receive hedge accounting treatment; therefore, changes in their fair value are not deferred but are recognized immediately in the Consolidated Statements of Income. At

March 31, 2020

, we held a foreign currency forward contract to buy

6.0

million

Canadian dollars. At

March 31, 2020

, we held commodity swap contracts to buy

715.2

thousand

pounds of nickel.

The following table presents the impact of derivative instruments and their location within the Consolidated Statements of Income:

Additionally, we hold our debt in multiple currencies to fund our operations and investments in certain subsidiaries. We designate portions of non-functional currency denominated intercompany loans as hedges of portions of net investments in foreign operations. Net debt designated as non-derivative net investment hedging instruments totaled

$

45,765

at

March 31, 2020

. These hedges are designed to be fully effective and any associated gain or loss is recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income and will be reclassified to income in the same period when a gain or loss related to the net investment in the foreign operation is included in income.

17. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or that would be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. We estimate the fair value of financial assets and liabilities using available market information and generally accepted valuation methodologies. The inputs used to measure fair value are classified into three tiers. These tiers include Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring the entity to develop its own assumptions.

The following table shows the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities at

March 31, 2020

and

March 31, 2019

:

(1)

The fair values of forward and swap contracts are based on period-end forward rates and reflect the value of the amount that we would pay or receive for the contracts involving the same notional amounts and maturity dates.

(2)

We maintain a frozen domestic non-qualified deferred compensation plan covering certain employees, which allowed for the deferral of payment of previously earned compensation for an employee-specified term or until retirement or termination. Amounts deferred can be allocated to various hypothetical investment options (compensation deferrals have been frozen under the plan). We hold investments to satisfy the future obligations of the plan. Employees who made deferrals are entitled to receive distributions of their hypothetical account balances (amounts deferred, together with earnings (losses)). We also hold an investment in the common stock of Servizi Italia, S.p.A, a leading provider of integrated linen washing and outsourced sterile processing services to hospital Customers. Beginning in fiscal 2019, changes in the fair value of these investments are recorded in the "Interest income and miscellaneous expense line" of the Consolidated Statement of Income

. During fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 we recorded losses of

$

3,579

and

$

2,731

, respectively, related to these investments.

(3)

We estimate the fair value of our long-term debt using discounted cash flow analyses, based on our current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements.

(4)

Contingent consideration obligations arise from prior business acquisitions. The fair values are based on discounted cash flow analyses reflecting the possible achievement of specified performance measures or events and captures the contractual nature of the contingencies, commercial risk, and the time value of money. Contingent consideration obligations are classified in the consolidated balance sheets as accrued expense (short-term) and other liabilities (long-term), as appropriate based on the contractual payment dates.

EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Our management, including the Principal Executive Officer (“PEO”) and Principal Financial Officer (“PFO”), has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on this evaluation, the PEO and PFO have determined that, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS

During the quarter ended

March 31, 2020

, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in the Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the PEO and PFO, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of

March 31, 2020

based on the framework in 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation under this framework, management concluded that the internal control over financial reporting was effective as of March 31, 2020. Our evaluation of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of the entities that were acquired during fiscal


. Total assets of the acquired businesses (inclusive of acquired intangible assets and goodwill) represented approximately 4% of our total assets as of

March 31, 2020

and approximately 1% of our total revenues for the year ended

March 31, 2020

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of

STERIS plc

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We have audited STERIS plc and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, STERIS plc and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2020, based on the COSO criteria.

As indicated in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management’s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of the entities that were acquired during the year ended March 31, 2020, which are included in the fiscal 2020 consolidated financial statements of the Company and constituted approximately 4% of total assets as of March 31, 2020 and approximately 1% of total revenues for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of the entities that were acquired during the year ended March 31, 2020.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of March 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2020, and the related notes

and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) and our report dated May 29, 2020 expressed

an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion



The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
