PART I

Item 1. BUSINESS

Southern Company was incorporated under the laws of Delaware on November 9, 1945. Southern Company
is domesticated under the laws of Georgia and is qualified to do business as a foreign corporation
under the laws of Alabama. Southern Company owns all of the outstanding common stock of Alabama
Power, Georgia Power, Gulf Power, and Mississippi Power, each of which is an operating public
utility company. The traditional operating companies supply electric service in the states of
Alabama, Georgia, Florida, and Mississippi. More particular information relating to each of the
traditional operating companies is as follows:

Alabama Power

is a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Alabama on November 10,
1927, by the consolidation of a predecessor Alabama Power Company, Gulf Electric Company, and
Houston Power Company. The predecessor Alabama Power Company had been in continuous existence
since its incorporation in 1906.

Georgia Power

was incorporated under the laws of the State of Georgia on June 26, 1930, and
admitted to do business in Alabama on September 15, 1948. Effective July 1, 2006, Savannah
Electric, formerly a wholly-owned subsidiary of Southern Company, was merged with and into
Georgia Power.

Gulf Power

is a Florida corporation that has had a continuous existence since it was originally
organized under the laws of the State of Maine on November 2, 1925. Gulf Power was admitted to
do business in Florida on January 15, 1926, in Mississippi on October 25, 1976, and in Georgia
on November 20, 1984. Gulf Power became a Florida corporation after being domesticated under
the laws of the State of Florida on November 2, 2005.

Mississippi Power

was incorporated under the laws of the State of Mississippi on July 12, 1972,
was admitted to do business in Alabama on November 28, 1972, and effective December 21, 1972, by
the merger into it of the predecessor Mississippi Power Company, succeeded to the business and
properties of the latter company. The predecessor Mississippi Power Company was incorporated
under the laws of the State of Maine on November 24, 1924 and was admitted to do business in
Mississippi on December 23, 1924 and in Alabama on December 7, 1962.

In addition, Southern Company owns all of the common stock of Southern Power, which is also an
operating public utility company. Southern Power constructs, acquires, owns, and manages
generation assets and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market. Southern
Power is a corporation organized under the laws of Delaware on January 8, 2001 and was admitted to
do business in the States of Alabama, Florida, and Georgia on January 10, 2001, in the State of
Mississippi on January 30, 2001, and in the State of North Carolina on February 19, 2007.

Southern Company also owns all the outstanding common stock or membership interests of SouthernLINC
Wireless, Southern Nuclear, SCS, Southern Holdings, and other direct and indirect subsidiaries.
SouthernLINC Wireless provides digital wireless communications for use by Southern Company and its
subsidiary companies and markets these services to the public and also provides wholesale fiber
optic solutions to telecommunication providers in the Southeast. Southern Nuclear operates and
provides services to Alabama Power’s and Georgia Power’s nuclear plants. SCS is the system service
company providing, at cost, specialized services to Southern Company and its subsidiary companies.
Southern Holdings is an intermediate holding subsidiary for Southern Company’s investments in
leveraged leases and various other energy-related businesses.

Alabama Power and Georgia Power each own 50% of the outstanding common stock of SEGCO. SEGCO is an
operating public utility company that owns electric generating units with an aggregate capacity of
1,019,680 kilowatts at Plant Gaston on the Coosa River near Wilsonville, Alabama. Alabama Power
and Georgia Power are each entitled to one-half of SEGCO’s capacity and energy. Alabama Power acts
as SEGCO’s agent in the operation of SEGCO’s units and furnishes coal to SEGCO as fuel for its
units. SEGCO also owns one 230,000 volt transmission line extending from Plant Gaston to the
Georgia state line at which point connection is made with the Georgia Power transmission line
system.

I-1


Southern Company’s segment information is included in Note 11 to the financial statements of
Southern Company in Item 8 herein.

The registrants’ Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on
Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports are made available on Southern Company’s website,
free of charge, as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with
or furnished to the SEC. Southern Company’s internet address is www.southerncompany.com.

The Southern Company System

Traditional Operating Companies

The traditional operating companies own generation, transmission, and distribution facilities. See
PROPERTIES in Item 2 herein for additional information on the traditional operating companies’
generating facilities. The transmission facilities of each of the traditional operating companies
are connected to the respective company’s own generating plants and other sources of power and are
interconnected with the transmission facilities of the other traditional operating companies and
SEGCO by means of heavy-duty high voltage lines. For information on Georgia Power’s integrated
transmission system, see “Territory Served by the Traditional Operating Companies and Southern
Power” herein.

Operating contracts covering arrangements in effect with principal neighboring utility systems
provide for capacity exchanges, capacity purchases and sales, transfers of economy energy, and
other similar transactions. Additionally, the traditional operating companies have entered into
voluntary reliability agreements with the subsidiaries of Entergy Corporation, Florida Electric
Power Coordinating Group, and TVA and with Progress Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy, South Carolina
Electric & Gas Company, and Virginia Electric and Power Company, each of which provides for the
establishment and periodic review of principles and procedures for planning and operation of
generation and transmission facilities, maintenance schedules, load retention programs, emergency
operations, and other matters affecting the reliability of bulk power supply. The traditional
operating companies have joined with other utilities in the Southeast (including those referred to
above) to form the SERC to augment further the reliability and adequacy of bulk power supply.
Through the SERC, the traditional operating companies are represented on the National Electric
Reliability Council.

The IIC provides for coordinating operations of the power producing facilities of the traditional
operating companies and Southern Power and the capacities available to such companies from
non-affiliated sources and for the pooling of surplus energy available for interchange.
Coordinated operation of the entire interconnected system is conducted through a central power
supply coordination office maintained by SCS. The available sources of energy are allocated to the
traditional operating companies and Southern Power to provide the most economical sources of power
consistent with reliable operation. The resulting benefits and savings are apportioned among each
of the companies. See MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – “FERC
Matters – Intercompany Interchange Contract” of each registrant in Item 7 herein and Note 3 to the
financial statements of each registrant, all under “FERC Matters – Intercompany Interchange
Contract” in Item 8 herein for information on the settlement of the FERC proceeding related to
the IIC.

Southern Company, each traditional operating company, Southern Power, Southern Nuclear, SEGCO, and
other subsidiaries have contracted with SCS to furnish, at direct or allocated cost and upon
request, the following services: general and design engineering, purchasing, accounting and
statistical analysis, finance and treasury, tax, information resources, marketing, auditing,
insurance and pension administration, human resources, systems and procedures, digital wireless
communications, and other services with respect to business and operations and power pool
transactions. Southern Power and SouthernLINC Wireless have also secured from the traditional
operating companies certain services which are furnished at cost and, in the case of Southern Power
which is subject to FERC regulations, in compliance with such regulations.

Alabama Power and Georgia Power each have a contract with Southern Nuclear to operate Plant Farley
and Plants Hatch and Vogtle, respectively. See “Regulation – Nuclear Regulation” herein for
additional information.

I-2


Southern Power

Southern Power is an electric wholesale generation subsidiary with market-based rate authority from
the FERC. Southern Power constructs, acquires, owns, and manages generation assets and sells
electricity at market-based prices in the wholesale market. Southern Power’s business activities
are not subject to traditional state regulation like the traditional operating companies but are
subject to regulation by the FERC. Southern Power has attempted to insulate itself from
significant fuel supply, fuel transportation, and electric transmission risks by making such risks
the responsibility of the counterparties to the PPAs. However, Southern Power’s future earnings
will depend on the parameters of the wholesale market, federal regulation, and the efficient
operation of its wholesale generating assets. For additional information on Southern Power’s
business activities, see MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – OVERVIEW – “Business Activities” of
Southern Power in Item 7 herein.

In June 2008, Southern Power completed construction on Plant Franklin Unit 3 which added 659
megawatts to the Southern Company system generating capacity. In December 2008, Southern Power
announced plans to construct a 720 megawatt electric generating plant in North Carolina. This new
plant is expected to go into commercial operation in 2012. As of December 31, 2008, Southern Power
had 7,555 megawatts of nameplate capacity in commercial operation.

Other Businesses

Southern Holdings is an intermediate holding subsidiary for Southern Company’s investments in
leveraged leases and various other energy-related businesses.

SouthernLINC Wireless provides digital wireless communications for use by Southern Company and its
subsidiary companies and markets its services to non-affiliates within the Southeast. SouthernLINC
Wireless delivers multiple wireless communication options including push to talk, cellular service,
text messaging, wireless internet access, and wireless data. Its system covers approximately
128,000 square miles in the Southeast. SouthernLINC Wireless also provides wholesale fiber optic
solutions to telecommunication providers in the Southeast under the name Southern Telecom.

These efforts to invest in and develop new business opportunities offer potential returns exceeding
those of rate-regulated operations. However, these activities also involve a higher degree of
risk.

I-3


Construction Programs

The subsidiary companies of Southern Company are engaged in continuous construction programs to
accommodate existing and estimated future loads on their respective systems. For estimated
construction and environmental expenditures for the periods 2009 through 2011, see Note 7 to the
financial statements of each traditional operating company and Southern Power under “Construction
Program” and “Expansion Program”, respectively, in Item 8 herein. Estimated construction costs in
2009 are expected to be apportioned approximately as follows: (in millions)

These amounts include the traditional operating companies and Southern Power (as detailed in the
table above) as well as the amounts for the other subsidiaries. See “Other Businesses” herein for
additional information.

The construction programs are subject to periodic review and revision, and actual construction
costs may vary from these estimates because of numerous factors. These factors include: changes in
business conditions; changes in load projections; changes in environmental statutes and
regulations; changes in nuclear plants to meet new regulatory requirements; changes in FERC rules
and regulations; PSC approvals; the cost and efficiency of construction labor, equipment, and
materials; and the cost of capital. In addition, there can be no assurance that costs related to
capital expenditures will be fully recovered.

Under Georgia law, Georgia Power is required to file an IRP for approval by the Georgia PSC.
Through the IRP process, the Georgia PSC must pre-certify the construction of new power plants and
new PPAs. See “Rate Matters – Integrated Resource Planning” herein for additional information.

See “Regulation – Environmental Statutes and Regulations” herein for additional information with
respect to certain existing and proposed environmental requirements and PROPERTIES – “Jointly-Owned
Facilities” in Item 2 herein for additional information concerning Alabama Power’s, Georgia
Power’s, and Southern Power’s joint ownership of certain generating units and related facilities
with certain non-affiliated utilities.

Financing Programs

See each of the registrant’s MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
LIQUIDITY in Item 7 herein and Note 6 to the financial statements of each registrant in Item 8
herein for information concerning financing programs.

Fuel Supply

The traditional operating companies’ and SEGCO’s supply of electricity is derived predominantly
from coal. Southern Power’s supply of electricity is primarily fueled by natural gas. See
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – RESULTS OF OPERATION – “Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses”
of Southern Company and each traditional operating company in Item 7 herein for information
regarding the electricity generated and the average cost of fuel in cents per net kilowatt-hour
generated for the years 2006 through 2008.

I-4


The traditional operating companies have agreements in place from which they expect to receive
approximately 100% of their coal burn requirements in 2009. These agreements have terms ranging
between one and seven years. In 2008, the weighted average sulfur content of all coal burned by
the traditional operating companies was 0.74% sulfur. This sulfur level, along with banked and
purchased sulfur dioxide allowances, allowed the traditional operating companies to remain within
limits set by the Phase II acid rain requirements of the Clean Air Act. In 2008, Southern Company
purchased approximately $63.5 million of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emission allowances to
be used in current and future periods. As additional environmental regulations are proposed that
impact the utilization of coal, the traditional operating companies’ fuel mix will be monitored to
ensure that the traditional operating companies remain in compliance with applicable laws and
regulations. Additionally, Southern Company and the traditional operating companies will continue
to evaluate the need to purchase additional emission allowances and the timing of capital
expenditures for emission control equipment. See MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – FUTURE
EARNINGS POTENTIAL – “Environmental Matters” of Southern Company and each traditional operating
company in Item 7 herein for information on the Clean Air Act and global climate issues.

SCS, acting on behalf of the traditional operating companies and Southern Power, has agreements in
place for the natural gas burn requirements of the Southern Company system. For 2009, SCS has
contracted for 220 billion cubic feet of natural gas supply. These agreements cover remaining
terms up to 10 years. In addition to gas supply, SCS has contracts in place for both firm gas
transportation and storage. Management believes that these contracts provide sufficient natural
gas supplies, transportation, and storage to ensure normal operations of the Southern Company
system’s natural gas generating units.

Changes in fuel prices to the traditional operating companies are generally reflected in fuel
adjustment clauses contained in rate schedules. See “Rate Matters – Rate Structure and Cost
Recovery Plans” herein for additional information. Southern Power’s PPAs generally provide that
the counterparty is responsible for substantially all of the cost of fuel.

Alabama Power and Georgia Power have numerous contracts covering a portion of their nuclear fuel
needs for uranium, conversion services, enrichment services, and fuel fabrication. These contracts
have varying expiration dates and most of them are for less than 10 years. Management believes
that sufficient capacity for nuclear fuel supplies and processing exists to preclude the impairment
of normal operations of the Southern Company system’s nuclear generating units.

Alabama Power and Georgia Power have contracts with the United States, acting through the DOE, that
provide for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel. The DOE failed to begin disposing of
spent fuel in 1998, as required by the contracts, and Alabama Power and Georgia Power are pursuing
legal remedies against the government for breach of contract. See Note 3 to the financial
statements of Southern Company, Alabama Power, and Georgia Power under “Nuclear Fuel Disposal
Costs” in Item 8 herein for additional information.

Territory Served by the Traditional Operating Companies and Southern Power

The territory in which the traditional operating companies provide electric service comprises most
of the states of Alabama and Georgia together with the northwestern portion of Florida and
southeastern Mississippi. In this territory there are non-affiliated electric distribution systems
which obtain some or all of their power requirements either directly or indirectly from the
traditional operating companies. The territory has an area of approximately 120,000 square miles
and an estimated population of approximately 13 million. Southern Power sells electricity at
market-based prices in the wholesale market to investor-owned utilities, IPPs, municipalities, and
electric cooperatives.

Alabama Power is engaged, within the State of Alabama, in the generation and purchase of
electricity and the transmission, distribution, and sale of such electricity at retail in over 650
communities (including Anniston, Birmingham, Gadsden, Mobile, Montgomery, and Tuscaloosa) and at
wholesale to 15 municipally-owned electric distribution systems, 11 of which are served indirectly
through sales to AMEA, and two rural distributing cooperative associations. Alabama Power owns
coal reserves near its Plant Gorgas and uses the output of coal from the reserves in its generating
plants. Alabama Power also sells, and cooperates with dealers in promoting the sale of, electric
appliances.

I-5


Georgia Power is engaged in the generation and purchase of electricity and the transmission,
distribution, and sale of such electricity within the State of Georgia at retail in over 600
communities (including Athens, Atlanta, Augusta, Columbus, Macon, Rome, and Savannah), as well as
in rural areas, and at wholesale currently to OPC, MEAG, Dalton, Hampton, and 30 electric
cooperatives.

Gulf Power is engaged, within the northwestern portion of Florida, in the generation and purchase
of electricity and the transmission, distribution, and sale of such electricity at retail in 71
communities (including Pensacola, Panama City, and Fort Walton Beach), as well as in rural areas,
and at wholesale to a non-affiliated utility and a municipality.

Mississippi Power is engaged in the generation and purchase of electricity and the transmission,
distribution, and sale of such energy within 23 counties in southeastern Mississippi, at retail in
123 communities (including Biloxi, Gulfport, Hattiesburg, Laurel, Meridian, and Pascagoula), as
well as in rural areas, and at wholesale to one municipality, six rural electric distribution
cooperative associations, and one generating and transmitting cooperative.

For information relating to kilowatt-hour sales by classification for the traditional operating
companies, see MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – RESULTS OF OPERATIONS of each traditional
operating company in Item 7 herein. Also, for information relating to the sources of revenues for
Southern Company, each traditional operating company, and Southern Power, reference is made to
Item 6 herein.

The RUS has authority to make loans to cooperative associations or corporations to enable them to
provide electric service to customers in rural sections of the country. There are 71 electric
cooperative organizations operating in the territory in which the traditional operating companies
provide electric service at retail or wholesale.

One of these organizations, PowerSouth, is a generating and transmitting cooperative selling power
to several distributing cooperatives, municipal systems, and other customers in south Alabama and
northwest Florida. PowerSouth owns generating units with approximately 1,776 megawatts of
nameplate capacity, including an undivided 8.16% ownership interest in Alabama Power’s Plant Miller
Units 1 and 2. PowerSouth’s facilities were financed with RUS loans secured by long-term contracts
requiring distributing cooperatives to take their requirements from PowerSouth to the extent such
energy is available.

Alabama Power and Gulf Power have entered into separate agreements with PowerSouth involving
interconnection between their respective systems. The delivery of capacity and energy from
PowerSouth to certain distributing cooperatives in the service areas of Alabama Power and Gulf
Power is governed by the Southern Company/PowerSouth Network Transmission Service Agreement. The
rates for this service to PowerSouth are on file with the FERC. See PROPERTIES – “Jointly-Owned
Facilities” in Item 2 herein for details of Alabama Power’s joint-ownership with PowerSouth of a
portion of Plant Miller.

Four electric cooperative associations, financed by the RUS, operate within Gulf Power’s service
area. These cooperatives purchase their full requirements from PowerSouth and SEPA (a federal
power marketing agency). A non-affiliated utility also operates within Gulf Power’s service area
and purchases its full requirements from Gulf Power.

Mississippi Power has an interchange agreement with SMEPA, a generating and transmitting
cooperative, pursuant to which various services are provided, including the furnishing of
protective capacity by Mississippi Power to SMEPA.

There are also 65 municipally-owned electric distribution systems operating in the territory in
which the traditional operating companies provide electric service at retail or wholesale.

Forty-eight municipally-owned electric distribution systems and one county-owned system receive
their requirements through MEAG, which was established by a Georgia state statute in 1975. MEAG
serves these requirements from self-owned generation facilities, some of which are acquired and
jointly-owned with Georgia Power, power purchased from Georgia Power, and purchases from other
resources. MEAG also has a pseudo scheduling and services agreement with

I-6


Georgia Power. Dalton serves its requirements from self-owned generation facilities, some of which
are acquired and jointly-owned with Georgia Power, and through purchases from Georgia Power
pursuant to their partial requirements tariff. In addition, Georgia Power serves the full
requirements of Hampton’s electric distribution system under a market-based contract. See
PROPERTIES – “Jointly-Owned Facilities” in Item 2 herein for additional information.

Georgia Power has entered into substantially similar agreements with Georgia Transmission
Corporation (formerly OPC’s transmission division), MEAG, and Dalton providing for the
establishment of an integrated transmission system to carry the power and energy of all parties.
The agreements require an investment by each party in the integrated transmission system in
proportion to its respective share of the aggregate system load. See PROPERTIES – “Jointly-Owned
Facilities” in Item 2 herein for additional information.

Southern Power has PPAs with some of the traditional operating companies and with other investor
owned utilities, IPPs, municipalities, and electric cooperatives. See MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS – FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – “Power Sales Agreements” of Southern Power in Item 7 herein
for additional information concerning Southern Power’s PPAs.

SCS, acting on behalf of the traditional operating companies, also has a contract with SEPA
providing for the use of the traditional operating companies’ facilities at government expense to
deliver to certain cooperatives and municipalities, entitled by federal statute to preference in
the purchase of power from SEPA, quantities of power equivalent to the amounts of power allocated
to them by SEPA from certain United States government hydroelectric projects.

The retail service rights of all electric suppliers in the State of Georgia are regulated by the
Territorial Electric Service Act of 1973. Pursuant to the provisions of this Act, all areas within
existing municipal limits were assigned to the primary electric supplier therein. Areas outside of
such municipal limits were either to be assigned or to be declared open for customer choice of
supplier by action of the Georgia PSC pursuant to standards set forth in this Act. Consistent with
such standards, the Georgia PSC has assigned substantially all of the land area in the state to a
supplier. Notwithstanding such assignments, this Act provides that any new customer locating
outside of 1973 municipal limits and having a connected load of at least 900 kilowatts may exercise
a one-time choice for the life of the premises to receive electric service from the supplier of its
choice. See “Competition” herein for additional information.

Pursuant to the 1956 Utility Act, the Mississippi PSC issued “Grandfather Certificates” of public
convenience and necessity to Mississippi Power and to six distribution rural cooperatives operating
in southeastern Mississippi, then served in whole or in part by Mississippi Power, authorizing them
to distribute electricity in certain specified geographically described areas of the state. The
six cooperatives serve approximately 325,000 retail customers in a certificated area of
approximately 10,300 square miles. In areas included in a “Grandfather Certificate,” the utility
holding such certificate may, without further certification, extend its lines up to five miles;
other extensions within that area by such utility, or by other utilities, may not be made except
upon a showing of, and a grant of a certificate of, public convenience and necessity. Areas
included in such a certificate which are subsequently annexed to municipalities may continue to be
served by the holder of the certificate, irrespective of whether it has a franchise in the annexing
municipality. On the other hand, the holder of the municipal franchise may not extend service into
such newly annexed area without authorization by the Mississippi PSC.

Competition

The electric utility industry in the United States is continuing to evolve as a result of
regulatory and competitive factors. Among the early primary agents of change was the Energy Act of
1992 which allowed IPPs to access a utility’s transmission network in order to sell electricity to
other utilities.

The competition for retail energy sales among competing suppliers of energy is influenced by
various factors, including price, availability, technological advancements, service, and
reliability. These factors are, in turn, affected by, among other influences, regulatory,
political, and environmental considerations, taxation, and supply.

Generally, the traditional operating companies have experienced, and expect to continue to
experience, competition in their respective retail service territories in varying degrees as the
result of self-generation (as described above) by

I-7


customers and other factors. See also “Territory Served by the Traditional Operating Companies and
Southern Power” herein for additional information concerning suppliers of electricity operating
within or near the areas served at retail by the traditional operating companies.

Southern Power competes with investor owned utilities, IPPs, and others for wholesale energy sales
primarily in the Southeastern United States wholesale market. The needs of this market are driven
by the demands of end users in the Southeast and the generation available. Southern Power’s
success in wholesale energy sales is influenced by various factors including reliability and
availability of Southern Power’s plants, availability of transmission to serve the demand, price,
and Southern Power’s ability to contain costs.

Alabama Power currently has cogeneration contracts in effect with nine industrial customers. Under
the terms of these contracts, Alabama Power purchases excess generation of such companies. During
2008, Alabama Power purchased approximately 114 million kilowatt-hours from such companies at a
cost of $5.6 million.

Georgia Power currently has contracts in effect with eight small power producers whereby Georgia
Power purchases their excess generation. During 2008, Georgia Power purchased 7.2 million
kilowatt-hours from such companies at a cost of $1.0 million. Georgia Power has PPAs for
electricity with two cogeneration facilities. Payments are subject to reductions for failure to
meet minimum capacity output. During 2008, Georgia Power purchased
222.9 million kilowatt-hours at a cost of $67.9 million from these facilities.

Also during 2008, Georgia Power purchased energy from seven customer-owned generating facilities.
Six of the seven customers provide only energy to Georgia Power. These six customers make no
capacity commitment and are not dispatched by Georgia Power. Georgia Power does have a contract
with the remaining customer for eight megawatts of dispatchable capacity and energy. During 2008,
Georgia Power purchased a total of 59.1 million kilowatt-hours from the seven customers at a cost
of approximately $3.0 million.

Gulf Power currently has agreements in effect with various industrial, commercial, and qualifying
facilities pursuant to which Gulf Power purchases “as available” energy from customer-owned
generation. During 2008, Gulf Power purchased 41.1 million kilowatt-hours from such companies for
approximately $2.7 million.

Mississippi Power currently has a cogeneration agreement in effect with one of its industrial
customers. Under the terms of this contract, Mississippi Power purchases any excess generation.
During 2008, this customer had no excess generation.

Seasonality

The demand for electric power generation is affected by seasonal differences in the weather. At
the traditional operating companies and Southern Power, the demand for power peaks during the
summer months, with market prices reflecting the demand of power and available generating resources
at that time. Power demand peaks can also be recorded during the winter. As a result, the overall
operating results of Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power in
the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. In addition, Southern Company, the
traditional operating companies, and Southern Power have historically sold less power when weather
conditions are milder.

Regulation

State Commissions

The traditional operating companies are subject to the jurisdiction of their respective state PSCs.
The PSCs have broad powers of supervision and regulation over public utilities operating in the
respective states, including their rates, service regulations, sales of securities (except for the
Mississippi PSC), and, in the cases of the Georgia PSC and the Mississippi PSC, in part, retail
service territories. See “Territory Served by the Traditional Operating Companies and Southern
Power” and “Rate Matters” herein for additional information.

I-8


Federal Power Act

The traditional operating companies, Southern Power and its generation subsidiaries, and SEGCO are
all public utilities engaged in wholesale sales of energy in interstate commerce and therefore are
subject to the rate, financial, and accounting jurisdiction of the FERC under the Federal Power
Act. The FERC must approve certain financings and allows an “at cost standard” for services
rendered by system service companies such as SCS. The FERC is also authorized to establish
regional reliability organizations which are authorized to enforce reliability standards, to
address impediments to the construction of transmission, and to prohibit manipulative energy
trading practices.

Alabama Power and Georgia Power are also subject to the provisions of the Federal Power Act or the
earlier Federal Water Power Act applicable to licensees with respect to their hydroelectric
developments. Among the hydroelectric projects subject to licensing by the FERC are 14 existing
Alabama Power generating stations having an aggregate installed capacity of 1,662,400 kilowatts and
18 existing Georgia Power generating stations having an aggregate installed capacity of 1,074,696
kilowatts.

On May 22, 2008, the FERC issued a new 30-year license for the Morgan Falls project, located on the
Chattahoochee River near Atlanta, with an effective start date of March 1, 2009. In 2007, Georgia
Power began the relicensing process for Bartlett’s Ferry which is located on the Chattahoochee
River near Columbus, Georgia. The current Bartlett’s Ferry license expires in 2014 and the
application for a new license is expected to be submitted to the FERC in 2012. In July 2005,
Alabama Power filed two applications with the FERC for new 50-year licenses for its seven
hydroelectric developments on the Coosa River (Weiss, Henry, Logan Martin, Lay, Mitchell, Jordan,
and Bouldin) and for the Lewis Smith and Bankhead developments on the Warrior River. The FERC
licenses for all of these nine developments expired in July and August 2007. The FERC issued an
annual license for the Coosa developments in August 2007 and issued an annual license for the
Warrior developments in September 2007. Both of these licenses were automatically renewed in 2008
pursuant to FERC regulations. These annual licenses provide the FERC with additional time to
complete its review of the license applications. In 2006, Alabama Power initiated the process of
developing an application to relicense the Martin hydroelectric project located on the Tallapoosa
River. The current Martin license will expire in 2013 and the application for a new license is
expected to be filed with the FERC in 2011. See MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – FUTURE
EARNINGS POTENTIAL – “FERC Matters – Hydro Relicensing” of Alabama Power in Item 7 herein for
additional information.

Georgia Power and OPC also have a license, expiring in 2027, for the Rocky Mountain Plant, a pure
pumped storage facility of 847,800 kilowatt capacity. See PROPERTIES – “Jointly-Owned Facilities”
in Item 2 herein for additional information.

Licenses for all projects, excluding those discussed above, expire in the period 2015-2034 in the
case of Alabama Power’s projects and in the period 2014-2039 in the case of Georgia Power’s
projects.

Upon or after the expiration of each license, the United States Government, by act of Congress, may
take over the project or the FERC may relicense the project either to the original licensee or to a
new licensee. In the event of takeover or relicensing to another, the original licensee is to be
compensated in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Power Act, such compensation to
reflect the net investment of the licensee in the project, not in excess of the fair value of the
property, plus reasonable damages to other property of the licensee resulting from the severance
therefrom of the property. If the FERC does not act on the new license application prior to the
expiration of the existing license, the FERC is required to issue annual licenses, under the same
terms and conditions of the existing license, until a new license is issued.

Nuclear Regulation

Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Southern Nuclear are subject to regulation by the NRC. The NRC
is responsible for licensing and regulating nuclear facilities and materials and for conducting
research in support of the licensing and regulatory process, as mandated by the Atomic Energy Act
of 1954, as amended; the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended; and the Nuclear
Nonproliferation Act of 1978; and in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969,
as amended, and other applicable statutes. These responsibilities also include protecting public
health and safety, protecting the environment, protecting and safeguarding nuclear

I-9


materials and nuclear power plants in the interest of national security, and assuring conformity
with antitrust laws.

The NRC operating licenses for Plant Vogtle units 1 and 2 currently expire in January 2027 and
February 2029, respectively. In January 2002, the NRC granted Georgia Power a 20-year extension of
the licenses for both units at Plant Hatch which permits the operation of units 1 and 2 until 2034
and 2038, respectively. Georgia Power filed an application with the NRC in June 2007 to extend the
licenses for Plant Vogtle units 1 and 2 for an additional 20 years. Georgia Power anticipates the
NRC may make a decision regarding the license extension for Plant Vogtle in 2009. In May 2005, the
NRC granted Alabama Power a 20-year extension of the licenses for both units at Plant Farley which
permits operation of units 1 and 2 until 2037 and 2041, respectively.

In August 2006, Southern Nuclear, on behalf of Georgia Power, OPC, MEAG, and Dalton (collectively,
Owners), filed an application with the NRC for an early site permit approving two additional
nuclear units on the site of Plant Vogtle. See Note 4 to the financial statements of Southern
Company and Georgia Power in Item 8 herein for additional information on these co-owners. On March
31, 2008, Southern Nuclear filed an application with the NRC for a combined construction and
operating license for the new units.

On April 8, 2008, Georgia Power, acting for itself and as agent for the Owners, and a consortium
consisting of Westinghouse and Stone & Webster (collectively, Consortium) entered into an
engineering, procurement, and
construction agreement to design, engineer, procure, construct, and test two AP1000 nuclear units
with electric generating capacity of approximately 1,100 megawatts each and related facilities,
structures, and improvements at Plant Vogtle. See MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – FUTURE
EARNINGS POTENTIAL – “Construction Projects” of Southern Company and MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS – FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – “Nuclear — Construction” of Georgia Power in Item 7 herein
and Note 3 to the financial statements of Southern Company and Georgia Power under “Nuclear” and
“Nuclear Construction,” respectively in Item 8 herein for additional information.

See Notes 1 and 9 to the financial statements of Southern Company, Alabama Power, and Georgia Power
in Item 8 herein for information on nuclear decommissioning costs and nuclear insurance.

FERC Matters

See MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – “FERC Matters” of each of
the registrants in Item 7 herein for information on matters regarding the FERC.

Environmental Statutes and Regulations

Southern Company’s operations are subject to extensive regulation by state and federal
environmental agencies under a variety of statutes and regulations governing environmental media,
including air, water, and land resources. Compliance with these existing environmental
requirements involves significant capital and operating costs, a major portion of which is expected
to be recovered through existing ratemaking provisions. There is no assurance, however, that all
such costs will be recovered.

Compliance with the federal Clean Air Act and resulting regulations has been, and will continue to
be, a significant focus for Southern Company, each traditional operating company, Southern Power,
and SEGCO. In addition, existing environmental laws and regulations may be changed or new laws and
regulations may be adopted or otherwise become applicable to Southern Company, the traditional
operating companies, Southern Power, or SEGCO, including laws and regulations designed to address
global climate change, air quality, water quality, or other environmental, public health, and
welfare concerns. See MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL –
“Environmental Matters” of Southern Company and each of the traditional
operating companies in Item 7 herein for additional information about the Clean Air Act and other
environmental issues, including the litigation brought by the EPA under the New Source Review
provisions of the Clean Air Act and possible climate change legislation and regulation. Also see
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – “Environmental Matters” of Southern Power in Item 7 herein for information about the environmental issues
and possible climate change legislation and regulation.

I-10


Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, Southern Power, and SEGCO are unable to
predict at this time what additional steps they may be required to take as a result of the
implementation of existing or future requirements pertaining to climate change, air quality, water
quality, and management of waste materials and combustion byproducts, including coal ash, but such
steps could adversely affect system operations and result in substantial additional costs.

The outcome of the matters mentioned above under “Regulation” cannot now be determined, except that
these developments may result in delays in obtaining appropriate licenses for generating
facilities, increased construction and operating costs, or reduced generation, the nature and
extent of which, while not determinable at this time, could be substantial.

Rate Matters

Rate Structure and Cost Recovery Plans

The rates and service regulations of the traditional operating companies are uniform for each class
of service throughout their respective service areas. Rates for residential electric service are
generally of the block type based upon kilowatt-hours used and include minimum charges.
Residential and other rates contain separate customer charges. Rates for commercial service are
presently of the block type and, for large customers, the billing demand is generally used to
determine capacity and minimum bill charges. These large customers’ rates are generally based upon
usage by the customer and include rates with special features to encourage off-peak usage.
Additionally, Alabama Power, Gulf Power, and Mississippi Power are generally allowed by their
respective state PSCs to negotiate the terms and cost of service to large customers. Such terms
and cost of service, however, are subject to final state PSC approval.

Fuel and net purchased energy costs are recovered through specific fuel cost recovery provisions at
the traditional operating companies. These fuel cost recovery provisions are adjusted to reflect
increases or decreases in such costs as needed. Gulf Power’s and Mississippi Power’s fuel cost
recovery provisions are adjusted annually to reflect increases or decreases in such costs. Georgia
Power expects to file for an adjustment to its fuel cost recovery rate on March 13, 2009. Alabama
Power’s fuel clause is adjusted as required. Revenues are adjusted for differences between
recoverable costs and amounts actually recovered in current rates.

Approved environmental compliance and storm damage costs are recovered at Alabama Power, Gulf
Power, and Mississippi Power through cost recovery provisions approved by their respective state
PSCs. Within limits approved by their respective PSCs, these rates are adjusted to reflect
increases or decreases in such costs as required.

Georgia Power’s environmental compliance costs were recovered in base rates through 2007. Under
the 2007 retail rate plan, an environmental compliance cost recovery tariff was implemented
effective January 1, 2008 to allow for recovery of most of the costs related to environmental
controls scheduled for completion between 2008 and 2010 that are mandated by state and federal
regulation. Georgia Power has also requested that the Georgia PSC certify the construction of
environmental controls for Plants Branch and Hammond. Georgia Power also continues to recover
storm damage and new plant costs through its base rates. See MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS – FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – “Construction Projects — Nuclear” of Southern Company and
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – “Nuclear — Construction” of
Georgia Power in Item 7 herein for information regarding legislation currently being considered in
the State of Georgia to allow recovery of financing costs for nuclear construction projects during
the construction period.

Alabama Power recovers the cost of certificated new plant and purchased power capacity and Gulf
Power recovers purchased power capacity and conservation costs through cost recovery provisions
which are adjusted as required to reflect increases or decreases in such costs as needed. Revenues
are adjusted for differences between recoverable costs and amounts actually recovered in current
rates.

See MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – “PSC Matters” of Southern
Company and each of the traditional operating companies in Item 7 herein and Note 3 to the
financial statements of Southern Company under “Alabama Power Retail Regulatory Matters” and
“Georgia Power Retail

Regulatory Matters” and Note 3 to the financial statements of each of the traditional operating
companies under “Retail Regulatory Matters” in Item 8 herein for a discussion of rate matters.
Also, see Note 1 to the financial statements of Southern Company and each of the traditional
operating companies in Item 8 herein for a discussion of recovery of fuel costs, storm damage
costs, and environmental compliance costs through rates.

The traditional operating companies and Southern Power are authorized by the FERC to sell power to
non-affiliates, including short-term opportunity sales, at market-based prices. Specific FERC
approval must be obtained with respect to a market-based contract with an affiliate. See
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – “FERC Matters – Market-Based
Rate Authority” of each registrant in Item 7 herein and Note 3 to the financial statements of each
registrant under “FERC Matters – Market-Based Rate Authority” in Item 8 herein for a discussion of
rate matters.

Integrated Resource Planning

Triennially, Georgia Power must file an IRP with the Georgia PSC that specifies how it intends to
meet the future electrical needs of its customers through a combination of demand-side and
supply-side resources. The Georgia PSC under state law will certify any new demand-side or
supply-side resources. Once certified, the lesser of actual or certified construction costs and
purchased power costs will be recoverable through rates.

In July 2007, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power’s 2007 IRP including the following provisions:
(1) retiring the coal units at Plant McDonough and replacing them with combined-cycle natural gas
units; (2) approving new energy efficiency pilot programs and rate recovery of demand-side
management programs; (3) approving pursuit of up to three new renewable generation projects with a
Georgia Power ownership interest; and (4) establishing new nuclear units as a preferred option to
meet demand in the 2015/2016 timeframe (2007 IRP Order).

On August 1, 2008, Georgia Power filed with the Georgia PSC an application for the certification of
Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and the 2008 IRP update (Updated IRP). The application requested that
the Georgia PSC take the following actions: (1) certify the proposed Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4;
(2) approve the Updated IRP; (3) allow construction work in progress in rate base for Plant Vogtle
Units 3 and 4; (4) institute quarterly construction monitoring and treatment of indexed costs; (5)
approve Georgia Power’s recommendation to install emissions controls at Plants Branch and Yates;
and (6) approve the deferral for later cost recovery of the significant expenses incurred in
developing and evaluating coal-fired generation, as required by the 2007 IRP Order. The Georgia
PSC is scheduled to render a decision in March 2009.

Georgia Power also filed with the Georgia PSC an application for certification to convert the
coal-fired unit at Plant Mitchell to a renewable wood biomass facility which would begin service in
June 2012. The Georgia PSC is scheduled to render a decision in March 2009. If certified,
construction on this conversion is expected to begin in the spring of 2011.

See MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – “Construction Projects -
Nuclear” of Southern Company and MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL –
“Nuclear — Construction” of Georgia Power in Item 7 herein for additional information regarding the
proposed Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.

Mississippi Base Load Construction Legislation

In the 2008 regular session of the Mississippi legislature, a bill was passed and signed by the
Governor on May 9, 2008 to enhance the Mississippi PSC’s authority to facilitate development and
construction of base load generation in the State of Mississippi (Baseload Act). The Baseload
Act authorizes, but does not require, the Mississippi PSC to adopt a cost recovery mechanism
that includes in retail base rates, prior to and during construction, all or a portion of the
prudently incurred pre-construction and construction costs incurred by a utility in constructing
a base load electric generating plant. Prior to the passage of the Baseload Act, such costs
would traditionally be recovered only after the plant was placed in service. The Baseload Act
also provides for periodic prudence reviews by the Mississippi PSC and prohibits the
cancellation of any such generating plant without the approval of the Mississippi PSC. In the
event of cancellation of the construction of the plant without approval of the Mississippi PSC,
the Baseload Act authorizes the Mississippi PSC to make a public interest

I-12


determination as to whether and to what extent the utility will be afforded rate recovery for
costs incurred in connection with such cancelled generating plant. The effect of this
legislation on Southern Company and Mississippi Power cannot now be determined.

On January 16, 2009, Mississippi Power filed for a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity
with the Mississippi PSC to allow construction of a new electric generating plant located in Kemper
County, Mississippi. As part of its filing, Mississippi Power has requested certain rate recovery
treatment in accordance with the base load construction legislation. See MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS – FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – “Construction Projects – Integrated Coal Gasification
Combined Cycle” and “Integrated Coal Gasification Combined
Cycle” of Southern Company and Mississippi Power,
respectively, in Item 7 herein for additional
information.

Item 1A. RISK FACTORS

In addition to the other information in this Form 10-K, including MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS – FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL in Item 7 of each registrant, and other documents filed by
Southern Company and/or its subsidiaries with the SEC from time to time, the following factors
should be carefully considered in evaluating Southern Company and its subsidiaries. Such factors
could affect actual results and cause results to differ materially from those expressed in any
forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, Southern Company and/or its subsidiaries.

Risks Related to the Energy Industry

Southern Company and its subsidiaries are subject to substantial governmental regulation.
Compliance with current and future regulatory requirements and procurement of necessary approvals,
permits, and certificates may result in substantial costs to Southern Company and its subsidiaries.

Southern Company and its subsidiaries, including the traditional operating companies and Southern
Power, are subject to substantial regulation from federal, state, and local regulatory agencies.
Southern Company and its subsidiaries are required to comply with numerous laws and regulations and
to obtain numerous permits, approvals, and certificates from the governmental agencies that
regulate various aspects of their businesses, including customer rates, service regulations, retail
service territories, sales of securities, asset acquisitions and sales, accounting policies and
practices, and the operation of fossil-fuel, hydroelectric, and nuclear generating facilities. For
example, the rates charged to wholesale customers by the traditional operating companies and by
Southern Power must be approved by the FERC and failure to maintain FERC market-based rate
authority may impact the rates charged to wholesale customers. Additionally, the respective state
PSCs must approve the traditional operating companies’ rates for retail customers. While the
retail rates approved by the respective state PSCs are designed to provide for recovery of costs
and a return on invested capital, there can be no assurance that a state PSC will not deem certain
costs to be imprudently incurred and not subject to recovery.

Southern Company and its subsidiaries believe the necessary permits, approvals, and certificates
have been obtained for their respective existing operations and that their respective businesses
are conducted in accordance with applicable laws; however, the impact of any future revision or
changes in interpretations of existing regulations or the adoption of new laws and regulations
applicable to Southern Company or any of its subsidiaries cannot now be predicted. Changes in
regulation or the imposition of additional regulations could influence the operating environment of
Southern Company and its subsidiaries and may result in substantial costs.

Risks Related to Environmental and Climate Change Legislation and Regulation

Southern Company’s and the traditional operating companies’ costs of compliance with environmental
laws are significant. The costs of compliance with future environmental laws, including laws and
regulations designed to address global climate change and renewable energy standards, and the
incurrence of environmental liabilities could affect unit retirement decisions and negatively
impact the net income, cash flows, and financial condition of Southern Company, the traditional
operating companies, or Southern Power.

Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power are subject to extensive
federal, state, and local environmental requirements which, among other things, regulate air
emissions, water usage and discharges, and the management of hazardous and solid waste in order to
adequately protect the environment. Compliance with these legal requirements requires Southern
Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power to commit significant expenditures
for installation of pollution control equipment, environmental monitoring, emissions fees, and
permits at all of their respective facilities. These expenditures are significant and Southern
Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power expect that they will increase in
the future. Through 2008, Southern Company had invested approximately $6.3 billion in capital
projects to comply with these requirements, with annual totals of $1.6 billion, $1.5 billion, and
$661 million for 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. Southern Company expects that capital
expenditures to assure compliance with existing and new statutes and regulations will be an
additional $1.4 billion, $737 million, and $871 million for 2009, 2010, and 2011, respectively.
Because Southern Company’s compliance strategy is impacted by changes to existing environmental

I-15


laws, statutes, and regulations, the cost, availability, and existing inventory of emission
allowances, and Southern Company’s fuel mix, the ultimate outcome cannot be determined at this
time.

If Southern Company, any traditional operating company, or Southern Power fails to comply with
environmental laws and regulations, even if caused by factors beyond its control, that failure may
result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and fines. The EPA has filed civil actions
against Alabama Power and Georgia Power alleging violations of the new source review provisions of
the Clean Air Act. Southern Company is a party to suits alleging emissions of carbon dioxide, a
greenhouse gas, contribute to global warming. An adverse outcome in any of these cases could
require substantial capital expenditures that cannot be determined at this time and could possibly
require payment of substantial penalties. Such expenditures could affect unit retirement and
replacement decisions, and results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition if such costs
are not recovered through regulated rates.

Litigation over environmental issues and claims of various types, including property damage,
personal injury, common law nuisance, and citizen enforcement of environmental requirements, such
as opacity and air and water quality standards, has increased generally throughout the United
States. In particular, personal injury claims for damages caused by alleged exposure to hazardous
materials have become more frequent.

Existing environmental laws and regulations may be revised or new laws and regulations related to
global climate change, air quality, combustion byproducts, including coal ash, or other
environmental and health concerns may be adopted or become applicable to Southern Company, the
traditional operating companies, and Southern Power. For example, federal legislative proposals
that would impose mandatory requirements on greenhouse gas emissions and renewable energy standards
continue to be strongly considered in Congress, and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions has
been identified as a high priority by the current Administration. In addition, some states,
including Florida, are considering or have undertaken actions to regulate and reduce greenhouse gas
emissions. In 2007, the U. S. Supreme Court ruled that the EPA has authority to regulate
greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles. The EPA is currently developing its response to
this decision. Regulatory decisions that will follow from this response may have implications for
both new and existing stationary sources, such as power plants.

New or revised laws and regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, such
as those related to climate change, could affect unit retirement and replacement decisions and/or
result in significant additional expense and operating restrictions on the facilities of the
traditional operating companies or Southern Power or increased compliance costs which may not be
fully recoverable from customers and would therefore reduce the net income of Southern Company, the
traditional operating companies, or Southern Power. The cost impact of such legislation,
regulation, or new interpretations would depend upon the specific requirements enacted and cannot
be determined at this time.

General Risks Related to Operation of Southern Company’s Utility Subsidiaries

The regional power market in which Southern Company and its utility subsidiaries compete may have
changing transmission regulatory structures, which could affect the ownership of these assets and
related revenues and expenses.

The traditional operating companies currently own and operate transmission facilities as part of a
vertically integrated utility. Transmission revenues are not separated from generation and
distribution revenues in their approved retail rates. Current FERC efforts that may potentially
change the regulatory and/or operational structure of transmission include rules related to the
standardization of generation interconnection, as well as an inquiry into, among other things,
market power by vertically integrated utilities. The financial condition, net income, and cash
flows of Southern Company and its utility subsidiaries could be adversely affected by future
changes in the federal regulatory or operational structure of transmission.

Deregulation or restructuring in the electric industry may result in increased competition and
unrecovered costs which could negatively impact the net income of Southern Company and the
traditional operating companies and the value of their respective assets.

Increased competition resulting from restructuring efforts could have a significant adverse
financial impact on Southern Company and the traditional operating companies. Any adoption in the
territories served by the traditional

I-16


operating companies of retail competition and the unbundling of regulated energy service could have
a significant adverse financial impact on Southern Company and the traditional operating companies
due to an impairment of assets, a loss of retail customers, lower profit margins, an inability to
recover reasonable costs, or increased costs of capital. Southern Company and the traditional
operating companies cannot predict if or when they may be subject to changes in legislation or
regulation, nor can Southern Company and the traditional operating companies predict the impact of
these changes.

Additionally, the electric utility industry has experienced a substantial increase in competition
at the wholesale level. As a result of changes in federal law and regulatory policy, competition
in the wholesale electricity market has greatly increased due to a greater participation by
traditional electricity suppliers, non-utility generators, IPPs, wholesale power marketers, and
brokers and due to the trading of energy futures contracts on various commodities exchanges. In
addition, FERC rules on transmission service are designed to facilitate competition in the
wholesale market on a nationwide basis by providing greater flexibility and more choices to
wholesale power customers.

Changes to the criteria used by the FERC for approval of market-based rate authority may negatively
impact the traditional operating companies’ and Southern Power’s ability to charge market-based
rates which could negatively impact the net income and cash flow of Southern Company, the
traditional operating companies, and Southern Power.

Each of the traditional operating companies and Southern Power have authorization from the FERC to
sell power to nonaffiliates, including short-term opportunity sales, at market-based prices.
Specific FERC approval must be obtained with respect to a market-based sale to an affiliate.

In 2004, the FERC initiated a proceeding to assess Southern Company’s generation dominance within
its retail service territory. The ability to charge market-based rates in other markets is not an
issue in the proceeding. Any new market-based rate sales by any subsidiary of Southern Company in
Southern Company’s retail service territory entered into during a 15-month refund period that ended
in May 2006 could be subject to refund to a cost-based rate level.

In November 2007, the presiding administrative law judge issued an initial decision regarding the
methodology to be used in the generation dominance tests. The proceedings are ongoing. The
ultimate outcome of this generation dominance proceeding cannot now be determined, but an adverse
decision by the FERC in a final order could require the traditional operating companies and
Southern Power to charge cost-based rates for certain wholesale sales in the Southern Company
retail service territory, which may be lower than negotiated market-based rates, and could also
result in total refunds of up to $19.7 million, plus interest. Southern Company and its
subsidiaries believe that there is no meritorious basis for an adverse decision in this proceeding
and are vigorously defending themselves in this matter.

In June 2007, the FERC issued its final rule in Order No. 697 regarding market-based rate
authority. The FERC generally retained its current market-based rate standards. Responding to a
number of requests for rehearing, the FERC issued Order No. 697-A on April 21, 2008 and Order No.
697-B on December 12, 2008. These orders largely affirmed the FERC’s prior revision and
codification of the regulations governing market-based rates for public utilities. In accordance
with the orders, Southern Company submitted to the FERC an updated market power analysis on
September 2, 2008 related to its continued market-based rate authority. The ultimate outcome of
this matter cannot now be determined.

On October 17, 2008, Southern Company filed with the FERC a revised market-based rate (MBR) tariff
and a new cost-based rate (CBR) tariff.   The revised MBR tariff provides for a “must offer” energy
auction whereby Southern Company offers all of its available energy for sale in a day-ahead auction
and an hour-ahead auction with reserve prices not to exceed the CBR tariff price, after considering
Southern Company’s native load requirements, reliability obligations, and sales commitments to
third parties. All sales under the energy auction would be at market clearing prices established
under the auction rules. The new CBR tariff provides for a cost-based price for wholesale sales of
less than a year. On December 18, 2008, the FERC issued an order conditionally accepting the MBR
tariff subject to certain revisions to the auction proposal. On January 21, 2009, Southern Company
made a compliance filing that accepted all the conditions of the MBR tariff order. When this order
becomes final, Southern Company will have 30 days to implement the wholesale auction. On December
31, 2008, the FERC issued an order conditionally accepting

I-17


the CBR tariff subject to providing additional information. On January 30, 2009, Southern Company
filed a response addressing the FERC inquiry to the CBR tariff order. Implementation of the energy
auction in accordance with the MBR tariff order is expected to adequately mitigate going forward
any presumption of market power that Southern Company may have in the Southern Company retail
service territory. The timing of when the FERC may issue final orders on the MBR and CBR tariffs
and the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Risks Related to Southern Company and its Business

Southern Company may be unable to meet its ongoing and future financial obligations and to pay
dividends on its common stock if its subsidiaries are unable to pay upstream dividends or repay
funds to Southern Company.

Southern Company is a holding company and, as such, Southern Company has no operations of its own.
Substantially all of Southern Company’s consolidated assets are held by subsidiaries. Southern
Company’s ability to meet its financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock is
primarily dependent on the net income and cash flows of its subsidiaries and their ability to pay
upstream dividends or to repay funds to Southern Company. Prior to funding Southern Company,
Southern Company’s subsidiaries have financial obligations that must be satisfied, including among
others, debt service and preferred and preference stock dividends. Southern Company’s subsidiaries
are separate legal entities and have no obligation to provide Southern Company with funds for its
payment obligations.

The financial performance of Southern Company and its subsidiaries may be adversely affected if
they are unable to successfully operate their facilities or perform certain corporate functions.

The financial performance of Southern Company and its subsidiaries depends on the successful
operation of its subsidiaries’ electric generating, transmission, and distribution facilities.
Operating these facilities involves many risks, including:

A decrease or elimination of revenues from the electric generation, transmission, or distribution
facilities or an increase in the cost of operating the facilities would reduce the net income and
cash flows and could adversely impact the financial condition of the affected traditional operating
company or Southern Power and of Southern Company.

The traditional operating companies could be subject to higher costs and penalties as a result of
mandatory reliability standards.

As a result of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, owners and operators of bulk power transmission
systems, including the traditional operating companies, are subject to mandatory reliability
standards enacted by the North American

I-18


Reliability Corporation and enforced by the FERC. Compliance with the mandatory reliability
standards may subject the traditional operating companies and Southern Company to higher operating
costs and may result in increased capital expenditures. If any traditional operating company is
found to be in noncompliance with the mandatory reliability standards, the traditional operating
company could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties.

The revenues of Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power depend in
part on sales under PPAs. The failure of a counterparty to one of these PPAs to perform its
obligations, or the failure to renew the PPAs, could have a negative impact on the net income and
cash flows of the affected traditional operating company or Southern Power and of Southern Company.

Most of Southern Power’s generating capacity has been sold to purchasers under PPAs. In addition,
the traditional operating companies enter into PPAs with non-affiliated parties. Revenues are
dependent on the continued performance by the purchasers of their obligations under these PPAs.
Even though Southern Power and the traditional operating companies have a rigorous credit
evaluation process, the failure of one of the purchasers to perform its obligations could have a
negative impact on the net income and cash flows of the affected traditional operating company or
Southern Power and of Southern Company. Although these credit evaluations take into account the
possibility of default by a purchaser, actual exposure to a default by a purchaser may be greater
than the credit evaluation predicts. Additionally, neither Southern Power nor any traditional
operating company can predict whether the PPAs will be renewed at the end of their respective terms
or on what terms any renewals may be made. If a PPA is not renewed, a replacement PPA cannot be
assured.

Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power may incur additional
costs or delays in the construction of new plants or other facilities and may not be able to
recover their investment. The facilities of the traditional operating companies and Southern Power
require ongoing capital expenditures.

The businesses of the registrants require substantial capital expenditures for investments in new
facilities and capital improvements to transmission, distribution, and generation facilities,
including those to meet environmental standards. Certain of the traditional operating companies
and Southern Power are in the process of constructing new generating facilities and adding
environmental controls equipment at existing generating facilities. Southern Company intends to
continue its strategy of developing and constructing other new facilities, including proposed new
nuclear generating units and a proposed integrated coal gasification combined cycle facility,
expanding existing facilities, and adding environmental control equipment. These types of projects
are long-term in nature and may involve facility designs that have not been finalized or previously
constructed. The completion of these types of projects without delays or cost overruns is subject
to substantial risks, including:

I-19


•

delays or increased costs to interconnect facilities to transmission grids;

•

unanticipated cost increases, including materials and labor; and

•

attention to other projects.

If a traditional operating company or Southern Power is unable to complete the development or
construction of a facility or decides to delay or cancel construction of a facility, it may not be
able to recover its investment in that facility and may incur substantial cancellation payments
under equipment purchase orders or construction contracts. Even if a construction project is
completed, the total costs may be higher than estimated and there is no assurance that the
traditional operating company will be able to recover such expenditures through regulated rates.
In addition, construction delays and contractor performance shortfalls can result in the loss of
revenues and may, in turn, adversely affect the net income and financial position of a traditional
operating company or Southern Power and of Southern Company. Furthermore, if construction projects
are not completed according to specification, a traditional operating company or Southern Power and
Southern Company may incur liabilities and suffer reduced plant efficiency, higher operating costs,
and reduced net income.

Once facilities come into commercial operation, ongoing capital expenditures are required to
maintain reliable levels of operation. Significant portions of the traditional operating
companies’ existing facilities were constructed many years ago. Older generation equipment, even
if maintained in accordance with good engineering practices, may require significant capital
expenditures to maintain efficiency, to comply with changing environmental requirements, or to
provide reliable operations.

Changes in technology may make Southern Company’s electric generating facilities owned by the
traditional operating companies and Southern Power less competitive.

A key element of the business model of Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and
Southern Power is that generating power at central station power plants achieves economies of scale
and produces power at a competitive cost. There are distributed generation technologies that
produce power, including fuel cells, microturbines, wind turbines, and solar cells. It is possible
that advances in technology will reduce the cost of alternative methods of producing power to a
level that is competitive with that of most central station power electric production. If this were
to happen and if these technologies achieved economies of scale, the market share of Southern
Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power could be eroded, and the value of
their respective electric generating facilities could be reduced. It is also possible that rapid
advances in central station power generation technology could reduce the value of the current
electric generating facilities owned by Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and
Southern Power. Changes in technology could also alter the channels through which electric
customers buy or utilize power, which could reduce the revenues or increase the expenses of
Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, or Southern Power.

Operation of nuclear facilities involves inherent risks, including environmental, health,
regulatory, terrorism, and financial risks, that could result in fines or the closure of Southern
Company’s nuclear units owned by Alabama Power or Georgia Power and which may present potential
exposures in excess of insurance coverage.

Alabama Power owns two nuclear units and Georgia Power holds undivided interests in, and contracts
for operation of, four nuclear units. These six units are operated by Southern Nuclear and
represent approximately 3,680 megawatts, or 8.6%, of Southern Company’s generation capacity as of
December 31, 2008. These nuclear facilities are subject to environmental, health, and financial
risks such as on-site storage of spent nuclear fuel, the ability to dispose of such spent nuclear
fuel, the ability to maintain adequate reserves for decommissioning, potential liabilities arising
out of the operation of these facilities, and the threat of a possible terrorist attack. Alabama
Power and Georgia Power maintain decommissioning trusts and external insurance coverage to minimize
the financial exposure to these risks; however, it is possible that damages could exceed the amount
of insurance coverage.

The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements
for the operation of nuclear generation facilities. In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has
the authority to impose fines

I-20


or shut down any unit, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until
compliance is achieved. NRC orders or regulations related to increased security measures and any
future safety requirements promulgated by the NRC could require Alabama Power and Georgia Power to
make substantial operating and capital expenditures at their nuclear plants. In addition, although
Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Southern Company have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear
incident at their plants, if an incident did occur, it could result in substantial costs to Alabama
Power or Georgia Power and Southern Company. A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in
the world could cause the NRC to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic
nuclear unit.

In addition, potential terrorist threats and increased public scrutiny of utilities could result in
increased nuclear licensing or compliance costs that are difficult or impossible to predict.

The generation operations and energy marketing operations of Southern Company, the traditional
operating companies, and Southern Power are subject to risks, many of which are beyond their
control, including changes in power prices and fuel costs, that may reduce Southern Company’s, the
traditional operating companies’, and Southern Power’s revenues and increase costs.

The generation operations and energy marketing operations of Southern Company, the traditional
operating companies, and Southern Power are subject to changes in power prices or fuel costs, which
could increase the cost of producing power or decrease the amount Southern Company, the traditional
operating companies, and Southern Power receive from the sale of power. The market prices for
these commodities may fluctuate significantly over relatively short periods of time. Southern
Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power attempt to mitigate risks
associated with fluctuating fuel costs by passing these costs on to customers through the
traditional operating companies’ fuel cost recovery clauses or through PPAs. Among the factors
that could influence power prices and fuel costs are:

Certain of these factors could increase the expenses of the traditional operating companies or
Southern Power and

I-21


Southern Company. For the traditional operating companies, such increases may not be fully
recoverable through rates. Other of these factors could reduce the revenues of the traditional
operating companies or Southern Power and Southern Company.

The traditional operating companies have experienced underrecovered fuel cost balances and deficits
in their storm cost recovery reserve balances and may continue to experience such balances in the
future. While the traditional operating companies are generally authorized to recover
underrecovered fuel costs through fuel cost recovery clauses and storm recovery costs through
special rate provisions administered by the respective PSCs, recovery may be denied if costs are
deemed to be imprudently incurred and delays in the authorization of such recovery could negatively
impact the cash flows of the affected traditional operating company and Southern Company.

The use of derivative contracts by Southern Company and its subsidiaries in the normal course of
business could result in financial losses that negatively impact the net income of Southern Company
and its subsidiaries.

Southern Company and its subsidiaries, including the traditional operating companies and Southern
Power, use derivative instruments, such as swaps, options, futures, and forwards, to manage their
commodity and interest rate risks and, to a lesser extent, engage in limited trading activities.
Southern Company and its subsidiaries could recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in
the market values of these contracts or if a counterparty fails to perform. In the absence of
actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the valuation of these
financial instruments can involve management’s judgment or use of estimates. As a result, changes
in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the value of the
reported fair value of these contracts.

The traditional operating companies and Southern Power may not be able to obtain adequate fuel
supplies, which could limit their ability to operate their facilities.

The traditional operating companies and Southern Power purchase fuel, including coal, natural gas,
uranium, and fuel oil, from a number of suppliers. Disruption in the delivery of fuel, including
disruptions as a result of, among other things, transportation delays, weather, labor relations,
force majeure events, or environmental regulations affecting any of these fuel suppliers, could
limit the ability of the traditional operating companies and Southern Power to operate their
respective facilities, and thus reduce the net income of the affected traditional operating company
or Southern Power and Southern Company.

The traditional operating companies are dependent on coal for much of their electric generating
capacity. Each traditional operating company has coal supply contracts in place; however, there
can be no assurance that the counterparties to these agreements will fulfill their obligations to
supply coal to the traditional operating companies. The suppliers under these agreements may
experience financial or technical problems which inhibit their ability to fulfill their obligations
to the traditional operating companies. In addition, the suppliers under these agreements may not
be required to supply coal to the traditional operating companies under certain circumstances, such
as in the event of a natural disaster. If the traditional operating companies are unable to obtain
their coal requirements under these contracts, the traditional operating companies may be required
to purchase their coal requirements at higher prices, which may not be fully recoverable through
rates.

In addition, Southern Power in particular, and the traditional operating companies to a lesser
extent, are dependent on natural gas for a portion of their electric generating capacity. Natural
gas supplies can be subject to disruption in the event production or distribution is curtailed,
such as in the event of a hurricane.

In addition, world market conditions for fuels can impact the availability of natural gas, coal,
and uranium.

Demand for power could exceed supply capacity, resulting in increased costs for purchasing capacity
in the open market or building additional generation capabilities.

Through the traditional operating companies and Southern Power, Southern Company is currently
obligated to supply power to retail customers and wholesale customers under long-term PPAs. At
peak times, the demand for power required to meet this obligation could exceed Southern Company’s
available generation capacity. Market or

I-22


competitive forces may require that the traditional operating companies or Southern Power purchase
capacity on the open market or build additional generation capabilities. Because regulators may
not permit the traditional operating companies to pass all of these purchase or construction costs
on to their customers, the traditional operating companies may not be able to recover any of these
costs or may have exposure to regulatory lag associated with the time between the incurrence of
costs of purchased or constructed capacity and the traditional operating companies’ recovery in
customers’ rates. Under Southern Power’s long-term fixed price PPAs, Southern Power would not have
the ability to recover any of these costs. These situations could have negative impacts on net
income and cash flows for the affected traditional operating company or Southern Power and Southern
Company.

Demand for power could decrease or fail to grow at expected rates, resulting in stagnant or reduced
revenues, limited growth opportunities, and potentially stranded generation assets.

Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power collectively engage in a
long-term planning process to determine the optimal mix and timing of new generation assets
required to serve future load obligations. This planning process must look many years into the
future in order to accommodate the long lead times associated with the permitting and construction
of new generation facilities. Inherent risk exists in predicting demand this far into the future
as these future loads are dependent on many uncertain factors, including regional economic
conditions, customer usage patterns, efficiency programs, and customer technology adoption.
Because regulators may not permit the traditional operating companies to adjust rates to recover
the costs of new generation assets while such assets are being constructed, the traditional
operating companies may not be able to fully recover these costs or may have exposure to regulatory
lag associated with the time between the incurrence of costs of additional capacity and the
traditional operating companies’ recovery in customers’ rates. Under Southern Power’s model of
selling capacity and energy at negotiated market-based rates under long-term PPAs, Southern Power
might not be able to fully execute its business plan if market prices drop below original
forecasts. Southern Power may not be able to extend its existing PPAs or to find new buyers for
existing generation assets as existing PPAs expire, or it may be forced to market these assets at
prices lower than originally intended. These situations could have negative impacts on net income
and cash flows for the affected traditional operating company or Southern Power and Southern
Company.

The operating results of Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power
are affected by weather conditions and may fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis.

Electric power supply is generally a seasonal business. In many parts of the country, demand for
power peaks during the summer months, with market prices also peaking at that time. In other
areas, power demand peaks during the winter. As a result, the overall operating results of
Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power in the future may
fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. In addition, Southern Company, the traditional
operating companies, and Southern Power have historically sold less power when weather conditions
are milder. Unusually mild weather in the future could reduce the revenues, net income, available
cash, and borrowing ability of Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern
Power.

Mirant and The Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of Mirant Corporation have filed a claim
against Southern Company seeking substantial monetary damages in connection with transfers made by
Mirant to Southern Company prior to the Mirant spin-off. An adverse outcome of this litigation
could negatively impact the net income and cash flows of Southern Company.

Mirant was an energy company with businesses that included independent power projects and energy
trading and risk management companies in the U.S. and selected other countries. It was a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Southern Company until its initial public offering in October 2000. In
April 2001, Southern Company completed a spin-off to its shareholders of its remaining ownership,
and Mirant became an independent corporate entity.

In July 2003, Mirant and certain of its affiliates filed for voluntary reorganization under
Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. In January 2006, Mirant’s plan of reorganization became
effective, and Mirant emerged from bankruptcy. As part of the plan, Mirant transferred
substantially all of its assets and its restructured debt to a new corporation that adopted the
name Mirant Corporation (Reorganized Mirant).

I-23


In December 2004, as a result of concluding an IRS audit for the tax years 2000 and 2001, Southern
Company paid approximately $39 million in additional tax and interest related to Mirant tax items
and filed a claim in Mirant’s bankruptcy case for that amount. Through December 2008, Southern
Company received from the IRS approximately $38 million in refunds related to Mirant. Southern
Company believes it has a right to recoup the $39 million tax payment owed by Mirant from such tax
refunds. As a result, Southern Company intends to retain the tax refunds and reduce its claim
against Mirant for the payment of Mirant taxes by the amount of such refunds.  MC Asset Recovery, a
special purpose subsidiary of Reorganized Mirant, has objected to and sought to equitably
subordinate the Southern Company tax claim in its fraudulent transfer litigation against Southern
Company.  Southern Company has reserved the remaining amount with respect to its Mirant tax claim.

If Southern Company is ultimately required to make any additional payments either with respect to
the IRS audit or its contingent obligations under guarantees of Mirant subsidiaries, Mirant’s
indemnification obligation to Southern Company for these additional payments, if allowed, would
constitute unsecured claims against Mirant, entitled to stock in Reorganized Mirant. The final
outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.

In June 2005, Mirant, as a debtor in possession, and The Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors
of Mirant Corporation filed a complaint against Southern Company in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for
the Northern District of Texas, which was amended in July 2005, February 2006, May 2006, and March
2007. In January 2006, MC Asset Recovery was substituted as plaintiff. The fourth amended
complaint (the complaint) alleges that Southern Company caused Mirant to engage in certain
fraudulent transfers and to pay illegal dividends to Southern Company prior to the spin-off. The
complaint also seeks to recharacterize certain advances from Southern Company to Mirant for
investments in energy facilities from debt to equity. The complaint further alleges that Southern
Company is liable to Mirant’s creditors for the full amount of Mirant’s liability under an alter
ego theory of recovery and that Southern Company breached its fiduciary duties to Mirant and its
creditors, caused Mirant to breach its fiduciary duties to creditors, and aided and abetted
breaches of fiduciary duties by Mirant’s directors and officers. The complaint also seeks
recoveries under the theories of restitution and unjust enrichment. In addition, the complaint
alleged a claim under the Federal Debt Collection Procedure Act (FDCPA) to avoid certain transfers
from Mirant to Southern Company; however, on July 7, 2008, the court ruled that the FDCPA does not
apply and that Georgia law should apply instead. The complaint seeks monetary damages in excess of
$2 billion plus interest, punitive damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs. Finally, the complaint
includes an objection to Southern Company’s pending claims against Mirant in the Bankruptcy Court
(which relate to reimbursement under the separation agreements of payments such as income taxes,
interest, legal fees, and other guarantees described in Note 7 to the financial statements of
Southern Company in Item 8 herein) and seeks equitable subordination of Southern Company’s claims
to the claims of all other creditors. Southern Company served an answer to the complaint in April
2007.

In February 2006, the Company’s motion to transfer the case to the U.S. District Court for the
Northern District of Georgia was granted. In May 2006, Southern Company filed a motion for summary
judgment seeking entry of judgment against the plaintiff as to all counts in the complaint. In
December 2006, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia granted in part and
denied in part the motion. As a result, certain breach of fiduciary duty claims alleged in earlier
versions of the complaint were barred; all other claims were allowed to proceed. On August 6,
2008, Southern Company filed a second motion for summary judgment. MC Asset Recovery filed its
response to Southern Company’s motion for summary judgment on October 20, 2008. On February 5,
2009, the court denied Southern Company’s summary judgment motion in connection with the fraudulent
conveyance and illegal dividend claims concerning certain advance return/loan repayments in 1999,
dividends in 1999 and 2000, and transfers in connection with Mirant’s separation from Southern
Company. The court granted the motion with respect to certain claims, including claims for
restitution and unjust enrichment, claims that Southern Company aided and abetted Mirant’s
directors’ breach of fiduciary duties to Mirant, and claims that Southern Company used Mirant as an
alter ego. In addition, the court granted Southern Company’s motion in connection with the
fraudulent transfer and illegal dividend claims concerning certain turbine termination payments.
Southern Company believes there is no meritorious basis for the claims in the complaint and is
vigorously defending itself in this action. See Note 3 to the financial statements of Southern
Company under “Mirant Matters – MC Asset Recovery Litigation” in Item 8 herein. The ultimate
outcome of these matters cannot now be determined at this time.

Risks Related to Market and Economic Volatility

The business of Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power is
dependent on their ability to successfully access funds through capital markets and financial
institutions. The inability of Southern Company, any traditional operating company, or Southern
Power to access funds may limit its ability to execute its business plan by impacting its ability
to fund capital investments or acquisitions that Southern Company, the traditional operating
companies, or Southern Power may otherwise rely on to achieve future earnings and cash flows.

Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power rely on access to both
short-term money markets and longer-term capital markets as a significant source of liquidity for
capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flow from their respective operations. If Southern
Company, any traditional operating company, or Southern Power is not able to access capital at
competitive rates, its ability to implement its business plan will be limited by impacting its
ability to fund capital investments or acquisitions that Southern Company, the traditional
operating companies, or Southern Power may otherwise rely on to achieve future earnings and cash
flows. In addition, Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power rely
on committed bank lending agreements as back-up liquidity which allows them to access low cost
money markets. Each of Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power
believes that it will maintain sufficient access to these financial markets based upon current
credit ratings. However, certain market disruptions or a downgrade of the credit rating of
Southern Company, any traditional operating company, or Southern Power may increase its cost of
borrowing, adversely affect its ability to raise capital through the issuance of securities or
other borrowing arrangements or its ability to secure committed bank lending agreements used as
back-up sources of capital. Such disruptions could include:

Market performance and other changes may decrease the value of benefit plans and decommissioning
trust assets, which then could require significant additional funding.

The performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets held in trust under
Southern Company’s pension and postretirement benefit plans and the assets held in trust to satisfy
obligations to decommission Alabama Power’s and Georgia Power’s nuclear plants. Southern Company,
Alabama Power, and Georgia Power have significant obligations in these areas and hold significant
assets in these trusts. These assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain
returns, which may fall below projected return rates. A decline in the market value of these
assets, as has been experienced in prior periods, may increase the funding requirements relating to
Southern Company’s benefit plan liabilities and Alabama Power’s and Georgia Power’s decommissioning
obligations. Additionally, changes in interest rates affect the liabilities under Southern
Company’s pension and postretirement benefit plans; as interest rates decrease, the liabilities
increase, potentially requiring additional funding. Further, changes in demographics, including
increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions, may also increase the
funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension benefit plans. If Southern Company
is unable to successfully manage benefit plan assets and Alabama Power and Georgia

I-25


Power are unable to successfully manage the decommissioning trust funds, results of operations and
financial position could be negatively affected.

Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power are subject to risks
associated with a changing economic environment, which could impact their ability to obtain
adequate insurance and the financial stability of the customers of the traditional operating
companies and Southern Power.

The financial condition of some insurance companies, the threat of terrorism, and the hurricanes
that affected the Gulf Coast, among other things, have had disruptive effects on the insurance
industry. The availability of insurance covering risks that Southern Company, the traditional
operating companies, Southern Power, and their respective competitors typically insure against may
decrease, and the insurance that Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and
Southern Power are able to obtain may have higher deductibles, higher premiums, and more
restrictive policy terms. Additionally, any economic downturn or disruption of financial markets
could negatively affect the financial stability of the customers and counterparties of the
traditional operating companies and Southern Power. These factors could adversely affect Southern
Company’s subsidiaries’ ability to maintain energy sales, thereby decreasing Southern Company’s
level of future net income.

Certain of the traditional operating companies have substantial investments in the Atlantic or Gulf
Coast regions which can be subject to major storm activity. The ability of the traditional
operating companies to recover costs and replenish reserves in the event of a major storm, other
natural disaster, terrorist attack, or other catastrophic event generally will require regulatory
action.

Each traditional operating company maintains a reserve for property damage to cover the cost of
damages from major storms to its transmission and distribution lines and the cost of uninsured
damages to its generating facilities and other property. In the event a traditional operating
company experiences a natural disaster, terrorist attack, or other catastrophic event, recovery of
costs in excess of reserves and insurance coverage is subject to the approval of its state PSC.
While the traditional operating companies generally are entitled to recover prudently incurred
costs incurred in connection with such an event, any denial by the applicable state PSC or delay in
recovery of any portion of such costs could have a material negative impact on a traditional
operating company’s and Southern Company’s results of operations and/or cash flows.

Mississippi Power owns a 79-mile length of 500-kilovolt transmission line which is leased to
Entergy Gulf States. The line, completed in 1984, extends from Plant Daniel to the Louisiana state
line. Entergy Gulf States is paying a use fee over a 40-year period covering all expenses and the
amortization of the original $57 million cost of the line. At December 31, 2008, the unamortized
portion of this cost was approximately $23 million.

In 2008, the maximum demand on the traditional operating companies, Southern Power, and SEGCO was
37,166,000 kilowatts and occurred on August 6, 2008. The all-time maximum demand of 38,777,000
kilowatts on the traditional operating companies, Southern Power, and SEGCO occurred on August 22,
2007. These amounts exclude demand served by capacity retained by MEAG, OPC, and SEPA. The
reserve margin for the traditional operating companies, Southern Power, and SEGCO in 2008 was
15.3%. See SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA in Item 6 herein for additional information on peak demands.

Alabama Power and Georgia Power have contracted to operate and maintain the respective units in
which each has an interest (other than Rocky Mountain and Intercession City) as agent for the joint
owners. SCS provides operation and maintenance services for Plant Stanton A.

In addition, Georgia Power has commitments regarding a portion of a five percent interest in Plant
Vogtle owned by MEAG that are in effect until the later of retirement of the plant or the latest
stated maturity date of MEAG’s bonds issued to finance such ownership interest. The payments for
capacity are required whether any capacity is available. The energy cost is a function of each
unit’s variable operating costs. Except for the portion of the capacity payments related to the
Georgia PSC’s disallowances of Plant Vogtle costs, the cost of such capacity and energy is included
in purchased power from non-affiliates in Georgia Power’s statements of income in Item 8 herein.

Titles to Property

The traditional operating companies’, Southern Power’s, and SEGCO’s interests in the principal
plants (other than certain pollution control facilities, one small hydroelectric generating station
leased by Georgia Power, combined cycle units at Plant Daniel leased by Mississippi Power, and the
land on which five combustion turbine generators of Mississippi Power are located, which is held by
easement) and other important units of the respective companies are owned in fee by such companies,
subject only to the liens pursuant to pollution control revenue bonds of Alabama Power and Gulf
Power on specific pollution control facilities. See Note 6 to the financial statements of Southern
Company, Alabama Power, and Gulf Power under “Assets Subject to Lien” and Note 7 to the financial
statements of Mississippi Power under “Operating Leases – Plant Daniel Combined Cycle Generating
Units” in Item 8 herein for additional information. The traditional operating companies own the
fee interests in certain of their principal plants as tenants in common. See “Jointly-Owned
Facilities” herein for additional information. Properties such as electric transmission and

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

Southern Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of
internal control over financial reporting as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and as
defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). A control system can provide only reasonable, not
absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.

Under management’s supervision, an evaluation of the design and effectiveness of Southern Company’s
internal control over financial reporting was conducted based on the framework in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that Southern Company’s internal
control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2008.

Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as auditors of Southern
Company’s financial statements, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of Southern
Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008. Deloitte & Touche

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Southern Company

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of
capitalization of Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2008
and 2007, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, common
stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2008.  We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2008, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  The Company’s management is
responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting (page II-9).  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements
and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects.  Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining
an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control based on the assessed risk.  Our audits also included performing such other procedures as
we considered necessary in the circumstances.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the
supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons
performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and
other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles.  A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the
possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to
error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.  Also, projections of any
evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods
are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

II-10


REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM (continued)

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements (pages II-50 to II-104) referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Southern Company and
Subsidiary Companies as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the results of their operations and
their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Also, in our
opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control
— Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

OVERVIEW

Business Activities

The primary business of Southern Company (the Company) is electricity sales in the Southeast
by the traditional operating companies – Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Gulf Power, and Mississippi
Power – and Southern Power. The four traditional operating companies are vertically integrated
utilities providing electric service in four Southeastern states. Southern Power constructs,
acquires, owns, and manages generation assets and sells electricity at market-based rates in the
wholesale market.

Many factors affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of Southern Company’s electricity
business. These factors include the traditional operating companies’ ability to maintain a
constructive regulatory environment, to maintain energy sales in the midst of the current economic
downturn, and to effectively manage and secure timely recovery of rising costs. Each of the
traditional operating companies has various regulatory mechanisms that operate to address cost
recovery. Since 2005, the traditional operating companies have completed a number of regulatory
proceedings that provide for the timely recovery of costs. Appropriately balancing required costs
and capital expenditures with customer prices will continue to challenge the Company for the
foreseeable future.

Another major factor is the profitability of the competitive market-based wholesale generating
business and federal regulatory policy, which may impact Southern Company’s level of participation
in this market. Southern Power continues to execute its strategy through a combination of
acquiring and constructing new power plants and by entering into power purchase agreements (PPAs)
with investor owned utilities, independent power producers, municipalities, and electric
cooperatives. The Company continues to face regulatory challenges related to transmission and
market power issues at the national level.

Southern Company’s other business activities include leveraged lease projects, telecommunications,
and energy-related services. Management continues to evaluate the contribution of each of these
remaining activities to total shareholder return and may pursue acquisitions and dispositions
accordingly.

Key Performance Indicators

In striving to maximize shareholder value while providing cost-effective energy to more than four
million customers, Southern Company continues to focus on several key indicators. These indicators
include customer satisfaction, plant availability, system reliability, and earnings per share
(EPS), excluding charges related to leveraged leases. Southern Company’s financial success is
directly tied to the satisfaction of its customers. Key elements of ensuring customer satisfaction
include outstanding service, high reliability, and competitive prices. Management uses customer
satisfaction surveys and reliability indicators to evaluate the Company’s results.

Peak season equivalent forced outage rate (Peak Season EFOR) is an indicator of fossil/hydro plant
availability and efficient generation fleet operations during the months when generation needs are
greatest. The rate is calculated by dividing the number of hours of forced outages by total
generation hours. The fossil/hydro 2008 Peak Season EFOR of 1.68% was better than the target. The
nuclear generating fleet also uses Peak Season EFOR as an indicator of availability and efficient
generation fleet operations during the peak season. The nuclear 2008 Peak Season EFOR of 1.98% was
slightly better than the target. Transmission and distribution system reliability performance is
measured by the frequency and duration of outages. Performance targets for reliability are set
internally based on historical performance, expected weather conditions, and expected capital
expenditures. The performance for 2008 was better than the target for these reliability measures.

II-12


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

Southern Company’s investments include three leveraged lease transactions whose tax deductions have
been challenged by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Ongoing settlement negotiations with the
IRS resulted in a charge to income of $83 million, or 11 cents per share, in 2008. Southern
Company management uses EPS, excluding leveraged lease charges, to evaluate the performance of
Southern Company’s ongoing business activities. Southern Company believes the presentation of
earnings and EPS excluding the leveraged lease charges is useful for investors because it provides
investors with additional information for purposes of comparing Southern Company’s performance for
such periods. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered a

Earnings

Southern Company’s net income was $1.74 billion in 2008, an increase of $8 million from the prior
year. Compared with the prior year, increases in retail rates and increases in revenues from
market-response rates to large commercial and industrial customers were mostly offset by higher
asset depreciation, milder summer temperatures compared to 2007, higher non-fuel operations and
maintenance expenses, charges related to the leveraged lease business, and exiting the synthetic
fuel business in 2007. Net income was $1.73 billion in 2007 and $1.57 billion in 2006, reflecting
a 10.2% increase and a 1.1% decrease, respectively, over the prior year. Basic EPS was $2.26 in
2008, $2.29 in 2007, and $2.12 in 2006. Diluted EPS, which factors in additional shares related to
stock-based compensation, was $2.25 in 2008, $2.28 in 2007, and $2.10 in 2006.

Dividends

Southern Company has paid dividends on its common stock since 1948. Dividends paid per share of
common stock were $1.6625 in 2008, $1.595 in 2007, and $1.535 in 2006. In January 2009, Southern
Company declared a quarterly dividend of 42 cents per share. This is the 245th consecutive quarter
that Southern Company has paid a dividend equal to or higher than the previous quarter. The
Company targets a dividend payout ratio of approximately 65% to 70% of net income. For 2008, the
actual payout ratio was 73.5% while the payout ratio of net income excluding leveraged lease
charges was 70.1%.

Retail revenues increased $1.4 billion, $838 million, and $636 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006,
respectively. The significant factors driving these changes are shown in the preceding table. The
increase in rates and pricing in 2008 was primarily due to Alabama Power’s increase under its Rate
Stabilization and Equalization Plan (Rate RSE), as ordered by the Alabama Public Service Commission
(PSC), and Georgia Power’s increase under its 2007 retail rate

II-14


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

plan, as ordered by the Georgia PSC. See Note 3 to the financial statements under “Alabama Power
Retail Regulatory Matters” and “Georgia Power Retail Regulatory Matters” for additional
information. Also contributing to the 2008 increase was an increase in revenues from
market-response rates to large commercial and industrial customers at Georgia Power. The 2007
increase in rates and pricing when compared to the prior year was primarily due to Alabama Power’s
increase under its Rate RSE, as ordered by the Alabama PSC. Partially offsetting the 2007 increase
was a decrease in revenues from market-response rates to large commercial and industrial customers
at Georgia Power. The 2006 increase in rates and pricing when compared to the prior year was not
material. See “Energy Sales” below for a discussion of changes in the volume of energy sold,
including changes related to sales growth and weather.

Electric rates for the traditional operating companies include provisions to adjust billings for
fluctuations in fuel costs, including the energy component of purchased power costs. Under these
provisions, fuel revenues generally equal fuel expenses, including the fuel component of purchased
power, and do not affect net income. The traditional operating companies may also have one or more
regulatory mechanisms to recover other costs such as environmental, storm damage, new plants, and
PPAs.

Wholesale revenues consist of PPAs with investor-owned utilities and electric cooperatives, unit
power sales contracts, and short-term opportunity sales. Short-term opportunity sales are made at
market-based rates that generally provide a margin above the Company’s variable cost to produce the
energy. Southern Company’s average wholesale contract extends more than 14 years and, as a result,
the Company has significantly limited its remarketing risk.

In 2008, wholesale revenues increased $412 million primarily as a result of a 21.8% increase in the
average cost of fuel per net kilowatt-hour (KWH) generated, as well as revenues resulting from new
and existing PPAs and revenues derived from contracts for Southern Power’s Plant Oleander Unit 5
and Plant Franklin Unit 3 placed in operation in December 2007 and June 2008, respectively. The
2008 increase was partially offset by a decrease in short-term opportunity sales and
weather-related generation load reductions.

In 2007, wholesale revenues increased $166 million primarily as a result of a 9.9% increase in the
average cost of fuel per net KWH generated. Excluding fuel, wholesale revenues were flat when
compared to the prior year.

In 2006, wholesale revenues increased $155 million primarily as a result of a 10.0% increase in the
average cost of fuel per net KWH generated, as well as revenues resulting from new PPAs in 2006.
In addition, Southern Company assumed four PPAs through the acquisitions of Plants DeSoto and Rowan
in June and September 2006, respectively. The 2006 increase was partially offset by a decrease in
short-term opportunity sales.

Revenues associated with PPAs and opportunity sales were as follows:

Capacity revenues under unit power sales contracts, principally sales to Florida utilities, reflect
the recovery of fixed costs and a return on investment. Unit power KWH sales decreased 2.1% in
2008, decreased 0.8% in 2007, and increased 0.2% in 2006. Fluctuations in oil and natural gas
prices, which are the primary fuel sources for unit power sales customers, influence changes in
these sales. However, because the energy is generally sold at variable cost, these fluctuations
have a minimal effect on earnings. The capacity and energy components of the unit power sales
contracts were as follows:

Changes in retail energy sales are comprised of changes in electricity usage by customers, changes
in weather, and changes in the number of customers. Retail energy sales in 2008 decreased 3.4
billion KWHs as a result of a 1.4% decrease in electricity usage mainly due to a slowing economy
that worsened during the fourth quarter. The 2008 decrease in residential sales resulted primarily
from lower home occupancy rates in Southern Company’s service area when compared to 2007.
Throughout the year, reduced demand in the textile sector; the lumber sector; and the stone, clay,
and glass sector contributed to the decrease in 2008 industrial sales. Additional weakness in the
fourth quarter 2008 affected all major industrial segments. Significantly less favorable weather
in 2008 when compared to

II-16


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

2007 also contributed to the 2008 decrease in retail energy sales. These decreases were partially
offset by customer growth of 0.6%. Retail energy sales in 2007 increased 2.3 billion KWHs as a
result of 1.3% customer growth and favorable weather in 2007 when compared to 2006. The 2007
decrease in industrial sales primarily resulted from reduced demand and closures within the textile
sector, as well as decreased demand in the primary metals sector and the stone, clay, and glass
sector. Retail energy sales in 2006 increased 2.3 billion KWHs as a result of customer growth of
1.7%, sustained economic growth primarily in the residential and commercial customer classes, and
favorable weather in 2006 when compared to 2005.

Wholesale energy sales decreased by 1.4 billion KWHs in 2008, increased by 2.3 billion KWHs in
2007, and increased by 1.4 billion KWHs in 2006. The decrease in wholesale energy sales in 2008
was primarily related to longer planned maintenance outages at a fossil unit in 2008 as
compared to 2007 which reduced the availability of this unit for wholesale sales. Lower
short-term opportunity sales primarily related to higher coal prices also contributed to the 2008
decrease. These decreases were partially offset by Plant Oleander Unit 5 and Plant Franklin Unit 3
being placed in operation in December 2007 and June 2008, respectively. The increase in wholesale
energy sales in 2007 was primarily related to new PPAs acquired by Southern Company through the
acquisition of Plant Rowan in September 2006, as well as new contracts with EnergyUnited Electric
Membership Corporation that commenced in September 2006 and January 2007. An increase in KWH sales
under existing PPAs also contributed to the 2007 increase. The increase in wholesale energy sales
in 2006 was related primarily to the new PPAs discussed previously under “Electric Operating
Revenues.”

Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses

Fuel costs constitute the single largest expense for the electric utilities. The mix of fuel
sources for generation of electricity is determined primarily by demand, the unit cost of fuel
consumed, and the availability of generating units. Additionally, the electric utilities purchase
a portion of their electricity needs from the wholesale market. Details of Southern Company’s
electricity generated and purchased were as follows:

In 2008, fuel and purchased power expenses were $7.6 billion, an increase of $1.3 billion or 20.0%
above 2007 costs. This increase was primarily the result of a $1.3 billion net increase in the
average cost of fuel and purchased power partially resulting from a 25.8% increase in the cost of
coal per net KWH generated and a 14.2% increase in the cost of gas per net KWH generated.

In 2007, fuel and purchased power expenses were $6.4 billion, an increase of $673 million or 11.8%
above 2006 costs. This increase was primarily the result of a $543 million net increase in the
average cost of fuel and purchased power partially resulting from a 51.4% decrease in hydro
generation as a result of a severe drought. Also contributing to this increase was a $130 million
increase related to higher net KWHs generated and purchased.

II-17


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

In 2006, fuel and purchased power expenses were $5.7 billion, an increase of $467 million or 8.9%
above the prior year costs. This increase was primarily the result of a $367 million net increase
in the average cost of fuel and purchased power and a $100 million increase related to higher net
KWHs generated and purchased.

Over the last several years, coal prices have been influenced by a worldwide increase in demand
from developing countries, as well as increases in mining and fuel transportation costs. In the
first half of 2008, coal prices reached unprecedented high levels primarily due to increased demand
following more moderate pricing in 2006 and 2007. Despite these fluctuations, fuel inventories
have been adequate and fuel supply markets have been sufficient to meet expected fuel requirements.
Demand for natural gas in the United States also increased in 2007 and the first half of 2008.
However, natural gas supplies increased in the last half of 2008 as a result of increased
production and higher storage levels due in part to weak industrial demand. Both coal and natural
gas prices moderated in the second half of 2008 as the result of a recessionary economy. During
2008, uranium prices continued to moderate from the highs set during 2007. While worldwide uranium
production levels appear to have increased slightly since 2007, secondary supplies and inventories
were still required to meet worldwide reactor demand.

Fuel expenses generally do not affect net income, since they are offset by fuel revenues under the
traditional operating companies’ fuel cost recovery provisions. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL –
“PSC Matters –Fuel Cost Recovery” herein for additional information. Likewise, Southern Power’s
PPAs generally provide that the purchasers are responsible for substantially all of the cost of
fuel.

Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses

Other operations and maintenance expenses were $3.6 billion, $3.5 billion, and $3.3 billion,
increasing $111 million, $183 million, and $70 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively.
Discussion of significant variances for components of other operations and maintenance expenses
follows.

Other production expenses at fossil, hydro, and nuclear plants increased $63 million, $128 million,
and $3 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. Production expenses fluctuate from year to
year due to variations in outage schedules and normal increases in costs. Other production
expenses increased in 2008 primarily due to a $64 million increase related to expenses incurred for
maintenance outages at generating units and a $30 million increase related to labor and materials
expenses, partially offset by a $15 million decrease in nuclear refueling costs. See Note 1 to the
financial statements under “Property, Plant, and Equipment” for additional information regarding
nuclear refueling costs. The 2008 increase was also partially offset by a $24 million decrease
related to new facilities, mainly lower costs associated with the 2007 write-off of Southern
Power’s integrated coal gasification combined cycle (IGCC) project with the Orlando Utilities
Commission. Other production expenses increased in 2007 primarily due to a $40 million increase
related to expenses incurred for maintenance outages at generating units and a $29 million increase
related to new facilities, mainly costs associated with the write-off of Southern Power’s IGCC
project and the acquisitions of Plants DeSoto and Rowan by Southern Power in June and September
2006, respectively. A $25 million increase related to labor and materials expenses and a $22
million increase in nuclear refueling costs also contributed to the 2007 increase. The 2006
increase in other production expenses when compared to the prior year was not material.

Transmission and distribution expenses increased $4 million, $21 million, and $30 million in 2008,
2007, and 2006, respectively. Transmission and distribution expenses fluctuate from year to year
due to variations in maintenance schedules and normal increases in costs. The 2008 increase in
transmission and distribution expenses was not material when compared to the prior year.
Transmission and distribution expenses increased in 2007 primarily as a result of increases in
labor and materials costs and maintenance associated with additional investment to meet customer
growth. Transmission and distribution expenses increased in 2006 primarily due to expenses
associated

II-18


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

with recovery of prior year storm costs through natural disaster recovery clauses in accordance
with an accounting order approved by the Alabama PSC and maintenance associated with additional
investment in distribution to meet customer growth.

Customer sales and service expenses increased $32 million, $7 million, and $9 million in 2008,
2007, and 2006, respectively. Customer sales and service expenses increased in 2008 primarily as a
result of an increase in customer account expenses, including a $13 million increase in
uncollectible accounts expense, a $9 million increase in meter reading and related supervision
expenses, and an $8 million increase for records and collections. The 2007 and 2006 increases in
customer sales and service expenses were not material when compared to the prior years.

Administrative and general expenses increased $10 million, $28 million, and $29 million in 2008,
2007, and 2006, respectively. The 2008 increase in administrative and general expenses was not
material when compared to the prior year. Administrative and general expenses increased in 2007
primarily as a result of a $16 million increase in legal costs and expenses associated with an
increase in employees. Also contributing to the 2007 increase was a $14 million increase in
accrued expenses for the litigation and workers’ compensation reserve, partially offset by an $8
million decrease in property damage expense. Administrative and general expenses increased in 2006
primarily as a result of a $17 million increase in salaries and wages and a $24 million increase in
pension expense, partially offset by a $16 million reduction in medical expenses.

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation and amortization increased $199 million in 2008 primarily as a result of an increase
in plant in service related to environmental, transmission, and distribution projects mainly at
Alabama Power and Georgia Power and generation projects at Georgia Power. An increase in
depreciation rates at Georgia Power and Southern Power also contributed to the 2008 increase, as
well as the expiration of a rate order previously allowing Georgia Power to levelize certain
purchased power capacity costs and the completion of Plant Oleander Unit 5 in December 2007 and
Plant Franklin Unit 3 in June 2008.

Depreciation and amortization increased $51 million in 2007 primarily as a result of an increase in
plant in service related to environmental, transmission, and distribution projects mainly at
Alabama Power and Georgia Power. An increase in the amortization expense of a regulatory
liability recorded in 2003 in connection with the Mississippi PSC’s accounting order on Plant
Daniel capacity also contributed to the 2007 increase. Partially offsetting the 2007 increase was
a reduction in amortization expense due to a Georgia Power regulatory liability related to the
levelization of certain purchased power capacity costs as ordered by the Georgia PSC under the
terms of the retail rate order effective January 1, 2005. See Note 1 to the financial statements
under “Depreciation and Amortization” for additional information.

Depreciation and amortization increased $27 million in 2006 primarily as a result of the
acquisitions of Plants DeSoto, Rowan, and Oleander in June 2006, September 2006, and June 2005,
respectively, and an increase in the amortization expense of the Mississippi Power regulatory
liability related to Plant Daniel capacity. An increase in depreciation rates at Southern Power
also contributed to the 2006 increase. Partially offsetting the 2006 increase was a reduction in
the amortization expense of a Georgia Power regulatory liability related to the levelization of
certain purchased power capacity costs.

Taxes Other Than Income Taxes

Taxes other than income taxes increased $56 million in 2008 primarily as a result of increases in
franchise fees and municipal gross receipt taxes associated with increases in revenues from energy
sales, as well as increases in property taxes associated with property tax actualizations and
additional plant in service. Taxes other than income taxes increased $23 million in 2007 primarily
as a result of increases in franchise and municipal gross receipts taxes

II-19


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

associated with increases
in revenues from energy sales, partially offset by a decrease in property taxes resulting
 from the resolution of a dispute with Monroe County, Georgia. Taxes other than income taxes
increased $39 million in 2006 primarily as a result of increases in franchise and municipal gross
receipts taxes associated with increases in revenues from energy sales, as well as increases in
property taxes associated with additional plant in service.

Other Income (Expense), Net

Other income (expense), net increased $24 million in 2008 primarily as a result of an increase in
allowance for equity funds used during construction related to additional investments in
environmental equipment at generating plants at Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Gulf Power, as
well as additional investments in transmission and distribution projects mainly at Alabama Power
and Georgia Power. Other income (expense), net increased $68 million in 2007 primarily as a result
of an increase in allowance for equity funds used during construction related to additional
investments in environmental equipment at generating plants and transmission and distribution
projects mainly at Alabama Power and Georgia Power. The 2006 decrease in other income (expense),
net when compared to the prior year was not material.

Interest Expense and Dividends

Total interest charges and other financing costs increased by $25 million in 2008 primarily as a
result of an $82 million increase associated with $1.7 billion in additional debt and preference
stock outstanding at December 31, 2008 compared to December 31, 2007. Also contributing to the
2008 increase was $5 million in other interest costs. The 2008 increase was partially offset by
$55 million related to lower average interest rates on existing variable rate debt and $7 million
of additional capitalized interest as compared to 2007.

Total interest charges and other financing costs increased by $61 million in 2007 primarily as a
result of a $72 million increase associated with $1.2 billion in additional debt and preference
stock outstanding at December 31, 2007 compared to December 31, 2006 and higher interest rates
associated with the issuance of new long-term debt. Also contributing to the 2007 increase was $7
million related to higher average interest rates on existing variable rate debt and $19 million in
other interest costs. The 2007 increase was partially offset by $38 million of additional
capitalized interest as compared to 2006.

Total interest charges and other financing costs increased by $75 million in 2006 primarily due to
a $78 million increase associated with $708 million in additional debt outstanding at December 31,
2006 compared to December 31, 2005 and higher interest rates associated with the issuance of new
long-term debt. Also contributing to the 2006 increase was $7 million associated with higher
average interest rates on existing variable rate debt, partially offset by $6 million of additional
capitalized interest associated with construction projects and $3 million in lower other interest
costs.

Income Taxes

Income taxes increased $87 million in 2008 primarily due to higher pre-tax earnings as compared to
2007 and a 2007 deduction for a Georgia Power land donation. The 2008 increase was partially
offset by an increase in allowance for equity funds used during construction, which is not taxable.
See Note 5 to the financial statements under “Effective Tax Rate” for additional information.

Income taxes were relatively flat in 2007 as higher pre-tax earnings as compared to 2006 were
largely offset due to a deduction for a Georgia Power land donation; an increase in allowance for
equity funds used during construction, which is not taxable; and an increase in the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Internal Revenue Code), Section 199 production activities
deduction.

II-20


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

Income taxes increased $50 million in 2006 primarily due to higher pre-tax earnings as compared to
2005 and the impact of a 2005 accounting order approved by the Alabama PSC to return certain
regulatory liabilities related to deferred taxes to Alabama Power’s retail customers.

Other Business Activities

Southern Company’s other business activities include the parent company (which does not allocate
operating expenses to business units), investments in leveraged lease and synthetic fuel projects,
telecommunications, and energy-related services. These businesses are classified in general
categories and may comprise one or more of the following subsidiaries: Southern Company Holdings
invests in various energy-related projects, including leveraged lease and synthetic fuel projects
that receive tax benefits, which have contributed significantly to the economic results of these
investments; SouthernLINC Wireless provides digital wireless communications for use by Southern
Company and its subsidiary companies and also markets these services to the public and provides
fiber cable services within the Southeast.

Southern Company’s investment in synthetic fuel projects ended at December 31, 2007. A condensed

Operating Revenues

Southern Company’s non-electric operating revenues from these other businesses decreased $86
million in 2008 primarily as a result of a $60 million decrease associated with Southern Company
terminating its investment in synthetic fuel projects at December 31, 2007 and a $21 million
decrease in revenues at SouthernLINC Wireless related to lower average revenue per subscriber and
fewer subscribers due to increased competition in the industry. Also contributing to the 2008
decrease was a $5 million decrease in revenues from Southern Company’s energy-related services
business. The $55 million decrease in 2007 primarily resulted from a $14 million decrease in fuel
procurement service revenues following a contract termination, a $13 million decrease in revenues
at SouthernLINC Wireless related to lower average revenue per subscriber and fewer subscribers due
to increased competition in the industry, and an $11 million decrease in revenues from Southern
Company’s energy-related services business. The $8 million decrease in 2006 primarily resulted
from a $21 million decrease in revenues at SouthernLINC Wireless related to lower average revenue
per subscriber and lower equipment and accessory sales. The 2006 decrease was partially offset by
a $12 million increase in fuel procurement service revenues.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses

Other operations and maintenance expenses for these other businesses decreased $44 million in 2008
primarily as a result of $11 million of lower coal expenses related to Southern Company terminating
its investment in synthetic fuel projects at December 31, 2007; $9 million of lower sales expenses
at SouthernLINC Wireless related to lower sales volume; and $5 million of lower parent company
expenses related to advertising, litigation, and property insurance costs. Other operations and
maintenance expenses decreased $29 million in 2007 primarily as a result of $11 million of lower
production expenses related to the termination of Southern Company’s membership interest in one of
the synthetic fuel entities and $8 million attributed to the wind-down of one of the Company’s
energy-related services businesses. Other operations and maintenance expenses decreased
$59 million in 2006 primarily as a result of $32 million of lower production expenses related to
the termination of Southern Company’s membership interest in one of the synthetic fuel entities,
$13 million attributed to the wind-down of one of the Company’s energy-related services businesses,
and $7 million of lower expenses resulting from the March 2006 sale of a subsidiary that provided
rail car maintenance services.

Equity in Income (Losses) of Unconsolidated Subsidiaries

Southern Company made investments in two synthetic fuel production facilities that generated
operating losses. These investments allowed Southern Company to claim federal income tax credits
that offset these operating losses and made the projects profitable. Equity in income of
unconsolidated subsidiaries increased $35 million in 2008 as a result of Southern Company
terminating its investment in synthetic fuel projects at December 31, 2007. Equity in losses of
unconsolidated subsidiaries decreased $35 million in 2007 as a result of terminating Southern
Company’s membership interest in one of the synthetic fuel entities which reduced the amount of the
Company’s share of the losses and, therefore, the funding obligation for the year. Also
contributing to the 2007 decrease were adjustments to the phase-out of the related federal income
tax credits, partially offset by higher operating expenses due to idled production in 2006 and
decreased production in 2007 in anticipation of exiting the business. Equity in losses of
unconsolidated subsidiaries decreased $62 million in 2006 as a result of terminating Southern
Company’s membership interest in one of the synthetic fuel entities which reduced the amount of the
Company’s share of the losses and, therefore, the funding obligation for the year. The 2006
decrease also resulted from lower operating expenses while the production facilities at the other
synthetic fuel entity were idled from May to September 2006 due to higher oil prices.

Leveraged Lease Income (Losses)

Southern Company has several leveraged lease agreements which relate to international and domestic
energy generation, distribution, and transportation assets. Southern Company receives federal
income tax deductions for depreciation and amortization, as well as interest on long-term debt
related to these investments. Leveraged lease losses increased $125 million in 2008 as a result of
Southern Company’s decision to participate in a settlement with the IRS related to deductions for
several sale-in-lease-out (SILO) transactions and the resulting application of Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) Staff Position No. FAS 13-2, “Accounting for a Change or Projected Change in
the Timing of Cash Flows Relating to Income Taxes Generated by a Leveraged Lease Transaction” (FSP
13-2). See Note 3 to the financial statements under “Income Tax
Matters — Leveraged Leases” for
further information. Leveraged lease income decreased $29 million in 2007 as a result of the
adoption of FSP 13-2, as well as an expected decline in leveraged lease income over the terms of
the leases. The 2006 decrease in leveraged lease income when compared to the prior year was not
material.

II-22


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

Other Income (Expense), Net

Other income (expense), net for these other businesses decreased $29 million in 2008 primarily as a
result of the 2007 gain on a derivative transaction in the synthetic fuel business which settled on
December 31, 2007. Other income (expense), net increased $73 million in 2007 primarily as a result
of a $60 million increase related to changes in the value of derivative transactions in the
synthetic fuel business and a $16 million increase related to the 2006 impairment of investments in
the synthetic fuel entities, partially offset by the release of $6 million in certain contractual
obligations associated with these investments in 2006. Other income (expense), net decreased
$19 million in 2006 primarily as a result of a $25 million decrease related to changes in
the value of derivative transactions in the synthetic fuel business and the previously mentioned
impairment and release of contractual obligations.

Interest Expense

Total interest charges and other financing costs for these other businesses decreased $28 million
in 2008 primarily as a result of $29 million associated with lower average interest rates on
existing variable rate debt and a $4 million decrease attributed to lower interest rates associated
with new debt issued to replace maturing securities. At December 31, 2008, these other businesses
had $92 million in additional debt outstanding compared to December 31, 2007. The 2008 decrease
was partially offset by a $5 million increase in other interest costs. Total interest charges and
other financing costs decreased by $27 million in 2007 primarily as a result of $16 million of
losses on debt that was reacquired in 2006. Also contributing to the 2007 decrease was $97 million
less debt outstanding at December 31, 2007 compared to December 31, 2006, lower interest rates
associated with the issuance of new long-term debt, and a $4 million decrease in other interest
costs. Total interest charges and other financing costs increased by $48 million in 2006 primarily
as a result of a $19 million increase associated with $149 million in additional debt outstanding
at December 31, 2006 as compared to December 31, 2005 and higher interest rates associated with the
issuance of new long-term debt. Also contributing to the increase were $12 million associated with
higher average interest rates on existing variable rate debt, a $6 million loss on the early
redemption of long-term debt payable to affiliated trusts in January 2006, and a $16 million loss
on the repayment of long-term debt payable to affiliated trusts in December 2006. The 2006
increase was partially offset by $4 million in lower other interest costs.

Income Taxes

Income taxes for these other businesses decreased $7 million in 2008 primarily as a result of
leveraged lease losses discussed previously under “Leveraged Lease Income (Losses),” partially
offset by a $36 million decrease in net synthetic fuel tax credits as a result of Southern Company
terminating its investment in synthetic fuel projects at December 31, 2007. Income taxes increased
$53 million in 2007 primarily as a result of a $30 million decrease in net synthetic fuel tax
credits as a result of terminating Southern Company’s membership interest in one of the synthetic
fuel entities in 2006 and increasing the synthetic fuel tax credit reserves due to an anticipated
phase-out of synthetic fuel tax credits due to higher oil prices. Income taxes increased
$136 million in 2006 primarily as a result of a $111 million decrease in net synthetic fuel tax
credits as a result of terminating Southern Company’s membership interest in one of the synthetic
fuel entities, curtailing production at the other synthetic fuel entity from May to September 2006,
and increasing the synthetic fuel tax credit reserves due to an anticipated phase-out of synthetic
fuel tax credits due to higher oil prices. See Note 5 to the financial statements under “Effective
Tax Rate” for further information.

II-23


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

Effects of Inflation

The traditional operating companies and Southern Power are subject to rate regulation and party to
long-term contracts that are generally based on the recovery of historical costs. When historical
costs are included, or when inflation exceeds projected costs used in rate regulation or in
market-based prices, the effects of inflation can create an economic loss since the recovery of
costs could be in dollars that have less purchasing power. In addition, the income tax laws are
based on historical costs. While the inflation rate has been relatively low in recent years, it
continues to have an adverse effect on Southern Company because of the large investment in utility
plant with long economic lives. Conventional accounting for historical cost does not recognize
this economic loss or the partially offsetting gain that arises through financing facilities with
fixed-money obligations such as long-term debt, preferred securities, preferred stock, and
preference stock. Any recognition of inflation by regulatory authorities is reflected in the rate
of return allowed in the traditional operating companies’ approved electric rates.

FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL

General

The four traditional operating companies operate as vertically integrated utilities providing
electricity to customers within their service areas in the Southeastern United States. Prices for
electricity provided to retail customers are set by state PSCs under cost-based regulatory
principles. Prices for wholesale electricity sales, interconnecting transmission lines, and the
exchange of electric power are regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).
Retail rates and earnings are reviewed and may be adjusted periodically within certain limitations.
Southern Power continues to focus on long-term capacity contracts, optimized by limited energy
trading activities. See ACCOUNTING POLICIES – “Application of Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates – Electric Utility Regulation” herein and Note 3 to the financial statements for
additional information about regulatory matters.

The results of operations for the past three years are not necessarily indicative of future
earnings potential. The level of Southern Company’s future earnings depends on numerous factors
that affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of Southern Company’s primary business of
selling electricity. These factors include the traditional operating companies’ ability to
maintain a constructive regulatory environment that continues to allow for the recovery of all
prudently incurred costs during a time of increasing costs. Other major factors include the
profitability of the competitive wholesale supply business and federal regulatory policy which may
impact Southern Company’s level of participation in this market. Future earnings for the
electricity business in the near term will depend, in part, upon maintaining energy sales during
the current economic downturn, which is subject to a number of factors. These factors include
weather, competition, new energy contracts with neighboring utilities and other wholesale
customers, energy conservation practiced by customers, the price of electricity, the price
elasticity of demand, and the rate of economic growth or decline in the service area. In addition,
the level of future earnings for the wholesale supply business also depends on numerous factors
including creditworthiness of customers, total generating capacity available in the Southeast, and
the successful remarketing of capacity as current contracts expire. Recent recessionary conditions
have negatively impacted sales growth for the traditional operating companies and may negatively
impact wholesale capacity revenues at Southern Power. The timing and extent of the economic
recovery will impact future earnings.

Southern Company system generating capacity increased 659 megawatts due to Southern Power’s
completion of Franklin Unit 3 in June 2008. In general, Southern Company has constructed or
acquired new generating capacity only after entering into long-term capacity contracts for the new
facilities or to meet requirements of Southern Company’s regulated retail markets, both of which
are optimized by limited energy trading activities. See FUTURE
EARNINGS POTENTIAL — “Construction
Projects” herein for additional information.

II-24


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

As part of its ongoing effort to adapt to changing market conditions, Southern Company continues to
evaluate and consider a wide array of potential business strategies. These strategies may include
business combinations, partnerships, acquisitions involving other utility or non-utility businesses
or properties, disposition of certain assets, internal restructuring, or some combination thereof.
Furthermore, Southern Company may engage in new business ventures that arise from competitive and
regulatory changes in the utility industry. Pursuit of any of the above strategies, or any
combination thereof, may significantly affect the business operations, risks, and financial
condition of Southern Company.

Environmental Matters

Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act and other environmental statutes and regulations
could affect earnings if such costs cannot continue to be fully recovered in rates on a timely
basis. Environmental compliance spending over the next several years may exceed amounts estimated.
Some of the factors driving the potential for such an increase are higher commodity costs, market
demand for labor, and scope additions and clarifications. The timing, specific requirements, and
estimated costs could also change as environmental statutes and regulations are adopted or
modified. See Note 3 to the financial statements under “Environmental Matters” for additional
information.

New Source Review Actions

In November 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) brought a civil action in the U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against certain Southern Company subsidiaries,
including Alabama Power and Georgia Power, alleging that these subsidiaries had violated the New
Source Review (NSR) provisions of the Clean Air Act and related state laws at certain coal-fired
generating facilities. Through subsequent amendments and other legal procedures, the EPA filed a
separate action in January 2001 against Alabama Power in the U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of Alabama after Alabama Power was dismissed from the original action. In these lawsuits,
the EPA alleged that NSR violations occurred at eight coal-fired generating facilities operated by
Alabama Power and Georgia Power. The civil actions request penalties and injunctive relief,
including an order requiring the installation of the best available control technology at the
affected units. The action against Georgia Power has been administratively closed since the
spring of 2001, and the case has not been reopened.

In June 2006, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama entered a consent decree
between Alabama Power and the EPA, resolving a portion of the Alabama Power lawsuit relating to the
alleged NSR violations at Plant Miller. The consent decree required Alabama Power to pay $100,000
to resolve the government’s claim for a civil penalty and to donate $4.9 million of sulfur dioxide
emission allowances to a nonprofit charitable organization. It also formalized specific emissions
reductions to be accomplished by Alabama Power, consistent with other Clean Air Act programs that
require emissions reductions. In August 2006, the district court in Alabama granted Alabama
Power’s motion for summary judgment and entered final judgment in favor of Alabama Power on the
EPA’s claims related to all of the remaining plants: Plants Barry, Gaston, Gorgas, and Greene
County.

The plaintiffs appealed the district court’s decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh
Circuit, where the appeal was stayed, pending the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in a similar case
against Duke Energy. The Supreme Court issued its decision in the Duke Energy case in April 2007,
and in December 2007, the Eleventh Circuit vacated the district court’s decision in the Alabama
Power case and remanded the case back to the district court for consideration of the legal issues
in light of the Supreme Court’s decision in the Duke Energy case. On July 24, 2008, the U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of Alabama granted partial summary judgment in favor of
Alabama Power regarding the proper legal test for determining whether projects are routine
maintenance, repair, and replacement and therefore are excluded from NSR permitting. The decision
did not resolve the case, and the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this
time.

II-25


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

Southern Company believes that the traditional operating companies complied with applicable laws
and the EPA regulations and interpretations in effect at the time the work in question took place.
The Clean Air Act authorizes maximum civil penalties of $25,000 to $37,500 per day, per violation
at each generating unit, depending on the date of the alleged violation. An adverse outcome in
either of these cases could require substantial capital expenditures or affect the timing of
currently budgeted capital expenditures that cannot be determined at this time and could possibly
require payment of substantial penalties. Such expenditures could affect future results of
operations, cash flows, and financial condition if such costs are not recovered through regulated
rates.

Carbon Dioxide Litigation

New York Case

In July 2004, three environmental groups and attorneys general from eight states, each outside of
Southern Company’s service territory, and the corporation counsel for New York City filed
complaints in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against Southern
Company and four other electric power companies. The complaints allege that the companies’
emissions of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, contribute to global warming, which the plaintiffs
assert is a public nuisance. Under common law public and private nuisance theories, the plaintiffs
seek a judicial order (1) holding each defendant jointly and severally liable for creating,
contributing to, and/or maintaining global warming and (2) requiring each of the defendants to cap
its emissions of carbon dioxide and then reduce those emissions by a specified percentage each year
for at least a decade. The plaintiffs have not, however, requested that damages be awarded in
connection with their claims. Southern Company believes these claims are without merit and notes
that the complaint cites no statutory or regulatory basis for the claims. In September 2005, the
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York granted Southern Company’s and the other
defendants’ motions to dismiss these cases. The plaintiffs filed an appeal to the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit in October 2005, but no decision has been issued. The ultimate
outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Kivalina Case

On February 26, 2008, the Native Village of Kivalina and the City of Kivalina filed a suit in the
U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against several electric utilities
(including Southern Company), several oil companies, and a coal company. The plaintiffs are the
governing bodies of an Inupiat village in Alaska. The plaintiffs contend that the village is being
destroyed by erosion allegedly caused by global warming that the plaintiffs attribute to emissions
of greenhouse gases by the defendants. The plaintiffs assert claims for public and private
nuisance and contend that the defendants have acted in concert and are therefore jointly and
severally liable for the plaintiffs’ damages. The suit seeks damages for lost property values and
for the cost of relocating the village, which is alleged to be $95 million to $400 million. On
June 30, 2008, all defendants filed motions to dismiss this case. Southern Company believes that
these claims are without merit and notes that the complaint cites no statutory or regulatory basis
for the claims. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Environmental Statutes and Regulations

General

Southern Company’s operations are subject to extensive regulation by state and federal
environmental agencies under a variety of statutes and regulations governing environmental media,
including air, water, and land resources. Applicable statutes include the Clean Air Act; the Clean
Water Act; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act; the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act; the Toxic Substances Control Act; the Emergency Planning & Community
Right-to-Know Act; the Endangered Species Act; and related federal and state regulations.
Compliance with these environmental requirements involves significant capital and operating

II-26


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

costs, a major portion of which is expected to be recovered through existing ratemaking provisions.
Through 2008, Southern Company had invested approximately $6.3 billion in capital projects to
comply with these requirements, with annual totals of $1.6 billion, $1.5 billion, and $661 million
for 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. The Company expects that capital expenditures to assure
compliance with existing and new statutes and regulations will be an additional $1.4 billion, $737
million, and $871 million for 2009, 2010, and 2011, respectively. The Company’s compliance
strategy can be affected by changes to existing environmental laws, statutes, and regulations, the
cost, availability, and existing inventory of emission allowances, and the Company’s fuel mix.
Environmental costs that are known and estimable at this time are included in capital expenditures
discussed under FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY — “Capital Requirements and Contractual
Obligations” herein.

Compliance with any new federal or state legislation or regulations related to global climate
change, air quality, combustion byproducts, including coal ash, or other environmental and health
concerns could also significantly affect Southern Company. Although new or revised environmental
legislation or regulations could affect many areas of Southern Company’s operations, the full
impact of any such changes cannot be determined at this time.

Air Quality

Compliance with the Clean Air Act and resulting regulations has been and will continue to be a
significant focus for Southern Company. Through 2008, the Company had spent approximately
$5.4 billion in reducing sulfur dioxide (SO


) and nitrogen oxide (NO

x

)
emissions and in monitoring emissions pursuant to the Clean Air Act. Additional controls are
currently being installed at several plants to further reduce air emissions, maintain compliance
with existing regulations, and meet new requirements.

In 2004, the EPA designated nonattainment areas under an eight-hour ozone standard. Areas within
Southern Company’s service area that were designated as nonattainment under the eight-hour ozone
standard included Macon (Georgia), Birmingham (Alabama), and a 20-county area within metropolitan
Atlanta. The Macon and Birmingham areas have since been redesignated as attainment areas by the
EPA, and maintenance plans to address future exceedances of the standard have been approved for
both areas. State plans for bringing the Atlanta area into attainment with this standard were due
to the EPA in 2007; however, in December 2006, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit vacated the EPA rules designed to provide states with the guidance necessary to
develop those plans. State plans could require additional reductions in NO

x

emissions
from power plants. On March 12, 2008, the EPA issued a final rule establishing a more stringent
eight-hour ozone standard which will likely result in designation of new nonattainment areas within
Southern Company’s service territory. The EPA is expected to publish those designations in 2010
and require state implementation plans for any nonattainment areas by 2013.

During 2005, the EPA’s annual fine particulate matter nonattainment designations became effective
for several areas within Southern Company’s service area in Alabama and Georgia. State plans for
addressing the nonattainment designations for this standard were due by April 5, 2008 but have not
been finalized. These state plans could require further reductions in SO


and
NO

x

emissions from power plants. In September 2006, the EPA published a final rule
which increased the stringency of the 24-hour average fine particulate matter air quality standard.
On December 18, 2008, the EPA designated the Birmingham, Alabama area as nonattainment for the
24-hour standard. A state implementation plan for this nonattainment area is due in 2012.

The EPA issued the final Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) in March 2005. This cap-and-trade rule
addresses power plant SO


and NO

x

emissions that were found to contribute to
nonattainment of the eight-hour ozone and fine particulate matter standards in downwind states.
Twenty-eight eastern states, including each of the states within Southern Company’s service area,
are subject to the requirements of the rule. The rule calls for additional

II-27


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

reductions of NO

x

and/or SO


to be achieved in two phases, 2009/2010 and
2015. On July 11, 2008, in response to petitions brought by certain states and regulated
industries challenging particular aspects of CAIR, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit issued a decision vacating CAIR in its entirety and remanding it to the EPA for
further action consistent with its opinion. On December 23, 2008, however, the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit altered its July decision in response to a rehearing
petition and remanded CAIR to the EPA without vacatur, thereby leaving CAIR compliance requirements
in place while the EPA develops a revised rule.  States in the Southern Company service territory
have completed plans to implement CAIR.  Emission reductions are being accomplished by the
installation of emission controls at Southern Company’s coal-fired facilities and/or by the
purchase of emission allowances. The full impact of the court’s remand and the outcome of the
EPA’s future rulemaking in response cannot be determined at this time.

The Clean Air Visibility Rule (formerly called the Regional Haze Rule) was finalized in July 2005.
The goal of this rule is to restore natural visibility conditions in certain areas (primarily
national parks and wilderness areas) by 2064. The rule involves (1) the application of Best
Available Retrofit Technology (BART) to certain sources built between 1962 and 1977 and (2) the
application of any additional emissions reductions which may be deemed necessary for each
designated area to achieve reasonable progress by 2018 toward the natural conditions goal.
Thereafter, for each 10-year planning period, additional emissions reductions will be required to
continue to demonstrate reasonable progress in each area during that period. For power plants, the
Clean Air Visibility Rule allows states to determine that CAIR satisfies BART requirements for
SO


and NO

x

. Extensive studies were performed for each of the Company’s
affected units to demonstrate that additional particulate matter controls are not necessary under
BART. The states of Alabama and Mississippi have determined that no additional SO


controls beyond CAIR are needed to satisfy reasonable progress. At the request of the State of
Georgia, additional analyses were performed for certain units in Georgia to demonstrate that no
additional SO


controls were required to demonstrate reasonable progress. States have
completed or are currently completing implementation plans that contain strategies for BART and any
other measures required to achieve the first phase of reasonable progress.

The impacts of the eight-hour ozone nonattainment designations, the fine particulate matter
nonattainment designations, and the Clean Air Visibility Rule on the Company cannot be determined
at this time and will depend on the resolution of any pending legal challenges and the development
and implementation of rules at the state level. For example, the State of Georgia has approved a
“multi-pollutant rule” that requires plant-specific emission controls on all but the smallest
generating units in Georgia to be installed according to a schedule set forth in the rule. The
rule is designed to ensure reductions in emissions of SO


, NO

x

, and mercury
in Georgia.

The Company has developed and continually updates a comprehensive environmental compliance strategy
to assess compliance obligations associated with the continuing and new environmental requirements
discussed above. As part of this strategy, the Company plans to install additional SO


and NO

x

emission controls within the next several years to ensure continued
compliance with applicable air quality requirements.

In March 2005, the EPA published the final Clean Air Mercury Rule, a cap-and-trade program for the
reduction of mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants. The final Clean Air Mercury Rule was
challenged in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The petitioners
alleged that the EPA was not authorized to establish a cap-and-trade program for mercury emissions
and instead the EPA must establish maximum achievable control technology standards for coal-fired
electric utility steam generating units. On February 8, 2008, the court ruled in favor of the
petitioners and vacated the Clean Air Mercury Rule. The Company’s overall environmental compliance
strategy relies primarily on a combination of SO


and NOx controls to reduce mercury
emissions. Any significant changes in the strategy will depend on the outcome of any appeals
and/or future federal and state rulemakings. Future rulemakings necessitated by the court’s
decision could require emission reductions more stringent than those required by the Clean Air
Mercury Rule.

II-28


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

Water Quality

In July 2004, the EPA published its final technology-based regulations under the Clean Water Act
for the purpose of reducing impingement and entrainment of fish, shellfish, and other forms of
aquatic life at existing power plant cooling water intake structures. The rules require baseline
biological information and, perhaps, installation of fish protection technology near some intake
structures at existing power plants. In January 2007, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit overturned and remanded several provisions of the rule, including the use of cost-benefit
analysis, to the EPA for revisions. The decision has been appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. The
full impact of these regulations will depend on subsequent legal proceedings, further rulemaking by
the EPA, the results of studies and analyses performed as part of the rules’ implementation, and
the actual requirements established by state regulatory agencies and, therefore, cannot be
determined at this time.

Environmental Remediation

Southern Company must comply with other environmental laws and regulations that cover the handling
and disposal of waste and releases of hazardous substances. Under these various laws and
regulations, the traditional operating companies could incur substantial costs to clean up
properties. The traditional operating companies conduct studies to determine the extent of any
required cleanup and have recognized in their respective financial statements the costs to clean up
known sites. Amounts for cleanup and ongoing monitoring costs were not material for any year
presented. The traditional operating companies may be liable for some or all required cleanup
costs for additional sites that may require environmental remediation. See Note 3 to the financial
statements under “Environmental Matters – Environmental Remediation” for additional information.

Global Climate Issues

Federal legislative proposals that would impose mandatory requirements related to greenhouse gas
emissions and renewable energy standards continue to be strongly considered in Congress, and the
reduction of greenhouse gas emissions has been identified as a high priority by the current
Administration. The ultimate outcome of these proposals cannot be determined at this time; however,
mandatory restrictions on the Company’s greenhouse gas emissions could result in significant
additional compliance costs that could affect future unit retirement and replacement decisions and
results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition if such costs are not recovered through
regulated rates.

In April 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the EPA has authority under the Clean Air Act to
regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles. The EPA is currently developing its
response to this decision. Regulatory decisions that will follow from this response may have
implications for both new and existing stationary sources, such as power plants. The ultimate
outcome of these rulemaking activities cannot be determined at this time; however, as with the
current legislative proposals, mandatory restrictions on the Company’s greenhouse gas emissions
could result in significant additional compliance costs that could affect future unit retirement
and replacement decisions and results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition if such
costs are not recovered through regulated rates.

In addition, some states are considering or have undertaken actions to regulate and reduce
greenhouse gas emissions. For example, on June 25, 2008, Florida’s Governor signed comprehensive
energy-related legislation that includes authorization for the Florida Department of Environmental
Protection to adopt rules for a cap-and-trade regulatory program to address greenhouse gas
emissions from electric utilities, conditioned upon their ratification by the legislature no sooner
than the 2010 legislative session.  This legislation also authorizes the Florida PSC to adopt a
renewable portfolio standard for public utilities, subject to legislative ratification. The impact
of this and any similar legislation on Southern Company will depend on the future development,
adoption, legislative ratification,

II-29


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

implementation, and potential legal challenges to rules governing greenhouse gas emissions and
mandates regarding the use of renewable energy, and the ultimate outcome cannot be determined at
this time.

International climate change negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change also continue. Current efforts focus on a potential successor to the Kyoto Protocol for the
post 2012 timeframe, with a conclusion to this round of negotiations targeted for the end of 2009.
The outcome and impact of the international negotiations cannot be determined at this time.

The Company is actively evaluating and developing electric generating technologies with lower
greenhouse gas emissions. These include new nuclear generation, including proposed construction of
two additional generating units at Plant Vogtle in Georgia; proposed construction of an advanced
IGCC unit with approximately 50% carbon capture in Kemper County, Mississippi; and renewables
investments, including the proposed conversion of Plant Mitchell in Georgia from coal-fired to
biomass generation. The Company is currently considering additional projects and is pursuing
research into the costs and viability of other renewable technologies for the Southeast.

FERC Matters

Market-Based Rate Authority

Each of the traditional operating companies and Southern Power has authorization from the FERC to
sell power to non-affiliates, including short-term opportunity sales, at market-based prices.
Specific FERC approval must be obtained with respect to a market-based contract with an affiliate.

In December 2004, the FERC initiated a proceeding to assess Southern Company’s generation dominance
within its retail service territory. The ability to charge market-based rates in other markets is
not an issue in the proceeding. Any new market-based rate sales by any subsidiary of Southern
Company in Southern Company’s retail service territory entered into during a 15-month refund period
that ended in May 2006 could be subject to refund to a cost-based rate level.

In November 2007, the presiding administrative law judge issued an initial decision regarding the
methodology to be used in the generation dominance tests. The proceedings are ongoing. The
ultimate outcome of this generation dominance proceeding cannot now be determined, but an adverse
decision by the FERC in a final order could require the traditional operating companies and
Southern Power to charge cost-based rates for certain wholesale sales in the Southern Company
retail service territory, which may be lower than negotiated market-based rates, and could also
result in total refunds of up to $19.7 million, plus interest. Southern Company and its
subsidiaries believe that there is no meritorious basis for an adverse decision in this proceeding
and are vigorously defending themselves in this matter.

In June 2007, the FERC issued its final rule in Order No. 697 regarding market-based rate
authority. The FERC generally retained its current market-based rate standards. Responding to a
number of requests for rehearing, the FERC issued Order No. 697-A on April 21, 2008 and Order No.
697-B on December 12, 2008. These orders largely affirmed the FERC’s prior revision and
codification of the regulations governing market-based rates for public utilities. In accordance
with the orders, Southern Company submitted to the FERC an updated market power analysis on
September 2, 2008 related to its continued market-based rate authority. The ultimate outcome of
this matter cannot now be determined.

On October 17, 2008, Southern Company filed with the FERC a revised market-based rate (MBR) tariff
and a new cost-based rate (CBR) tariff.   The revised MBR tariff provides for a “must offer” energy
auction whereby Southern Company offers all of its available energy for sale in a day-ahead auction
and an hour-ahead auction with reserve prices not to exceed the CBR tariff price, after considering
Southern Company’s native load requirements, reliability

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

obligations, and sales commitments to third parties. All sales under the energy auction would be
at market clearing prices established under the auction rules. The new CBR tariff provides for a
cost-based price for wholesale sales of less than a year. On December 18, 2008, the FERC issued an
order conditionally accepting the MBR tariff subject to certain revisions to the auction proposal.
On January 21, 2009, Southern Company made a compliance filing that accepted all the conditions of
the MBR tariff order. When this order becomes final, Southern Company will have 30 days to
implement the wholesale auction. On December 31, 2008, the FERC issued an order conditionally
accepting the CBR tariff subject to providing additional information concerning one aspect of the
tariff. On January 30, 2009, Southern Company filed a response addressing the FERC inquiry to the
CBR tariff order. Implementation of the energy auction in accordance with the MBR tariff order is
expected to adequately mitigate going forward any presumption of market power that Southern Company
may have in the Southern Company retail service territory. The timing of when the FERC may issue
the final orders on the MBR and CBR tariffs and the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be
determined at this time.

Generation Interconnection Agreements

In November 2004, generator company subsidiaries of Tenaska, Inc. (Tenaska), as counterparties to
three previously executed interconnection agreements with subsidiaries of Southern Company, filed
complaints at the FERC requesting that the FERC modify the agreements and that those Southern
Company subsidiaries refund a total of $19 million previously paid for interconnection facilities.
No other similar complaints are pending with the FERC.

In January 2007, the FERC issued an order granting Tenaska’s requested relief. Although the FERC’s
order required the modification of Tenaska’s interconnection agreements, under the provisions of
the order, Southern Company determined that no refund was payable to Tenaska. Southern Company
requested rehearing asserting that the FERC retroactively applied a new principle to existing
interconnection agreements. Tenaska requested rehearing of FERC’s methodology for determining the
amount of refunds. The requested rehearings were denied, and Southern Company and Tenaska have
appealed the orders to the U.S. Circuit Court for the District of Columbia. The final outcome of
this matter cannot now be determined.

PSC Matters

Alabama Power

Effective January 2007 and thereafter, Rate RSE adjustments are based on forward-looking
information for the applicable upcoming calendar year. Retail rate adjustments for any two-year
period, when averaged together, cannot exceed 4% per year and any annual adjustment is limited to
5%. Retail rates remain unchanged when the retail return on common equity (ROE) is projected to be
between 13.0% and 14.5%. If Alabama Power’s actual retail ROE is above the allowed equity return
range, customer refunds will be required; however, there is no provision for additional customer
billings should the actual retail ROE fall below the allowed equity return range.

On October 7, 2008, the Alabama PSC approved a corrective rate package primarily providing for
adjustments associated with customer charges to certain existing rate structures. This package,
effective in January 2009, is expected to generate additional annual revenues of approximately $168
million. Alabama Power agreed to a moratorium on any increase in 2009 under Rate RSE. Alabama
Power also agreed to defer any increase in rates during 2009 under the portion of Rate Certificated
New Plant which permits recovery of costs associated with environmental laws and regulations until
2010. The deferral of the retail rate adjustments will have no significant effect on Southern
Company’s revenues or net income, but will have an immaterial impact on annual cash flows. On
December 1, 2008, Alabama Power made its submission of projected data for calendar year 2009. See
Note 3 to the financial statements under “Alabama Power Retail Regulatory Matters” for further
information.

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

Georgia Power

In December 2007, the Georgia PSC approved the retail rate plan for the years 2008 through 2010
(2007 Retail Rate Plan). Under the 2007 Retail Rate Plan, Georgia Power’s earnings will continue
to be evaluated against a retail ROE range of 10.25% to 12.25%. Two-thirds of any earnings above
12.25% will be applied to rate refunds with the remaining one-third applied to an environmental
compliance cost recovery (ECCR) tariff. Georgia Power has agreed that it will not file for a
general base rate increase during this period unless its projected retail ROE falls below 10.25%.
Retail base rates increased by approximately $99.7 million effective January 1, 2008 to provide for
cost recovery of transmission, distribution, generation, and other investments, as well as
increased operating costs. In addition, the ECCR tariff was implemented to allow for the recovery
of costs for required environmental projects mandated by state and federal regulations. The ECCR
tariff increased rates by approximately $222 million effective January 1, 2008. Georgia Power is
required to file a general rate case by July 1, 2010, in response to which the Georgia PSC would be
expected to determine whether the 2007 Retail Rate Plan should be continued, modified, or
discontinued. See Note 3 to the financial statements under “Georgia Power Retail Regulatory
Matters” for additional information.

Fuel Cost Recovery

The traditional operating companies each have established fuel cost recovery rates approved by
their respective state PSCs. Over the past several years, the traditional operating companies have
continued to experience higher than expected fuel costs for coal, natural gas, and uranium. The
traditional operating companies continuously monitor the under recovered fuel cost balance in light
of these higher fuel costs. Each of the traditional operating companies received approval in 2007
and/or 2008 to increase its fuel cost recovery factor to recover existing under recovered amounts
as well as projected future costs. At December 31, 2008, the amount of under recovered fuel costs
included in the balance sheets was $1.2 billion compared to $1.1 billion at December 31, 2007.

Fuel cost recovery revenues as recorded on the financial statements are adjusted for differences in
actual recoverable costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates. Accordingly, changing the
billing factor has no significant effect on the Company’s revenues or net income, but does impact
annual cash flow. Based on their respective state PSC orders, a portion of the under recovered
regulatory clause revenues for Alabama Power and Georgia Power was reclassified from current assets
to deferred charges and other assets in the balance sheets. See Note 1 to the financial statements
under “Revenues” and Note 3 to the financial statements under “Alabama Power Retail Regulatory
Matters”, “Georgia Power Retail Regulatory Matters”, and “Gulf Power Retail Regulatory Matters” for
additional information.

Storm Damage Cost Recovery

Each traditional operating company maintains a reserve to cover the cost of damages from major
storms to its transmission and distribution lines and generally the cost of uninsured damages to
its generation facilities and other property. In addition, each of the traditional operating
companies has been authorized by its state PSC to defer the portion of the major storm restoration
costs that exceeded the balance in its storm damage reserve account. As of December 31, 2008, the
under recovered balance in Southern Company’s storm damage reserve accounts totaled approximately
$27 million, of which approximately $21 million and $6 million, respectively, are included in the
balance sheets herein under “Other Current Assets” and “Other Regulatory Assets.”

See Notes 1 and 3 to the financial statements under “Storm Damage Reserves” and “Storm Damage Cost
Recovery,” respectively, for additional information on these reserves. The final outcome of these
matters cannot now be determined.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

Mississippi Base Load Construction Legislation

In the 2008 regular session of the Mississippi legislature, a bill was passed and signed by the
Governor on May 9, 2008 to enhance the Mississippi PSC’s authority to facilitate development and
construction of base load generation in the State of Mississippi (Baseload Act). The Baseload Act
authorizes, but does not require, the Mississippi PSC to adopt a cost recovery mechanism that
includes in retail base rates, prior to and during construction, all or a portion of the prudently
incurred pre-construction and construction costs incurred by a utility in constructing a base load
electric generating plant. Prior to the passage of the Baseload Act, such costs would
traditionally be recovered only after the plant was placed in service. The Baseload Act also
provides for periodic prudence reviews by the Mississippi PSC and prohibits the cancellation of any
such generating plant without the approval of the Mississippi PSC. In the event of cancellation of
the construction of the plant without approval of the Mississippi PSC, the Baseload Act authorizes
the Mississippi PSC to make a public interest determination as to whether and to what extent the
utility will be afforded rate recovery for costs incurred in connection with such cancelled
generating plant. The effect of this legislation on Southern Company cannot now be determined.

Mirant Matters

Mirant was an energy company with businesses that included independent power projects and energy
trading and risk management companies in the U.S. and selected other countries. It was a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Southern Company until its initial public offering in October 2000. In
April 2001, Southern Company completed a spin-off to its shareholders of its remaining ownership,
and Mirant became an independent corporate entity.

In July 2003, Mirant and certain of its affiliates filed for voluntary reorganization under
Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. In January 2006, Mirant’s plan of reorganization became
effective, and Mirant emerged from bankruptcy. As part of the plan, Mirant transferred
substantially all of its assets and its restructured debt to a new corporation that adopted the
name Mirant Corporation (Reorganized Mirant). Southern Company has certain contingent liabilities
associated with guarantees of contractual commitments made by Mirant’s subsidiaries discussed in
Note 7 to the financial statements under “Guarantees” and with various lawsuits discussed in Note 3
to the financial statements under “Mirant Matters.”

In December 2004, as a result of concluding an IRS audit for the tax years 2000 and 2001, Southern
Company paid approximately $39 million in additional tax and interest related to Mirant tax items
and filed a claim in Mirant’s bankruptcy case for that amount.  Through December 2008, Southern
Company received from the IRS approximately $38 million in refunds related to Mirant. Southern
Company believes it has a right to recoup the $39 million tax payment owed by Mirant from such tax
refunds.  As a result, Southern Company intends to retain the tax refunds and reduce its claim
against Mirant for the payment of Mirant taxes by the amount of such refunds.  MC Asset Recovery, a
special purpose subsidiary of Reorganized Mirant, has objected to and sought to equitably
subordinate the Southern Company tax claim in its fraudulent transfer litigation against Southern
Company. Southern Company has reserved the remaining amount with respect to its Mirant tax claim.

If Southern Company is ultimately required to make any additional payments either with respect to
the IRS audit or its contingent obligations under guarantees of Mirant subsidiaries, Mirant’s
indemnification obligation to Southern Company for these additional payments, if allowed, would
constitute unsecured claims against Mirant, entitled to stock in Reorganized Mirant. See Note 3 to
the financial statements under “Mirant Matters — Mirant Bankruptcy.”

In June 2005, Mirant, as a debtor in possession, and The Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors
of Mirant Corporation filed a complaint against Southern Company in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for
the Northern District of Texas, which was amended in July 2005, February 2006, May 2006, and March
2007. In January 2006, MC Asset Recovery was substituted as plaintiff. The fourth amended
complaint (the complaint) alleges that Southern Company caused Mirant to engage in certain
fraudulent transfers and to pay illegal dividends to Southern Company

II-33


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

prior to the spin-off. The complaint also seeks to recharacterize certain advances from Southern
Company to Mirant for investments in energy facilities from debt to equity. The complaint further
alleges that Southern Company is liable to Mirant’s creditors for the full amount of Mirant’s
liability under an alter ego theory of recovery and that Southern Company breached its fiduciary
duties to Mirant and its creditors, caused Mirant to breach its fiduciary duties to creditors, and
aided and abetted breaches of fiduciary duties by Mirant’s directors and officers. The complaint
also seeks recoveries under the theories of restitution and unjust enrichment. In addition, the
complaint alleged a claim under the Federal Debt Collection Procedure Act (FDCPA) to avoid certain
transfers from Mirant to Southern Company; however, on July 7, 2008, the court ruled that the FDCPA
does not apply and that Georgia law should apply instead. The complaint seeks monetary damages in
excess of $2 billion plus interest, punitive damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs. Finally, the
complaint includes an objection to Southern Company’s pending claims against Mirant in the
Bankruptcy Court (which relate to reimbursement under the separation agreements of payments such as
income taxes, interest, legal fees, and other guarantees described in Note 7 to the financial
statements) and seeks equitable subordination of Southern Company’s claims to the claims of all
other creditors. Southern Company served an answer to the complaint in April 2007.

In February 2006, the Company’s motion to transfer the case to the U.S. District Court for the
Northern District of Georgia was granted. In May 2006, Southern Company filed a motion for summary
judgment seeking entry of judgment against the plaintiff as to all counts in the complaint. In
December 2006, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia granted in part and
denied in part the motion. As a result, certain breach of fiduciary duty claims alleged in earlier
versions of the complaint were barred; all other claims were allowed to proceed. On August 6,
2008, Southern Company filed a second motion for summary judgment. MC Asset Recovery filed its
response to Southern Company’s motion for summary judgment on October 20, 2008. On February 5,
2009, the court denied the summary judgment motion in connection with the fraudulent conveyance and
illegal dividend claims concerning certain advance return/loan repayments in 1999, dividends in
1999 and 2000, and transfers in connection with Mirant’s separation from Southern Company. The
court granted Southern Company’s motion for summary judgment with respect to certain claims,
including claims for restitution and unjust enrichment, claims that Southern Company aided and
abetted Mirant’s directors’ breach of fiduciary duties to Mirant, and claims that Southern Company
used Mirant as an alter ego. In addition, the court granted Southern Company’s motion in
connection with the fraudulent transfer and illegal dividend claims concerning certain turbine
termination payments. Southern Company believes there is no meritorious basis for the claims in
the complaint and is vigorously defending itself in this action. See Note 3 to the financial
statements under “Mirant Matters — MC Asset Recovery Litigation” for additional information. The
ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Mirant Securities Litigation

In November 2002, Southern Company, certain former and current senior officers of Southern Company,
and 12 underwriters of Mirant’s initial public offering were added as defendants in a class action
lawsuit that several Mirant shareholders originally filed against Mirant and certain Mirant
officers in May 2002. Several other similar lawsuits filed subsequently were consolidated into
this litigation in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. The amended
complaint is based on allegations related to alleged improper energy trading and marketing
activities involving the California energy market, alleged false statements and omissions in
Mirant’s prospectus for its initial public offering and in subsequent public statements by Mirant,
and accounting-related issues previously disclosed by Mirant. The lawsuit purports to include
persons who acquired Mirant securities between September 26, 2000 and September 5, 2002.

In July 2003, the court dismissed all claims based on Mirant’s alleged improper energy trading and
marketing activities involving the California energy market. The other claims do not allege any
improper trading and marketing activity, accounting errors, or material misstatements or omissions
on the part of Southern Company but seek to impose liability on Southern Company based on
allegations that Southern Company was a “control person”

II-34


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

as to Mirant prior to the spin-off date. Southern Company filed an answer to the consolidated
amended class action complaint in September 2003. Plaintiffs also filed a motion for class
certification.

During Mirant’s Chapter 11 proceeding, the securities litigation was stayed, with the exception of
limited discovery. Since Mirant’s plan of reorganization has become effective, the stay has been
lifted. In March 2006, the plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration requesting that the court
vacate that portion of its July 2003 order dismissing the plaintiffs’ claims based upon Mirant’s
alleged improper energy trading and marketing activities involving the California energy market.
Southern Company and the other defendants opposed the plaintiffs’ motion. In March 2007, the court
granted plaintiffs’ motion for reconsideration, reinstated the California energy market claims, and
granted in part and denied in part defendants’ motion to compel certain class certification
discovery. In March 2007, defendants filed renewed motions to dismiss the California energy claims
on grounds originally set forth in their 2003 motions to dismiss, but which were not addressed by
the court. In July 2007, certain defendants, including Southern Company, filed motions for
reconsideration of the court’s denial of a motion seeking dismissal of certain federal securities
laws claims based upon, among other things, certain alleged errors included in financial statements
issued by Mirant. On August 6, 2008, the court entered an order in regard to the defendants’
motions to dismiss and for partial summary judgment. The court granted the defendants’ motion for
partial summary judgment in two respects concluding that certain holders of Mirant stock do not
have standing under the securities laws. The court denied the defendants’ other motions and
granted leave to the plaintiffs to re-plead their claims against the defendants. In accordance
with the court’s order, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. The plaintiffs added
allegations based upon claims asserted against Southern Company in the MC Asset Recovery
litigation. Southern Company and the remaining defendants filed motions to dismiss the amended
complaint on October 9, 2008. On January 7, 2009, the trial judge dismissed all counts of the
plaintiffs’ second amended complaint with prejudice. This matter is now concluded.

Income Tax Matters

Legislation

On February 17, 2009, President Obama signed into law the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of
2009 (ARRA). Major tax incentives in the ARRA include an extension of bonus depreciation and
multiple renewable energy incentives. These incentives could have a significant impact on Southern
Company’s future cash flow and net income. Additionally, the ARRA includes programs for renewable
energy, transmission and smart grid enhancement, fossil energy and research, and energy efficiency
and conservation. The ultimate impact cannot be determined at this time.

Georgia State Income Tax Credits

Georgia Power’s 2005 through 2008 income tax filings for the State of Georgia include state income
tax credits for increased activity through Georgia ports. Georgia Power has also filed similar
claims for the years 2002 through 2004. The Georgia Department of Revenue has not responded to
these claims. In July 2007, Georgia Power filed a complaint in the Superior Court of Fulton County
to recover the credits claimed for the years 2002 through 2004. An unrecognized tax benefit has
been recorded related to these credits. If Georgia Power prevails, these claims could have a
significant, and possibly material, positive effect on Southern Company’s net income. If Georgia
Power is not successful, payment of the related state tax could have a significant, and possibly
material, negative effect on Southern Company’s cash flow. The ultimate outcome of this matter
cannot now be determined.

Internal Revenue Code Section 199 Domestic Production Deduction

The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 created a tax deduction for a portion of income attributable
to U.S. production activities as defined in the Internal Revenue Code Section 199 (production
activities deduction). The

II-35


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

deduction is equal to a stated percentage of qualified production activities net income. The
percentage is phased in over the years 2005 through 2010 with a 3% rate applicable to the years
2005 and 2006, a 6% rate applicable for years 2007 through 2009, and a 9% rate thereafter. The IRS
has not clearly defined a methodology for calculating this deduction. However, Southern Company
has agreed with the IRS on a calculation methodology and signed a closing agreement on December 11,
2008. Therefore, Southern Company reversed the unrecognized tax benefit and adjusted the deduction
to conform to the agreement. The net impact of the reversal of the unrecognized tax benefits
combined with the application of the new methodology had no material effect on the Company’s
financial statements. See Note 5 to the financial statements under “Effective Tax Rate” for
additional information.

Construction Projects

Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle

On January 16, 2009, Mississippi Power filed for a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity
with the Mississippi PSC to allow construction of a new electric generating plant located in Kemper
County, Mississippi. The plant would utilize an advanced coal IGCC with an output capacity of 582
megawatts. The Kemper IGCC will use locally mined lignite (an abundant, lower heating value coal)
from a proposed mine adjacent to the plant as fuel. This certificate, if approved by the
Mississippi PSC, would authorize Mississippi Power to acquire, construct and operate the Kemper
IGCC and related facilities. The Kemper IGCC, subject to federal and state environmental reviews
and certain regulatory approvals, is expected to begin commercial operation in November 2013. As
part of its filing, Mississippi Power has requested certain rate recovery treatment in accordance
with the base load construction legislation. See FUTURE EARNINGS
POTENTIAL — “PSC Matters –
Mississippi Base Load Construction Legislation” herein for additional information.

Mississippi Power filed an application in June 2006 with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for
certain tax credits available to projects using clean coal technologies under the Energy Policy Act
of 2005. The DOE subsequently certified the Kemper IGCC, and in November 2006 the IRS allocated
Internal Revenue Code Section 48A tax credits of $133 million to Mississippi Power. The
utilization of these credits is dependent upon meeting the certification requirements for the
Kemper IGCC, including an in-service date no later than November 2013. Mississippi Power has
secured all environmental reviews and permits necessary to commence construction of the Kemper IGCC
and has entered into a binding contract for the steam turbine generator, completing two milestone
requirements for the Section 48A credits.

On February 14, 2008, Mississippi Power also requested that the DOE transfer the remaining funds
previously granted to a cancelled Southern Company project that would have been located in Orlando,
Florida. On December 12, 2008, an agreement was reached to assign the remaining funds to the
Kemper IGCC. The estimated construction cost of the Kemper IGCC is approximately $2.2 billion,
which is net of $220 million related to funding to be received from the DOE related to project
construction. The remaining DOE funding of $50 million is projected to be used for demonstration
over the first few years of operation.

Beginning in December 2006, the Mississippi PSC has approved Mississippi Power’s requested
accounting treatment to defer the costs associated with Mississippi Power’s generation resource
planning, evaluation, and screening activities as a regulatory asset. On December 22, 2008,
Mississippi Power requested an amendment to its original order that would allow these costs to
continue to be charged to and remain in a regulatory asset until January 1, 2010. In its
application, Mississippi Power reported that it anticipated spending approximately $61 million by
or before May 31, 2009. At December 31, 2008, Mississippi Power had spent $42.3 million of the $61
million, of which $3.7 million related to land purchases capitalized. Of the remaining amount,
$0.8 million was expensed and $37.8 million was deferred in other regulatory assets.

The final outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.

Nuclear

In August 2006, Southern Nuclear, on behalf of Georgia Power, Oglethorpe Power Corporation, the
Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia, and the City of Dalton, Georgia, an incorporated
municipality in the State of Georgia acting by and through its Board of Water, Light and Sinking
Fund Commissioners (collectively, Owners), filed an application with the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission (NRC) for an early site permit relating to two additional nuclear units on the site of
Plant Vogtle. See Note 4 to the financial statements for additional information on these
co-owners. On March 31, 2008, Southern Nuclear filed an application with the NRC for a combined
construction and operating license (COL) for the new units.

On April 8, 2008, Georgia Power, acting for itself and as agent for the Owners, and a consortium
consisting of Westinghouse Electric Company LLC and Stone & Webster, Inc. (collectively,
Consortium) entered into an engineering, procurement, and construction agreement to design,
engineer, procure, construct, and test two AP1000 nuclear units with electric generating capacity
of approximately 1,100 megawatts each and related facilities, structures, and improvements at Plant
Vogtle (Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement).

The Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement is an arrangement whereby the Consortium supplies and constructs the
entire facility with the exception of certain items provided by the Owners. Under the terms of the
Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement, the Owners will pay a purchase price that will be subject to certain
price escalation and adjustments, adjustments for change orders, and performance bonuses. Each
Owner is severally (and not jointly) liable for its proportionate share, based on its ownership
interest, of all amounts owed to the Consortium under the Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement. Georgia
Power’s proportionate share, based on its current ownership interest, is 45.7%. Under the terms of
a separate joint development agreement, the Owners finalized their ownership percentages on July 2,
2008, except for allowed changes, under certain limited circumstances, during the Georgia PSC
certification process.

On August 1, 2008, Georgia Power submitted an application for the Georgia PSC to certify the
project. Hearings began November 3, 2008 and a final certification decision is expected in March
2009.

If certified by the Georgia PSC and licensed by the NRC, Vogtle Units 3 and 4 are scheduled to be
placed in service in 2016 and 2017, respectively. The total plant value to be placed in service
will also include financing costs for each of the Owners, the impacts of inflation on costs, and
transmission and other costs that are the responsibility of the Owners. Georgia Power’s
proportionate share of the estimated in-service costs, based on its current ownership interest, is
approximately $6.4 billion, subject to adjustments and performance bonuses under the Vogtle 3 and 4
Agreement.

The Owners and the Consortium have agreed to certain liquidated damages upon the Consortium’s
failure to comply with the schedule and performance guarantees. The Owners and the Consortium also
have agreed to certain bonuses payable to the Consortium for early completion and unit performance.
The Consortium’s liability to the Owners for schedule and performance liquidated damages and
warranty claims is subject to a cap.

The obligations of Westinghouse Electric Company LLC and Stone & Webster, Inc. under the Vogtle 3
and 4 Agreement are guaranteed by Toshiba Corporation and The Shaw Group, Inc., respectively. In
the event of certain credit rating downgrades of any Owner, such Owner will be required to provide
a letter of credit or other credit enhancement.

The Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement is subject to certification by the Georgia PSC. In addition, the
Owners may terminate the Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement at any time for their convenience, provided that
the Owners will be required to pay certain termination costs and, at certain stages of the work,
cancellation fees to the Consortium. The Consortium
may terminate the Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement under certain circumstances, including delays in receipt
of the COL or

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

delivery of full notice to proceed, certain Owner suspension or delays of work, action by a
governmental authority to permanently stop work, certain breaches of the Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement
by the Owners, Owner insolvency, and certain other events.

In connection with the certification application, Georgia Power has requested Georgia PSC approval
to include the construction work in progress accounts for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in rate base
and allow Georgia Power to recover financing costs during the construction period.

On February 11, 2009, the Georgia State Senate passed Senate Bill 31 that would allow the Company
to recover financing costs for nuclear construction projects by including the related construction
work in progress accounts in rate base during the construction period. A similar bill is being
considered in the Georgia State House of Representatives.

Southern Company also is participating in NuStart Energy Development, LLC (NuStart Energy), a
broad-based nuclear industry consortium formed to share the cost of developing a COL and the
related NRC review. NuStart Energy was organized to complete detailed engineering design work and
to prepare COL applications for two advanced reactor designs. COLs for the two reactor designs were
submitted to the NRC during the fourth quarter of 2007. The COLs ultimately are expected to be
transferred to one or more of the consortium companies; however, at this time, none of them have
committed to build a new nuclear plant.

Southern Company is also exploring other possibilities relating to additional nuclear power
projects, both on its own or in partnership with other utilities.

The final outcome of these matters cannot now be determined.

Nuclear Relicensing

The NRC operating licenses for Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2 currently expire in January 2027 and
February 2029, respectively. In June 2007, Georgia Power filed an application with the NRC to
extend the licenses for Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2 for an additional 20 years. Georgia Power
anticipates the NRC may make a decision regarding the license extension for Plant Vogtle in 2009.

Other Matters

Georgia Power has initiated a voluntary attrition plan under which participating employees may
elect to resign from their positions as of March 31, 2009. Approximately 700 employees who have
indicated an interest in participating in the plan have been selected by Georgia Power and are
permitted to resign and receive severance. Each participating employee who resigns under the plan
will be entitled to receive a severance payment equal to his or her annual base salary, accrued
vacation, and pro-rated bonus as of March 31, 2009. Southern Company will record a charge during
the first quarter 2009 in connection with the plan. The ultimate amount of the charge will be
dependent on the total number of employees who elect to resign under the plan. Such charge could
have a material impact on Southern Company’s statements of income for the quarter ending March 31,
2009 and statements of cash flow for the six months ending June 30, 2009. The first quarter 2009
charge will generally be offset with lower salary costs for the remainder of the year and is not
expected to have a material impact on Southern Company’s financial statements for the year ending
December 31, 2009.

Southern Company is involved in various other matters being litigated, regulatory matters, and
certain tax-related issues that could affect future earnings. In addition, Southern Company is
subject to certain claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. Southern
Company’s business activities are subject to extensive governmental regulation related to public
health and the environment. Litigation over environmental issues and

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

claims of various types, including property damage, personal injury, common law nuisance, and
citizen enforcement of environmental requirements such as opacity and air and water quality
standards, has increased generally throughout the United States. In particular, personal injury
claims for damages caused by alleged exposure to hazardous materials have become more frequent.
The ultimate outcome of such pending or potential litigation against Southern Company and its
subsidiaries cannot be predicted at this time; however, for current proceedings not specifically
reported herein, management does not anticipate that the liabilities, if any, arising from such
current proceedings would have a material adverse effect on Southern Company’s financial
statements. See Note 3 to the financial statements for information regarding material issues.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Southern Company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States. Significant accounting policies are described
in Note 1 to the financial statements. In the application of these policies, certain estimates are
made that may have a material impact on Southern Company’s results of operations and related
disclosures. Different assumptions and measurements could produce estimates that are significantly
different from those recorded in the financial statements. Senior management has discussed the
development and selection of the critical accounting policies and estimates described below with
the Audit Committee of Southern Company’s Board of Directors.

Electric Utility Regulation

Southern Company’s traditional operating companies, which comprised approximately 95% of Southern
Company’s total operating revenues for 2008, are subject to retail regulation by their respective
state PSCs and wholesale regulation by the FERC. These regulatory agencies set the rates the
traditional operating companies are permitted to charge customers based on allowable costs. As a
result, the traditional operating companies apply FASB Statement No. 71, “Accounting for the
Effects of Certain Types of Regulation” (SFAS No. 71), which requires the financial statements to
reflect the effects of rate regulation. Through the ratemaking process, the regulators may require
the inclusion of costs or revenues in periods different than when they would be recognized by a
non-regulated company. This treatment may result in the deferral of expenses and the recording of
related regulatory assets based on anticipated future recovery through rates or the deferral of
gains or creation of liabilities and the recording of related regulatory liabilities. The
application of SFAS No. 71 has a further effect on the Company’s financial statements as a result
of the estimates of allowable costs used in the ratemaking process. These estimates may differ
from those actually incurred by the traditional operating companies; therefore, the accounting
estimates inherent in specific costs such as depreciation, nuclear decommissioning, and pension and
postretirement benefits have less of a direct impact on the Company’s results of operations than
they would on a non-regulated company.

As reflected in Note 1 to the financial statements, significant regulatory assets and liabilities
have been recorded. Management reviews the ultimate recoverability of these regulatory assets and
liabilities based on applicable regulatory guidelines and accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States. However, adverse legislative, judicial, or regulatory actions could
materially impact the amounts of such regulatory assets and liabilities and could adversely impact
the Company’s financial statements.

Contingent Obligations

Southern Company and its subsidiaries are subject to a number of federal and state laws and
regulations, as well as other factors and conditions that potentially subject them to
environmental, litigation, income tax, and other risks. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL herein and
Note 3 to the financial statements for more information regarding certain of these contingencies.
Southern Company periodically evaluates its exposure to such risks and, in

II-39


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, records reserves for those matters where
a non-tax-related loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable and records a tax asset or
liability if it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained. The adequacy of
reserves can be significantly affected by external events or conditions that can be unpredictable;
thus, the ultimate outcome of such matters could materially affect Southern Company’s financial
statements. These events or conditions include the following:

Unbilled Revenues

Revenues related to the retail sale of electricity are recorded when electricity is delivered to
customers. However, the determination of KWH sales to individual customers is based on the
reading of their meters, which is performed on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the
end of each month, amounts of electricity delivered to customers, but not yet metered and billed,
are estimated. Components of the unbilled revenue estimates include total KWH territorial supply,
total KWH billed, estimated total electricity lost in delivery, and customer usage. These
components can fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including weather, generation
patterns, and power delivery volume and other operational constraints. These factors can be
unpredictable and can vary from historical trends. As a result, the overall estimate of unbilled
revenues could be significantly affected, which could have a material impact on the Company’s
results of operations.

New Accounting Standards

Business Combinations

In December 2007, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 141 (revised 2007), “Business Combinations”
(SFAS No. 141R). Southern Company adopted SFAS No. 141R on January 1, 2009. The adoption of SFAS
No. 141R could have an impact on the accounting for any business combinations completed by Southern
Company after January 1, 2009.

In December 2007, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 160, “Non-controlling Interests in
Consolidated Financial Statements” (SFAS No. 160). SFAS No. 160 amends Accounting Research
Bulletin No. 51, “Consolidated Financial Statements” to establish accounting and reporting
standards for the non-controlling (minority) interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation
of a subsidiary. It clarifies that a non-controlling interest in a subsidiary should be reported as
equity in the consolidated financial statements and establishes a single method of accounting for
changes in a parent’s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation.
Southern Company adopted SFAS No. 160 on January 1, 2009 with no material impact to the financial
statements.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY

Overview

Southern Company’s financial condition remained stable at December 31, 2008. Throughout the recent
turmoil in the financial markets, Southern Company has maintained adequate access to capital
without drawing on any of its committed bank credit arrangements used to support its commercial
paper programs and variable rate pollution control revenue bonds. Southern Company and the
traditional operating companies have continued to issue commercial paper at reasonable rates.
Southern Company intends to continue to monitor its access to short-term and long-term capital
markets as well as its bank credit arrangements to meet future capital and liquidity needs. No
material changes in bank credit arrangements have occurred although market rates for committed
credit have increased and the Company may be subject to higher costs as its existing facilities are
replaced or renewed. Southern Company’s interest cost for short-term debt has decreased as market
short-term interest rates have declined. The ultimate impact on future financing costs as a result
of the financial turmoil cannot be determined at this time. Southern Company experienced no
material counterparty credit losses as a result of the turmoil in the financial markets. See
“Sources of Capital” and “Financing Activities” herein for additional information.

Southern Company’s investments in pension and nuclear decommissioning trust funds declined in value
as of December 31, 2008. Southern Company expects that the earliest that cash may have to be
contributed to the pension trust fund is 2011 and such contribution could be significant; however,
projections of the amount vary significantly depending on interpretations of and decisions related
to federal legislation passed during 2008 as well as other key variables including future trust
fund performance and cannot be determined at this time. Southern Company does not expect any
changes to funding obligations to the nuclear decommissioning trusts at this time.

Net cash provided from operating activities in 2008 totaled $3.4 billion, an increase of $3 million
as compared to 2007. Significant changes in operating cash flow for 2008 included a $264 million
increase in the use of funds for fossil fuel inventory as compared to 2007. This use of funds was
offset by an increase in cash of $312 million in accrued taxes primarily due to a difference
between the periods in payments for federal taxes and property taxes. Net cash provided from
operating activities in 2007 totaled $3.4 billion, an increase of $575 million as compared to 2006.
The increase was primarily due to an increase in net income as previously discussed, an increase
in cash collections from previously deferred fuel and storm damage costs, and a reduction in cash
outflows compared to the previous year in fossil fuel inventory. In 2006, net cash provided from
operating activities totaled $2.8 billion, an increase over the previous year of $290 million,
primarily as a result of a decrease in under recovered storm restoration costs, a decrease in
accounts payable from year-end 2005 amounts that included substantial hurricane-related
expenditures, partially offset by an increase in fossil fuel inventory.

Net cash used for investing activities in 2008 totaled $4.1 billion primarily due to property
additions to utility plant of $4.0 billion. Net cash used for investing activities in 2007 totaled
$3.7 billion primarily due to property additions to utility plant of $3.5 billion. In 2006, net
cash used for investing activities was $2.8 billion primarily due to property additions to utility
plant of $3.0 billion, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of Southern Company Gas LLC and
the receipt by Mississippi Power of capital grant proceeds related to Hurricane Katrina.

Net cash provided from financing activities totaled $944 million in 2008 primarily due to long-term
debt issuances. Net cash provided from financing activities totaled $348 million in 2007 primarily
due to replacement of short-term debt with longer term financing and cash raised from common stock
programs. In 2006, net cash used for financing activities was $21 million.

Significant balance sheet changes in 2008 include an increase in total property, plant, and
equipment of $2.5 billion and an increase in long-term debt, excluding amounts due within one year,
of $2.7 billion used primarily for construction expenditures and general corporate purposes. Other
significant balance sheet changes which are

II-41


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

primarily attributable to the decline in market value of the Company’s pension trust fund include a
decrease of $2.4 billion in prepaid pension costs, an increase of $1.9 billion in other regulatory
assets, and a decrease of $1.3 billion in other regulatory liabilities.

At the end of 2008, the closing price of Southern Company’s common stock was $37.00 per share,
compared with book value of $17.08 per share. The market-to-book value ratio was 217% at the end
of 2008, compared with 239% at year-end 2007.

Southern Company, each of the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power have received
investment grade credit ratings from the major rating agencies with respect to debt, preferred
securities, preferred stock, and/or preference stock. SCS has an investment grade corporate credit
rating.

Sources of Capital

Southern Company intends to meet its future capital needs through internal cash flow and external
security issuances. Equity capital can be provided from any combination of the Company’s stock
plans, private placements, or public offerings. The amount and timing of additional equity capital
to be raised in 2009, as well as in subsequent years, will be contingent on Southern Company’s
investment opportunities.

The traditional operating companies and Southern Power plan to obtain the funds required for
construction and other purposes from sources similar to those used in the past, which were
primarily from operating cash flows, security issuances, term loans, short-term borrowings, and
equity contributions from Southern Company. However, the type and timing of any financings, if
needed, will depend upon prevailing market conditions, regulatory approval, and other factors. The
issuance of securities by the traditional operating companies is generally subject to the approval
of the applicable state PSC. In addition, the issuance of all securities by Mississippi Power and
Southern Power and short-term securities by Georgia Power is generally subject to regulatory
approval by the FERC. Additionally, with respect to the public offering of securities, Southern
Company and certain of its subsidiaries file registration statements with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (1933 Act). The amounts of
securities authorized by the appropriate regulatory authorities, as well as the amounts, if any,
registered under the 1933 Act, are continuously monitored and appropriate filings are made to
ensure flexibility in the capital markets.

Southern Company, each traditional operating company, and Southern Power obtain financing
separately without credit support from any affiliate. See Note 6 to the financial statements under
“Bank Credit Arrangements” for additional information. The Southern Company system does not
maintain a centralized cash or money pool. Therefore, funds of each company are not commingled
with funds of any other company.

Southern Company’s current liabilities frequently exceed current assets because of the continued
use of short-term debt as a funding source to meet cash needs as well as scheduled maturities of
long-term debt. To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, Southern Company has substantial
cash flow from operating activities and access to capital markets, including commercial paper
programs (which are backed by bank credit facilities).

At December 31, 2008, Southern Company and its subsidiaries had approximately $417 million of cash
and cash equivalents and $4.2 billion of unused credit arrangements with banks, of which
$970 million expire in 2009, $25 million expire in 2011, and $3.2 billion expire in 2012.
Approximately $84 million of the credit facilities expiring in 2009 allow for the execution of term
loans for an additional two-year period, and $544 million allow for the execution of one-year term
loans. Most of these arrangements contain covenants that limit debt levels and typically contain
cross default provisions that are restricted only to the indebtedness of the individual company.
Southern Company and its subsidiaries are currently in compliance with all such covenants. See
Note 6 to the financial statements under “Bank Credit Arrangements” for additional information.

II-42


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

Financing Activities

During 2008, Southern Company and its subsidiaries issued $2.5 billion of senior notes and
$566 million of obligations related to pollution control revenue bonds. In addition, Georgia
Power, Gulf Power, and Mississippi Power entered into long-term bank loans of $300 million, $110
million, and $80 million, respectively. Georgia Power and Gulf Power also entered into short-term
bank loans of $100 million and $50 million, respectively. Interest rate hedges of $405 million
notional amount were settled at a loss of $26 million related to the issuances. Southern Company
issued $474 million of common stock through the Southern Company Investment Plan and employee and
director stock plans. The security issuances were used to redeem or
repay at maturity $1.5 billion
of long-term debt, to reduce short-term indebtedness, to fund Southern Company’s ongoing
construction program, and for general corporate purposes. Additionally, interest rate hedges of
$100 million were settled early at a loss of $2 million related to counterparty credit issues.

Also in 2008, the traditional operating companies converted their entire $1.2 billion of
obligations related to auction rate pollution control revenue bonds from auction rate modes to
other interest rate modes. Initially, approximately $696 million of the auction rate pollution
control revenue bonds were converted to fixed interest rate modes and approximately $553 million
were converted to variable rate modes. In June 2008, approximately $98 million of the variable
rate pollution control revenue bonds were converted to fixed interest rate modes.

During the third quarter 2008, Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power were required to
purchase a total of approximately $96 million of variable rate pollution control revenue bonds that
were tendered by investors. Alabama Power and Mississippi Power remarketed all of their
repurchased variable rate pollution control revenue bonds of $11 million and $8 million,
respectively. Georgia Power remarketed $75 million of its $77 million of tendered bonds. The
remaining $2 million were extinguished.

In the fourth quarter 2008, Georgia Power and Gulf Power converted a total of approximately
$171 million of variable rate pollution control revenue bonds to fixed interest rate modes.

Subsequent to December 31, 2008, Georgia Power issued $500 million of Series 2009A 5.95% Senior
Notes due February 1, 2039. The proceeds were used to repay $150 million of its Series U Floating
Rate Senior Notes at maturity, to repay short-term indebtedness, and for other general corporate
purposes. Georgia Power settled $100 million of hedges related to the issuance at a loss of
approximately $16 million.

In addition to any financings that may be necessary to meet capital requirements and contractual
obligations, Southern Company and its subsidiaries plan to continue, when economically feasible, a
program to retire higher-cost securities and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital if
market conditions permit.

Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements

In 2001, Mississippi Power began the initial 10-year term of a lease agreement for a combined cycle
generating facility built at Plant Daniel for approximately $370 million. In 2003, the generating
facility was acquired by Juniper Capital L.P. (Juniper), a limited partnership whose investors are
unaffiliated with Mississippi Power. Simultaneously, Juniper entered into a restructured lease
agreement with Mississippi Power. Juniper has also entered into leases with other parties
unrelated to Mississippi Power. The assets leased by Mississippi Power comprise less than 50% of
Juniper’s assets. Mississippi Power is not required to consolidate the leased assets and related
liabilities, and the lease with Juniper is considered an operating lease. The lease also provides
for a residual value guarantee, approximately 73% of the acquisition cost, by Mississippi Power
that is due upon termination of the lease in the event that Mississippi Power does not renew the
lease or purchase the assets and that the fair market value is less than the unamortized cost of
the assets. See Note 7 to the financial statements under “Operating Leases” for additional
information.

II-43


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

Credit Rating Risk

Southern Company does not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in
payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade. There are certain
contracts that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of a credit
rating change of certain subsidiaries to BBB and Baa2, or BBB- and/or Baa3 or below. These
contracts are for physical electricity purchases and sales, fuel purchases, fuel transportation and
storage, emissions allowances, energy price risk management, and construction of new generation.
At December 31, 2008, the maximum potential collateral requirements under these contracts at a BBB
and Baa2 rating were approximately $9 million and at a BBB- and/or Baa3 rating were approximately
$395 million. At December 31, 2008, the maximum potential collateral requirements under these
contracts at a rating below BBB- and/or Baa3 were approximately $1.8 billion. Generally,
collateral may be provided by a Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit, or cash.
Additionally, any credit rating downgrade could impact the Company’s ability to access capital
markets, particularly the short-term debt market.

Market Price Risk

Southern Company is exposed to market risks, primarily commodity price risk and interest rate risk.
To manage the volatility attributable to these exposures, the Company nets the exposures, where
possible, to take advantage of natural offsets and enters into various derivative transactions for
the remaining exposures pursuant to the Company’s policies in areas such as counterparty exposure
and risk management practices. Company policy is that derivatives are to be used primarily for
hedging purposes and mandates strict adherence to all applicable risk management policies.
Derivative positions are monitored using techniques including, but not limited to, market
valuation, value at risk, stress testing, and sensitivity analysis.

To mitigate future exposure to a change in interest rates, the Company enters into forward starting
interest rate swaps and other derivatives that have been designated as hedges. Derivatives
outstanding at December 31, 2008 have a notional amount of $1.4 billion and are related to
anticipated debt issuances and various floating rate obligations over the next two years. The
weighted average interest rate on $1.6 billion of long-term variable interest rate exposure that
has not been hedged at January 1, 2009 was 2.45%. If Southern Company sustained a 100 basis point
change in interest rates for all unhedged variable rate long-term debt, the change would affect
annualized interest expense by approximately $16 million at January 1, 2009. For further
information, see Notes 1 and 6 to the financial statements under “Financial Instruments.”

Due to cost-based rate regulation, the traditional operating companies continue to have limited
exposure to market volatility in interest rates, commodity fuel prices, and prices of electricity.
In addition, Southern Power’s exposure to market volatility in commodity fuel prices and prices of
electricity is limited because its long-term sales contracts shift substantially all fuel cost
responsibility to the purchaser. However, Southern Power has been and may continue to be exposed
to market volatility in energy-related commodity prices as a result of sales of uncontracted
generating capacity. To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity prices, the
traditional operating companies enter into physical fixed-price contracts for the purchase and sale
of electricity through the wholesale electricity market and, to a lesser extent, into financial
hedge contracts for natural gas purchases. The traditional operating companies continue to manage
fuel-hedging programs implemented per the guidelines of their respective state PSCs.

Current period changes also include the changes in fair value of new contracts entered into
during the period, if any.

The decrease in the fair value positions of the energy-related derivative contracts for the
year-ended December 31, 2008 was $289 million, substantially all of which is due to natural gas
positions. This change is attributable to both the volume and prices of natural gas. At December
31, 2008, Southern Company had a net hedge volume of 148.9 billion cubic feet (Bcf) with a weighted
average contract cost approximately $1.97 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) above market
prices, compared to 99.0 Bcf at December 31, 2007 with a weighted average contract cost
approximately $0.01 per mmBtu above market prices. The majority of the natural gas hedges are
recorded through the traditional operating companies’ fuel cost recovery clauses.

At December 31, the net fair value of energy-related derivative contracts by hedge designation was
reflected in the financial statements as assets/(liabilities) as follows:

Energy-related derivative contracts which are designated as regulatory hedges relate to the
traditional operating companies’ fuel hedging programs, where gains and losses are initially
recorded as regulatory liabilities and assets, respectively, and then are included in fuel expense
as they are recovered through the fuel cost recovery clauses. Gains and losses on energy-related
derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are mainly used by Southern Power to hedge anticipated
purchases and sales and are initially deferred in other comprehensive income before being
recognized in income in the same period as the hedged transaction. Gains and losses on
energy-related derivative contracts that are not designated or fail to qualify as hedges are
recognized in the statements of income as incurred.

Unrealized pre-tax gains/(losses) recognized in income for energy-related derivative contracts that
are not hedges were not material for any year presented.

As part of the adoption of FASB Statement No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” to increase
consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, the table above
now uses the three-tier fair value hierarchy, as discussed in Note 10 to the financial statements,
as opposed to the previously used descriptions “actively quoted,” “external sources,” and “models
and other methods.” The three-tier fair value hierarchy focuses on the fair value of the contract
itself, whereas the previous descriptions focused on the source of the inputs. Because Southern
Company uses over-the-counter contracts that are not exchange traded but are fair valued using
prices which are actively quoted, the valuations of those contracts now appear in Level 2;
previously they were shown as “actively quoted.”

Southern Company is exposed to market risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to
energy-related and interest rate derivative contracts. Southern Company’s practice is to enter
into agreements with counterparties that have investment grade credit ratings by Moody’s and
Standard & Poor’s or with counterparties who have posted collateral to cover potential credit
exposure. Therefore, Southern Company does not anticipate market risk exposure from nonperformance
by the counterparties. For additional information, see Notes 1 and 6 to the financial statements
under “Financial Instruments.”

During 2006 and 2007, Southern Company had derivatives in place to reduce its exposure to a
phase-out of certain income tax credits related to synthetic fuel production in 2007. In
accordance with Internal Revenue Code Section 45K, these tax credits were subject to limitation as
the annual average price of oil increased. Because these transactions were not designated as
hedges, the gains and losses were recognized in the statements of income as incurred. These
derivatives settled on January 1, 2008 and thus there was no income statement impact for the year
ended December 31, 2008. For 2007 and 2006, the fair value gain/(loss) recognized in other
income/(expense) to mark the transactions to market was $27 million and $(32) million,
respectively. For further information, see Notes 1 and 6 to the financial statements under
“Financial Instruments.”

Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations

The construction program of Southern Company is currently estimated to be $5.7 billion for 2009,
$5.1 billion for 2010, and $5.8 billion for 2011. These estimates include costs for new generation
construction. Environmental expenditures included in these estimated amounts are $1.4 billion,
$737 million, and $871 million for 2009, 2010, and 2011, respectively. The construction programs
are subject to periodic review and revision, and actual construction costs may vary from these
estimates because of numerous factors. These factors include: changes in business conditions;
changes in load projections; changes in environmental statutes and regulations; changes in nuclear
plants to meet new regulatory requirements; changes in FERC rules and regulations; PSC approvals;
the cost and efficiency of construction labor, equipment, and materials; and the cost of capital.
In addition, there can be no assurance that costs related to capital expenditures will be fully
recovered.

As a result of NRC requirements, Alabama Power and Georgia Power have external trust funds for
nuclear decommissioning costs; however, Alabama Power currently has no additional funding
requirements. For additional information, see Note 1 to the financial statements under “Nuclear
Decommissioning.”

In addition, as discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, Southern Company provides
postretirement benefits to substantially all employees and funds trusts to the extent required by
the traditional operating companies’ respective regulatory commissions.

Other funding requirements related to obligations associated with scheduled maturities of long-term

(a)

All amounts are reflected based on final maturity dates. Southern Company and its
subsidiaries plan to continue to retire higher-cost securities and replace these obligations
with lower-cost capital if market conditions permit. Variable rate interest obligations are
estimated based on rates as of January 1, 2009, as reflected in the statements of
capitalization. Fixed rates include, where applicable, the effects of interest rate
derivatives employed to manage interest rate risk.

(b)

Preferred and preference stock do not mature; therefore, amounts are provided for the next
five years only.

(c)

For additional information, see Notes 1 and 6 to the financial statements.

(d)

The timing related to the $16 million in unrecognized tax benefits and interest payments in
individual years beyond 12 months cannot be reasonably and reliably estimated due to
uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions. See Notes 3 and 5
to the financial statements for additional information.

(e)

Southern Company generally does not enter into non-cancelable commitments for other
operations and maintenance expenditures. Total other operations and maintenance expenses for
2008, 2007, and 2006 were $3.8 billion, $3.7 billion, and $3.5 billion, respectively.

(f)

Southern Company forecasts capital expenditures over a three-year period. Amounts represent
current estimates of total expenditures excluding those amounts related to contractual
purchase commitments for nuclear fuel. At December 31, 2008, significant purchase commitments
were outstanding in connection with the construction program.

(g)

As part of Southern Company’s program to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions from its coal
plants, the traditional operating companies have begun construction of flue gas
desulfurization projects and have entered into various long-term commitments for the
procurement of limestone to be used in such equipment.

(h)

Natural gas purchase commitments are based on various indices at the time of delivery.
Amounts reflected have been estimated based on the New York Mercantile Exchange future prices
at December 31, 2008.

(i)

Long-term service agreements include price escalation based on inflation indices.

(j)

Southern Company forecasts postretirement trust contributions over a three-year period.
Southern Company expects that the earliest that cash may have to be contributed to the pension
trust fund is 2011 and such contribution could be significant; however, projections of the amount
vary significantly depending on interpretations of and decisions related to federal legislation
passed during 2008 as well as other key variables including future trust fund performance and
cannot be determined at this time. Therefore, no amounts related to the pension trust fund are
included in the table. See Note 2 to the financial statements for additional information related
to the pension and postretirement plans, including estimated benefit payments. Certain benefit
payments will be made through the related trusts. Other benefit payments will be made from
Southern Company’s corporate assets.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

Southern Company’s 2008 Annual Report contains forward-looking statements. Forward-looking
statements include, among other things, statements concerning the strategic goals for the wholesale
business, retail sales growth, customer growth, storm damage cost recovery and repairs, fuel cost
recovery and other rate actions, environmental regulations and expenditures, earnings growth,
dividend payout ratios, access to sources of capital, projections for postretirement benefit and
nuclear decommissioning trust contributions, financing activities, completion of construction
projects, plans and estimated costs for new generation resources, impacts of adoption of new
accounting rules, unrecognized tax benefits related to leveraged lease transactions, estimated
sales and purchases under new power sale and purchase agreements, and estimated construction and
other expenditures. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology
such as “may,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “believes,”
“estimates,” “projects,” “predicts,” “potential,” or “continue” or the negative of these terms or
other similar terminology. There are various factors that could cause actual results to differ
materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements; accordingly, there can be no
assurance that such indicated results will be realized. These factors include:

Southern Company expressly disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

General

The Southern Company (the Company) is the parent company of four traditional operating companies,
Southern Power Company (Southern Power), Southern Company Services, Inc. (SCS), Southern
Communications Services, Inc. (SouthernLINC Wireless), Southern Company Holdings, Inc. (Southern
Holdings), Southern Nuclear Operating Company, Inc. (Southern Nuclear), and other direct and
indirect subsidiaries. The traditional operating companies, Alabama Power Company (Alabama Power),
Georgia Power Company (Georgia Power), Gulf Power Company (Gulf Power), and Mississippi Power
Company (Mississippi Power), are vertically integrated utilities providing electric service in four
Southeastern states. Southern Power constructs, acquires, owns, and manages generation assets and
sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market. SCS, the system service company,
provides, at cost, specialized services to Southern Company and the subsidiary companies.
SouthernLINC Wireless provides digital wireless communications for use by Southern Company and its
subsidiary companies and also markets these services to the public and provides fiber cable
services within the Southeast. Southern Holdings is an intermediate holding company subsidiary for
Southern Company’s investments in leveraged leases and various other energy-related businesses.
Southern Nuclear operates and provides services to Southern Company’s nuclear power plants.

The financial statements reflect Southern Company’s investments in the subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis. The equity method is used for entities in which the Company has significant
influence but does not control and for variable interest entities where the Company is not the
primary beneficiary. All material intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

The traditional operating companies, Southern Power, and certain of their subsidiaries are subject
to regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the traditional operating
companies are also subject to regulation by their respective state public service commissions
(PSC). The companies follow accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and
comply with the accounting policies and practices prescribed by their respective commissions. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States requires the use of estimates, and the actual results may differ from those
estimates.

Reclassifications

Certain prior years’ data presented in the financial statements have been reclassified to conform
to the current year presentation. The consolidated statements of income for the prior periods
presented have been modified within the operating expenses section to combine the line items “Other
operations” and “Maintenance” into a single line item entitled “Other operations and maintenance.”
The statements of cash flows for the prior periods presented were modified within the operating
activities section to present a separate line item for “Deferred revenues” previously included in
“Other, net.” The consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2007 has been modified within current
liabilities to reflect the amount of “Unrecognized tax benefits” previously included within
“Accrued taxes — Income taxes” and to present the amount of “Liabilities for risk management
activities” previously included in “Other.” These reclassifications had no effect on total assets,
net income, cash flows, or earnings per share.

Related Party Transactions

Alabama Power and Georgia Power purchased synthetic fuel from Alabama Fuel Products, LLC (AFP), an
entity in which Southern Holdings held a 30% ownership interest until July 2006, when its ownership
interest was terminated. Total fuel purchases for January 2006 through June 2006 were
$354 million. Synfuel Services, Inc. (SSI), another subsidiary of Southern Holdings, provided fuel
transportation services to AFP that were ultimately reflected in the cost of the synthetic fuel
billed to Alabama Power and Georgia Power. In connection with these services, the related revenues
of approximately $62 million for January 2006 through June 2006, have been eliminated against fuel
expense in the financial statements. SSI also provided additional services to AFP, as well as

II-57


NOTES (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

to a
related party of AFP. Revenues from these transactions totaled approximately $24 million for
January 2006 through June 2006.

Subsequent to the termination of Southern Company’s membership interest in AFP, Alabama Power and
Georgia Power continued to purchase an additional $6 million, $750 million, and $384 million in
fuel from AFP in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. SSI continued to provide fuel transportation
services of $131 million in 2007 and $62 million in 2006, which were eliminated against fuel
expense in the financial statements. SSI also provided other additional services to AFP and a
related party of AFP totaling $47 million and $21 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The
synthetic fuel investments and related party transactions were terminated on December 31, 2007.

Regulatory Assets and Liabilities

The traditional operating companies are subject to the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB) Statement No. 71, “Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation”
(SFAS No. 71). Regulatory assets represent probable future revenues associated with certain costs
that are expected to be recovered from customers through the ratemaking process. Regulatory
liabilities represent probable future reductions in revenues associated with amounts that are
expected to be credited to customers through the ratemaking process. Regulatory assets and
(liabilities) reflected in the balance sheets at December 31 relate to:

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

In the event that a portion of a traditional operating company’s operations is no longer subject to
the provisions of SFAS No. 71, such company would be required to write off or reclassify to
accumulated other comprehensive income related regulatory assets and liabilities that are not
specifically recoverable through regulated rates. In addition, the traditional operating company
would be required to determine if any impairment to other assets, including plant, exists and write
down the assets, if impaired, to their fair values. All regulatory assets and liabilities are to
be reflected in rates. See Note 3 under “Alabama Power Retail Regulatory Matters,” “Georgia Power
Retail Regulatory Matters,” “Gulf Power Retail Regulatory Matters,” and “Storm Damage Cost
Recovery” for additional information.

Revenues

Wholesale capacity revenues are generally recognized on a levelized basis over the appropriate
contract periods. Energy and other revenues are recognized as services are provided. Unbilled
revenues related to retail sales are accrued at the end of each fiscal period. Electric rates for
the traditional operating companies include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel
costs, fuel hedging, the energy component of purchased power costs, and certain other costs.
Revenues are adjusted for differences between these actual costs and amounts billed in current
regulated rates. Under or over recovered regulatory clause revenues are recorded in the balance
sheets and are recovered or returned to customers through adjustments to the billing factors.

Retail fuel cost recovery mechanisms vary by each traditional operating company, but in general,
the process requires periodic filings with the appropriate state PSC. Alabama Power continuously
monitors the under/over recovered balance and files for a revised fuel rate when management deems
appropriate. Georgia Power is required to file a new fuel case no later than March 1, 2009. On
February 19, 2009, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power’s request to delay the filing of that
case until March 13, 2009. The new rates are expected to become effective on June 1, 2009. Gulf
Power is required to notify the Florida PSC if the projected fuel cost over or under recovery
exceeds 10% of the projected fuel revenue applicable for the period and indicate if an adjustment
to the fuel cost recovery factor is being requested. Mississippi Power is required to file for an
adjustment to the fuel cost recovery factor annually. See Note 3 under “Alabama Power Retail
Regulatory Matters,” “Georgia Power Retail Regulatory Matters,” and “Gulf Power Retail Regulatory
Matters” for additional information.

Southern Company has a diversified base of customers. No single customer or industry comprises 10%
or more of revenues. For all periods presented, uncollectible accounts averaged less than 1% of
revenues.

Fuel Costs

Fuel costs are expensed as the fuel is used. Fuel expense generally includes the cost of purchased
emission allowances as they are used. Fuel expense also includes the amortization of the cost of
nuclear fuel and a charge, based on nuclear generation, for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear
fuel. See Note 3 under “Nuclear Fuel Disposal Costs” for additional information.

Income and Other Taxes

Southern Company uses the liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes and provides
deferred income taxes for all significant income tax temporary differences. Investment tax credits
utilized are deferred and amortized to income over the average life of the related property. Taxes
that are collected from customers on behalf of governmental agencies to be remitted to these
agencies are presented net on the statements of income.

In accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes” (FIN
48), Southern Company recognizes tax positions that are “more likely than not” of being sustained
upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities. See Note 5 under “Unrecognized Tax
Benefits” for additional information on FIN 48.

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

Property, Plant, and Equipment

Property, plant, and equipment is stated at original cost less regulatory disallowances and
impairments. Original cost includes: materials; labor; minor items of property; appropriate
administrative and general costs; payroll-related costs such as taxes, pensions, and other
benefits; and the interest capitalized and/or cost of funds used during construction.

Southern Company’s property, plant, and equipment consisted of the following at December 31:

The cost of replacements of property, exclusive of minor items of property, is capitalized. The
cost of maintenance, repairs, and replacement of minor items of property is charged to maintenance
expense as incurred or performed with the exception of nuclear refueling costs, which are recorded
in accordance with specific state PSC orders. Alabama Power accrues estimated nuclear refueling
costs in advance of the unit’s next refueling outage. Georgia Power defers and amortizes nuclear
refueling costs over the unit’s operating cycle before the next refueling. The refueling cycles
for Alabama Power and Georgia Power range from 18 to 24 months for each unit. In accordance with a
Georgia PSC order, Georgia Power also defers the costs of certain significant inspection costs for
the combustion turbines at Plant McIntosh and amortizes such costs over 10 years, which
approximates the expected maintenance cycle.

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation of the original cost of utility plant in service is provided primarily by using
composite straight-line rates, which approximated 3.2% in 2008, 3.0% in 2007, and 3.0% in 2006.
Depreciation studies are conducted periodically to update the composite rates. These studies are
filed with the respective state PSC for the traditional operating companies. Accumulated
depreciation for utility plant in service totaled $17.9 billion and $17.0 billion at December 31,
2008 and 2007, respectively. When property subject to composite depreciation is retired or
otherwise disposed of in the normal course of business, its original cost, together with the cost
of removal, less salvage, is charged to accumulated depreciation. For other property dispositions,
the applicable cost and accumulated depreciation is removed from the balance sheet accounts and a
gain or loss is recognized. Minor items of property included in the original cost of the plant are
retired when the related property unit is retired.

Under Georgia Power’s retail rate plan for the three years ended December 31, 2007 (2004 Retail
Rate Plan), Georgia Power was ordered to recognize Georgia PSC-certified capacity costs in rates
evenly over the three years covered by the 2004 Retail Rate Plan. Georgia Power recorded credits
to amortization of $19 million and $14 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. See Note 3 under
“Georgia Power Retail Regulatory Matters” for additional information.

NOTES (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

In May 2004, the Mississippi PSC approved Mississippi Power’s request to reclassify 266 megawatts
of Plant Daniel units 3 and 4 capacity to jurisdictional cost of service effective January 1, 2004
and authorized Mississippi Power to include the related costs and revenue credits in jurisdictional
rate base, cost of service, and revenue requirement calculations for purposes of retail rate
recovery. Mississippi Power amortized the related regulatory liability pursuant to the Mississippi
PSC’s order as follows: $6 million in 2007 and $13 million in 2006, resulting in increases to
earnings in each of those years.

Depreciation of the original cost of other plant in service is provided primarily on a
straight-line basis over estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 25 years. Accumulated
depreciation for other plant in service totaled $433 million and $429 million at December 31, 2008
and 2007, respectively.

Asset Retirement Obligations and Other Costs of Removal

Asset retirement obligations are computed as the present value of the ultimate costs for an asset’s
future retirement and are recorded in the period in which the liability is incurred. The costs are
capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset’s useful life.
The Company has received accounting guidance from the various state PSCs allowing the continued
accrual of other future retirement costs for long-lived assets that the Company does not have a
legal obligation to retire. Accordingly, the accumulated removal costs for these obligations will
continue to be reflected in the balance sheets as a regulatory liability.

The liability recognized to retire long-lived assets primarily relates to the Company’s nuclear
facilities, Plants Farley, Hatch, and Vogtle. The fair value of assets legally restricted for
settling retirement obligations related to nuclear facilities as of December 31, 2008 was $864
million. In addition, the Company has retirement obligations related to various landfill sites,
underground storage tanks, asbestos removal, and disposal of polychlorinated biphenyls in certain
transformers. The Company also has identified retirement obligations related to certain
transmission and distribution facilities, co-generation
facilities, certain wireless communication towers, and certain structures authorized by the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers. However, liabilities for the removal of these assets have not been
recorded because the range of time over which the Company may settle these obligations is unknown
and cannot be reasonably estimated. The Company will continue to recognize in the statements of
income allowed removal costs in accordance with its regulatory treatment. Any differences between
costs recognized under FASB Statement No. 143 “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations” and
FASB Interpretation No. 47, “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations” and those
reflected in rates are recognized as either a regulatory asset or liability, as ordered by the
various state PSCs, and are reflected in the balance sheets. See “Nuclear Decommissioning” herein
for further information on amounts included in rates.

Nuclear Decommissioning

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) requires licensees of commercial nuclear power reactors to
establish a plan for providing reasonable assurance of funds for future decommissioning. Alabama
Power and Georgia Power have external trust funds (the Funds) to comply with the NRC’s regulations.
Use of the Funds is restricted to

II-61


NOTES (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

nuclear decommissioning activities and the Funds are managed and
invested in accordance with applicable requirements of various regulatory bodies, including the
NRC, the FERC, and state PSCs, as well as the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Funds are
invested in a tax-efficient manner in a diversified mix of equity and fixed income securities and
are reported as of December 31, 2008 as trading securities pursuant to FASB Statement No. 115,
“Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities” (SFAS No. 115).

On January 1, 2008, the Company adopted FASB Statement No. 159, “Fair Value Option for Financial
Assets and Financial Liabilities – Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115” (SFAS No.
159). This standard permits an entity to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain
other items at fair value. Southern Company elected the fair value option only for investment
securities held in the Funds. The Funds are included in the balance sheets at fair value, as
disclosed in Note 10.

Management elected to continue to record the Funds at fair value because management believes that
fair value best represents the nature of the Funds. Management has delegated day-to-day management
of the investments in the Funds to unrelated third party managers with oversight by Southern
Company, Alabama Power, and Georgia Power management. The managers of the Funds are authorized,
within broad limits, to actively buy and sell securities at their own discretion in order to
maximize the investment return on the Funds’ investments. Because of the Company’s inability to
choose to hold securities that have experienced unrealized losses until recovery of their value,
all unrealized losses incurred during 2006 and 2007, prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 159, were
considered other-than-temporary impairments under SFAS No. 115.

The adoption of SFAS No. 159 had no impact on the results of operations, cash flows, or financial
condition of the Company. For all periods presented, all gains and losses, whether realized,
unrealized, or identified as other-than-temporary, have been and will continue to be recorded in
the regulatory liability for asset retirement obligations in the balance sheets and are not
included in net income or other comprehensive income. Fair value adjustments, realized gains, and
other-than-temporary impairment losses are determined on a specific identification basis.

At December 31, 2008, investment securities in the Funds totaled $862 million consisting of equity
securities of $518 million, debt securities of $323 million, and $21 million of other securities.
These amounts exclude receivables related to investment income and pending investment sales, and
payables related to pending investment purchases.

At December 31, 2007, investment securities in the Funds totaled $1.1 billion consisting of equity
securities of $788 million, debt securities of $312 million, and $32 million of other securities.
Unrealized gains were $256 million for equity securities and $12 million for debt securities.
Other-than-temporary impairments were $(28) million for equity securities and $(5) million for debt
securities.

Sales of the securities held in the Funds resulted in cash proceeds of $712 million, $775 million,
and $743 million, in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, all of which were re-invested. For 2008,
fair value reductions, including reinvested interest and dividends, was $(278) million, of which
$(259) million related to securities held in the Funds at December 31, 2008. Realized gains and
other-than-temporary impairment losses were $78 million and $(76) million, respectively, in 2007
and $40 million and $(30) million, respectively, in 2006. While the investment securities held in
the Funds are reported as trading securities, the Funds continue to be managed with a long-term
focus. Accordingly, all purchases and sales within the Funds are presented separately in the
statement of cash flows as investing cash flows, consistent with the nature of and purpose for
which the securities were acquired.

Amounts previously recorded in internal reserves are being transferred into the external trust
funds over periods approved by the respective state PSCs. The NRC’s minimum external funding
requirements are based on a generic estimate of the cost to decommission only the radioactive
portions of a nuclear unit based on the size and type of reactor. Alabama Power and Georgia Power
have filed plans with the NRC designed to ensure that, over time, the deposits and earnings of the
external trust funds will provide the minimum funding amounts prescribed by the NRC.

The decommissioning cost estimates are based on prompt dismantlement and removal of the plant from
service. The actual decommissioning costs may vary from the above estimates because of changes in
the assumed date of decommissioning, changes in NRC requirements, or changes in the assumptions
used in making these estimates.

For ratemaking purposes, Alabama Power’s decommissioning costs are based on the site study, and
Georgia Power’s decommissioning costs are based on the NRC generic estimate to decommission the
radioactive portion of the facilities as of 2006. The estimates used in current rates are
$495 million and $334 million for Plants Hatch and Vogtle, respectively. Amounts expensed were
$3 million in 2008 and $7 million annually for 2007 and 2006 for Plant Vogtle. Significant
assumptions used to determine these costs for ratemaking were an inflation rate of 4.5% and 2.9%
for Alabama Power and Georgia Power, respectively, and a trust earnings rate of 7.0% and 4.9% for
Alabama Power and Georgia Power, respectively. As a result of license extensions, amounts
previously contributed to the external trust funds for Plants Hatch and Farley are currently
projected to be adequate to meet the decommissioning obligations. Georgia Power filed an
application with the NRC in June 2007 to extend the licenses for Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2 for an
additional 20 years. Georgia Power anticipates the NRC may make a decision regarding the license
extension for Plant Vogtle in 2009.

Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC) and Interest Capitalized

In accordance with regulatory treatment, the traditional operating companies record AFUDC, which
represents the estimated debt and equity costs of capital funds that are necessary to finance the
construction of new regulated facilities. While cash is not realized currently from such
allowance, it increases the revenue requirement over the service life of the plant through a higher
rate base and higher depreciation expense. The equity component of AFUDC is not included in
calculating taxable income. Interest related to the construction of new facilities not included in
the traditional operating companies’ regulated rates is capitalized in accordance with standard
interest capitalization requirements. AFUDC and interest capitalized, net of income taxes were
11.2%, 8.4%, and 4.2% of net income for 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively.

Cash payments for interest totaled $787 million, $798 million, and $875 million in 2008, 2007, and
2006, respectively, net of amounts capitalized of $71 million, $64 million, and $27 million,
respectively.

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles

Southern Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. The determination of
whether an impairment has occurred is based on either a specific regulatory disallowance or an
estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets, as compared with the
carrying value of the assets. If an impairment has occurred, the amount of the impairment
recognized is determined by either the amount of regulatory disallowance or by estimating the fair
value of the assets and recording a loss if the carrying value is greater than the fair value. For
assets identified as held for sale, the carrying value is compared to the estimated fair value less
the cost to sell in order to determine if an impairment loss is required. Until the assets are
disposed of, their estimated fair value is re-evaluated when circumstances or events change.

Storm Damage Reserves

Each traditional operating company maintains a reserve to cover the cost of damages from major
storms to its transmission and distribution lines and generally the cost of uninsured damages to
its generation facilities and other property. In accordance with their respective state PSC
orders, the traditional operating companies accrued $40.4 million in 2008. Alabama Power, Gulf
Power, and Mississippi Power also have discretionary authority from their state PSCs to accrue
certain additional amounts as circumstances warrant. There were no material accruals for any year
presented. See Note 3 under “Storm Damage Cost Recovery” for additional information regarding
these reserves and the deferral of additional costs, as well as additional rate riders or other
cost recovery mechanisms which have been approved by the respective state PSCs to recover the
deferred costs and accrue reserves for future storms.

Leveraged Leases

Southern Company has several leveraged lease agreements, with terms ranging up to 45 years, which
relate to international and domestic energy generation, distribution, and transportation assets.
Southern Company receives federal income tax deductions for depreciation and amortization, as well
as interest on long-term debt related to these investments. The Company reviews all important
lease assumptions at least annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances
indicate that a change in assumptions has occurred or may occur. These assumptions include the
effective tax rate, the residual value, the credit quality of the lessees, and the timing of
expected tax cash flows.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

For purposes of the financial statements, temporary cash investments are considered cash
equivalents. Temporary cash investments are securities with original maturities of 90 days or
less.

Materials and Supplies

Generally, materials and supplies include the average costs of transmission, distribution, and
generating plant materials. Materials are charged to inventory when purchased and then expensed or
capitalized to plant, as appropriate, at weighted average cost when installed.

Fuel Inventory

Fuel inventory includes the average costs of oil, coal, natural gas, and emission allowances. Fuel
is charged to inventory when purchased and then expensed as used and recovered by the traditional
operating companies through fuel cost recovery rates approved by each state PSC. Emission
allowances granted by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are included in inventory at zero
cost.

Financial Instruments

Southern Company uses derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to fluctuations in
interest rates, the prices of certain fuel purchases, and electricity purchases and sales. All
derivative financial instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities (categorized in
“Other” or shown separately as “Risk Management Activities”) and are measured at fair value. See
Note 10 for additional information. Substantially all of Southern Company’s bulk energy purchases
and sales contracts that meet the definition of a derivative are exempt from fair value accounting
requirements and are accounted for under the accrual method. Other derivative contracts qualify as
cash flow hedges of anticipated transactions or are recoverable through the traditional operating
companies’ fuel hedging programs. This results in the deferral of related gains and losses in
other comprehensive income or regulatory assets and liabilities, respectively, until the hedged
transactions occur. Any ineffectiveness arising from cash flow hedges is recognized currently in
net income. Other derivative contracts, including derivatives related to synthetic fuel

II-65


NOTES (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

investments, are marked to market through current period income and are recorded on a net basis in
the statements of income. See Note 6 under “Financial Instruments” for additional information.

The Company does not offset fair value amounts recognized for multiple derivative instruments
executed with the same counterparty under a master netting arrangement. At December 31, 2008, the
Company has recognized $8.5 million for the obligation to return cash collateral arising from
derivative instruments, which is included in “Accounts payable” in the balance sheets.

Southern Company is exposed to losses related to financial instruments in the event of
counterparties’ nonperformance. The Company has established controls to determine and monitor the
creditworthiness of counterparties in order to mitigate the Company’s exposure to counterparty
credit risk.

The other Southern Company financial instruments for which the carrying amount did not equal fair
value at December 31 were as follows:

The fair values were based on either closing market prices (Level 1) or closing prices of
comparable instruments (Level 2). See Note 10 for all other items recognized at fair value in the
financial statements.

Comprehensive Income

The objective of comprehensive income is to report a measure of all changes in common stock equity
of an enterprise that result from transactions and other economic events of the period other than
transactions with owners. Comprehensive income consists of net income, changes in the fair value
of qualifying cash flow hedges and marketable securities, and certain changes in pension and other
post retirement benefit plans, less income taxes and reclassifications for amounts included in net
income.

Variable Interest Entities

The primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity must consolidate the related assets and
liabilities. Southern Company has established certain wholly-owned trusts to issue preferred
securities. See Note 6 under “Long-Term Debt Payable to Affiliated Trusts” for additional
information. However, Southern Company and the traditional operating companies are not considered
the primary beneficiaries of the trusts. Therefore, the investments in these trusts are reflected
as Other Investments, and the related loans from the trusts are included in Long-term Debt in the
balance sheets.

2. RETIREMENT BENEFITS

Southern Company has a defined benefit, trusteed, pension plan covering substantially all
employees. The plan is funded in accordance with requirements of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA). No contributions to the plan are expected for the year
ending December 31, 2009. Southern Company also provides certain defined benefit pension plans for
a selected group of management and highly compensated employees. Benefits under these
non-qualified pension plans are funded on a cash basis. In addition, Southern Company provides
certain medical care and life insurance benefits for retired employees through other postretirement
benefit plans. The traditional operating companies fund related trusts to the extent required by
their respective regulatory commissions. For the year ending December 31, 2009, postretirement
trust contributions are expected to total approximately $56 million.

The measurement date for plan assets and obligations for 2008 was December 31 while the measurement
date for prior years was September 30. Pursuant to FASB Statement No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting
for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans” (SFAS No. 158), Southern Company was
required to change the measurement date for its defined benefit postretirement plans from September
30 to December 31 beginning with the year ended December 31, 2008. As permitted, Southern Company
adopted the measurement date provisions of SFAS No. 158 effective January 1, 2008 resulting in an
increase in long-term liabilities of approximately $28 million and an increase in prepaid pension
costs of approximately $16 million.

Pension Plans

The total accumulated benefit obligation for the pension plans was $5.5 billion in 2008 and $5.3
billion in 2007. Changes during the 15-month period ended December 31, 2008 and the 12-month
period ended September 30, 2007 in the projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

Pension plan assets are managed and invested in accordance with all applicable requirements,
including ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Internal Revenue Code). The
Company’s investment policy covers a diversified mix of assets, including equity and fixed income
securities, real estate, and private equity. Derivative instruments are used primarily as hedging
tools but may also be used to gain efficient exposure to the various asset classes. The Company
primarily minimizes the risk of large losses through diversification but also monitors and manages
other aspects of risk. The actual composition of the Company’s pension plan assets as of the end
of year, along with the targeted mix of assets, is presented below:

Net periodic pension cost is the sum of service cost, interest cost, and other costs netted against
the expected return on plan assets. The expected return on plan assets is determined by
multiplying the expected rate of return on plan assets and the market-related value of plan assets.
In determining the market-related value of plan assets, the Company has elected to amortize
changes in the market value of all plan assets over five years rather than recognize the changes
immediately. As a result, the accounting value of plan assets that is used to calculate the
expected return on plan assets differs from the current fair value of the plan assets.

Future benefit payments reflect expected future service and are estimated based on assumptions used
to measure the projected benefit obligation for the pension plans. At December 31, 2008, estimated
benefit payments were as follows:

The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (Medicare Act) provides
a 28% prescription drug subsidy for Medicare eligible retirees. The effect of the subsidy reduced
Southern Company’s expenses for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006 by approximately
$35 million, $35 million, and $39 million, respectively.

Future benefit payments, including prescription drug benefits, reflect expected future service and

Actuarial Assumptions

The weighted average rates assumed in the actuarial calculations used to determine both the benefit
obligations as of the measurement date and the net periodic costs for the pension and other
postretirement benefit plans for the following year are presented below. Net periodic benefit
costs were calculated in 2005 for the 2006 plan year using a discount rate of 5.50%.

The Company determined the long-term rate of return based on historical asset class returns and

An additional assumption used in measuring the APBO was a weighted average medical care cost trend
rate of 9.15% for 2009, decreasing gradually to 5.50% through the year 2015 and remaining at that
level thereafter. An annual increase or decrease in the assumed medical care cost trend rate of 1%
would affect the APBO and the service and interest cost components at December 31, 2008 as follows:

Employee Savings Plan

Southern Company also sponsors a 401(k) defined contribution plan covering substantially all
employees. The Company provides an 85% matching contribution up to 6% of an employee’s base
salary. Prior to November 2006, the Company matched employee contributions at a rate of 75% up to
6% of the employee’s base salary. Total matching contributions made to the plan for 2008, 2007,
and 2006 were $76 million, $73 million, and $62 million, respectively.

3. CONTINGENCIES AND REGULATORY MATTERS

General Litigation Matters

Southern Company is subject to certain claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of
business. In addition, Southern Company’s business activities are subject to extensive
governmental regulation related to public health and the environment. Litigation over
environmental issues and claims of various types, including property damage, personal injury,
common law nuisance, and citizen enforcement of environmental requirements such as opacity and air
and water quality standards, has increased generally throughout the United States. In particular,
personal injury claims for damages caused by alleged exposure to hazardous materials have become
more frequent. The ultimate outcome of such pending or potential litigation against Southern
Company and its subsidiaries cannot be predicted at this time; however, for current proceedings not
specifically reported herein, management does not anticipate that the liabilities, if any, arising
from such current proceedings would have a material adverse effect on Southern Company’s financial
statements.

Mirant Matters

Mirant Corporation (Mirant) was an energy company with businesses that included independent power
projects and energy trading and risk management companies in the U.S. and selected other countries.
It was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Southern Company until its initial public offering in October
2000. In April 2001, Southern Company completed a spin-off to its shareholders of its remaining
ownership, and Mirant became an independent corporate entity.

Mirant Bankruptcy

In July 2003, Mirant and certain of its affiliates filed voluntary petitions for relief under
Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas.
The Bankruptcy Court entered an order confirming Mirant’s plan of reorganization in December 2005,
and Mirant announced that this plan became effective in January 2006. As part of the plan, Mirant
transferred substantially all of its assets and its restructured debt to a new corporation that
adopted the name Mirant Corporation (Reorganized Mirant).

Southern Company has certain contingent liabilities associated with guarantees of contractual
commitments made by Mirant’s subsidiaries discussed in Note 7 under “Guarantees” and with various
lawsuits related to Mirant discussed below. Also, Southern Company has joint and several liability
with Mirant regarding the joint consolidated federal income tax returns through 2001, as discussed
in Note 5. In December 2004, as a result of concluding an IRS audit for the tax years 2000 and
2001, Southern Company paid approximately $39 million in additional tax and interest related to
Mirant tax items and filed a claim in Mirant’s bankruptcy case for that amount. Through December
2008, Southern Company received from the IRS approximately $38 million in refunds related to
Mirant. Southern Company believes it has a right to recoup the $39 million tax payment owed by
Mirant from such tax refunds. As a result, Southern Company intends to retain the tax refunds and
reduce its claim against Mirant for the payment of Mirant taxes by the amount of such refunds. MC
Asset Recovery, a special purpose subsidiary of Reorganized Mirant, has objected to and sought to
equitably subordinate the Southern Company tax claim in its fraudulent

II-73


NOTES (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

transfer litigation against Southern Company. Southern Company has reserved the remaining amount
with respect to its Mirant tax claim.

Under the terms of the separation agreements entered into in connection with the spin-off, Mirant
agreed to indemnify Southern Company for costs associated with these guarantees, lawsuits, and
additional IRS assessments. However, as a result of Mirant’s bankruptcy, Southern Company sought
reimbursement as an unsecured creditor in Mirant’s Chapter 11 proceeding. As part of a complaint
filed against Southern Company in June 2005 and amended thereafter, Mirant and The Official
Committee of Unsecured Creditors of Mirant Corporation (Unsecured Creditors’ Committee) objected to
and sought equitable subordination of Southern Company’s claims, and Mirant moved to reject the
separation agreements entered into in connection with the spin-off. MC Asset Recovery has been
substituted as plaintiff in the complaint. If Southern Company’s claims for indemnification with
respect to these, or any additional future payments, are allowed, then Mirant’s indemnity
obligations to Southern Company would constitute unsecured claims against Mirant entitled to stock
in Reorganized Mirant. The final outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.

MC Asset Recovery Litigation

In June 2005, Mirant, as a debtor in possession, and the Unsecured Creditors’ Committee filed a
complaint against Southern Company in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas,
which was amended in July 2005, February 2006, May 2006, and March 2007.

In December 2005, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order authorizing the transfer of this
proceeding, along with certain other actions, to MC Asset Recovery. Under that order, Reorganized
Mirant is obligated to fund up to $20 million in professional fees in connection with the lawsuits,
as well as certain additional amounts. Any net recoveries from these lawsuits will be distributed
to, and shared equally by, certain unsecured creditors and the original equity holders. In January
2006, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas substituted MC Asset Recovery as
plaintiff.

The complaint, as amended in March 2007, alleges that Southern Company caused Mirant to engage in
certain fraudulent transfers and to pay illegal dividends to Southern Company prior to the
spin-off. The alleged fraudulent transfers and illegal dividends include without limitation: (1)
certain dividends from Mirant to Southern Company in the aggregate amount of $668 million, (2) the
repayment of certain intercompany loans and accrued interest in an aggregate amount of $1.035
billion, and (3) the dividend distribution of one share of Series B Preferred Stock and its
subsequent redemption in exchange for Mirant’s 80% interest in a holding company that owned SE
Finance Capital Corporation and Southern Company Capital Funding, Inc., which transfer plaintiff
asserts is valued at over $200 million. The complaint also seeks to recharacterize certain
advances from Southern Company to Mirant for investments in energy facilities from debt to equity.
The complaint further alleges that Southern Company is liable to Mirant’s creditors for the full
amount of Mirant’s liability under an alter ego theory of recovery and that Southern Company
breached its fiduciary duties to Mirant and its creditors, caused Mirant to breach its fiduciary
duties to creditors, and aided and abetted breaches of fiduciary duties by Mirant’s directors and
officers. The complaint also seeks recoveries under the theories of restitution and unjust
enrichment. In addition, the complaint alleged a claim under the Federal Debt Collection Procedure
Act (FDCPA) to avoid certain transfers from Mirant to Southern Company; however, on July 7, 2008,
the court ruled that the FDCPA does not apply and that Georgia law should apply instead. The
complaint seeks monetary damages in excess of $2 billion plus interest, punitive damages,
attorneys’ fees, and costs. Finally, the complaint includes an objection to Southern Company’s
pending claims against Mirant in the Bankruptcy Court (which relate to reimbursement under the
separation agreements of payments such as income taxes, interest, legal fees, and other guarantees
described in Note 7) and seeks equitable subordination of Southern Company’s claims to the claims
of all other creditors. Southern Company served an answer to the complaint in April 2007.

II-74


NOTES (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

In January 2006, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas granted Southern
Company’s motion to withdraw this action from the Bankruptcy Court and, in February 2006, granted
Southern Company’s motion to transfer the case to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District
of Georgia. In May 2006, Southern Company filed a motion for summary judgment seeking entry of
judgment against the plaintiff as to all counts of the complaint. In December 2006, the U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of Georgia granted in part and denied in part the motion.
As a result, certain breach of fiduciary duty claims alleged in earlier versions of the complaint
are barred; all other claims in the complaint were allowed to proceed. On August 6, 2008, Southern
Company filed a second motion for summary judgment. MC Asset Recovery filed its response to
Southern Company’s motion for summary judgment on October 20, 2008. On February 5, 2009, the court
denied the summary judgment motion in connection with the fraudulent conveyance and illegal
dividend claims concerning certain advance return/loan repayments in 1999, dividends in 1999 and
2000, and transfers in connection with Mirant’s separation from Southern Company. The court
granted Southern Company’s motion for summary judgment with respect to certain claims, including
claims for restitution and unjust enrichment, claims that Southern Company aided and abetted
Mirant’s directors’ breach of fiduciary duties to Mirant, and claims that Southern Company used
Mirant as an alter ego. In addition, the court granted Southern Company’s motion in connection
with the fraudulent transfer and illegal dividend claims concerning certain turbine termination
payments. Southern Company believes there is no meritorious basis for the claims in the complaint
and is vigorously defending itself in this action. However, the final outcome of this matter
cannot now be determined.

Mirant Securities Litigation

In November 2002, Southern Company, certain former and current senior officers of Southern Company,
and 12 underwriters of Mirant’s initial public offering were added as defendants in a class action
lawsuit that several Mirant shareholders originally filed against Mirant and certain Mirant
officers in May 2002. Several other similar lawsuits filed subsequently were consolidated into
this litigation in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. The amended
complaint is based on allegations related to alleged improper energy trading and marketing
activities involving the California energy market, alleged false statements and omissions in
Mirant’s prospectus for its initial public offering and in subsequent public statements by Mirant,
and accounting-related issues previously disclosed by Mirant. The lawsuit purports to include
persons who acquired Mirant securities between September 26, 2000 and September 5, 2002.

In July 2003, the court dismissed all claims based on Mirant’s alleged improper energy trading and
marketing activities involving the California energy market. The other claims do not allege any
improper trading and marketing activity, accounting errors, or material misstatements or omissions
on the part of Southern Company but seek to impose liability on Southern Company based on
allegations that Southern Company was a “control person” as to Mirant prior to the spin-off date.
Southern Company filed an answer to the consolidated amended class action complaint in September
2003. Plaintiffs also filed a motion for class certification.

During Mirant’s Chapter 11 proceeding, the securities litigation was stayed, with the exception of
limited discovery. Since Mirant’s plan of reorganization has become effective, the stay has been
lifted. In March 2006, the plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration requesting that the court
vacate that portion of its July 2003 order dismissing the plaintiffs’ claims based upon Mirant’s
alleged improper energy trading and marketing activities involving the California energy market.
Southern Company and the other defendants opposed the plaintiffs’ motion. In March 2007, the court
granted plaintiffs’ motion for reconsideration, reinstated the California energy market claims, and
granted in part and denied in part defendants’ motion to compel certain class certification
discovery. In March 2007, defendants filed renewed motions to dismiss the California energy claims
on grounds originally set forth in their 2003 motions to dismiss, but which were not addressed by
the court. In July 2007, certain defendants, including Southern Company, filed motions for
reconsideration of the court’s denial of a motion seeking dismissal of certain federal securities
laws claims based upon, among other things, certain alleged errors included in financial statements
issued by Mirant. On August 6, 2008, the court entered an order in regard to the defendants’
motions to

II-75


NOTES (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

dismiss and for partial summary judgment. The court granted the defendants’ motion for partial
summary judgment in two respects concluding that certain holders of Mirant stock do not have
standing under the securities laws. The court denied the defendants’ other motions and granted
leave to the plaintiffs to re-plead their claims against the defendants. In accordance with the
court’s order, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. The plaintiffs added allegations based
upon claims asserted against Southern Company in the MC Asset Recovery litigation. Southern
Company and the remaining defendants filed motions to dismiss the amended complaint on October 9,
2008. On January 7, 2009, the trial judge dismissed all counts of the plaintiffs’ second amended
complaint with prejudice. This matter is now concluded.

Environmental Matters

New Source Review Actions

In November 1999, the EPA brought a civil action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of Georgia against certain Southern Company subsidiaries, including Alabama Power and
Georgia Power, alleging that these subsidiaries had violated the New Source Review (NSR) provisions
of the Clean Air Act and related state laws at certain coal-fired generating facilities. Through
subsequent amendments and other legal procedures, the EPA filed a separate action in January 2001
against Alabama Power in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama after Alabama
Power was dismissed from the original action. In these lawsuits, the EPA alleged that NSR
violations occurred at eight coal-fired generating facilities operated by Alabama Power and Georgia
Power. The civil actions request penalties and injunctive relief, including an order requiring the
installation of the best available control technology at the affected units. The action against
Georgia Power has been administratively closed since the spring of 2001, and the case has not been
reopened.

In June 2006, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama entered a consent decree
between Alabama Power and the EPA, resolving a portion of the Alabama Power lawsuit relating to the
alleged NSR violations at Plant Miller. The consent decree required Alabama Power to pay $100,000
to resolve the government’s claim for a civil penalty and to donate $4.9 million of sulfur dioxide
emission allowances to a nonprofit charitable organization. It also formalized specific emissions
reductions to be accomplished by Alabama Power, consistent with other Clean Air Act programs that
require emissions reductions. In August 2006, the district court in Alabama granted Alabama
Power’s motion for summary judgment and entered final judgment in favor of Alabama Power on the
EPA’s claims related to all of the remaining plants: Plants Barry, Gaston, Gorgas, and Greene
County.

The plaintiffs appealed the district court’s decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh
Circuit, where the appeal was stayed, pending the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in a similar case
against Duke Energy. The Supreme Court issued its decision in the Duke Energy case in April 2007,
and in December 2007, the Eleventh Circuit vacated the district court’s decision in the Alabama
Power case and remanded the case back to the district court for consideration of the legal issues
in light of the Supreme Court’s decision in the Duke Energy case. On July 24, 2008, the U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of Alabama granted partial summary judgment in favor of
Alabama Power regarding the proper legal test for determining whether projects are routine
maintenance, repair, and replacement and therefore are excluded from NSR permitting. The decision
did not resolve the case, and the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this
time.

Southern Company believes that the traditional operating companies complied with applicable laws
and the EPA regulations and interpretations in effect at the time the work in question took place.
The Clean Air Act authorizes maximum civil penalties of $25,000 to $37,500 per day, per violation
at each generating unit, depending on the date of the alleged violation. An adverse outcome in
either of these cases could require substantial capital expenditures or affect the timing of
currently budgeted capital expenditures that cannot be determined at this time and could possibly
require payment of substantial penalties. Such expenditures could affect future results of
operations, cash flows, and financial condition if such costs are not recovered through regulated
rates.

Carbon Dioxide Litigation

New York Case

In July 2004, three environmental groups and attorneys general from eight states, each outside of
Southern Company’s service territory, and the corporation counsel for New York City filed
complaints in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against Southern
Company and four other electric power companies. The complaints allege that the companies’
emissions of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, contribute to global warming, which the plaintiffs
assert is a public nuisance. Under common law public and private nuisance theories, the plaintiffs
seek a judicial order (1) holding each defendant jointly and severally liable for creating,
contributing to, and/or maintaining global warming and (2) requiring each of the defendants to cap
its emissions of carbon dioxide and then reduce those emissions by a specified percentage each year
for at least a decade. The plaintiffs have not, however, requested that damages be awarded in
connection with their claims. Southern Company believes these claims are without merit and notes
that the complaint cites no statutory or regulatory basis for the claims. In September 2005, the
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York granted Southern Company’s and the other
defendants’ motions to dismiss these cases. The plaintiffs filed an appeal to the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit in October 2005, but no decision has been issued. The ultimate
outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Kivalina Case

On February 26, 2008, the Native Village of Kivalina and the City of Kivalina filed a suit in the
U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against several electric utilities
(including Southern Company), several oil companies, and a coal company. The plaintiffs are the
governing bodies of an Inupiat village in Alaska. The plaintiffs contend that the village is being
destroyed by erosion allegedly caused by global warming that the plaintiffs attribute to emissions
of greenhouse gases by the defendants. The plaintiffs assert claims for public and private
nuisance and contend that the defendants have acted in concert and are therefore jointly and
severally liable for the plaintiffs’ damages. The suit seeks damages for lost property values and
for the cost of relocating the village, which is alleged to be $95 million to $400 million. On
June 30, 2008, all defendants filed motions to dismiss this case. Southern Company believes that
these claims are without merit and notes that the complaint cites no statutory or regulatory basis
for the claims. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Environmental Remediation

Southern Company must comply with environmental laws and regulations that cover the handling and
disposal of waste and releases of hazardous substances. Under these various laws and regulations,
the subsidiaries may also incur substantial costs to clean up properties. The traditional
operating companies have each received authority from their respective state PSCs to recover
approved environmental compliance costs through regulatory mechanisms. Within limits approved by
the state PSCs, these rates are adjusted annually or as necessary.

Georgia Power’s environmental remediation liability as of December 31, 2008 was $10.1 million.
Georgia Power has been designated or identified as a potentially responsible party (PRP) at sites
governed by the Georgia Hazardous Site Response Act and/or by the federal Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), including a large site in
Brunswick, Georgia on the CERCLA National Priorities List (NPL). The parties have completed the
removal of wastes from the Brunswick site as ordered by the EPA. Additional claims for recovery of
natural resource damages at this site or for the assessment and potential cleanup of other sites on
the Georgia Hazardous Sites Inventory and CERCLA NPL are anticipated.

By letter dated September 30, 2008, the EPA advised Georgia Power that it has been designated as a
PRP at the Ward Transformer Superfund site located in Raleigh, North Carolina. Numerous other
entities have also received notices from the EPA. Georgia Power, along with other named PRPs, will
participate in negotiations with the EPA

II-77

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

to address cleanup of the site and reimbursement for the EPA’s past expenditures related to work
performed at the site. The ultimate outcome of this matter will depend upon further environmental
assessment and the ultimate number of PRPs and cannot be determined at this time; however, it is
not expected to have a material impact on Southern Company’s financial statements.

Gulf Power’s environmental remediation liability includes estimated costs of environmental
remediation projects of approximately $66.8 million as of December 31, 2008. These estimated costs
relate to site closure criteria by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) for
potential impacts to soil and groundwater from herbicide applications at Gulf Power substations.
The schedule for completion of the remediation projects will be subject to FDEP approval. The
projects have been approved by the Florida PSC for recovery through Gulf Power’s environmental cost
recovery clause; therefore, there was no impact on net income as a result of these estimates.

The final outcome of these matters cannot now be determined. However, based on the currently known
conditions at these sites and the nature and extent of activities relating to these sites,
management does not believe that additional liabilities, if any, at these sites would be material
to the financial statements.

FERC Matters

Market-Based Rate Authority

Each of the traditional operating companies and Southern Power has authorization from the FERC to
sell power to non-affiliates, including short-term opportunity sales, at market-based prices.
Specific FERC approval must be obtained with respect to a market-based contract with an affiliate.

In December 2004, the FERC initiated a proceeding to assess Southern Company’s generation dominance
within its retail service territory. The ability to charge market-based rates in other markets is
not an issue in the proceeding. Any new market-based rate sales by any subsidiary of Southern
Company in Southern Company’s retail service territory entered into during a 15-month refund period
that ended in May 2006 could be subject to refund to a cost-based rate level.

In November 2007, the presiding administrative law judge issued an initial decision regarding the
methodology to be used in the generation dominance tests. The proceedings are ongoing. The
ultimate outcome of this generation dominance proceeding cannot now be determined, but an adverse
decision by the FERC in a final order could require the traditional operating companies and
Southern Power to charge cost-based rates for certain wholesale sales in the Southern Company
retail service territory, which may be lower than negotiated market-based rates, and could also
result in total refunds of up to $19.7 million, plus interest. Southern Company and its
subsidiaries believe that there is no meritorious basis for an adverse decision in this proceeding
and are vigorously defending themselves in this matter.

In June 2007, the FERC issued its final rule in Order No. 697 regarding market-based rate
authority. The FERC generally retained its current market-based rate standards. Responding to a
number of requests for rehearing, the FERC issued Order No. 697-A on April 21, 2008 and Order No.
697-B on December 12, 2008. These orders largely affirmed the FERC’s prior revision and
codification of the regulations governing market-based rates for public utilities. In accordance
with the orders, Southern Company submitted to the FERC an updated market power analysis on
September 2, 2008 related to its continued market-based rate authority. The ultimate outcome of
this matter cannot now be determined.

On October 17, 2008, Southern Company filed with the FERC a revised market-based rate (MBR) tariff
and a new cost-based rate (CBR) tariff. The revised MBR tariff provides for a “must offer” energy
auction whereby Southern Company offers all of its available energy for sale in a day-ahead auction
and an hour-ahead auction with reserve prices not to exceed the CBR tariff price, after considering
Southern Company’s native load requirements, reliability

II-78


NOTES (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

obligations, and sales commitments to third parties. All sales under the energy auction would be
at market clearing prices established under the auction rules. The new CBR tariff provides for a
cost-based price for wholesale sales of less than a year. On December 18, 2008, the FERC issued an
order conditionally accepting the MBR tariff subject to certain revisions to the auction proposal.
On January 21, 2009, Southern Company made a compliance filing that accepted all the conditions of
the MBR tariff order. When this order becomes final, Southern Company will have 30 days to
implement the wholesale auction. On December 31, 2008, the FERC issued an order conditionally
accepting the CBR tariff subject to providing additional information concerning one aspect of the
tariff. On January 30, 2009, Southern Company filed a response addressing the FERC inquiry to the
CBR tariff order. Implementation of the energy auction in accordance with the MBR tariff order is
expected to adequately mitigate going forward any presumption of market power that Southern Company
may have in the Southern Company retail service territory. The timing of when the FERC may issue
the final orders on the MBR and CBR tariffs and the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be
determined at this time.

Intercompany Interchange Contract

The Company’s generation fleet in its retail service territory is operated under the Intercompany
Interchange Contract (IIC), as approved by the FERC. In May 2005, the FERC initiated a new
proceeding to examine (1) the provisions of the IIC among the traditional operating companies,
Southern Power, and SCS, as agent, under the terms of which the power pool of Southern Company is
operated, (2) whether any parties to the IIC have violated the FERC’s standards of conduct
applicable to utility companies that are transmission providers, and (3) whether Southern Company’s
code of conduct defining Southern Power as a “system company” rather than a “marketing affiliate”
is just and reasonable. In connection with the formation of Southern Power, the FERC authorized
Southern Power’s inclusion in the IIC in 2000. The FERC also previously approved Southern
Company’s code of conduct.

In October 2006, the FERC issued an order accepting a settlement resolving the proceeding subject
to Southern Company’s agreement to accept certain modifications to the settlement’s terms and
Southern Company notified the FERC that it accepted the modifications. The modifications largely
involve functional separation and information restrictions related to marketing activities
conducted on behalf of Southern Power. In November 2006, Southern Company filed with the FERC a
compliance plan in connection with the order. In April 2007, the FERC approved, with certain
modifications, the plan submitted by Southern Company. Implementation of the plan did not have a
material impact on the Company’s financial statements. In November 2007, Southern Company notified
the FERC that the plan had been implemented. On December 12, 2008, the FERC division of audits
issued for public comment its final audit report pertaining to compliance implementation and
related matters. No comments challenging the audit report’s findings were submitted. A decision
is now pending from the FERC.

Generation Interconnection Agreements

In November 2004, generator company subsidiaries of Tenaska, Inc. (Tenaska), as counterparties to
three previously executed interconnection agreements with subsidiaries of Southern Company, filed
complaints at the FERC requesting that the FERC modify the agreements and that those Southern
Company subsidiaries refund a total of $19 million previously paid for interconnection facilities.
No other similar complaints are pending with the FERC.

In January 2007, the FERC issued an order granting Tenaska’s requested relief. Although the FERC’s
order required the modification of Tenaska’s interconnection agreements, under the provisions of
the order, Southern Company determined that no refund was payable to Tenaska. Southern Company
requested rehearing asserting that the FERC retroactively applied a new principle to existing
interconnection agreements. Tenaska requested rehearing of FERC’s methodology for determining the
amount of refunds. The requested rehearings were denied, and Southern Company and Tenaska have
appealed the orders to the U.S. Circuit Court for the District of Columbia. The final outcome of
this matter cannot now be determined.

Right of Way Litigation

Southern Company and certain of its subsidiaries, including Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Gulf
Power, Mississippi Power, and Southern Telecom, Inc. (a subsidiary of SouthernLINC Wireless), have
been named as defendants in numerous lawsuits brought by landowners since 2001. The plaintiffs’
lawsuits claim that defendants may not use, or sublease to third parties, some or all of the fiber
optic communications lines on the rights of way that cross the plaintiffs’ properties and that such
actions exceed the easements or other property rights held by defendants. The plaintiffs assert
claims for, among other things, trespass and unjust enrichment and seek compensatory and punitive
damages and injunctive relief. Management of Southern Company and its subsidiaries believe that
they have complied with applicable laws and that the plaintiffs’ claims are without merit.

To date, Mississippi Power has entered into agreements with plaintiffs in approximately 95% of the
actions pending against Mississippi Power to clarify its easement rights in the State of
Mississippi. These agreements have been approved by the Circuit Courts of Harrison County and
Jasper County, Mississippi (First Judicial Circuit), and dismissals of the related cases are in
progress. These agreements have not resulted in any material effects on Southern Company’s
financial statements.

In addition, in late 2001, certain subsidiaries of Southern Company, including Alabama Power,
Georgia Power, Gulf Power, Mississippi Power, and Southern Telecom, Inc. (a subsidiary of
SouthernLINC Wireless), were named as defendants in a lawsuit brought in Troup County, Georgia,
Superior Court by Interstate Fiber Network, a subsidiary of telecommunications company ITC
DeltaCom, Inc. that uses certain of the defendants’ rights of way. This lawsuit alleges, among
other things, that the defendants are contractually obligated to indemnify, defend, and hold
harmless the telecommunications company from any liability that may be assessed against it in
pending and future right of way litigation. The Company believes that the plaintiff’s claims are
without merit. In the fall of 2004, the trial court stayed the case until resolution of the
underlying landowner litigation discussed above. In January 2005, the Georgia Court of Appeals
dismissed the telecommunications company’s appeal of the trial court’s order for lack of
jurisdiction. An adverse outcome in this matter, combined with an adverse outcome against the
telecommunications company in one or more of the right of way lawsuits, could result in substantial
judgments; however, the final outcome of these matters cannot now be determined.

Income Tax Matters

Leveraged Leases

In 2002, the IRS began the examination of three sale-in-lease-out (SILO) transactions entered into
by Southern Company. As a result of this examination, the IRS challenged the deductions related to
these transactions. Southern disagreed with the IRS’s conclusion, went through all administrative
appeals, paid approximately $168 million of the additional tax, and sued the IRS for the refund of
such taxes.

During the second quarter 2008, decisions in favor of the IRS were reached in several court cases
involving other taxpayers with similar leveraged lease investments. Pursuant to the application of
FIN 48 and FASB Staff Position No. FAS 13-2, “Accounting for a Change or Projected Change in the
Timing of Cash Flows Relating to Income Taxes Generated by a Leveraged Lease Transaction,”
management is required to assess on a periodic basis, the likely outcome of the uncertain tax
positions related to the SILO transactions. Based on these accounting standards and management’s
review of the recent court decisions, Southern Company recorded an after-tax charge of
approximately $67 million in the second quarter 2008.

On December 12, 2008, Southern Company received from the Commissioner of the IRS an invitation to
participate in a global settlement initiative related to the SILO transactions. Southern Company
accepted the settlement offer on January 8, 2009. Pursuant to the settlement offer, Southern
Company recorded an additional after-tax charge in the fourth quarter 2008 of $16 million.
Including charges recorded in the second quarter 2008, total after-tax

II-80


NOTES (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

charges related to settling the SILO litigation amounted to $83 million in 2008. Of the total,
approximately $7 million represents interest and $76 million represents non-cash charges related to
the reallocation of lease income and will be recognized in income over the remaining term of the
affected leases. A final closing agreement with the IRS is expected to be completed in the first
quarter 2009. At that time, Southern Company will make a cash payment to the IRS of approximately
$113 million. This payment will represent $120 million related to the timing of tax benefits
recognized in prior year tax returns, partially offset by $7 million in interest refunds. The
settlement of the SILO issue represented a significant non-cash operating transaction due to the
deposits previously paid to the IRS. This resulted in a reduction to other current assets of
approximately $207 million, a reduction of approximately $168 million in accrued taxes, and a
reduction of approximately $39 million in other current liabilities.

Georgia State Income Tax Credits

Georgia Power’s 2005 through 2008 income tax filings for the State of Georgia include state income
tax credits for increased activity through Georgia ports. Georgia Power has also filed similar
claims for the years 2002 through 2004. The Georgia Department of Revenue has not responded to
these claims. In July 2007, Georgia Power filed a complaint in the Superior Court of Fulton County
to recover the credits claimed for the years 2002 through 2004. An unrecognized tax benefit has
been recorded related to these credits. See Note 5 under “Unrecognized Tax Benefits” for
additional information. If Georgia Power prevails, these claims could have a significant, and
possibly material, positive effect on Southern Company’s net income. If Georgia Power is not
successful, payment of the related state tax could have a significant, and possibly material,
negative effect on Southern Company’s cash flow. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot now be
determined.

Alabama Power Retail Regulatory Matters

Alabama Power operates under a Rate Stabilization and Equalization Plan (Rate RSE) approved by the
Alabama PSC. Prior to 2007, Rate RSE provided for periodic annual adjustments based upon Alabama
Power’s earned return on end-of-period retail common equity. Effective January 2007 and
thereafter, Rate RSE adjustments are based on forward-looking information for the applicable
upcoming calendar year. Rate adjustments for any two-year period, when averaged together, cannot
exceed 4% per year and any annual adjustment is limited to 5%. Prior to January 2007, annual
adjustments were limited to 3.0%. Retail rates remain unchanged when the retail return on common
equity (ROE) is projected to be between 13% and 14.5%. If Alabama Power’s actual retail ROE is
above the allowed equity return range, customer refunds will be required; however, there is no
provision for additional customer billings should the actual retail ROE fall below the allowed
equity return range. The Rate RSE increase for 2008 was 3.24%, or $147 million annually and was
effective in January 2008. On October 7, 2008, the Alabama PSC approved a corrective rate package
primarily providing for adjustments associated with customer charges to certain existing rate
structures. This package, effective in January 2009, is expected to generate additional annual
revenues of approximately $168 million. Alabama Power expects these additional revenues will
preclude the need for a rate adjustment under the Rate RSE in 2009 and agreed to a moratorium on
any increase in 2009 under Rate RSE. On December 1, 2008, Alabama Power made its submission of
projected data for calendar year 2009. The ratemaking procedures will remain in effect until the
Alabama PSC votes to modify or discontinue them.

The Alabama PSC has also approved a rate mechanism that provides for adjustments to recognize the
cost of placing new generating facilities in retail service and for the recovery of retail costs
associated with certificated purchased power agreements (Rate CNP). The annual true-up adjustment
effective in April 2006 increased retail rates by 0.5%, or $19 million annually. In April 2007,
there was no adjustment to Rate CNP.

II-81


NOTES (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

Rate CNP also allows for the recovery of Alabama Power’s retail costs associated with environmental
laws, regulations, or other such mandates. The rate mechanism, based on forward-looking
information, began operation in January 2005 and provides for the recovery of these costs pursuant
to a factor that will be calculated annually. Environmental costs to be recovered include
operations and maintenance expenses, depreciation, and a return on invested capital. Retail rates
increased due to environmental costs approximately 1.2% in January 2006, 0.6% in January 2007, and
2.4% in January 2008. On October 7, 2008, Alabama Power agreed to defer any increase in rates
during 2009 under the portion of Rate CNP which permits recovery of costs associated with
environmental laws and regulations until 2010. The deferral of the retail rate adjustments will
have no significant effect on Southern Company’s revenues or net income, but will have an
immaterial impact on annual cash flows. On December 1, 2008, Alabama Power made its submission of
projected data for calendar year 2009.

Alabama Power fuel costs are recovered under Rate ECR (Energy Cost Recovery), which provides for
the addition of a fuel and energy cost factor to base rates. In June 2007, the Alabama PSC
approved Alabama Power’s request to increase the retail energy cost recovery rate to 3.100 cents
per kilowatt hour (KWH), effective with billings beginning July 2007 for the 30-month period ending
December 2009. On October 7, 2008, the Alabama PSC approved an increase in Alabama Power’s Rate
ECR factor to 3.983 cents per KWH for a 24-month period beginning with October 9, 2008 billings.
Thereafter, the Rate ECR factor shall be 5.910 cents per KWH, absent a contrary order by the
Alabama PSC. During the 24-month period, Alabama Power will be allowed to continue to include a
carrying charge associated with the under recovered fuel costs in the fuel expense calculation. In
the event the application of this increased Rate ECR factor results in an over recovered position
during this period, Alabama Power will pay interest on any such over recovered balance at the same
rate used to derive the carrying cost. Accordingly, this approved increase in the billing factor
will have no significant effect on Southern Company’s revenues or net income, but will increase
annual cash flow. As of December 31, 2008, Alabama Power had an under recovered fuel balance of
approximately $306 million, of which approximately $181 million is included in deferred charges and
other assets in the balance sheets.

Georgia Power Retail Regulatory Matters

In December 2007, the Georgia PSC approved the 2007 Retail Rate Plan. Under the 2007 Retail Rate
Plan, Georgia Power’s earnings will continue to be evaluated against a retail ROE range of 10.25%
to 12.25%. Two-thirds of any earnings above 12.25% will be applied to rate refunds with the
remaining one-third applied to an environmental compliance cost recovery (ECCR) tariff. There were
no refunds related to earnings for the year 2008. Georgia Power has agreed that it will not file
for a general base rate increase during this period unless its projected retail ROE falls below
10.25%. Retail base rates increased by approximately $99.7 million effective January 1, 2008 to
provide for cost recovery of transmission, distribution, generation, and other investments, as well
as increased operating costs. In addition, the ECCR tariff was implemented to allow for the
recovery of costs for required environmental projects mandated by state and federal regulations.
The ECCR tariff increased rates by approximately $222 million effective January 1, 2008. Georgia
Power is required to file a general rate case by July 1, 2010, in response to which the Georgia PSC
would be expected to determine whether the 2007 Retail Rate Plan should be continued, modified, or
discontinued.

In December 2004, the Georgia PSC approved the retail rate plan for the years 2005 through 2007
(2004 Retail Rate Plan) for Georgia Power. Under the terms of the 2004 Retail Rate Plan, Georgia
Power’s earnings were evaluated against a retail ROE range of 10.25% to 12.25%. Two-thirds of any
earnings above 12.25% were applied to rate refunds, with the remaining one-third retained by
Georgia Power. Retail rates and customer fees increased by approximately $203 million effective
January 1, 2005 to cover the higher costs of purchased power, operating and maintenance expenses,
environmental compliance, and continued investment in new generation, transmission, and
distribution facilities to support growth and ensure reliability. In 2007, Georgia Power refunded
2005 earnings above 12.25% retail ROE. There were no refunds related to earnings for 2006 or 2007.

II-82


NOTES (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

Georgia Power has established fuel cost recovery rates approved by the Georgia PSC. The Georgia
PSC approved increases in Georgia Power’s total annual billings of approximately $383 million
effective March 2007 and approximately $222 million effective June 1, 2008. The Georgia PSC order
also requires Georgia Power to file for a new fuel cost recovery rate no later than March 1, 2009.
On February 19, 2009, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power’s request to delay the filing of that
case until March 13, 2009. The new rates are expected to become effective on June 1, 2009. As of
December 31, 2008, Georgia Power had an under recovered fuel balance of approximately $764 million,
of which approximately $426 million is included in deferred charges and other assets in the balance
sheets.

Gulf Power Retail Regulatory Matters

On July 29, 2008, the Florida PSC approved Gulf Power’s request to increase the fuel cost recovery
factor effective with billings beginning September 2008. The remaining portion of the projected
under recovered balance is expected to be recovered in 2009. On September 2, 2008, Gulf Power
filed its 2009 projected fuel cost recovery filing with the Florida PSC which includes the fuel
factors proposed for January 2009 through December 2009. On October 13, 2008, Gulf Power notified
the Florida PSC that the updated projected fuel cost under recovery balance at year-end exceeds the
10% threshold, but no adjustment to the fuel factor was requested. On November 6, 2008, the
Florida PSC approved an increase of approximately 12.9% in the fuel factor for retail customers
effective with billings beginning January 2009. The fuel factors are intended to allow Gulf Power
to recover its projected 2009 fuel and purchased power costs as well as the 2008 under recovered
amounts in 2009. Fuel cost recovery revenues, as recorded on the financial statements, are
adjusted for differences in actual recoverable costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates.
Accordingly, changing the billing factor has no significant effect on Southern Company’s revenues
or net income, but does impact annual cash flow. As of December 31, 2008, Gulf Power had an under
recovered fuel balance of approximately $97 million, which is included in current assets in the
balance sheets.

Storm Damage Cost Recovery

Each traditional operating company maintains a reserve to cover the cost of damages from major
storms to its transmission and distribution lines and generally the cost of uninsured damages to
its generation facilities and other property. In addition, each traditional operating company
affected by recent hurricanes has been authorized by its state PSC to defer the portion of the
hurricane restoration costs that exceeded the balance in its storm damage reserve account. As of
December 31, 2008, the under recovered balance in Southern Company’s storm damage reserve accounts
totaled approximately $27 million, of which approximately $21 million and $6 million, respectively,
are included in the balance sheets herein under “Other Current Assets” and “Other Regulatory
Assets.”

In August 2005, Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast of the United States and caused significant
damage within Mississippi Power’s service area. The estimated total storm restoration costs
relating to Hurricane Katrina through December 31, 2007 of $302.4 million, which was net of
expected insurance proceeds of approximately $77 million, without offset for the property damage
reserve of $3.0 million, was affirmed by the Mississippi PSC in June 2006, and Mississippi Power
was ordered to establish a regulatory asset for the retail portion. The Mississippi PSC issued an
order directing Mississippi Power to file an application with the Mississippi Development Authority
(MDA) for a Community Development Block Grant (CDBG). In October 2006, Mississippi Power received
from the MDA a CDBG in the amount of $276.4 million, which was allocated to both the retail and
wholesale jurisdictions. In the same month, the Mississippi PSC issued a financing order that
authorized the issuance of system restoration bonds for the remaining $25.2 million of the retail
portion of storm recovery costs not covered by the CDBG. These funds were received in June 2007.
Mississippi Power affirmed the $302.4 million total storm costs incurred as of December 31, 2007.
Mississippi Power plans to file with the Mississippi PSC its final accounting of the restoration
cost relating to Hurricane Katrina and the storm operations center by the end of the first quarter
2009, at which time the final net retail receivable of approximately $3.2 million is expected to be
recovered.

II-83


NOTES (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

In July 2006, the Florida PSC issued its order approving a stipulation and settlement between Gulf
Power and several consumer groups that resolved all matters relating to Gulf Power’s request for
recovery of incurred costs for storm-recovery activities and the replenishment of Gulf Power’s
property damage reserve. The order provided for an extension of the storm-recovery surcharge then
being collected by Gulf Power for an additional 27 months, expiring in June 2009. Funds collected
by Gulf Power related to the storm recovery costs associated with previous hurricanes had been
fully recovered by August 31, 2008. Funds collected by Gulf Power through its storm recovery
surcharge are now being credited to the property damage reserve and will continue though June 2009
when the approved surcharge ends. The Florida PSC-approved annual accrual to the property damage
reserve is $3.5 million, with a target level for the reserve between $25.1 million and $36.0
million. The Florida PSC also authorized Gulf Power to make additional accruals above the $3.5
million at Gulf Power’s discretion. Gulf Power accrued total expenses of $3.5 million in 2008,
$3.5 million in 2007, and $6.5 million in 2006. According to the order, in the case of future
storms, if Gulf Power incurs cumulative costs for storm-recovery activities in excess of $10
million during any calendar year, Gulf Power will be permitted to file a streamlined formal request
for an interim surcharge. Any interim surcharge would provide for the recovery, subject to refund,
of up to 80% of the claimed costs for storm-recovery activities. Gulf Power would then petition
the Florida PSC for full recovery through an additional surcharge or other cost recovery mechanism.
As of December 31, 2008, Gulf Power’s balance in the property damage reserve totaled approximately
$9.8 million which is included in the balance sheets under deferred liabilities.

Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle

On January 16, 2009, Mississippi Power filed for a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity
with the Mississippi PSC to allow construction of a new electric generating plant located in Kemper
County, Mississippi. The plant would utilize an advanced integrated coal gasification combined
cycle (IGCC) with an output capacity of 582 megawatts. The Kemper IGCC will use locally mined
lignite (an abundant, lower heating value coal) from a proposed mine adjacent to the plant as fuel.
This certificate, if approved by the Mississippi PSC, would authorize Mississippi Power to
acquire, construct and operate the Kemper IGCC and related facilities. The Kemper IGCC, subject to
federal and state environmental reviews and certain regulatory approvals, is expected to begin
commercial operation in November 2013. As part of its filing, Mississippi Power has requested
certain rate recovery treatment in accordance with the base load construction legislation.

Mississippi Power filed an application in June 2006 with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for
certain tax credits available to projects using clean coal technologies under the Energy Policy Act
of 2005. The DOE subsequently certified the Kemper IGCC, and in November 2006 the IRS allocated
Internal Revenue Code Section 48A tax credits of $133 million to Mississippi Power. The
utilization of these credits is dependent upon meeting the certification requirements for the
Kemper IGCC, including an in-service date no later than November 2013. Mississippi Power has
secured all environmental reviews and permits necessary to commence construction of the Kemper IGCC
and has entered into a binding contract for the steam turbine generator, completing two milestone
requirements for the Section 48A credits.

On February 14, 2008, Mississippi Power also requested that the DOE transfer the remaining funds
previously granted to a cancelled Southern Company project that would have been located in Orlando,
Florida. On December 12, 2008, an agreement was reached to assign the remaining funds to the
Kemper IGCC. The estimated construction cost of the Kemper IGCC is approximately $2.2 billion,
which is net of $220 million related to funding to be received from the DOE related to project
construction. The remaining DOE funding of $50 million is projected to be used for demonstration
over the first few years of operation.

Beginning in December 2006, the Mississippi PSC has approved Mississippi Power’s requested
accounting treatment to defer the costs associated with Mississippi Power’s generation resource
planning, evaluation, and screening activities as a regulatory asset. On December 22, 2008,
Mississippi Power requested an amendment to its original order that would allow these costs to
continue to be charged to and remain in a regulatory asset until January 1, 2010. In its
application, Mississippi Power reported that it anticipated spending approximately $61

II-84

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

million by or before May 31, 2009. At December 31, 2008, Mississippi Power had spent $42.3 million
of the $61 million, of which $3.7 million related to land purchases capitalized. Of the remaining

The final outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.

Nuclear

In August 2006, Southern Nuclear, on behalf of Georgia Power, Oglethorpe Power Corporation (OPC),
the Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia (MEAG Power), and the City of Dalton, Georgia, an
incorporated municipality in the State of Georgia acting by and through its Board of Water, Light
and Sinking Fund Commissioners (collectively, Owners), filed an application with the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission (NRC) for an early site permit relating to two additional nuclear units on
the site of Plant Vogtle. See Note 4 to the financial statements for additional information on
these co-owners. On March 31, 2008, Southern Nuclear filed an application with the NRC for a
combined construction and operating license (COL) for the new units.

On April 8, 2008, Georgia Power, acting for itself and as agent for the Owners, and a consortium
consisting of Westinghouse Electric Company LLC and Stone & Webster, Inc. (collectively,
Consortium) entered into an engineering, procurement, and construction agreement to design,
engineer, procure, construct, and test two AP1000 nuclear units with electric generating capacity
of approximately 1,100 megawatts each and related facilities, structures, and improvements at Plant
Vogtle (Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement).

The Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement is an arrangement whereby the Consortium supplies and constructs the
entire facility with the exception of certain items provided by the Owners. Under the terms of the
Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement, the Owners will pay a purchase price that will be subject to certain
price escalation and adjustments, adjustments for change orders, and performance bonuses. Each
Owner is severally (and not jointly) liable for its proportionate share, based on its ownership
interest, of all amounts owed to the Consortium under the Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement. Georgia
Power’s proportionate share, based on its current ownership interest, is 45.7%. Under the terms of
a separate joint development agreement, the Owners finalized their ownership percentages on July 2,
2008, except for allowed changes, under certain limited circumstances, during the Georgia PSC
certification process.

On August 1, 2008, Georgia Power submitted an application for the Georgia PSC to certify the
project. Hearings began November 3, 2008 and a final certification decision is expected in March
2009.

If certified by the Georgia PSC and licensed by the NRC, Vogtle Units 3 and 4 are scheduled to be
placed in service in 2016 and 2017, respectively. The total plant value to be placed in service
will also include financing costs for each of the Owners, the impacts of inflation on costs, and
transmission and other costs that are the responsibility of the Owners. Georgia Power’s
proportionate share of the estimated in-service costs, based on its current ownership interest, is
approximately $6.4 billion, subject to adjustments and performance bonuses under the Vogtle 3 and 4
Agreement.

The Owners and the Consortium have agreed to certain liquidated damages upon the Consortium’s
failure to comply with the schedule and performance guarantees. The Owners and the Consortium also
have agreed to certain bonuses payable to the Consortium for early completion and unit performance.
The Consortium’s liability to the Owners for schedule and performance liquidated damages and
warranty claims is subject to a cap.

The obligations of Westinghouse Electric Company LLC and Stone & Webster, Inc. under the Vogtle 3
and 4 Agreement are guaranteed by Toshiba Corporation and The Shaw Group, Inc., respectively. In
the event of certain credit rating downgrades of any Owner, such Owner will be required to provide
a letter of credit or other credit enhancement.

NOTES (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

The Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement is subject to certification by the Georgia PSC. In addition, the
Owners may terminate the Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement at any time for their convenience, provided that
the Owners will be required to pay certain termination costs and, at certain stages of the work,
cancellation fees to the Consortium. The Consortium may terminate the Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement
under certain circumstances, including delays in receipt of the COL or delivery of full notice to
proceed, certain Owner suspension or delays of work, action by a governmental authority to
permanently stop work, certain breaches of the Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement by the Owners, Owner
insolvency, and certain other events.

Southern Company also is participating in NuStart Energy Development, LLC (NuStart Energy), a
broad-based nuclear industry consortium formed to share the cost of developing a COL and the
related NRC review. NuStart Energy was organized to complete detailed engineering design work and
to prepare COL applications for two advanced reactor designs. COLs for the two reactor designs were
submitted to the NRC during the fourth quarter of 2007. The COLs ultimately are expected to be
transferred to one or more of the consortium companies; however, at this time, none of them have
committed to build a new nuclear plant.

Southern Company is also exploring other possibilities relating to additional nuclear power
projects, both on its own or in partnership with other utilities. The final outcome of these
matters cannot now be determined.

Nuclear Fuel Disposal Costs

Alabama Power and Georgia Power have contracts with the United States, acting through the DOE,
which provide for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel. The DOE failed to begin disposing
of spent nuclear fuel in 1998 as required by the contracts, and Alabama Power and Georgia Power are
pursuing legal remedies against the government for breach of contract.

In July 2007, the U.S. Court of Federal Claims awarded Georgia Power approximately $30 million,
based on its ownership interests, and awarded Alabama Power approximately $17 million, representing
substantially all of the direct costs of the expansion of spent nuclear fuel storage facilities at
Plants Farley, Hatch, and Vogtle from 1998 through 2004. In July 2007, the government filed a
motion for reconsideration, which was denied in November 2007. On January 2, 2008, the government
filed an appeal, and on February 29, 2008, filed a motion to stay the appeal. On April 1, 2008,
the court granted the government’s motion to stay the appeal pending the court’s decisions in three
other similar cases already on appeal. Those cases were decided in August 2008. Based on the
rulings in those cases, the appeal is expected to proceed in first quarter 2009.

On April 3, 2008, a second claim against the government was filed for damages incurred after
December 31, 2004 (the court-mandated cut-off in the original claim), due to the government’s
alleged continuing breach of contract. On October 31, 2008, the court denied a similar request by
the government to stay this proceeding. The complaint does not contain any specific dollar amount
for recovery of damages. Damages will continue to accumulate until the issue is resolved or the
storage is provided. No amounts have been recognized in the financial statements as of December
31, 2008 for either claim. The final outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time,
but no material impact on net income is expected as any damage amounts collected from the
government are expected to be returned to customers.

Sufficient pool storage capacity for spent fuel is available at Plant Vogtle to maintain full-core
discharge capability for both units into 2014. Expanded wet storage capacity and construction of
an on-site dry storage facility at Plant Vogtle is expected to begin in sufficient time to maintain
pool full-core discharge capability. At Plants Hatch and Farley, on-site dry storage facilities
are operational and can be expanded to accommodate spent fuel through the expected life of each
plant.

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

At December 31, 2008, Southern Company had a State of Georgia net operating loss (NOL) carryforward
totaling $1.0 billion, which could result in net state income tax benefits of $57 million, if
utilized. However, Southern Company has established a valuation allowance for the potential $57
million tax benefit due to the remote likelihood that the tax benefit will be realized. These NOLs
will expire between 2009 and 2021. During 2008, Southern Company utilized $5.8 million in
available NOLs, which resulted in a $0.3 million state income tax benefit. The State of Georgia
allows the filing of a combined return, which should substantially reduce any additional NOL
carryforwards.

At December 31, 2008, the tax-related regulatory assets and liabilities were $972 million and $260
million, respectively. These assets are attributable to tax benefits flowed through to customers in
prior years and to taxes applicable to capitalized interest. These liabilities are attributable to
deferred taxes previously recognized at rates higher than the current enacted tax law and to
unamortized investment tax credits.

In accordance with regulatory requirements, deferred investment tax credits are amortized over the
lives of the related property with such amortization normally applied as a credit to reduce
depreciation in the statements of income. Credits amortized in this manner amounted to $23 million
in 2008, $23 million in 2007, and $23 million in 2006. At December 31, 2008, all investment tax
credits available to reduce federal income taxes payable had been utilized.

Southern Company’s effective tax rate increased due to the unavailability of the synthetic fuel tax
credits in 2008. The credits were no longer allowed under Internal Revenue Code Section 45K for
production after December 31, 2007.

The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 created a tax deduction for a portion of income attributable
to U. S. production activities as defined in the Internal Revenue Code Section 199 (production
activities deduction). The deduction is equal to a stated percentage of qualified production
activities net income. The percentage is phased in over the years 2005 through 2010 with a 3% rate
applicable to the years 2005 and 2006, a 6% rate applicable for years 2007 through 2009, and a 9%
rate thereafter. This increase from 3% in 2006 to 6% in 2007 was one of several

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

factors that increased Southern Company’s 2007 deduction by $32 million over the 2006 deduction.
The resulting additional tax benefit was $11 million. The IRS has not clearly defined a methodology
for calculating this deduction. However, Southern Company has agreed with the IRS on a calculation
methodology and signed a closing agreement on December 11, 2008. Therefore, Southern Company reversed the unrecognized tax benefit and
adjusted the deduction for all previous years to conform to the agreement which resulted in a
decrease in the 2008 deduction when compared to the 2007 deduction. The net impact of the reversal
of the unrecognized tax benefits combined with the application of the new methodology had no
material effect on the Company’s financial statements.

In 2007, Georgia Power donated 2,200 acres of land in the Tallulah Gorge State Park to the State of
Georgia. The estimated value of the donation caused a lower effective income tax rate for the year
ended December 31, 2007, when compared to December 31, 2008.

Unrecognized Tax Benefits

FIN 48 requires companies to determine whether it is “more likely than not” that a tax position
will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities before any part of the
benefit can be recorded in the financial statements. It also provides guidance on the recognition,
measurement, and classification of income tax uncertainties, along with any related interest and
penalties. For 2008, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits decreased by $118 million,
resulting in a balance of $146 million as of December 31, 2008.

Changes during the year in unrecognized tax benefits were as follows:

The tax positions from current periods increase for 2008 relate primarily to the Georgia state tax
credits litigation and other miscellaneous uncertain tax positions. The tax positions from prior
periods increase for 2008 relate primarily to the SILO transactions that was remeasured during the
second quarter 2008 and effectively settled in December 2008. The reduction due to settlements
relates to the agreement with the IRS on the SILO transactions and the agreement with the IRS
regarding the production activities deduction methodology. The results of the effective settlement
of the SILO transactions were related to timing differences and therefore had no impact on income.

Southern Company classifies interest on tax uncertainties as interest expense. The net amount of
interest accrued during the period was primarily associated with the SILO transactions and the
Georgia state tax credit litigation. Interest reclassified due to settlements relates to the SILO
transactions effective settlement agreement and the production activities deduction methodology.
These amounts have been reclassified from interest on tax uncertainties to current interest
payable.

Southern Company did not accrue any penalties on uncertain tax positions.

It is reasonably possible that the amount of the unrecognized benefit with respect to a majority of
Southern Company’s unrecognized tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the
next 12 months. The possible settlement of the Georgia state tax credits litigation and/or the
conclusion or settlement of federal or state audits could impact the balances significantly. At
this time, an estimate of the range of reasonably possible outcomes cannot be determined.

The IRS has audited and closed all tax returns prior to 2004. The audits for the state returns
have either been concluded, or the statute of limitations has expired, for years prior to 2002.

6. FINANCING

Long-Term Debt Payable to Affiliated Trusts

Southern Company and certain of the traditional operating companies have formed certain
wholly-owned trust subsidiaries for the purpose of issuing preferred securities. The proceeds of
the related equity investments and preferred security sales were loaned back to Southern Company or
the applicable traditional operating company through the issuance of junior subordinated notes
totaling $412 million, which constitute substantially all of the assets of these trusts and are
reflected in the balance sheets as “Long-term Debt.” Southern Company and such traditional
operating companies each consider that the mechanisms and obligations relating to the preferred
securities issued for its benefit, taken together, constitute a full and unconditional guarantee by
it of the respective trusts’ payment obligations with respect to these securities. At December 31,
2008, preferred securities of $400 million were outstanding. See Note 1 under “Variable Interest
Entities” for additional information on the accounting treatment for these trusts and the related
securities.

$1.8 billion in 2012; and $950 million in 2013.

Bank Term Loans

Certain of the traditional operating companies entered into bank term loan agreements in 2008.
Georgia Power borrowed $300 million under a three-year term loan agreement and $100 million under a
short-term loan agreement. Gulf Power borrowed $110 million under a three-year loan agreement and
$50 million under a short-term loan agreement. Mississippi Power also borrowed $80 million under a
three-year term loan agreement. The proceeds of these loans were used to repay maturing long-term
and short-term indebtedness and for other general corporate purposes. Another Southern Company
subsidiary had outstanding long-term bank loans of $184 million at December 31, 2008.

Senior Notes

Southern Company and its subsidiaries issued a total of $2.5 billion of senior notes in 2008.
Southern Company issued $600 million, and the traditional operating companies’ combined issuances
totaled $1.9 billion. The proceeds of these issuances were used to repay maturing long-term and
short-term indebtedness and for other general corporate purposes.

At December 31, 2008 and 2007, Southern Company and its subsidiaries had a total of $12.9 billion
and $11.4 billion, respectively, of senior notes outstanding. At December 31, 2008 and 2007,
Southern Company had a total of $1.1 billion and $900 million, respectively, of senior notes
outstanding.

Subsequent to December 31, 2008, Georgia Power issued $500 million long-term senior notes. The
proceeds were used to repay long-term and short-term indebtedness and for other general corporate
purposes.

Assets Subject to Lien

Each of Southern Company’s subsidiaries is organized as a legal entity, separate and apart from
Southern Company and its other subsidiaries. Alabama Power and Gulf Power have granted one or more
liens on certain of their respective property in connection with the issuance of certain pollution
control revenue bonds with an outstanding principal amount of $194 million. There are no
agreements or other arrangements among the subsidiary companies under which the assets of one
company have been pledged or otherwise made available to satisfy obligations of Southern Company or
any of its other subsidiaries.

Approximately $84 million of the credit facilities expiring in 2009 allow the execution of term
loans for an additional two-year period and $544 million allow execution of one-year term loans.
Most of these agreements include stated borrowing rates.

All of the credit arrangements require payment of commitment fees based on the unused portion of
the commitments or the maintenance of compensating balances with the banks. Commitment fees
average one-eighth of 1% or less for Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and
Southern Power. Compensating balances are not legally restricted from withdrawal.

Most of the credit arrangements with banks have covenants that limit debt levels to 65% of total
capitalization, as defined in the agreements. For purposes of these definitions, debt excludes the
long-term debt payable to affiliated trusts and, in certain arrangements, other hybrid securities.
At December 31, 2008, Southern Company, Southern Power, and the traditional operating companies
were each in compliance with their respective debt limit covenants.

In addition, the credit arrangements typically contain cross default provisions that would be
triggered if the borrower defaulted on other indebtedness above a specified threshold. The cross
default provisions are restricted only to the indebtedness, including any guarantee obligations, of
the company that has such credit arrangements. Southern Company and its subsidiaries are currently
in compliance with all such covenants.

A portion of the $4.2 billion unused credit with banks is allocated to provide liquidity support to
the traditional operating companies’ variable rate pollution control revenue bonds. The amount of
variable rate pollution control revenue bonds requiring liquidity support as of December 31, 2008
was approximately $1.3 billion.

Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power make short-term
borrowings primarily through commercial paper programs that have the liquidity support of committed
bank credit arrangements. Southern Company and the traditional operating companies may also borrow
through various other arrangements with banks. The amounts of commercial paper outstanding and
included in notes payable in the balance sheets at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007 were
$794.3 million and $1.2 billion, respectively. The amounts of short-term bank loans included in
notes payable in the balance sheets at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007 were $150 million
and $113 million, respectively.

NOTES (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

During 2008, the peak amount outstanding for short-term debt was $1.7 billion, and the average
amount outstanding was $1.1 billion. The average annual interest rate on short-term debt was 2.7%
for 2008 and 5.3% for 2007.

Financial Instruments

The traditional operating companies and Southern Power enter into energy-related derivatives to
hedge exposures to electricity, gas, and other fuel price changes. However, due to cost-based rate
regulations, the traditional operating companies have limited exposure to market volatility in
commodity fuel prices and prices of electricity. Southern Power also has limited exposure to
market volatility in commodity fuel prices and prices of electricity because its long-term sales
contracts shift substantially all fuel cost responsibility to the purchaser. However, Southern
Power has been and may continue to be exposed to market volatility in energy-related commodity
prices as a result of sales of uncontracted generating capacity. Each of the traditional operating
companies manage fuel-hedging programs implemented per the guidelines of their respective state
PSCs. In addition to hedges on fuel and purchased power, the traditional operating companies and
Southern Power may also enter into hedges of forward electricity sales.

At December 31, the net fair value of energy-related derivative contracts by hedge designation was
reflected in the financial statements as assets/(liabilities) as follows:

Energy-related derivative contracts which are designated as regulatory hedges relate primarily to
the traditional operating companies’ fuel hedging programs, where gains and losses are initially
recorded as regulatory liabilities and assets, respectively, and then are included in fuel expense
as they are recovered through the fuel cost recovery clauses. Gains and losses on energy-related
derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are mainly used by Southern Power to hedge anticipated
purchases and sales and are initially deferred in other comprehensive income before being
recognized in income in the same period as the hedged transactions. Gains and losses on
energy-related derivative contracts that are not designated or fail to qualify as hedges are
recognized in the statements of income as incurred. The pre-tax gains/(losses) reclassified from
other comprehensive income to revenue and fuel expense were not material for any period presented
and are not expected to be material for 2009. Additionally, no material ineffectiveness was
recorded in earnings for any period presented. Southern Company has energy-related hedges in place
up to and including 2012.

During 2006 and 2007, Southern Company had derivatives in place to reduce its exposure to a
phase-out of certain income tax credits related to synthetic fuel production in 2007. In
accordance with Internal Revenue Code Section 45K, these tax credits were subject to limitation as
the annual average price of oil increases. These derivatives settled on January 1, 2008 and thus
there was no income statement impact for the period ended December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2007,
the fair value of all derivative transactions related to synthetic fuel production was a $43
million net asset. For 2007 and 2006, the fair value gain/(loss) recognized in other income
(expense) to mark the transactions to market was $27 million and $(32) million, respectively.

Southern Company and certain subsidiaries also enter into derivatives to hedge exposure to changes
in interest rates. Derivatives related to fixed-rate securities are accounted for as fair value
hedges. Derivatives related to existing variable rate securities or forecasted transactions are
accounted for as cash flow hedges. The derivatives employed as hedging instruments are structured
to minimize ineffectiveness. As such, no material ineffectiveness has been recorded in earnings
for any period presented.

Hedged using the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association
Municipal Swap Index (SIFMA) (formerly the Bond Market Association/PSA
Municipal Swap Index)

For fair value hedges, the changes in the fair value of the hedging derivatives are recorded in
earnings and are offset by the changes in the fair value of the hedged item. The Company did not
have any fair value hedges as of December 31, 2008.

The fair value gains/(losses) for cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income and
are reclassified into earnings at the same time the hedged items affect earnings. In 2008, 2007,
and 2006, the Company incurred net gains/(losses) of $(26) million, $9 million, and $1 million,
respectively, upon termination of certain interest derivatives at the same time it issued debt.
The effective portion of these gains/(losses) has been deferred in other comprehensive income and
will be amortized to interest expense over the life of the original interest derivative. The
Company also settled an interest derivative early because of counterparty credit issues at a loss
of $(2) million. This loss is deferred in other comprehensive income and will be amortized into
earnings once the forecasted debt is issued in 2009. For 2008, 2007, and 2006, approximately $(19)
million, $(15) million, and $(1) million, respectively, of pre-tax losses were reclassified from
other comprehensive income to interest expense. For 2009, pre-tax losses of approximately $(34)
million are expected to be reclassified from other comprehensive income to interest expense. The
Company has interest-related hedges in place through 2019 and has deferred realized gains/(losses)
that are being amortized through 2037.

Subsequent to December 31, 2008, Georgia Power settled $100 million of hedges related to the
forecasted debt issuance in February 2009 at a loss of approximately $16 million. This loss will
be amortized into earnings over 10 years.

All derivative financial instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are
measured at fair value. See Note 10 for additional information.

7. COMMITMENTS

Construction Program

Southern Company is engaged in continuous construction programs, currently estimated to total $5.7
billion in 2009, $5.1 billion in 2010, and $5.8 billion in 2011. These amounts include $187
million, $151 million, and $150 million in 2009, 2010, and 2011, respectively, for construction
expenditures related to contractual purchase commitments for nuclear fuel included herein under
“Fuel and Purchased Power Commitments.” The construction programs are subject to periodic review
and revision, and actual construction costs may vary from these estimates because of numerous
factors. These factors include: changes in business conditions; changes in load projections;
changes in environmental statutes and regulations; changes in nuclear plants to meet new regulatory
requirements; changes in FERC rules and regulations; PSC approvals; the cost and efficiency of
construction labor, equipment, and materials; and the cost of capital. In addition, there can be
no assurance that costs related to capital expenditures will be fully recovered. At December 31,
2008, significant purchase commitments were outstanding in connection with the ongoing construction
program, which includes new facilities and capital improvements to transmission, distribution, and
generation facilities, including those to meet environmental standards.

Long-Term Service Agreements

The traditional operating companies and Southern Power have entered into Long-Term Service
Agreements (LTSAs) with General Electric (GE), Alstom Power, Inc., Mitsubishi Power Systems
Americas, Inc., and Siemens AG for the purpose of securing maintenance support for the combined
cycle and combustion turbine generating facilities owned or under construction by the subsidiaries.
The LTSAs cover all planned inspections on the covered equipment, which generally includes the
cost of all labor and materials. The LTSAs are also obligated to cover the costs of unplanned
maintenance on the covered equipment subject to limits and scope specified in each contract.

In general, these LTSAs are in effect through two major inspection cycles per unit. Scheduled
payments under the LTSAs, which are subject to price escalation, are made at various intervals
based on actual operating hours or number of gas turbine starts of the respective units. Total
remaining payments under these agreements for facilities owned are currently estimated at $2.3
billion over the remaining life of the agreements, which are currently estimated to range up to 28
years. However, the LTSAs contain various cancellation provisions at the option of the purchasers.

Georgia Power has also entered into an LTSA with GE through 2014 for neutron monitoring system
parts and electronics at Plant Hatch. Total remaining payments to GE under this agreement are
currently estimated at $10 million. The contract contains cancellation provisions at the option of
Georgia Power.

Payments made under the LTSAs prior to the performance of any work are recorded as a prepayment in
the balance sheets. All work performed is capitalized or charged to expense (net of any joint
owner billings), as appropriate based on the nature of the work.

Limestone Commitments

As part of Southern Company’s program to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions from its coal plants, the
traditional operating companies have begun construction of flue gas desulfurization projects and
have entered into various long-term commitments for the procurement of limestone to be used in such
equipment. Limestone contracts are structured with tonnage minimums and maximums in order to
account for fluctuations in coal burn and sulfur content. Southern Company has a minimum
contractual obligation of 7.5 million tons, equating to approximately $299 million, through 2019.
Estimated expenditures (based on minimum contracted obligated dollars) over the next five years
are, $13 million in 2009, $35 million in 2010, $35 million in 2011, $36 million in 2012, and $36
million in 2013.

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

Fuel and Purchased Power Commitments

To supply a portion of the fuel requirements of the generating plants, Southern Company has entered
into various long-term commitments for the procurement of fossil and nuclear fuel. In most cases,
these contracts contain provisions for price escalations, minimum purchase levels, and other
financial commitments. Coal commitments include forward contract purchases for sulfur dioxide and
nitrogen oxide emission allowances. Natural gas purchase commitments contain fixed volumes with
prices based on various indices at the time of delivery; amounts included in the chart below
represent estimates based on New York Mercantile Exchange future prices at December 31, 2008.
Also, Southern Company has entered into various long-term commitments for the purchase of capacity
and electricity. Total estimated minimum long-term obligations at December 31, 2008 were as
follows:

charges for nuclear fuel included in fuel expense amounted to $147 million in 2008, $144 million in
2007, and $137 million in 2006.

Operating Leases

In 2001, Mississippi Power began the initial 10-year term of a lease agreement for a combined cycle
generating facility built at Plant Daniel for approximately $370 million. In 2003, the generating
facility was acquired by Juniper Capital L.P. (Juniper), whose partners are unaffiliated with
Mississippi Power. Simultaneously, Juniper entered into a restructured lease agreement with
Mississippi Power. Juniper has also entered into leases with other parties unrelated to
Mississippi Power. The assets leased by Mississippi Power comprise less than 50% of Juniper’s
assets. Mississippi Power is not required to consolidate the leased assets and related
liabilities, and the lease with Juniper is considered an operating lease. The initial lease term
ends in 2011, and the lease includes a purchase and renewal option based on the cost of the
facility at the inception of the lease. Mississippi Power is required to amortize approximately 4%
of the initial acquisition cost over the initial lease term. Eighteen months prior to the end of
the initial lease, Mississippi Power may elect to renew for 10 years. If the lease is renewed, the
agreement calls for Mississippi Power to amortize an additional 17% of the initial completion cost
over the renewal period. Upon termination of the lease, at Mississippi Power’s option, it may
either exercise its purchase option or the facility can be sold to a third party.

The lease provides for a residual value guarantee, approximately 73% of the acquisition cost, by
Mississippi Power that is due upon termination of the lease in the event that Mississippi Power
does not renew the lease or purchase the assets and that the fair market value is less than the
unamortized cost of the asset. A liability of approximately $5 million, $7 million, and $9 million
for the fair market value of this residual value guarantee is included in the balance sheets as of
December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively.

Southern Company also has other operating lease agreements with various terms and expiration dates.
Total operating lease expenses were $184 million, $187 million, and $181 million for 2008, 2007,
and 2006, respectively. Southern Company includes any step rents, escalations, and lease
concessions in its computation of minimum lease payments, which are recognized on a straight-line
basis over the minimum lease term.

II-97


NOTES (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

For the traditional operating companies, a majority of the barge and rail car lease expenses are
recoverable through fuel cost recovery provisions. In addition to the above rental commitments,
Alabama Power and Georgia Power have obligations upon expiration of certain leases with respect to
the residual value of the leased property. These leases expire in 2010, 2011, and 2013, and the
maximum obligations are $61 million, $40 million, and $19 million, respectively. At the
termination of the leases, the lessee may either exercise its purchase option, or the property can
be sold to a third party. Alabama Power and Georgia Power expect that the fair market value of the
leased property would substantially reduce or eliminate the payments under the residual value
obligations.

Guarantees

Prior to the Mirant spin-off, Southern Company made separate guarantees to certain counterparties
regarding performance of contractual commitments by Mirant’s trading and marketing subsidiaries.
The total notional amount of the guarantees is not material.

As discussed earlier in this Note under “Operating Leases,” Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and
Mississippi Power have entered into certain residual value guarantees.

8. COMMON STOCK

Stock Issued

In 2008, Southern Company raised $474 million from the issuance of 14.1 million new common shares
under the Company’s various stock programs. In 2007, Southern Company raised $379 million from the
issuance of 11.6 million new common shares and $159 million from the re-issuance of 5.3 million
shares of treasury stock under the Company’s various stock programs.

Shares Reserved

At December 31, 2008, a total of 72 million shares were reserved for issuance pursuant to the
Southern Investment Plan, the Employee Savings Plan, the Outside Directors Stock Plan, and the
Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan (which includes the stock option plan discussed below).

Stock Option Plan

Southern Company provides non-qualified stock options to a large segment of its employees ranging
from line management to executives. As of December 31, 2008, there were 7,009 current and former
employees participating in the stock option plan, and there were 33.2 million shares of common
stock remaining available for awards under this plan. The prices of options granted to date have
been at the fair market value of the shares on the dates of grant. Options granted to date become
exercisable pro rata over a maximum period of three years from the date of grant.

II-98


NOTES (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

Southern Company generally recognizes stock option expense on a straight-line basis over the
vesting period which equates to the requisite service period; however, for employees who are
eligible for retirement, the total cost is expensed at the grant date. Options outstanding will
expire no later than 10 years after the date of grant, unless terminated earlier by the Southern
Company Board of Directors in accordance with the stock option plan. For certain stock option
awards, a change in control will provide accelerated vesting.

The estimated fair values of stock options granted in 2008, 2007, and 2006 were derived using the
Black-Scholes stock option pricing model. Expected volatility was based on historical volatility
of Southern Company’s stock over a period equal to the expected term. Southern Company used
historical exercise data to estimate the expected term that represents the period of time that
options granted to employees are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rate was based on the
U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant that covers the expected term of the stock
options. The following table shows the assumptions used in the pricing model and the weighted
average grant-date fair value of stock options granted:

The number of stock options vested, and expected to vest in the future, as of December 31, 2008 was
not significantly different from the number of stock options outstanding at December 31, 2008 as
stated above. As of December 31, 2008, the weighted average remaining contractual term for the
options outstanding and options exercisable was 6.3 years and 5.1 years, respectively, and the aggregate intrinsic value for the
options outstanding and options exercisable was $181 million and $165 million, respectively.

As of December 31, 2008, there was $7 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to
stock option awards not yet vested. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average
period of approximately 10 months.

For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, total compensation cost for stock option
awards recognized in income was $20 million, $28 million, and $28 million, respectively, with the
related tax benefit also recognized in income of $8 million, $11 million, and $11 million,
respectively.

The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and
2006 was $45 million, $81 million, and $36 million, respectively. The actual tax benefit realized
by the Company for the tax deductions from stock option exercises totaled $17 million, $31 million,
and $14 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006.

II-99


NOTES (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

Southern Company has a policy of issuing shares to satisfy share option exercises. Cash received
from issuances related to option exercises under the share-based payment arrangements for the years
ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006 was $113 million, $195 million, and $77 million,
respectively.

Diluted Earnings Per Share

For Southern Company, the only difference in computing basic and diluted earnings per share is
attributable to outstanding options under the stock option plan. The effect of the stock options
was determined using the treasury stock method. Shares used to compute diluted earnings per share
are as follows:

Common Stock Dividend Restrictions

The income of Southern Company is derived primarily from equity in earnings of its subsidiaries.
At December 31, 2008, consolidated retained earnings included $5.3 billion of undistributed
retained earnings of the subsidiaries. Southern Power’s credit facility contains potential
limitations on the payment of common stock dividends; as of December 31, 2008, Southern Power was
in compliance with all such requirements.

9. NUCLEAR INSURANCE

Under the Price-Anderson Amendments Act (Act), Alabama Power and Georgia Power maintain agreements
of indemnity with the NRC that, together with private insurance, cover third-party liability
arising from any nuclear incident occurring at the companies’ nuclear power plants. The Act
provides funds up to $12.5 billion for public liability claims that could arise from a single
nuclear incident. Each nuclear plant is insured against this liability to a maximum of $300
million by American Nuclear Insurers (ANI), with the remaining coverage provided by a mandatory
program of deferred premiums that could be assessed, after a nuclear incident, against all owners
of commercial nuclear reactors. A company could be assessed up to $117.5 million per incident for
each licensed reactor it operates but not more than an aggregate of $17.5 million per incident to
be paid in a calendar year for each reactor. Such maximum assessment, excluding any applicable
state premium taxes, for Alabama Power and Georgia Power, based on its ownership and buyback
interests, is $235 million and $237 million, respectively, per incident, but not more than an
aggregate of $35 million per company to be paid for each incident in any one year. Both the
maximum assessment per reactor and the maximum yearly assessment are adjusted for inflation at
least every five years. The next scheduled adjustment is due no later than October 29, 2013.

Alabama Power and Georgia Power are members of Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL), a mutual
insurer established to provide property damage insurance in an amount up to $500 million for
members’ nuclear generating facilities.

Additionally, both companies have policies that currently provide decontamination, excess property
insurance, and premature decommissioning coverage up to $2.25 billion for losses in excess of the
$500 million primary coverage. This excess insurance is also provided by NEIL.

NEIL also covers the additional costs that would be incurred in obtaining replacement power during
a prolonged accidental outage at a member’s nuclear plant. Members can purchase this coverage,
subject to a deductible waiting period of up to 26 weeks, with a maximum per occurrence per unit
limit of $490 million. After the deductible

II-100


NOTES (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

period, weekly indemnity payments would be received until either the unit is operational or until
the limit is exhausted in approximately three years. Alabama Power and Georgia Power each purchase
the maximum limit allowed by NEIL, subject to ownership limitations. Each facility has elected a
12-week waiting period.

Under each of the NEIL policies, members are subject to assessments if losses each year exceed the
accumulated funds available to the insurer under that policy. The current maximum annual
assessments for Alabama Power and Georgia Power under the NEIL policies would be $39 million and
$51 million, respectively.

Claims resulting from terrorist acts are covered under both the ANI and NEIL policies (subject to
normal policy limits). The aggregate, however, that NEIL will pay for all claims resulting from
terrorist acts in any 12-month period is $3.2 billion plus such additional amounts NEIL can recover
through reinsurance, indemnity, or other sources.

For all on-site property damage insurance policies for commercial nuclear power plants, the NRC
requires that the proceeds of such policies shall be dedicated first for the sole purpose of
placing the reactor in a safe and stable condition after an accident. Any remaining proceeds are
to be applied next toward the costs of decontamination and debris removal operations ordered by the
NRC, and any further remaining proceeds are to be paid either to the company or to its bond
trustees as may be appropriate under the policies and applicable trust indentures.

All retrospective assessments, whether generated for liability, property, or replacement power, may
be subject to applicable state premium taxes.

10. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

On January 1, 2008, Southern Company adopted FASB Statement No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements”
(SFAS No. 157) which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and
requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements. The criterion that is set forth
in SFAS No. 157 is applicable to fair value measurement where it is permitted or required under
other accounting pronouncements.

SFAS No. 157 defines fair value as the exit price, which is the price that would be received to
sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on inputs of
observable and unobservable market data that a market participant would use in pricing the
asset or liability. The use of observable inputs is maximized where available and the use of
unobservable inputs is minimized for fair value measurement. As a means to illustrate the
inputs used, SFAS No. 157 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy that prioritizes inputs
to valuation techniques used for fair value measurement.

•

Level 1 consists of observable market data in an active market for identical assets or
liabilities.

•

Level 2 consists of observable market data, other than that included in Level 1, that
is either directly or indirectly observable.

•

Level 3 consists of unobservable market data. The input may reflect the assumptions of
the Company of what a market participant would use in pricing an asset or liability. If
there is little available market data, then the Company’s own assumptions are the best
available information.

In the case of multiple inputs being used in a fair value measurement, the lowest level input
that is significant to the fair value measurement represents the level in the fair value
hierarchy in which the fair value measurement is reported.

II-101


NOTES (continued)

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

The adoption of SFAS No. 157 has not resulted in any significant changes to the methodologies
used for fair value measurement. Primarily all the changes in the fair value of assets and
liabilities are recorded in other comprehensive income or regulatory assets and liabilities,
and thus the impact on earnings is limited to derivatives that do not qualify for hedge
accounting.

The fair value measurements performed on a recurring basis and the level of the fair value
hierarchy in which they fall at December 31, 2008 are as follows:

decommissioning trust funds are invested in a diversified mix of equity and fixed income
securities. See Note 1 under “Nuclear Decommissioning” for additional information. The cash
equivalents and restricted cash consist of securities with original maturities of 90 days or less. “Other”

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Alabama Power Company 2008 Annual Report

The management of Alabama Power Company (the “Company”) is responsible for establishing and
maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting as required by the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). A control system can
provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.

Under management’s supervision, an evaluation of the design and effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting was conducted based on the framework in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2008.

This Annual Report does not include an attestation report of the Company’s independent registered
public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management’s report
was not subject to attestation by the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm
pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to
provide only management’s report in this Annual Report.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Alabama Power Company

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets and statements of capitalization of Alabama Power
Company (the “Company”) (a wholly owned subsidiary of Southern Company) as of December 31, 2008 and
2007, and the related statements of income, comprehensive income, common stockholder’s equity, and
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The
Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control
over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial
reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but
not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such financial statements (pages II-133 to II-169) present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Alabama Power Company at December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2008, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Alabama Power Company 2008 Annual Report

OVERVIEW

Business Activities

Alabama Power Company (the Company) operates as a vertically integrated utility providing
electricity to retail customers within its traditional service area located within the State of
Alabama and to wholesale customers in the Southeast.

Many factors affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of the Company’s primary business of
selling electricity. These factors include the ability to maintain a constructive regulatory
environment, to maintain energy sales in the midst of the current economic downturn, and to
effectively manage and secure timely recovery of rising costs. These costs include those related
to projected long-term demand growth, increasingly stringent environmental standards, fuel prices,
capital expenditures, and restoration following major storms. Appropriately balancing the need to
recover these increasing costs with customer prices will continue to challenge the Company for the
foreseeable future.

Key Performance Indicators

In striving to maximize shareholder value while providing cost-effective energy to customers, the
Company continues to focus on several key indicators. These indicators include customer
satisfaction, plant availability, system reliability, and net income after dividends on preferred
and preference stock. The Company’s financial success is directly tied to the satisfaction of its
customers. Key elements of ensuring customer satisfaction include outstanding service, high
reliability, and competitive prices. Management uses customer satisfaction surveys and reliability
indicators to evaluate the Company’s results.

Peak season equivalent forced outage rate (Peak Season EFOR) is an indicator of fossil/hydro plant
availability and efficient generation fleet operations during the months when generation needs are
greatest. The rate is calculated by dividing the number of hours of forced outages by total
generation hours. The fossil/hydro 2008 Peak Season EFOR of 1.51% was better than the target. The
nuclear generating fleet also uses Peak Season EFOR as an indicator of availability and efficient
generation fleet operations during the peak season. The nuclear 2008 Peak Season EFOR of 2.78% did
not meet the target. Transmission and distribution system reliability performance is measured by
the frequency and duration of outages. Performance targets for reliability are set internally
based on historical performance, expected weather conditions, and expected capital expenditures.
The performance for 2008 was better than the target for these reliability measures.

Net income after dividends on preferred and preference stock is the primary component of the
Company’s contribution to Southern Company’s earnings per share goal. The Company’s 2008 results
compared with its targets for some of these key indicators are reflected in the following chart.

See RESULTS OF OPERATIONS herein for additional information on the Company’s financial performance.
The financial performance achieved in 2008 reflects the continued management emphasis, as well as
the commitment shown by employees, in achieving or exceeding these key performance expectations.

Earnings

The Company’s financial performance remained strong in 2008 despite the challenges of a weakening
economy and rising costs. The Company’s net income after dividends on preferred and preference
stock of $616 million in 2008 increased $36 million (6.3%) over the prior year. This improvement
was primarily due to an increase in retail base rate revenues resulting from an increase in rates
under Rate Stabilization and Equalization Plan (Rate RSE) and Rate Certificated New Plant (Rate
CNP) for environmental costs that took effect January 1, 2008, partially offset by higher non-fuel
operating expenses and depreciation expense.

II-111


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2008 Annual Report

The Company’s 2007 net income after dividends on preferred and preference stock was $580 million,
representing a $62 million (11.9%) increase from the prior year. This improvement was primarily
due to an increase in retail base rate revenues resulting from an increase in rates under Rate RSE
and Rate CNP for environmental costs that took effect January 1, 2007 as well as favorable weather
conditions, partially offset by higher non-fuel operating expenses and increased interest expense.

The Company’s 2006 net income after dividends on preferred and preference stock was $518 million,
representing a $10 million (1.9%) increase from the prior year. This improvement was primarily due
to retail and wholesale revenue growth offset by higher non-fuel operating expenses and increased
interest expense.

January 2008, 5.3% in January 2007, and 2.6% in January 2006. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL — “PSC
Matters” herein and Note 3 to the financial statements under “Retail Regulatory Matters” for
additional information.

Fuel rates billed to customers are designed to fully recover fluctuating fuel and purchased power
costs over a period of time. Fuel revenues generally have no effect on net income because they
represent the recording of revenues to offset fuel and purchased power expenses. See FUTURE
EARNINGS POTENTIAL — “PSC Matters — Retail Fuel Cost Recovery” herein and Note 3 to the financial
statements under “Retail Regulatory Matters — Fuel Cost Recovery” for additional information.

Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates will vary depending on the market cost of available
energy compared to the cost of the Company and Southern Company system-owned generation, demand for
energy within the Southern Company service territory, and availability of Southern Company system
generation.

Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates include unit power sales under long-term contracts
to Florida utilities and sales to wholesale customers within the Company’s service territory.
Capacity revenues under unit power sales contracts reflect the recovery of fixed costs and a return
on investment, and under these contracts, energy is generally sold at variable cost. Fluctuations
in oil and natural gas prices, which are the primary fuel sources for unit power sales customers,
influence changes in these energy sales. However, because energy is generally sold at variable
cost, these fluctuations have a minimal effect on earnings. No significant declines in the amount
of capacity revenues are scheduled until the termination of the unit power sales contracts in May
2010. In June 2010, the units subject to the unit power sales contracts are expected to return to
territorial service. As shown in the table above, unit power sales capacity revenues have ranged
from $151 million to $160 million over the last three years. Short-term opportunity energy sales
are also included in wholesale energy sales to non-affiliates. These opportunity sales are made at
market-based rates that generally provide a margin above the Company’s variable cost to produce the
energy.

Wholesale revenues from sales to affiliated companies within the Southern Company system will vary
from year to year depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each
company. These affiliated sales and purchases are made in accordance with the Intercompany
Interchange Contract (IIC), as approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). In
2008, wholesale revenues from sales to affiliates increased $164.4 million primarily due to a 62.2%
increase in kilowatt-hour (KWH) sales to affiliates as a result of an increase in the availability
of the Company’s generating resources because of a decrease in customer demand within the Company’s
service territory. In 2007, wholesale revenues from sales to affiliates decreased $71.9 million
primarily due to a 37.0% decrease in KWH sales to affiliates as a result of a decrease in the
availability of the Company’s generating resources because of an increase in customer demand within
the Company’s service territory. In 2006, wholesale revenues decreased $73.0 million primarily due
to a 16.7% decrease in price and a 10.3% decrease in KWH sales to affiliates as a result of a
decrease in the availability of the Company’s generating resources because of an increase in
customer demand within the Company’s service territory. Excluding the capacity revenues, these
transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since the energy is generally sold at
marginal cost and energy purchases are generally offset by energy revenues through the Company’s
energy cost recovery clause (Rate ECR).

Other operating revenues in 2008 increased $12.4 million (6.8%) from 2007 primarily due to an $11.7
million increase in revenues from gas-fueled co-generation steam facilities. In 2007, other
operating revenues increased $13.5 million (8.0%) from 2006 primarily due to a $4.0 million
increase in revenues from electric property associated with pole attachment and building rentals, a
$2.6 million increase in transmission revenues, and a $2.5 million increase in revenues from
gas-fueled co-generation steam facilities. In 2006,

II-113


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2008 Annual Report

other operating revenues decreased $17.6 million (9.5%) from 2005 primarily due to a decrease of
$14.6 million in revenues from gas-fueled co-generation steam facilities mainly as a result of
lower gas prices. Since co-generation steam revenues are generally offset by fuel expense, these
revenues did not have a significant impact on earnings for any year reported.

Energy Sales

Changes in revenues are influenced heavily by the change in the volume of energy sold from year to
year. KWH sales for 2008 and the percent change by year were as follows:

Changes in retail energy sales are comprised of changes in electricity usage by customers, changes
in weather, and changes in the number of customers. Retail energy sales in 2008 were 2.5% less
than in 2007. Energy sales were down in 2008 across all classes of customers. Residential and
commercial sales decreased 2.6% and 1.4%, respectively, due primarily to milder weather in 2008
compared to 2007. Industrial sales decreased 3.2% during the year primarily as a result of
decreased customer demand in the chemical and pipeline, and textiles and food sectors, as a result
of a slowing economy that worsened during the fourth quarter of 2008.

Retail energy sales in 2007 were 0.5% higher than in 2006. Energy sales in the residential and
commercial sectors led the growth with a 1.3% and a 2.8% increase, respectively, due primarily to
weather-driven increased demand. Industrial sales decreased 1.6% during the year primarily as a
result of decreased sales demand in textiles and food, primary metals, and chemical sectors.

Retail energy sales in 2006 were 1.2% higher than in 2005. Energy sales in the residential and
commercial sectors led the growth with a 3.1% and a 2.1% increase, respectively, due primarily to
weather-driven increased demand. Industrial sales decreased 0.7% as several large textile
facilities discontinued or substantially reduced their operations in 2006. In addition, industrial
sales decreased due to pulp and paper customers utilizing self-generation as a result of lower gas
prices during the year compared to 2005.

Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses

Fuel costs constitute the single largest expense for the Company. The mix of fuel sources for
generation of electricity is determined primarily by demand, the unit cost of fuel consumed, and
the availability of generating units. Additionally, the Company purchases a portion of its
electricity needs from the wholesale market. Details of the Company’s electricity generated and
purchased were as follows:

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2008 Annual Report

Fuel and purchased power expenses were $2.7 billion in 2008, an increase of $521.5 million (23.7%)
above the prior year costs. This increase was the result of a $560.8 million increase in the cost
of fuel, offset by a $39.3 million decrease related to the volume of KWHs generated and purchased.

Fuel and purchased power expenses were $2.2 billion in 2007, an increase of $101.9 million (4.9%)
above the prior year costs. This increase was the result of a $70.3 million increase in the cost
of fuel and a $31.6 million increase related to the volume of KWHs generated and purchased.

Fuel and purchased power expenses were $2.1 billion in 2006, an increase of $184.1 million (9.6%)
above the prior year costs. This increase was the result of a $128.7 million increase in the cost
of fuel and a $55.4 million increase related to the volume of KWHs generated and purchased.

Purchased power consists of purchases from affiliates in the Southern Company system and
non-affiliated companies. Purchased power transactions among the Company, its affiliates, and
non-affiliates will vary from period to period depending on demand and the availability and
variable production cost of generating resources at each company. Purchased power from
non-affiliates increased $81.9 million (84.5%) in 2008 due to a 67.9% increase in the amount of
energy purchased. In 2007, purchased power from non-affiliates decreased $27.1 million (21.8%) due
to a 22.6% decrease in the amount of energy purchased over the previous year. In 2006, purchased
power from non-affiliates decreased $64.7 million (34.3%) due to a 26.8% decrease in the amount of
energy purchased and a 10.3% decrease in purchased power prices over the previous year.

Over the last several years, coal prices have been influenced by a worldwide increase in demand
from developing countries, as well as increases in mining and fuel transportation costs. In the
first half of 2008, coal prices reached unprecedented high levels primarily due to increased demand
following more moderate pricing in 2006 and 2007. Despite these fluctuations, fuel inventories
have been adequate and fuel supply markets have been sufficient to meet expected fuel requirements.
Demand for natural gas in the United States also increased in 2007 and the first half of 2008.
However, natural gas supplies increased in the last half of 2008 as a result of increased
production and higher storage levels due in part to weak industrial demand. Both coal and natural
gas prices moderated in the second half of 2008 as the result of a recessionary economy. During
2008, uranium prices continued to moderate from the highs set during 2007. While worldwide uranium
production levels appear to have increased slightly since 2007, secondary supplies and inventories
were still required to meet worldwide reactor demand.

Fuel and purchased power expenses generally do not affect net income, since they are offset by fuel
revenues under the Company’s Rate ECR. The Company, along with the Alabama Public Service
Commission (PSC), continuously monitors the under/over recovered balance to determine whether
adjustments to billing rates are required. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL — “PSC Matters — Retail
Fuel Cost Recovery” herein and Note 3 to the financial statements under “Retail Regulatory
Matters — Fuel Cost Recovery” for additional information.

Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses

In 2008, other operations and maintenance expenses increased $72.7 million (6.1%) primarily due to
a $27.4 million increase in steam production expense related to environmental mandates (which were
offset by revenues associated with Rate CNP environmental) and scheduled outage costs, a $22.9
million increase in nuclear production expense related to operations and scheduled outage costs,
and a $19.9 million increase in transmission and distribution expense related to overhead line
clearing costs. In 2007, other operations and maintenance expenses increased $89.3 million (8.1%)
primarily due to a $28.5 million increase in steam production expense related to environmental
mandates and scheduled outage costs, a $19.6 million increase in transmission and distribution
expense related to overhead line clearing costs, a $19.0 million increase in administrative and
general expenses related to an increase in the expenses for the injuries and damages reserve,
outside services, and employee benefits, an $8.1 million increase in nuclear production expense
related to scheduled outage cost, and a $4.7 million increase in customer accounts expense
associated with customer service expenses. In 2006, other operations and maintenance expenses
increased $52.8 million (5.1%) primarily due to an $18.8 million increase in administrative and
general expenses related to employee benefits, a $10.1 million increase in nuclear production
expense related to both routine operation and scheduled outage costs, a $9.8 million increase in
transmission and distribution expense related to overhead and underground line costs, and a
$5.4 million increase in steam production expense related to environmental costs.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2008 Annual Report

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $48.9 million (10.4%) in 2008, $20.5 million
(4.5%) in 2007, and $24.5 million (5.7%) in 2006, primarily due to additions to property, plant,
and equipment related to environmental mandates (which were offset by revenues associated with Rate
CNP environmental) and distribution projects. During 2008, a depreciation study was completed
based on information as of December 31, 2007. The study was filed with the FERC on October 29,
2008 and was also provided to the Alabama PSC. The proposed rates result in an expected increase
in depreciation expense for 2009 of approximately $29 million.

Taxes Other Than Income Taxes

Taxes other than income taxes increased $19.9 million (7.0%) in 2008, $28.4 million (11.0%) in
2007, and $9.3 million (3.7%) in 2006, primarily due to increases in state and municipal public
utility license taxes which are directly related to the increase in retail revenues.

Allowance for Equity Funds Used During Construction

Allowance for equity funds used during construction (AFUDC) increased $10.1 million (28.5%) in 2008
and $17.2 million (94.1%) in 2007, primarily due to increases in the amount of construction work in
progress related to environmental mandates at generating facilities and transmission and
distribution projects compared to the prior years. In 2006, AFUDC decreased $2.0 million (10.0%)
primarily due to the timing of construction expenditures compared to the prior year. See Note 1 to
the financial statements under “Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC)” for
additional information.

Income Taxes

Income taxes increased $16.6 million (4.7%) in 2008, primarily due to higher pre-tax income
partially offset by the tax benefit associated with an increase in AFUDC and a decrease in expense
related to tax contingencies.

Income taxes increased $20.9 million (6.3%) in 2007, primarily due to higher pre-tax income
partially offset by the tax benefit associated with an increase in AFUDC and an increase in the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Internal Revenue Code), Section 199 production
activities deduction.

Income taxes increased $45.6 million (16.0%) in 2006, primarily due to higher pre-tax income and
the impact of a 2005 accounting order approved by the Alabama PSC to return certain regulatory
liabilities related to deferred taxes to Alabama Power’s retail customers. See Note 5 to the
financial statements for additional information.

Effects of Inflation

The Company is subject to rate regulation that is based on the recovery of costs. Retail rates may
be adjusted annually based on historical or projected costs, including estimates for inflation.
When historical costs are included, or when inflation exceeds the projected costs used in rate
regulation or market-based prices, the effects of inflation can create an economic loss since the
recovery of costs could be in dollars that have less purchasing power. In addition, the income tax
laws are based on historical costs. Any adverse effect of inflation on the Company’s results of
operations has not been substantial. See Note 3 to financial statements under “Retail Regulatory
Matters — Rate RSE” for additional information.

FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL

General

The Company operates as a vertically integrated utility providing electricity to retail and
wholesale customers within its traditional service area located in the State of Alabama in addition
to wholesale customers in the Southeast. Prices for electricity provided by the Company to retail
customers are set by the Alabama PSC under cost-based regulatory principles. Prices for wholesale
electricity sales, interconnecting transmission lines, and the exchange of electric power are
regulated by the FERC. Retail rates and earnings are reviewed and may be adjusted periodically
within certain limitations. See ACCOUNTING POLICIES — “Application of Critical Accounting Policies
and Estimates — Electric Utility Regulation” herein and Note 3 to the financial statements under
“FERC Matters” and “Retail Regulatory Matters” for additional information about regulatory matters.

II-116


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2008 Annual Report

The results of operations for the past three years are not necessarily indicative of future
earnings potential. The level of the Company’s future earnings depends on numerous factors that
affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of the Company’s primary business of selling
electricity. These factors include the Company’s ability to maintain a constructive regulatory
environment that continues to allow for the recovery of all prudently incurred costs during a time
of increasing costs. Future earnings in the near term will depend, in part, upon maintaining
energy sales during the current economic downturn, which is subject to a number of factors. These
factors include weather, competition, new energy contracts with neighboring utilities, energy
conservation practiced by customers, the price of electricity, the price elasticity of demand, and
the rate of economic growth or decline in the Company’s service area. Recent recessionary
conditions have negatively impacted sales growth. The timing and extent of the economic recovery
will impact future earnings.

Environmental Matters

Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act and other environmental statutes and regulations
could affect earnings if such costs cannot continue to be fully recovered in rates on a timely
basis. Environmental compliance spending over the next several years may exceed amounts estimated.
Some of the factors driving the potential for such an increase are higher commodity costs, market
demand for labor, and scope additions and clarifications. The timing, specific requirements, and
estimated costs could also change as environmental statutes and regulations are adopted or
modified. See Note 3 to the financial statements under “Environmental Matters” for additional
information.

New Source Review Actions

In November 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) brought a civil action in the U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against certain Southern Company subsidiaries,
including the Company, alleging that it had violated the New Source Review (NSR) provisions of the
Clean Air Act and related state laws at certain coal-fired generating facilities. Through
subsequent amendments and other legal procedures, the EPA filed a separate action in January 2001
against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama after the
Company was dismissed from the original action. In this lawsuit, the EPA alleged that NSR
violations occurred at five coal-fired generating facilities operated by the Company. The civil
action requests penalties and injunctive relief, including an order requiring the installation of
the best available control technology at the affected units.

In June 2006, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama entered a consent decree
between the Company and the EPA, resolving a portion of the Company’s lawsuit relating to the
alleged NSR violations at Plant Miller. The consent decree required the Company to pay $100,000 to
resolve the government’s claim for a civil penalty and to donate $4.9 million of sulfur dioxide
emission allowances to a nonprofit charitable organization. It also formalized specific emissions
reductions to be accomplished by the Company, consistent with other Clean Air Act programs that
require emissions reductions. In August 2006, the district court in Alabama granted the Company’s
motion for summary judgment and entered final judgment in favor of the Company on the EPA’s claims
related to all of the remaining plants: Plants Barry, Gaston, Gorgas, and Greene County.

The plaintiffs appealed the district court’s decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh
Circuit, where the appeal was stayed, pending the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in a similar case
against Duke Energy. The Supreme Court issued its decision in the Duke Energy case in April 2007,
and in December 2007, the Eleventh Circuit vacated the district court’s decision in the Company’s
case and remanded the case back to the district court for consideration of the legal issues in
light of the Supreme Court’s decision in the Duke Energy case. On July 24, 2008, the U.S. District
Court for the Northern District of Alabama granted partial summary judgment in favor of the Company
regarding the proper legal test for determining whether projects are routine maintenance, repair,
and replacement and therefore are excluded from NSR permitting. The decision did not resolve the
case and the ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

The Company believes that it complied with applicable laws and the EPA regulations and
interpretations in effect at the time the work in question took place. The Clean Air Act
authorizes maximum civil penalties of $25,000 to $37,500 per day, per violation at each generating
unit, depending on the date of the alleged violation. An adverse outcome in this matter could
require substantial capital expenditures or affect the timing of currently budgeted capital
expenditures that cannot be determined at this time and could possibly require payment of
substantial penalties. Such expenditures could affect future results of operations, cash flows,
and financial condition if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2008 Annual Report

Carbon Dioxide Litigation

New York Case

In July 2004, three environmental groups and attorneys general from eight states, each outside of
Southern Company’s service territory, and the corporation counsel for New York City filed
complaints in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against Southern
Company and four other electric power companies. The complaints allege that the companies’
emissions of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, contribute to global warming, which the plaintiffs
assert is a public nuisance. Under common law public and private nuisance theories, the plaintiffs
seek a judicial order (1) holding each defendant jointly and severally liable for creating,
contributing to, and/or maintaining global warming and (2) requiring each of the defendants to cap
its emissions of carbon dioxide and then reduce those emissions by a specified percentage each year
for at least a decade. The plaintiffs have not, however, requested that damages be awarded in
connection with their claims. Southern Company believes these claims are without merit and notes
that the complaint cites no statutory or regulatory basis for the claims. In September 2005, the
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York granted Southern Company’s and the other
defendants’ motions to dismiss these cases. The plaintiffs filed an appeal to the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit in October 2005, but no decision has been issued. The ultimate
outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Kivalina Case

On February 26, 2008, the Native Village of Kivalina and the City of Kivalina filed a suit in the
U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against several electric utilities
(including Southern Company), several oil companies, and a coal company. The plaintiffs are the
governing bodies of an Inupiat village in Alaska. The plaintiffs contend that the village is being
destroyed by erosion allegedly caused by global warming that the plaintiffs attribute to emissions
of greenhouse gases by the defendants. The plaintiffs assert claims for public and private
nuisance and contend that the defendants have acted in concert and are therefore jointly and
severally liable for the plaintiffs’ damages. The suit seeks damages for lost property values and
for the cost of relocating the village, which is alleged to be $95 million to $400 million. On
June 30, 2008, all defendants filed motions to dismiss this case. Southern Company believes that
these claims are without merit and notes that the complaint cites no statutory or regulatory basis
for the claims. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Environmental Statutes and Regulations

General

The Company’s operations are subject to extensive regulation by state and federal environmental
agencies under a variety of statutes and regulations governing environmental media, including air,
water, and land resources. Applicable statutes include the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act; the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act; the Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act; the Toxic Substances Control Act; the Emergency Planning & Community
Right-to-Know Act; the Endangered Species Act; and related federal and state regulations.
Compliance with these environmental requirements involves significant capital and operating costs,
a major portion of which is expected to be recovered through existing ratemaking provisions.
Through 2008, the Company had invested approximately $2.3 billion in capital projects to comply
with these requirements, with annual totals of $617 million, $469 million, and $260 million for
2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. The Company expects that capital expenditures to assure
compliance with existing and new statutes and regulations will be an additional $584 million, $131
million, and $59 million for 2009, 2010, and 2011, respectively. The Company’s compliance strategy
can be affected by changes to existing environmental laws, statutes, and regulations, the cost,
availability, and existing inventory of emission allowances, and the Company’s fuel mix.
Environmental costs that are known and estimable at this time are included in capital expenditures
discussed under FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY — “Capital Requirements and Contractual
Obligations” herein.

Compliance with any new federal or state legislation or regulations related to global climate
change, air quality, combustion byproducts, including coal ash, or other environmental and health
concerns could also significantly affect the Company. Although new or revised environmental
legislation or regulations could affect many areas of the Company’s operations, the full impact of
any such changes cannot be determined at this time.

Air Quality

Compliance with the Clean Air Act and resulting regulations has been and will continue to be a
significant focus for the Company. Through 2008, the Company had spent approximately $2.0 billion
in reducing sulfur dioxide (SO


) and nitrogen oxide (NO

x

)

II-118


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2008 Annual Report

emissions and in monitoring emissions pursuant to the Clean Air Act. Additional controls are
currently being installed at several plants to further reduce air emissions, maintain compliance
with existing regulations, and meet new requirements.

In 2004, the EPA designated nonattainment areas under an eight-hour ozone standard. The Birmingham
area was originally designated as nonattainment under the eight-hour ozone standard, but has since
been redesignated as an attainment area by the EPA, and a maintenance plan to address future
exceedances of the standard has been approved. On March 12, 2008, the EPA issued a final rule
establishing a more stringent eight-hour ozone standard which will likely result in designation of
new nonattainment areas within the Company’s service territory. The EPA is expected to publish
those designations in 2010, and require state implementation plans for any nonattainment areas by
2013.

During 2005, the EPA’s annual fine particulate matter nonattainment designations became effective
for several areas within the Company’s service territory, including the Birmingham area. State
plans for addressing the nonattainment designations for this standard were due by April 5, 2008 but
have not been finalized. These state plans could require further reductions in SO


and
NO

x

emissions from power plants. In September 2006, the EPA published a final rule
which increased the stringency of the 24-hour average fine particulate matter air quality standard.
On December 18, 2008, the EPA designated the Birmingham area as nonattainment for the 24-hour
standard. A state implementation plan for this nonattainment area is due in 2012.

The EPA issued the final Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) in March 2005. This cap-and-trade rule
addresses power plant SO


and NO

x

emissions that were found to contribute to
nonattainment of the eight-hour ozone and fine particulate matter standards in downwind states.
Twenty-eight eastern states, including the State of Alabama, are subject to the requirements of the
rule. The rule calls for additional reductions of NO

x

and/or SO


to be
achieved in two phases, 2009/2010 and 2015. On July 11, 2008, in response to petitions brought by
certain states and regulated industries challenging particular aspects of CAIR, the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued a decision vacating CAIR in its entirety and
remanding it to the EPA for further action consistent with its opinion. On December 23, 2008,
however, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit altered its July decision
in response to a rehearing petition and remanded CAIR to the EPA without vacatur, thereby leaving
CAIR compliance requirements in place while the EPA develops a revised rule. The State of Alabama
has completed its plan to implement CAIR. Emission reductions are being accomplished by the
installation of emission controls at the Company’s coal-fired facilities and/or by the purchase of
emission allowances. The full impact of the court’s remand and the outcome of the EPA’s future
rulemaking in response cannot be determined at this time.

The Clean Air Visibility Rule (formerly called the Regional Haze Rule) was finalized in July 2005.
The goal of this rule is to restore natural visibility conditions in certain areas (primarily
national parks and wilderness areas) by 2064. The rule involves (1) the application of Best
Available Retrofit Technology (BART) to certain sources built between 1962 and 1977 and (2) the
application of any additional emissions reductions which may be deemed necessary for each
designated area to achieve reasonable progress by 2018 toward the natural conditions goal.
Thereafter, for each 10-year planning period, additional emissions reductions will be required to
continue to demonstrate reasonable progress in each area during that period. For power plants, the
Clean Air Visibility Rule allows states to determine that the CAIR satisfies BART requirements for
SO


and NO

x

. Extensive studies were performed for each of the Company’s
affected units to demonstrate that additional particulate matter controls are not necessary under
BART. The state of Alabama has determined that no additional SO


controls beyond CAIR
are needed to satisfy reasonable progress. States have completed or are currently completing
implementation plans that contain strategies for BART and any other measures required to achieve
the first phase of reasonable progress.

The impacts of the eight-hour ozone nonattainment designations, the fine particulate matter
nonattainment designations, and the Clean Air Visibility Rule on the Company cannot be determined
at this time and will depend on the resolution of any pending legal challenges and the development
and implementation of rules at the state level.

The Company has developed and continually updates a comprehensive environmental compliance strategy
to assess compliance obligations associated with the continuing and new environmental requirements
discussed above. As part of this strategy, the Company plans to install additional SO


and NO

x

emission controls within the next several years to ensure continued
compliance with applicable air quality requirements.

In March 2005, the EPA published the final Clean Air Mercury Rule, a cap-and-trade program for the
reduction of mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants. The final Clean Air Mercury Rule was
challenged in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The petitioners
alleged that the EPA was not authorized to establish a cap-and-trade program for mercury emissions
and instead the EPA must establish maximum achievable control technology standards for coal-fired
electric utility steam generating units. On February 8, 2008, the court ruled in favor of the
petitioners and vacated the Clean Air Mercury Rule. The

II-119


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2008 Annual Report

Company’s overall environmental compliance strategy relies primarily on a combination of
SO


and NO

x

controls to reduce mercury emissions. Any significant changes in
the strategy will depend on the outcome of any appeals and/or future federal and state rulemakings.
Future rulemakings necessitated by the court’s decision could require emission reductions more
stringent than those required by the Clean Air Mercury Rule.

Water Quality

In July 2004, the EPA published its final technology-based regulations under the Clean Water Act
for the purpose of reducing impingement and entrainment of fish, shellfish, and other forms of
aquatic life at existing power plant cooling water intake structures. The rules require baseline
biological information and, perhaps, installation of fish protection technology near some intake
structures at existing power plants. In January 2007, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit overturned and remanded several provisions of the rule, including the use of cost-benefit
analysis, to the EPA for revisions. The decision has been appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. The
full impact of these regulations will depend on subsequent legal proceedings, further rulemaking by
the EPA, the results of studies and analyses performed as part of the rules’ implementation, and
the actual requirements established by state regulatory agencies and, therefore, cannot be
determined at this time.

Environmental Remediation

The Company must comply with other environmental laws and regulations that cover the handling and
disposal of waste and releases of hazardous substances. Under these various laws and regulations,
the Company could incur substantial costs to clean up properties. The Company conducts studies to
determine the extent of any required cleanup and has recognized in its financial statements the
costs to clean up known sites. Amounts for cleanup and ongoing monitoring costs were not material
for any year presented. The Company may be liable for some or all required cleanup costs for
additional sites that may require environmental remediation. See Note 3 to the financial
statements under “Environmental Matters — Environmental Remediation” for additional information.

Global Climate Issues

Federal legislative proposals that would impose mandatory requirements related to greenhouse gas
emissions and renewable energy standards continue to be strongly considered in Congress, and the
reduction of greenhouse gas emissions has been identified as a high priority by the current
Administration. The ultimate outcome of these proposals cannot be determined at this time; however,
mandatory restrictions on the Company’s greenhouse gas emissions could result in significant
additional compliance costs that could affect future unit retirement and replacement decisions and
results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition if such costs are not recovered through
regulated rates.

In April 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the EPA has authority under the Clean Air Act to
regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles. The EPA is currently developing its
response to this decision. Regulatory decisions that will follow from this response may have
implications for both new and existing stationary sources, such as power plants. The ultimate
outcome of these rulemaking activities cannot be determined at this time; however, as with the
current legislative proposals, mandatory restrictions on the Company’s greenhouse gas emissions
could result in significant additional compliance costs that could affect future unit retirement
and replacement decisions and results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition if such
costs are not recovered through regulated rates.

In addition, some states are considering or have undertaken actions to regulate and reduce
greenhouse gas emissions. For example, on June 25, 2008, Florida’s Governor signed comprehensive
energy-related legislation that includes authorization for the Florida Department of Environmental
Protection to adopt rules for a cap-and-trade regulatory program to address greenhouse gas
emissions from electric utilities, conditioned upon their ratification by the legislature no sooner
than the 2010 legislative session. This legislation also authorizes the Florida PSC to adopt a
renewable portfolio standard for public utilities, subject to legislative ratification. The impact
of any similar state legislation on the Company will depend on the future development, adoption,
legislative ratification, implementation, and potential legal challenges to rules governing
greenhouse gas emissions and mandates regarding the use of renewable energy, and the ultimate
outcome cannot be determined at this time.

International climate change negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change also continue. Current efforts focus on a potential successor to the Kyoto Protocol for the
post 2012 timeframe, with a conclusion to this round of negotiations targeted for the end of 2009.
The outcome and impact of the international negotiations cannot be determined at this time.

II-120


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2008 Annual Report

The Company continues to evaluate its future energy and emission profiles and is participating in
voluntary programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to help develop and advance technology to
reduce emissions.

FERC Matters

Market-Based Rate Authority

The Company has authorization from the FERC to sell power to non-affiliates, including short-term
opportunity sales, at market-based prices. Specific FERC approval must be obtained with respect to
a market-based contract with an affiliate.

In December 2004, the FERC initiated a proceeding to assess Southern Company’s generation dominance
within its retail service territory. The ability to charge market-based rates in other markets is
not an issue in the proceeding. Any new market-based rate sales by the Company in Southern
Company’s retail service territory entered into during a 15-month refund period that ended in May
2006 could be subject to refund to a cost-based rate level.

In November 2007, the presiding administrative law judge issued an initial decision regarding the
methodology to be used in the generation dominance tests. The proceedings are ongoing. The
ultimate outcome of this generation dominance proceeding cannot now be determined, but an adverse
decision by the FERC in a final order could require the Company to charge cost-based rates for
certain wholesale sales in the Southern Company retail service territory, which may be lower than
negotiated market-based rates, and could also result in total refunds of up to $3.9 million, plus
interest. The Company believes that there is no meritorious basis for an adverse decision in this
proceeding and is vigorously defending itself in this matter.

In June 2007, the FERC issued its final rule in Order No. 697 regarding market-based rate
authority. The FERC generally retained its current market-based rate standards. Responding to a
number of requests for rehearing, the FERC issued Order No. 697-A on April 21, 2008 and Order No.
697-B on December 12, 2008. These orders largely affirmed the FERC’s prior revision and
codification of the regulations governing market-based rates for public utilities. In accordance
with the orders, Southern Company submitted to the FERC an updated market power analysis on
September 2, 2008 related to its continued market-based rate authority. The ultimate outcome of
this matter cannot now be determined.

On October 17, 2008, Southern Company filed with the FERC a revised market-based rate (MBR) tariff
and a new cost-based rate (CBR) tariff. The revised MBR tariff provides for a “must offer” energy
auction whereby Southern Company offers all of its available energy for sale in a day-ahead auction
and an hour-ahead auction with reserve prices not to exceed the CBR tariff price, after considering
Southern Company’s native load requirements, reliability obligations, and sales commitments to
third parties. All sales under the energy auction would be at market clearing prices established
under the auction rules. The new CBR tariff provides for a cost-based price for wholesale sales of
less than a year. On December 18, 2008, the FERC issued an order conditionally accepting the MBR
tariff subject to certain revisions to the auction proposal. On January 21, 2009, Southern Company
made a compliance filing that accepted all the conditions of the MBR tariff order. When this order
becomes final, Southern Company will have 30 days to implement the wholesale auction. On December
31, 2008, the FERC issued an order conditionally accepting the CBR tariff subject to providing
additional information concerning one aspect of the tariff. On January 30, 2009, Southern Company
filed a response addressing the FERC inquiry to the CBR tariff order. Implementation of the energy
auction in accordance with the MBR tariff order is expected to adequately mitigate going forward
any presumption of market power that Southern Company may have in the Southern Company retail
service territory. The timing of when the FERC may issue the final orders on the MBR and CBR
tariffs and the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Generation Interconnection Agreements

In November 2004, generator company subsidiaries of Tenaska, Inc. (Tenaska), as counterparties to
two previously executed interconnection agreements with the Company, filed complaints at the FERC
requesting that the FERC modify the agreements and that the Company refund a total of $11.0 million
previously paid for interconnection facilities. No other similar complaints are pending with the
FERC.

In January 2007, the FERC issued an order granting Tenaska’s requested relief. Although the FERC’s
order required the modification of Tenaska’s interconnection agreements, under the provisions of
the order, the Company determined that no refund was payable to Tenaska. The Company requested
rehearing asserting that the FERC retroactively applied a new principle to existing interconnection
agreements. Tenaska requested rehearing of FERC’s methodology for determining the amount of
refunds. The requested rehearings

II-121


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2008 Annual Report

were denied and the Company and Tenaska have appealed the orders to the U.S. Circuit Court for the
District of Columbia. The final outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.

Hydro Relicensing

In July 2005, the Company filed two applications with the FERC for new 50-year licenses for the
Company’s seven hydroelectric developments on the Coosa River (Weiss, Henry, Logan Martin, Lay,
Mitchell, Jordan, and Bouldin) and for the Lewis Smith and Bankhead developments on the Warrior
River. The FERC licenses for all of these nine projects expired in July and August of 2007. Since
the FERC did not act on the Company’s new license applications prior to the expiration of the
existing licenses, the FERC is required by law to issue annual licenses to the Company, under the
terms and conditions of the existing license, until action is taken on the new license
applications. The FERC issued an annual license for the Coosa developments in August 2007 and
issued an annual license for the Warrior developments in September 2007. These annual licenses are
automatically renewed each year without further action by the FERC to allow the Company to continue
operation of the projects under the terms of the previous license while the FERC completes review
of the applications for new licenses.

In 2006, the Company initiated the process of developing an application to relicense the Martin
hydroelectric project located on the Tallapoosa River. The current Martin license will expire in
2013 and the application for a new license is expected to be filed with the FERC in 2011.

Upon or after the expiration of each license, the U.S. Government, by act of Congress, may take
over the project or the FERC may relicense the project either to the original licensee or to a new
licensee. The FERC may grant relicenses subject to certain requirements that could result in
additional costs to the Company. The timing and final outcome of the Company’s relicense
applications cannot now be determined.

PSC Matters

Retail Rate Adjustments

In October 2005, the Alabama PSC approved a revision to Rate RSE requested by the Company.
Effective January 2007 and thereafter, Rate RSE adjustments are based on forward-looking
information for the applicable upcoming calendar year. Rate adjustments for any two-year period,
when averaged together, cannot exceed 4% per year and any annual adjustment is limited to 5%.
Retail rates remain unchanged when the return on retail common equity is projected to be between
13.0% and 14.5%. If the Company’s actual retail return on common equity is above the allowed
equity return range, customer refunds will be required; however, there is no provision for
additional customer billings should the actual retail return on common equity fall below the
allowed equity return range.

On October 7, 2008, the Alabama PSC approved a corrective rate package primarily providing for
adjustments associated with customer charges to certain existing rate structures. This package,
effective in January 2009, is expected to generate additional annual revenues of approximately $168
million. The Company agreed to a moratorium on any increase in rates in 2009 under Rate RSE. On
December 1, 2008, the Company made its submission of projected data for calendar year 2009. See
Note 3 to the financial statements under “Retail Regulatory Matters — Rate RSE” for further
information.

The Company’s retail rates, approved by the Alabama PSC, also provide for adjustments to recognize
the placing of new generating facilities into retail service and the recovery of retail costs
associated with certificated power purchase agreements (PPAs) under Rate CNP. In April 2006, an
annual adjustment to Rate CNP, associated with PPAs, increased retail rates by approximately 0.5%,
or $19 million annually. There was no rate adjustment associated with the annual adjustment to
Rate CNP, associated with PPAs, or the true-up adjustment in April 2007 and 2008. There will be no
adjustment to the current Rate CNP to recover certificated PPA costs in April 2009. See Note 3 to
the financial statements under “Retail Regulatory Matters — Rate CNP” for additional information.

Rate CNP also allows for the recovery of the Company’s retail costs associated with environmental
laws, regulations, or other such mandates. The rate mechanism, based on forward-looking
information provides for the recovery of these costs pursuant to a factor that is calculated
annually. Environmental costs to be recovered include operations and maintenance expenses,
depreciation, and a return on invested capital. Retail rates increased due to environmental costs
approximately 1.2% in January 2006, 0.6% in January 2007, and 2.4% in January 2008. On October 7,
2008, the Alabama PSC approved a corrective rate package primarily providing for adjustments
associated with customer charges to certain existing rate structures. As a part of the Alabama PSC
approval of the corrective rate package, the Alabama PSC and the Company agreed to defer any
environmental rate increase from 2009 to 2010. This

II-122


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2008 Annual Report

deferral will have an immaterial impact on annual cash flows, and will have no significant effect
on the Company’s revenues or net income. On December 1, 2008, the Company made its submission of
projected data for calendar year 2009. See Note 3 to the financial statements under “Retail
Regulatory Matters” for further information.

Retail Fuel Cost Recovery

The Company has established fuel cost recovery rates approved by the Alabama PSC. Rates are based
on an estimate of future energy costs and the current over or under recovered balance. The
Company, along with the Alabama PSC, will continue to monitor the under recovered fuel cost balance
to determine whether an additional adjustment to billing rates is required.

In June 2007, the Alabama PSC ordered the Company to increase its Rate ECR factor to 3.100 cents
per KWH effective with billings beginning July 2007 for the 30-month period ending December 2009.
The previous rate of 2.400 cents per KWH had been in effect since January 2006. This increase was
intended to permit recovery of energy costs based on an estimate of future energy cost, as well as
the collection of the existing under recovered energy cost by the end of 2009. During the recovery
period, the Company was allowed to include a carrying charge associated with the under recovered
fuel costs in the fuel expense calculation. In the event the application of this increased Rate
ECR factor results in an over recovered position during this period, the Company would pay interest
on any such over recovered balance at the same rate used to derive the carrying cost.

On October 7, 2008, the Alabama PSC approved an increase in the Company’s Rate ECR factor to 3.983
cents per KWH for a 24-month period beginning with October 9, 2008 billings. Thereafter, the Rate
ECR factor is 5.910 cents per KWH, absent a contrary order by the Alabama PSC. The previous rate
of 3.100 cents per KWH had been in effect since June 2007. During the 24-month period, the Company
will be allowed to continue to include a carrying charge associated with the under recovered fuel
costs in the fuel expense calculation. In the event the application of this increased Rate ECR
factor results in an over recovered position during this period, the Company will pay interest on
any such over recovered balance at the same rate used to derive the carrying cost.

The Company’s under recovered fuel costs as of December 31, 2008 totaled $305.8 million as compared
to $279.8 million at December 31, 2007. As a result of the Alabama PSC orders, the Company
classified $180.9 million and $81.7 million of the under recovered regulatory clause revenues as
deferred charges and other assets in the balance sheets as of December 31, 2008 and December 31,
2007, respectively. This classification is based on an estimate which includes such factors as
weather, generation availability, energy demand, and the price of energy. A change in any of these
factors could have a material impact on the timing of the recovery of the under recovered fuel
costs.

Rate ECR revenues, as recorded on the financial statements, are adjusted for the difference in
actual recoverable costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates. Accordingly, this approved
increase in the billing factor will have no significant effect on the Company’s revenues or net
income, but will increase annual cash flow.

Natural Disaster Cost Recovery

Based on an order from the Alabama PSC, the Company maintains a reserve for operations and
maintenance expense to cover the cost of damages from major storms to its transmission and
distribution facilities. See Note 1 and Note 3 to the financial statements under “Natural Disaster
Reserve” and “Retail Regulatory Matters — Natural Disaster Cost Recovery,” respectively, for
additional information on these reserves.

In December 2005, the Alabama PSC approved a request by the Company to replenish the depleted
natural disaster reserve (NDR) due to hurricanes in 2005 and allow for recovery of future natural
disaster costs. The Alabama PSC order gives the Company authority to record a deficit balance in
the NDR when costs of uninsured storm damage exceed any established reserve balance. The order
also approved a separate monthly NDR charge consisting of two components beginning in January 2006.
The first component is intended to establish and maintain a target reserve balance of $75 million
for future storms and is an on-going part of customer billing. Assuming no additional storms, the
Company currently expects that the target reserve balance could be achieved within three years.
The second component of the NDR charge is intended to allow recovery of any existing deferred
hurricane related operations and maintenance costs and any future reserve deficits over a 24-month
period. Absent further Alabama PSC approval, the maximum total NDR charge consisting of both
components is $10 per month per non-residential customer account and $5 per month per residential
customer account.

II-123


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2008 Annual Report

At December 31, 2008, the Company had an accumulated balance of $33.2 million in the target reserve
for future storms, which is included in the balance sheets under “Other Regulatory Liabilities.”
In June 2007, the Company fully recovered its storm costs of $51.3 million resulting from previous
hurricanes. As a result, customer rates decreased by this portion of the NDR charge effective in
July 2007.

As revenue from the NDR charge is recognized, an equal amount of operations and maintenance
expenses related to the NDR will also be recognized. As a result, this increase in revenue and
expense will not have an impact on net income but will increase annual cash flow.

Income Tax Matters

Legislation

On February 17, 2009, President Obama signed into law the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of
2009 (ARRA). Major tax incentives in the ARRA include an extension of bonus depreciation and
multiple renewable energy incentives. These incentives could have a significant impact on the
Company’s future cash flow and net income. Additionally, the ARRA includes programs for renewable
energy, transmission and smart grid enhancement, fossil energy and research, and energy efficiency
and conservation. The ultimate impact cannot be determined at this time.

Internal Revenue Code Section 199 Domestic Production Deduction

The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 created a tax deduction for a portion of income attributable
to U.S. production activities as defined in Section 199 (production activities deduction) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Internal Revenue Code). The deduction is equal to a
stated percentage of qualified production activities net income. The percentage is phased in over
the years 2005 through 2010 with a 3% rate applicable to the years 2005 and 2006, a 6% rate
applicable for years 2007 through 2009, and a 9% rate thereafter. The Internal Revenue Service has
not clearly defined a methodology for calculating this deduction. However, Southern Company has
agreed with the IRS on a calculation methodology and signed a closing agreement on December 11,
2008. Therefore, the Company reversed the unrecognized tax benefit and adjusted the deduction to
conform to the agreement. The net impact of the reversal of the unrecognized tax benefits combined
with the application of the new methodology had no material effect on the Company’s financial
statements. See Note 5 to the financial statements under “Effective Tax Rate” for additional
information.

Other Matters

In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 87, Employers’
Accounting for Pensions, the Company recorded non-cash pre-tax pension income of approximately $26
million, $17 million, and $13 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. Postretirement
benefit costs for the Company were $23 million, $27 million, and $28 million in 2008, 2007, and
2006, respectively. Such amounts are dependent on several factors including trust earnings and
changes to the plans. A portion of pension and postretirement benefit costs is capitalized based
on construction-related labor charges. Pension and postretirement benefit costs are a component of
the regulated rates and generally do not have a long-term effect on net income. For more
information regarding pension and postretirement benefits, see Note 2 to the financial statements.

The Company is involved in various other matters being litigated and regulatory matters that could
affect future earnings. In addition, the Company is subject to certain claims and legal actions
arising in the ordinary course of business. In addition, the Company’s business activities are
subject to extensive governmental regulation related to public health and the environment.
Litigation over environmental issues and claims of various types, including property damage,
personal injury, common law nuisance, and citizen enforcement of environmental requirements such as
opacity and air and water quality standards, has increased generally throughout the United States.
In particular, personal injury claims for damages caused by alleged exposure to hazardous materials
have become more frequent. The ultimate outcome of such pending or potential litigation against
the Company cannot be predicted at this time; however, for current proceedings not specifically
reported herein, management does not anticipate that the liabilities, if any, arising from such
current proceedings would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial statements.
See Note 3 to the financial statements for information regarding material issues.

Alabama Power Company 2008 Annual Report

ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The Company prepares its financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. Significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the
financial statements. In the application of these policies, certain estimates are made that may
have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations and related disclosures. Different
assumptions and measurements could produce estimates that are significantly different from those
recorded in the financial statements. Senior management has reviewed and discussed critical
accounting policies and estimates described below with the Audit Committee of Southern Company’s
Board of Directors.

Electric Utility Regulation

The Company is subject to retail regulation by the Alabama PSC and wholesale regulation by the
FERC. These regulatory agencies set the rates the Company is permitted to charge customers based
on allowable costs. As a result, the Company applies FASB Statement No. 71, “Accounting for the
Effects of Certain Types of Regulation” (SFAS No. 71), which requires the financial statements to
reflect the effects of rate regulation. Through the ratemaking process, the regulators may require
the inclusion of costs or revenues in periods different than when they would be recognized by a
non-regulated company. This treatment may result in the deferral of expenses and the recording of
related regulatory assets based on anticipated future recovery through rates or the deferral of
gains or creation of liabilities and the recording of related regulatory liabilities. The
application of SFAS No. 71 has a further effect on the Company’s financial statements as a result
of the estimates of allowable costs used in the ratemaking process. These estimates may differ
from those actually incurred by the Company; therefore, the accounting estimates inherent in
specific costs such as depreciation, nuclear decommissioning, and pension and postretirement
benefits have less of a direct impact on the Company’s financial statements than they would on a
non-regulated company.

As reflected in Note 1 to the financial statements under “Regulatory Assets and Liabilities,”
significant regulatory assets and liabilities have been recorded. Management reviews the ultimate
recoverability of these regulatory assets and liabilities based on applicable regulatory guidelines
and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. However, adverse legislative,
judicial, or regulatory actions could materially impact the amounts of such regulatory assets and
liabilities and could adversely impact the Company’s results of operations.

Contingent Obligations

The Company is subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, as well as other
factors and conditions that potentially subject it to environmental, litigation, income tax, and
other risks. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL herein and Note 3 to the financial statements for more
information regarding certain of these contingencies. The Company periodically evaluates its
exposure to such risks and, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, records
reserves for those matters where a non-tax-related loss is considered probable and reasonably
estimable and records a tax asset or liability if it is more likely than not that a tax position
will be sustained. The adequacy of reserves can be significantly affected by external events or
conditions that can be unpredictable; thus, the ultimate outcome of such matters could materially
affect the Company’s financial statements. These events or conditions include the following:

II-125


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2008 Annual Report

Unbilled Revenues

Revenues related to the retail sale of electricity are recorded when electricity is delivered to
customers. However, the determination of KWH sales to individual customers is based on the
reading of their meters, which is performed on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the
end of each month, amounts of electricity delivered to customers, but not yet metered and billed,
are estimated. Components of the unbilled revenue estimates include total KWH territorial supply,
total KWH billed, estimated total electricity lost in delivery, and customer usage. These
components can fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including weather, generation
patterns, power delivery volume and other operational constraints. These factors can be
unpredictable and can vary from historical trends. As a result, the overall estimate of unbilled
revenues could be significantly affected, which could have a material impact on the Company’s
results of operations.

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY

Overview

The Company’s financial condition remained stable at December 31, 2008. Throughout the recent
turmoil in the financial markets, the Company has maintained adequate access to capital without
drawing on any of its committed bank credit arrangements used to support its commercial paper
programs and variable rate pollution control revenue bonds. The Company has continued to issue
commercial paper at reasonable rates. The Company intends to continue to monitor its access to
short-term and long-term capital markets as well as its bank credit arrangements to meet future
capital and liquidity needs. No material changes in bank credit arrangements have occurred,
although market rates for committed credit have increased and the Company may be subject to higher
costs as its existing facilities are replaced or renewed. The Company’s interest cost for
short-term debt has decreased as market short-term interest rates have declined. The ultimate
impact on future financing costs as a result of the financial turmoil cannot be determined at this
time. The Company experienced no material counterparty credit losses as a result of the turmoil in
the financial markets. See “Sources of Capital” and “Financing Activities” herein for additional
information.

The Company’s investments in pension and nuclear decommissioning trust funds declined in value as
of December 31, 2008. The Company expects that the earliest that cash may have to be contributed
to the pension trust fund is 2011 and such contribution could be significant; however, projections
of the amount vary significantly depending on interpretations of and decisions related to federal
legislation passed during 2008 as well as other key variables including future trust fund
performance and cannot be determined at this time. The Company does not expect any changes to the
funding obligations to the nuclear decommissioning trust at this time.

Net cash provided from operating activities in 2008 totaled $1.2 billion, an increase of $30
million as compared to 2007. Significant changes in operating cash flow for 2008 included an
increase in the use of funds for fossil fuel inventory and payment of operating expenses along with
a higher receivables balance as compared 2007. This use of funds was offset by an increase in cash
from net income as previously discussed and higher depreciation expense along with a decrease in
the payments for federal taxes as compared to 2007. Net cash provided from operating activities in
2007 totaled $1.2 billion, an increase of $194 million as compared to 2006. The increase was
primarily due to an increase in net income resulting from price increases, an increase in deferred
taxes and the timing of payments related to operating expenses. Net cash provided from operating
activities in 2006 totaled $956 million, an increase of $48 million as compared to 2005. The
increase was primarily due to higher recovery rates for fuel and purchased power partially offset
by the timing of payments for operating expenses.

Net cash used for investing activities totaled $1.6 billion, $1.3 billion, and $1.0 billion for
2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, primarily due to gross property additions to utility plant of
$1.5 billion, $1.2 billion and $0.9 billion for 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. These
additions were primarily related to construction of transmission and distribution facilities,
replacement of steam generation equipment, purchases of nuclear fuel, and environmental mandates.

Net cash provided from financing activities totaled $375 million in 2008, $162 million in 2007, and
$14 million in 2006 primarily due to long term debt issuances and cash raised from common stock
sales in excess of redemptions of securities and dividends paid. Fluctuations in cash flow from
financing activities vary from year to year based on capital needs and securities redeemed.

Significant balance sheet changes for 2008 include an increase of $966 million in gross plant and
an increase of $855 million in long-term debt, primarily due to an increase in
environmental-related equipment. Other significant balance sheet changes were a result of a decline
in the market value of the Company’s pension trust and nuclear decommissioning trust funds,
impacting the Company’s other regulatory assets and liabilities. See Note 1 to the financial
statements under “Regulatory Assets and Liabilities” and “Nuclear

II-126


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2008 Annual Report

Decommissioning” and Note 2 under “Pension Plans” for additional information. In 2007, significant
balance sheet changes included an increase of $671 million in gross plant and an increase of $602
million in long-term debt, primarily due to an increase in environmental-related equipment.

The Company’s ratio of common equity to total capitalization, including short-term debt, was 42.5%
in 2008, 42.5% in 2007, and 42.1% in 2006. See Note 6 to the financial statements for additional
information.

The Company has maintained investment grade credit ratings from the major rating agencies with
respect to debt, preferred securities, preferred stock, and preference stock. See SELECTED
FINANCIAL AND OPERATING DATA for additional information regarding the Company’s securities ratings.

Sources of Capital

The Company plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from sources
similar to those used in the past, which were primarily from operating cash flows, unsecured debt,
common stock, preferred stock, and preference stock. However, the type and timing of any
financings will depend on market conditions, regulatory approval, and other factors.

Security issuances are subject to regulatory approval by the Alabama PSC. Additionally, with
respect to the public offering of securities, the Company files registration statements with the
Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The amounts of
securities authorized by the Alabama PSC are continuously monitored and appropriate filings are
made to ensure flexibility in the capital markets.

The Company obtains financing separately without credit support from any affiliate. See Note 6 to
the financial statements under “Bank Credit Arrangements” for additional information. The Southern
Company system does not maintain a centralized cash or money pool. Therefore, funds of the Company
are not commingled with funds of any other company.

The Company’s current liabilities sometimes exceed current assets because of the Company’s debt due
within one year and the periodic use of short-term debt as a funding source primarily to meet
scheduled maturities of long-term debt as well as cash needs which can fluctuate significantly due
to the seasonality of the business.

To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, the Company has various internal and external
sources of liquidity. At December 31, 2008, the Company had approximately $28.2 million of cash
and cash equivalents and $1.3 billion of unused credit arrangements with banks, as described below.
In addition, the Company has substantial cash flow from operating activities and access to the
capital markets, including a commercial paper program, to meet liquidity needs.

The Company maintains committed lines of credit in the amount of $1.3 billion, of which
$466 million will expire at various times during 2009. $379 million of the credit facilities
expiring in 2009 allow for the execution of term loans for an additional one-year period.
$765 million of credit facilities expire in 2012. See Note 6 to the financial statements under
“Bank Credit Arrangements” for additional information.

The Company may also meet short-term cash needs through a Southern Company subsidiary organized to
issue and sell commercial paper at the request and for the benefit of the Company and the other
traditional operating companies. Proceeds from such issuances for the benefit of the Company are
loaned directly to the Company and are not commingled with proceeds from such issuances for the
benefit of any other traditional operating company. The obligations of each company under these
arrangements are several and there is no cross affiliate credit support.

As of December 31, 2008, the Company had $25 million of commercial paper outstanding. As of
December 31, 2007, the Company had no commercial paper outstanding.

II-127


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2008 Annual Report

Financing Activities

During 2008, the Company issued $850 million of senior notes and incurred obligations related to
the issuance of $254 million of tax-exempt bonds. In addition, the Company issued a total of 7.5
million shares of its common stock at $40.00 per share and realized proceeds of $300 million. The
proceeds of these issuances were used to repay short-term indebtedness, to fund certain pollution
control, environmental improvement facilities and solid waste disposal facilities, and for general
corporate purposes.

Also during 2008, the Company paid at maturity $410 million of senior notes and redeemed 1,250
shares of its Flexible Money Market Class A Preferred Stock (Series 2003A), Stated Capital $100,000
Per Share ($125 million aggregate value).

Also during 2008, the Company entered into $330 million notional amount of interest rate swaps
related to variable rate pollution control revenue bonds to hedge changes in interest rates for the
period February 2008 through February 2010. The weighted average fixed payment rate on these
hedges is 2.49% and the Company now has a total of $576 million of such hedges in place, with an
overall weighted average fixed payment rate of 2.69%.

The Company converted its $246.5 million obligation related to auction rate pollution control
revenue bonds from an auction rate mode to fixed rate interest modes. With the completion of this
conversion in March 2008, none of the outstanding securities or obligations of the Company is
subject to an auction rate mode.

Also during 2008, the Company was required to purchase a total of approximately $11 million of
variable rate pollution control revenue bonds that were tendered by investors, all of which were
subsequently remarketed.

In addition to any financings that may be necessary to meet capital requirements and contractual
obligations, the Company plans to continue, when economically feasible, a program to retire
higher-cost securities and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital if market conditions
permit.

Credit Rating Risk

The Company does not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in payment
schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade. There are certain contracts
that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of a credit rating change
to BBB- and/or Baa3 or below. These contracts are primarily for fuel purchases, fuel
transportation and storage, emission allowances, and energy price risk management. At December 31,
2008, the maximum potential collateral requirements under these contracts at a BBB- and/or Baa3
rating were approximately $2 million. At December 31, 2008, the maximum potential collateral
requirements under these contracts at a rating below BBB- and/or Baa3 were approximately $99
million. Included in these amounts are certain agreements that could require collateral in the
event that one or more power pool participants has a credit rating change to below investment
grade. Generally, collateral may be provided by a Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit, or
cash. Additionally, any credit rating downgrade could impact the Company’s ability to access
capital markets, particularly the short-term debt market.

Market Price Risk

Due to cost-based rate regulations, the Company has limited exposure to market volatility in
interest rates, commodity fuel prices, and prices of electricity. To manage the volatility
attributable to these exposures, the Company nets the exposures, where possible, to take advantage
of natural offsets and enters into various derivative transactions for the remaining exposures
pursuant to the Company’s policies in areas such as counterparty exposure and risk management
practices. Company policy is that derivatives are to be used primarily for hedging purposes and
mandates strict adherence to all applicable risk management policies. Derivative positions are
monitored using techniques including, but not limited to, market valuation, value at risk, stress
testing, and sensitivity analysis.

II-128


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2008 Annual Report

To mitigate future exposure to changes in interest rates, the Company enters into forward starting
interest rate swaps and other derivatives that have been designated as hedges. The weighted
average interest rate on $250 million of long-term variable interest rate exposure that has not
been hedged at January 1, 2009 was 2.34%. If the Company sustained a 100 basis point change in
interest rates for all unhedged variable rate long-term debt, the change would affect annualized
interest expense by approximately $2.5 million at January 1, 2009. For further information, see
Notes 1 and 6 to the financial statements under “Financial Instruments.”

To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity prices, the Company enters into
fixed-price contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity through the wholesale electricity
market and, to a lesser extent, into financial hedge contracts for natural gas purchases. The
Company has implemented fuel hedging programs per the guidelines of the Alabama PSC.

In addition, the Company’s Rate ECR allows the recovery of specific costs associated with the sales
of natural gas that become necessary due to operating considerations at the Company’s electric
generating facilities. Rate ECR also allows recovery of the cost of financial instruments used for
hedging market price risk up to 75% of the budgeted annual amount of natural gas purchases. The
Company may not engage in natural gas hedging activities that extend beyond a rolling 42-month
window. Also, the premiums paid for natural gas financial options may not exceed 5% of the
Company’s natural gas budget for that year.

The changes in fair value of energy-related derivative contracts were as follows at December 31:

Current period changes also include the changes in fair value of new contracts entered into
during the period, if any.

The decrease in the fair value positions of the energy-related derivative contracts for the
year-ended December 31, 2008 was $91.5 million, substantially all of which is due to natural gas
positions. This change is attributable to both the volume and prices of natural gas. At December
31, 2008, the Company had a net hedge volume of 44.5 billion cubic feet (Bcf) with a weighted
average contract cost approximately $2.12 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) above market
prices, and 27.4 Bcf at December 31, 2007 with a weighted average contract cost approximately $0.02
per mmBtu above market prices. The majority of the natural gas hedges are recovered through the
fuel cost recovery clauses.

At December 31, the net fair value of energy-related derivative contracts by hedge designation was
reflected in the financial statements as assets/(liabilities) as follows:

Energy-related derivative contracts which are designated as regulatory hedges relate to the
Company’s fuel hedging program where gains and losses are initially recorded as regulatory
liabilities and assets, respectively, and then are included in fuel expense as they are recovered
through the fuel cost recovery clauses. Certain other gains and losses on energy-related
derivatives, designated as cash flow hedges, are initially deferred in other comprehensive income
before being recognized in income in the same period as the hedged transaction. Gains and losses
on energy-related derivative contracts that are not designated or fail to qualify as hedges are
recognized in the statements of income as incurred.

Unrealized pre-tax gains and losses from energy-related derivative contracts recognized in income
were not material for any year presented.

As part of the adoption of FASB Statement No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” to increase
consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, the table above
now uses the three-tier fair value hierarchy, as discussed in Note 10 to the financial statements,
as opposed to the previously used descriptions “actively quoted,” “external sources,” and “models
and other methods.” The three-tier fair value hierarchy focuses on the fair value of the contract
itself, whereas the previous descriptions focused on the source of the inputs. Because the Company
uses over-the-counter contracts that are not exchange traded but are fair valued using prices which
are actively quoted, the valuations of those contracts now appear in Level 2; previously they were
shown as “actively quoted.”

The Company is exposed to market risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to
energy-related and interest rate derivative contracts. The Company’s practice is to enter into
agreements with counterparties that have investment grade credit ratings by Moody’s and Standard &
Poor’s or with counterparties who have posted collateral to cover potential credit exposure.
Therefore, the Company does not anticipate market risk exposure from nonperformance by the
counterparties. For additional information, see Notes 1 and 6 to the financial statements under
“Financial Instruments.”

Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations

The construction program of the Company is currently estimated to be $1.4 billion for 2009,
$1.0 billion for 2010, and $1.0 billion for 2011. Environmental expenditures included in these
estimated amounts are $584 million, $131 million, and $59 million for 2009, 2010, and 2011,
respectively. Also included over the next three years, the Company estimates spending $586 million
on Plant Farley (including $341 million for nuclear fuel), $950 million on distribution facilities,
and $387 million on transmission additions. See Note 7 to the financial statements under
“Construction Program” for additional details.

The construction programs are subject to periodic review and revision, and actual construction
costs may vary from these estimates because of numerous factors. These factors include: changes in
business conditions; revised load growth estimates; changes in environmental statutes and
regulations; changes in nuclear plants to meet new regulatory requirements; changes in FERC rules
and regulations; Alabama PSC approvals; the cost and efficiency of construction labor, equipment,
and materials; and the cost of capital. In addition, there can be no assurance that costs related
to capital expenditures will be fully recovered. As a result of Nuclear Regulatory Commission
requirements, the Company has external trust funds for nuclear decommissioning costs; however, the
Company currently has no additional funding requirements. For additional information, see Note 1
to the financial statements under “Nuclear Decommissioning.”

In addition to the funds required for the Company’s construction program, approximately $550
million will be required by the end of 2011 for maturities of long-term debt. The Company plans to
continue, when economically feasible, to retire higher cost securities and replace these
obligations with lower-cost capital if market conditions permit.

The Company has also established an external trust fund for postretirement benefits as ordered by
the Alabama PSC. The cumulative effect of funding these items over a long period will diminish
internally funded capital for other purposes and may require the Company to seek capital from other
sources. For additional information, see Note 2 to the financial statements under “Postretirement
Benefits.”

Other funding requirements related to obligations associated with scheduled maturities of long-term
debt and preferred securities, as well as the related interest, derivative obligations, preferred
and preference stock dividends, leases, and other purchase commitments, are as follows. See
Notes 1, 6, and 7 to the financial statements for additional information.

All amounts are reflected based on final maturity dates. The Company plans to continue to retire
higher-cost securities and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital if market conditions permit.
Variable rate interest obligations are estimated based on rates as of January 1, 2009, as reflected in the
statements of capitalization. Fixed rates include, where applicable, the effects of interest rate
derivatives employed to manage interest rate risk.

(b)

Preferred and preference stock do not mature; therefore, amounts are provided for the next five years only.

(c)

For additional information, see Notes 1 and 6 to the financial statements.

(d)

The Company generally does not enter into non-cancelable commitments for other operations and maintenance
expenditures. Total other operations and maintenance expenses for 2008, 2007, and 2006 were
$1.26 billion, $1.19 billion, and $1.10 billion, respectively.

(e)

The Company forecasts capital expenditures over a three-year period. Amounts represent current estimates
of total expenditures excluding those amounts related to contractual purchase commitments for nuclear
fuel. At December 31, 2008, significant purchase commitments were outstanding in connection with the
construction program.

(f)

As part of the Company’s program to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions from certain of its coal plants, the
Company has begun construction of flue gas desulfurization projects and has entered into various long-term
commitments for the procurement of limestone to be used in such equipment.

(g)

Natural gas purchase commitments are based on various indices at the time of delivery. Amounts reflected
have been estimated based on the New York Mercantile Exchange future prices at December 31, 2008.

(h)

Long-term service agreements include price escalation based on inflation indices.

(i)

The Company forecasts postretirement trust contributions over a three-year period. The Company expects
that the earliest that cash may have to be contributed to the pension trust fund is 2011 and such
contribution could be significant; however, projections of the amount vary significantly depending on
interpretations of and decisions related to federal legislation passed during 2008 as well as other key
variables including future trust fund performance and cannot be determined at this time. Therefore, no
amounts related to the pension trust are included in the table. See Note 2 to the financial statements
for additional information related to the pension and postretirement plans, including estimated benefit
payments. Certain benefit payments will be made through the related trusts. Other benefit payments will
be made from the Company’s corporate assets.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Alabama Power Company 2008 Annual Report

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

General

Alabama Power Company (the Company) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Southern Company, which is the
parent company of four traditional operating companies, Southern Power Company (Southern Power),
Southern Company Services, Inc. (SCS), Southern Communications Services, Inc. (SouthernLINC
Wireless), Southern Company Holdings, Inc. (Southern Holdings), Southern Nuclear Operating Company,
Inc. (Southern Nuclear), and other direct and indirect subsidiaries. The traditional operating
companies — the Company, Georgia Power Company (Georgia Power), Gulf Power Company (Gulf Power),
and Mississippi Power Company (Mississippi Power). The Company provides electricity to retail
customers within its traditional service area located within the State of Alabama and to wholesale
customers in the Southeast. Southern Power constructs, acquires, owns, and manages generation
assets, and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market. SCS, the system
service company, provides, at cost, specialized services to Southern Company and its subsidiary
companies. SouthernLINC Wireless provides digital wireless communications for use by Southern
Company and its subsidiary companies and also markets these services to the public and provides
fiber cable services within the Southeast. Southern Holdings is an intermediate holding company
subsidiary for Southern Company’s investments in leveraged leases and various other energy-related
businesses. The investments in synthetic fuels ended on December 31, 2007. Southern Nuclear
operates and provides services to Southern Company’s nuclear power plants, including the Company’s
Plant Farley.

The equity method is used for subsidiaries in which the Company has significant influence but does
not control and for variable interest entities where the Company is not the primary beneficiary.

The Company is subject to regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the
Alabama Public Service Commission (PSC). The Company follows accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States and complies with the accounting policies and practices prescribed by
its regulatory commissions. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires the use of estimates, and the actual
results may differ from those estimates.

Reclassifications

Certain prior years’ data presented in the financial statements have been reclassified to conform
with current year presentation. The statements of cash flows for the prior periods presented have
been modified within the operating activities section to combine the amount of “Deferred revenues”
and “Hedge settlements” into “Other, net.” The statements of income for the prior periods
presented have been modified within the operating expenses section to combine the line items “Other
operations” and “Maintenance” into a single line item entitled “Other operations and maintenance.”
The balance sheet at December 31, 2007 was modified to present a separate line for “Liabilities for
risk management activities” previously included in “Other.” These reclassifications had no effect
on total assets, cash flows, or net income.

Affiliate Transactions

The Company has an agreement with SCS under which the following services are rendered to the
Company at direct or allocated cost: general and design engineering, purchasing, accounting and
statistical analysis, finance and treasury, tax, information resources, marketing, auditing,
insurance and pension administration, human resources, systems and procedures, digital wireless
communications, and other services with respect to business and operations and power pool
transactions. Costs for these services amounted to $321 million, $299 million, and $266 million
during 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. Cost allocation methodologies used by SCS were approved
by the Securities and Exchange Commission prior to the repeal of the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935, as amended, and management believes they are reasonable. The FERC permits services to
be rendered at cost by system service companies.

The Company has an agreement with Southern Nuclear under which Southern Nuclear operates the
Company’s Plant Farley and provides the following nuclear-related services at cost: general
executive and advisory services, general operations, management and

II-140


NOTES (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2008 Annual Report

technical services, administrative services including procurement, accounting, statistical
analysis, employee relations, and other services with respect to business and operations. Costs
for these services amounted to $196 million, $182 million, and $162 million during 2008, 2007, and
2006, respectively.

The Company jointly owns Plant Greene County with Mississippi Power. The Company has an agreement
with Mississippi Power under which the Company operates Plant Greene County, and Mississippi Power
reimburses the Company for its proportionate share of non-fuel expenses which were $11.1 million in
2008, $9.8 million in 2007, and $8.6 million in 2006. See Note 4 for additional information.

Southern Company’s 30% ownership interest in Alabama Fuel Products, LLC (AFP), which produced
synthetic fuel was terminated in July 2006. The Company had an agreement with an indirect
subsidiary of Southern Company that provided services for AFP. Under this agreement, the Company
provided certain accounting functions, including processing and paying fuel transportation
invoices, and the Company was reimbursed for its expenses. Amounts billed under this agreement
totaled approximately $1.2 million, $58.1 million, and $56.5 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006,
respectively. In addition, the Company purchased synthetic fuel from AFP for use at several of the
Company’s plants. Synthetic fuel purchases totaled $6.2 million, $462.1 million, and $446.6
million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. The synthetic fuel purchases and related party
transactions were terminated as of December 31, 2007.

The Company had an agreement with Southern Power under which the Company operated and maintained
Plant Harris at cost. On August 1, 2007, that agreement was terminated and replaced with a service
agreement under which the Company provides to Southern Power specifically requested services. In
2008, 2007, and 2006, the Company billed Southern Power $0.9 million, $2.4 million, and
$2.2 million, respectively, under these agreements. Under a power purchase agreement (PPA) with
Southern Power, the Company’s purchased power costs from Plant Harris in 2008, 2007, and 2006
totaled $63.2 million, $66.3 million, and $61.7 million, respectively. The Company also provides
the fuel, at cost, associated with the PPA and the fuel cost recognized by the Company was
$119.6 million in 2008, $108.1 million in 2007, and $77.8 million in 2006. Additionally, the
Company recorded $8.3 million of prepaid capacity expenses included in other deferred charges and
other assets in the balance sheets at December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. See Note 3 under “Retail
Regulatory Matters” and Note 7 under “Purchased Power Commitments” for additional information.

Also, see Note 4 for information regarding the Company’s ownership in and PPA with Southern
Electric Generating Company (SEGCO).

In the second quarter, Southern Power sold a turbine rotor assembly to the Company for
approximately $8.2 million. In October 2008, the Company also sold a rotor to Southern Power for
approximately $6.3 million and sold a distance piece component to Gulf Power for approximately $0.3
million. In the fourth quarter, the Company purchased from SEGCO two 230kV transmission lines.
The purchase price for the transmission line facilities was approximately $3.9 million. These
affiliate transactions were made in accordance with FERC and Alabama PSC rules and guidelines.

The traditional operating companies, including the Company, and Southern Power jointly enter into
various types of wholesale energy, natural gas, and certain other contracts, either directly or
through SCS as agent. Each participating company may be jointly and severally liable for the
obligations incurred under these agreements. See Note 7 under “Fuel Commitments” for additional
information.

Regulatory Assets and Liabilities

The Company is subject to the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement
No. 71, “Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation” (SFAS No. 71). Regulatory
assets represent probable future revenues associated with certain costs that are expected to be
recovered from customers through the ratemaking process. Regulatory liabilities represent probable
future reductions in revenues associated with amounts that are expected to be credited to customers
through the ratemaking process.

Note:

The recovery and amortization periods for these regulatory assets and (liabilities) are as follows:

(a)

Asset retirement and removal liabilities are recorded, deferred income tax assets are recovered, and deferred tax liabilities are
amortized over the related property lives, which may range up to 50 years. Asset retirement and removal liabilities will be settled
and trued up following completion of the related activities.

(b)

Recovered over the remaining life of the original issue which may range up to 50 years.

(c)

Recorded as earned by employees and recovered as paid, generally within one year. This includes both vacation and banked holiday pay.

(d)

Recorded and recovered or amortized as approved or accepted by the Alabama PSC.

(e)

Fuel-hedging assets and liabilities are recorded over the life of the underlying hedged purchase contracts, which generally does not
exceed two years. Upon final settlement, actual costs incurred are recovered through the fuel cost recovery clauses.

(f)

Recovered and amortized over the average remaining service period which may range up to 14 years. See Note 2 for additional
information.

In the event that a portion of the Company’s operations is no longer subject to the provisions of
SFAS No. 71, the Company would be required to write off or reclassify to accumulated other
comprehensive income related regulatory assets and liabilities that are not specifically
recoverable through regulated rates. In addition, the Company would be required to determine if
any impairment to other assets, including plant, exists and write down the assets, if impaired, to
their fair values. All regulatory assets and liabilities are to be reflected in rates.

Revenues

Energy and other revenues are recognized as services are provided. Wholesale capacity revenues are
generally recognized on a levelized basis over the appropriate contract periods. Unbilled revenues
are accrued at the end of each fiscal period. Electric rates for the Company include provisions to
adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, fuel hedging, the energy component of purchased
power costs, and certain other costs. Revenues are adjusted for differences between these actual
costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates. Under or over recovered regulatory clause
revenues are recorded in the balance sheets and are recovered or returned to customers through
adjustments to the billing factors. The Company continuously monitors the under/over recovered
balances and files for revised rates as required or when management deems appropriate depending on
the rate. See Note 3 under “Retail Regulatory Matters — Fuel Cost Recovery” for additional
information.

The Company has a diversified base of customers. No single customer comprises 10% or more of
revenues. For all periods presented, uncollectible accounts averaged less than one percent of
revenues.

II-142


NOTES (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2008 Annual Report

Fuel Costs

Fuel costs are expensed as the fuel is used. Fuel expense includes the cost of purchased emission
allowances as they are used. Fuel expense also includes the amortization of the cost of nuclear
fuel and a charge, based on nuclear generation, for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel.
See Note 3 under “Nuclear Fuel Disposal Costs” for additional information.

Income and Other Taxes

The Company uses the liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes and provides deferred
income taxes for all significant income tax temporary differences. Investment tax credits utilized
are deferred and amortized to income over the average life of the related property. Taxes that are
collected from customers on behalf of governmental agencies to be remitted to these agencies are
presented net on the statements of income.

In accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes” (FIN
48), the Company recognizes tax positions that are “more likely than not” of being sustained upon
examination by the appropriate taxing authorities. See Note 5 under “Unrecognized Tax Benefits”
for additional information.

Property, Plant, and Equipment

Property, plant, and equipment is stated at original cost less regulatory disallowances and
impairments. Original cost includes: materials; labor; minor items of property; appropriate
administrative and general costs; payroll-related costs such as taxes, pensions, and other
benefits; and the interest capitalized and/or cost of funds used during construction.

The Company’s property, plant, and equipment consisted of the following at December 31:

The cost of replacements of property — exclusive of minor items of property — is capitalized. The
cost of maintenance, repairs, and replacement of minor items of property is charged to maintenance
expense as incurred or performed with the exception of nuclear refueling costs, which are recorded
in accordance with specific Alabama PSC orders. The Company accrues estimated nuclear refueling
costs in advance of the unit’s next refueling outage. The refueling cycle is 18 months for each
unit. During 2008, the Company accrued $39.4 million and paid $28.5 million for an outage at Plant
Farley Unit 2. At December 31, 2008, the reserve balance totaled $8.7 million and is included in
the balance sheet in other regulatory liabilities.

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation of the original cost of utility plant in service is provided primarily by using
composite straight-line rates, which approximated 3.2% in 2008 and 3.1% in 2007 and 2006.
Depreciation studies are conducted periodically to update the composite rates and the information
is provided to the Alabama PSC and approved by the FERC. When property subject to depreciation is
retired or otherwise disposed of in the normal course of business, its original cost, together with
the cost of removal, less salvage, is charged to accumulated depreciation. For other property
dispositions, the applicable cost and accumulated depreciation is removed from the balance sheet
accounts and a gain or loss is recognized. Minor items of property included in the original cost
of the plant are retired when the related property unit is retired.

II-143


NOTES (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2008 Annual Report

Asset Retirement Obligations and Other Costs of Removal

Asset retirement obligations are computed as the present value of the ultimate costs for an asset’s
future retirement and are recorded in the period in which the liability is incurred. The costs are
capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset’s useful life.
The Company has received accounting guidance from the Alabama PSC allowing the continued accrual of
other future retirement costs for long-lived assets that the Company does not have a legal
obligation to retire. Accordingly, the accumulated removal costs for these obligations will
continue to be reflected in the balance sheets as a regulatory liability.

The liability recognized to retire long-lived assets primarily relates to the Company’s nuclear
facility, Plant Farley. The fair value of assets legally restricted for settling retirement
obligations related to nuclear facilities as of December 31, 2008 was $404 million. In addition,
the Company has retirement obligations related to various landfill sites and underground storage
tanks, asbestos removal, and disposal of polychlorinated biphenyls in certain transformers. The
Company also has identified retirement obligations related to certain transmission and distribution
facilities and certain wireless communication towers. However, liabilities for the removal of
these assets have not been recorded because the range of time over which the Company may settle
these obligations is unknown and cannot be reasonably estimated. The Company will continue to
recognize in the statements of income allowed removal costs in accordance with its regulatory
treatment. Any differences between costs recognized under Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations” and FASB Interpretation No. 47,
“Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations” and those reflected in rates are
recognized as either a regulatory asset or liability, as ordered by the Alabama PSC, and are
reflected in the balance sheets. See “Nuclear Decommissioning” for further information on amounts
included in rates.

Nuclear Decommissioning

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) requires licensees of commercial nuclear power reactors to
establish a plan for providing reasonable assurance of funds for future decommissioning. The
Company has an external trust fund (the Fund) to comply with the NRC’s regulations. Use of the
Fund is restricted to nuclear decommissioning activities and the Fund is managed and invested in
accordance with applicable requirements of various regulatory bodies, including the NRC, the FERC,
and the Alabama PSC, as well as the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Fund is invested in a
tax-efficient manner in a diversified mix of equity and fixed income securities and are reported as
of December 31, 2008 as trading securities pursuant to FASB Statement No. 115, “Accounting for
Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities” (SFAS No. 115).

On January 1, 2008, the Company adopted FASB Statement No. 159, “Fair Value Option for Financial
Assets and Financial Liabilities — Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115” (SFAS No.
159). This standard permits an entity to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain
other items at fair value. The Company elected the fair value option only for investment
securities held in the Fund. The Fund is included in the balance sheets at fair value, as
disclosed in Note 10.

Management elected to continue to record the Fund at fair value because management believes that
fair value best represents the nature of the Fund. Management has delegated day-to-day management
of the investments in the Fund to unrelated third party managers with oversight by Company
management. The managers of the Fund are authorized, within broad limits, to actively buy and sell
securities at their own discretion in order to maximize the investment return on the Fund
investments. Because of the Company’s inability to choose to hold securities that have experienced
unrealized losses until recovery of their value, all unrealized losses incurred during 2006 and
2007, prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 159, were considered other-than-temporary impairments under
SFAS No. 115.

II-144


NOTES (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2008 Annual Report

The adoption of SFAS No. 159 had no impact on the results of operations, cash flows, or financial
condition of the Company. For all periods presented, all gains and losses, whether realized,
unrealized, or identified as other-than-temporary, have been and will continue to be recorded in
the regulatory liability for asset retirement obligations in the balance sheets and are not
included in net income or other comprehensive income. Fair value adjustments, realized gains, and
other-than-temporary impairment losses are determined on a specific identification basis.

At December 31, 2008, investment securities in the Fund totaled $402.9 million consisting of equity
securities of $256.7 million, debt securities of $135.3 million, and $10.9 million of other
securities. These amounts exclude receivables related to investment income and pending investment
sales, and payables related to pending investment purchases.

At December 31, 2007, investment securities in the Fund totaled $542.8 million consisting of equity
securities of $385.4 million, debt securities of $140.2 million, and $17.2 million of other
securities. Unrealized gains were $130.8 million for equity securities, $7.0 million debt
securities, and $0.1 million for other securities. Other-than-temporary impairments were $(15.7)
million for equity securities and $(3.5) million for debt securities.

Sales of the securities held in the Fund resulted in cash proceeds of $299.6 million, $333.4
million, and $285.7 million, in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, all of which were re-invested.
For 2008, fair value reductions, including reinvested interest and dividends, were $134.4 million,
of which $107.6 million related to securities held in the Fund at December 31, 2008. Realized
gains and other-than-temporary impairment losses were $34.6 million and $37.2 million,
respectively, in 2007 and $22.0 million and $18.2 million, respectively, in 2006. While the
investment securities held in the Fund are reported as trading securities from the perspective of
SFAS No. 115, the Fund continues to be managed with a long-term focus. Accordingly, all purchases
and sales within the Fund are presented separately in the statements of cash flows as investing
cash flows, consistent with the nature of and purpose for which the securities were acquired.

Amounts previously recorded in internal reserves are being transferred into the external trust
funds over periods approved by the Alabama PSC. The NRC’s minimum external funding requirements
are based on a generic estimate of the cost to decommission only the radioactive portions of a
nuclear unit based on the size and type of reactor. The Company has filed a plan with the NRC
designed to ensure that, over time, the deposits and earnings of the external trust funds will
provide the minimum funding amounts prescribed by the NRC. At December 31, 2008, the accumulated
provisions for decommissioning were as follows:

(in millions)

External trust funds

$


Internal reserves

Site study cost is the estimate to decommission the facility as of the site study year. The
estimated costs of decommissioning based on the most current study performed in 2008 for Plant

Decommissioning periods:

Beginning year


Completion year


(in millions)

Site study costs:

The decommissioning cost estimates are based on prompt dismantlement and removal of the plant from
service. The actual decommissioning costs may vary from the above estimates because of changes in
the assumed date of decommissioning, changes in NRC requirements, or changes in the assumptions
used in making these estimates.

For ratemaking purposes, the Company’s decommissioning costs are based on the site study.
Significant assumptions used to determine these costs for ratemaking were an inflation rate of 4.5%
and a trust earnings rate of 7.0%.

II-145


NOTES (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2008 Annual Report

Amounts previously contributed to the external trust fund are currently projected to be adequate to
meet the decommissioning obligations. The Company will continue to provide site specific estimates
of the decommissioning costs and related projections of funds in the external trust to the Alabama
PSC and, if necessary, would seek the Alabama PSC’s approval to address any changes in a manner
consistent with the NRC and other applicable requirements. The Company continues to transfer
internal reserves (less than $1 million annually) previously collected from customers prior to the
establishment of the external trust.

Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC)

In accordance with regulatory treatment, the Company records AFUDC, which represents the estimated
debt and equity costs of capital funds that are necessary to finance the construction of new
regulated facilities. While cash is not realized currently from such allowance, it increases the
revenue requirement over the service life of the plant through a higher rate base and higher
depreciation expense. The equity component of AFUDC is not included in calculating taxable income.
All current construction costs are included in retail rates. The composite rate used to determine
the amount of AFUDC was 9.2% in 2008, 9.4% in 2007, and 8.8% in 2006. AFUDC, net of income tax, as
a percent of net income after dividends on preferred and preference stock was 9.4% in 2008, 8.0% in
2007, and 4.5% in 2006.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles

The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. The determination of
whether an impairment has occurred is based on either a specific regulatory disallowance or an
estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets, as compared with the
carrying value of the assets. If an impairment has occurred, the amount of the impairment
recognized is determined by either the amount of regulatory disallowance or by estimating the fair
value of the assets and recording a loss if the carrying value is greater than the fair value. For
assets identified as held for sale, the carrying value is compared to the estimated fair value less
the cost to sell in order to determine if an impairment loss is required. Until the assets are
disposed of, their estimated fair value is re-evaluated when circumstances or events change.

Natural Disaster Reserve

In accordance with an Alabama PSC order, the Company has established a natural disaster reserve
(NDR) to cover the cost of uninsured damages from major storms to transmission and distribution
facilities. The Company is authorized to collect a monthly NDR charge per account that consists of
two components which began on January 1, 2006. The first component is intended to establish and
maintain a reserve for future storms and is an on-going part of customer billing. This plan has a
target reserve balance of $75 million that could be achieved within three years assuming the
Company experiences no additional storms. The second component of the NDR charge is intended to
allow recovery of any existing deferred hurricane related operations and maintenance costs and any
future reserve deficits over a 24-month period. The Alabama PSC order gives the Company authority
to have a negative NDR balance when costs of uninsured storm damage exceed any established NDR
balance. Absent further Alabama PSC approval, the maximum total NDR charge consisting of both
components is $10 per month per account for non-residential customers and $5 per month per account
for residential customers.

At December 31, 2008, the Company had accumulated a balance of $33.2 million in the target reserve
for future storms, which is included in the balance sheets under “Other Regulatory Liabilities.”
In June 2007, the Company fully recovered its prior storm cost of $51.3 million resulting from
Hurricanes Dennis and Katrina. As a result, customer rates decreased by this portion of the NDR
charge effective July 1, 2007.

As revenue from the NDR charge is recognized, an equal amount of operations and maintenance expense
related to the NDR will also be recognized. As a result, this increase in revenue and expense will
not have an impact on net income, but will increase annual cash flow.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

For purposes of the financial statements, temporary cash investments are considered cash
equivalents. Temporary cash investments are securities with original maturities of 90 days or
less.

II-146


NOTES (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2008 Annual Report

Materials and Supplies

Generally, materials and supplies include the average cost of transmission, distribution, and
generating plant materials. Materials are charged to inventory when purchased and expensed or
capitalized to plant, as appropriate, at weighted average cost when installed.

Fuel Inventory

Fuel inventory includes the average costs of oil, coal, natural gas, and emission allowances. Fuel
is charged to inventory when purchased and then expensed as used and recovered by the Company
through fuel cost recovery rates approved by the Alabama PSC. Emission allowances granted by the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are included in inventory at zero cost.

Financial Instruments

The Company uses derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to fluctuations in interest
rates, the prices of certain fuel purchases, and electricity purchases and sales. All derivative
financial instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities (categorized in “Other” or
shown separately as “Risk Management Activities”) and are measured at fair value. See Note 10 for
additional information. Substantially all of the Company’s bulk energy purchases and sales
contracts that meet the definition of a derivative are exempt from fair value accounting
requirements and are accounted for under the accrual method. Other derivative contracts qualify as
cash flow hedges of anticipated transactions or are recoverable through the Alabama PSC-approved
fuel hedging program. This results in the deferral of related gains and losses in other
comprehensive income or regulatory assets and liabilities, respectively, until the hedged
transactions occur. Any ineffectiveness arising from cash flow hedges is recognized currently in
net income. Other derivative contracts are marked to market through current period income and are
recorded on a net basis in the statements of income. See Note 6 under “Financial Instruments” for
additional information.

The Company does not offset fair value amounts recognized for multiple derivative instruments
executed with the same counterparty under a master netting arrangement. Additionally, the Company
has no outstanding collateral repayment obligations or rights to reclaim collateral arising from
derivative instruments recognized at December 31, 2008.

The Company is exposed to losses related to financial instruments in the event of counterparties’
nonperformance. The Company has established controls to determine and monitor the creditworthiness
of counterparties in order to mitigate the Company’s exposure to counterparty credit risk.

The Company’s other financial instruments for which the carrying amounts did not equal fair values
at December 31 were as follows:

Carrying Amount

Fair Value

(in millions)

Long-term debt:


$

5,855

$

5,784


5,160

5,079

The fair values were based on either closing market prices (Level 1) or closing prices of
comparable instruments (Level 2). See Note 10 for all other items recognized at fair value in the
financial statements.

Comprehensive Income

The objective of comprehensive income is to report a measure of all changes in common stock equity
of an enterprise that result from transactions and other economic events of the period other than
transactions with owners. Comprehensive income consists of net income, changes in the fair value
of qualifying cash flow hedges, and prior to the adoption of SFAS No.158, “Employers’ Accounting
for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans” (SFAS No. 158), the minimum pension
liability, less income taxes and reclassifications for amounts included in net income.

Variable Interest Entities

The primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity must consolidate the related assets and
liabilities. The Company has established certain wholly-owned trusts to issue preferred
securities. See Note 6 under “Long-Term Debt Payable to Affiliated Trusts” for additional
information. However, the Company is not considered the primary beneficiary of the trusts.
Therefore, the investments in

II-147


NOTES (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2008 Annual Report

these trusts are reflected as Other Investments, and the related loans from the trusts are included
in Long-term Debt in the balance sheets.

Investments

The Company maintains an investment in a debt security that matures in 2018 and is classified as
available-for-sale. This security is included in the balance sheets under Other Property and
Investments-Other and totaled $0.4 million and $2.3 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
respectively. Because the interest rate resets weekly, the carrying value approximates the fair
market value.

2. RETIREMENT BENEFITS

The Company has a defined benefit, trusteed, pension plan covering substantially all employees.
The plan is funded in accordance with requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
of 1974, as amended (ERISA). No contributions to the plan are expected for the year ending December
31, 2009. The Company also provides certain defined benefit pension plans for a selected group of
management and highly compensated employees. Benefits under these non-qualified pension plans are
funded on a cash basis. In addition, the Company provides certain medical care and life insurance
benefits for retired employees through other postretirement benefit plans. The Company funds
trusts to the extent required by the Alabama PSC and the FERC. For the year ending December 31,
2009, postretirement trust contributions are expected to total approximately $17.2 million.

The measurement date for plan assets and obligations for 2008 was December 31 while the measurement
date for prior years was September 30. Pursuant to SFAS No. 158, the Company was required to
change the measurement date for its defined benefit postretirement plans from September 30 to
December 31 beginning with the year ended December 31, 2008. As permitted, the Company adopted the
measurement date provisions of SFAS No. 158 effective January 1, 2008 resulting in an increase in
long-term liabilities of approximately $5 million and an increase in prepaid pension costs of
approximately $11 million.

Pension Plans

The total accumulated benefit obligation for the pension plans was $1.4 billion in 2008 and $1.3
billion in 2007. Changes during the 15-month period ended December 31, 2008 and 12-month period
ended September 30, 2007 in the projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets
were as follows:

At December 31, 2008, the projected benefit obligations for the qualified and non-qualified pension
plans were $1.4 billion and $87 million, respectively. All pension plan assets are related to the
qualified pension plan.

Pension plan assets are managed and invested in accordance with all applicable requirements,
including ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Internal Revenue Code). The
Company’s investment policy covers a diversified mix of assets, including equity and fixed income
securities, real estate, and private equity. Derivative instruments are used primarily as hedging
tools but may also be used to gain efficient exposure to the various asset classes. The Company
primarily minimizes the risk of large losses through diversification but also monitors and manages
other aspects of risk. The actual composition of the Company’s pension plan assets as of the end

Net periodic pension cost (income) is the sum of service cost, interest cost, and other costs
netted against the expected return on plan assets. The expected return on plan assets is determined
by multiplying the expected rate of return on plan assets and the market-related value of plan
assets. In determining the market-related value of plan assets, the Company has elected to amortize
changes in the market value of all plan assets over five years rather than recognize the changes
immediately. As a result, the accounting value of plan assets that is used to calculate the
expected return on plan assets differs from the current fair value of the plan assets.

Future benefit payments reflect expected future service and are estimated based on assumptions used
to measure the projected benefit obligation for the pension plans. At December 31, 2008, estimated
benefit payments were as follows:

The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (Medicare Act) provides

Actuarial Assumptions

The weighted average rates assumed in the actuarial calculations used to determine both the benefit
obligations as of the measurement date and the net periodic costs for the pension and other
postretirement benefit plans for the following year are presented below. Net periodic benefit
costs were calculated in 2005 for the 2006 plan year, using a discount rate of 5.50%.

The Company determined the long-term rate of return based on historical asset class returns and
current market conditions, taking into account the diversification benefits of investing in
multiple asset classes.

An additional assumption used in measuring the APBO was a weighted average medical care cost trend
rate of 9.15% for 2009, decreasing gradually to 5.50% through the year 2015, and remaining at that
level thereafter. An annual increase or decrease in the assumed medical care cost trend rate of 1%
would affect the APBO and the service and interest cost components at December 31, 2008 as follows:

Employee Savings Plan

The Company also sponsors a 401(k) defined contribution plan covering substantially all employees.
The Company provides an 85% matching contribution up to 6% of an employee’s base salary. Prior to
November 2006, the Company matched employee contributions at a rate of 75% up to 6% of the
employee’s base salary. Total matching contributions made to the plan for 2008, 2007, and 2006
were $18 million, $17 million, and $14 million, respectively.

3. CONTINGENCIES AND REGULATORY MATTERS

General Litigation Matters

The Company is subject to certain claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of
business. In addition, the Company’s business activities are subject to extensive governmental
regulation related to public health and the environment. Litigation over environmental issues and
claims of various types, including property damage, personal injury, common law nuisance, and
citizen enforcement of environmental requirements such as opacity and air and water quality
standards, has increased generally throughout the United States. In particular, personal injury
claims for damages caused by alleged exposure to hazardous materials have become more frequent.
The ultimate outcome of such pending or potential litigation against the Company cannot be
predicted at this time; however, for current proceedings not specifically reported herein,
management does not anticipate that the liabilities, if any, arising from such current proceedings
would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial statements.

Alabama Power Company 2008 Annual Report

Environmental Matters

New Source Review Actions

In November 1999, the EPA brought a civil action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of Georgia against certain Southern Company subsidiaries, including the Company, alleging
that it had violated the New Source Review (NSR) provisions of the Clean Air Act and related state
laws at certain coal-fired generating facilities. Through subsequent amendments and other legal
procedures, the EPA filed a separate action in January 2001 against the Company in the U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of Alabama after the Company was dismissed from the
original action. In this lawsuit, the EPA alleged that NSR violations occurred at five coal-fired
generating facilities operated by the Company. The civil action requests penalties and injunctive
relief, including an order requiring the installation of the best available control technology at
the affected units.

In June 2006, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama entered a consent decree
between the Company and the EPA, resolving a portion of the Company’s lawsuit relating to the
alleged NSR violations at Plant Miller. The consent decree required the Company to pay $100,000 to
resolve the government’s claim for a civil penalty and to donate $4.9 million of sulfur dioxide
emission allowances to a nonprofit charitable organization. It also formalized specific emissions
reductions to be accomplished by the Company, consistent with other Clean Air Act programs that
require emissions reductions. In August 2006, the district court in Alabama granted the Company’s
motion for summary judgment and entered final judgment in favor of the Company on the EPA’s claims
related to all of the remaining plants: Plants Barry, Gaston, Gorgas, and Greene County.

The plaintiffs appealed the district court’s decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh
Circuit, where the appeal was stayed, pending the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in a similar case
against Duke Energy. The Supreme Court issued its decision in the Duke Energy case in April 2007,
and in December 2007, the Eleventh Circuit vacated the district court’s decision in the Company’s
case and remanded the case back to the district court for consideration of the legal issues in
light of the Supreme Court’s decision in the Duke Energy case. On July 24, 2008, the U.S. District
Court for the Northern District of Alabama granted partial summary judgment in favor of the Company
regarding the proper legal test for determining whether projects are routine maintenance, repair,
and replacement and therefore are excluded from NSR permitting. The decision did not resolve the
case and the ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

The Company believes that it complied with applicable laws and the EPA regulations and
interpretations in effect at the time the work in question took place. The Clean Air Act
authorizes maximum civil penalties of $25,000 to $37,500 per day, per violation at each generating
unit, depending on the date of the alleged violation. An adverse outcome in this matter could
require substantial capital expenditures or affect the timing of currently budgeted capital
expenditures that cannot be determined at this time and could possibly require payment of
substantial penalties. Such expenditures could affect future results of operations, cash flows,
and financial condition if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates.

Carbon Dioxide Litigation

New York Case

In July 2004, three environmental groups and attorneys general from eight states, each outside of
Southern Company’s service territory, and the corporation counsel for New York City filed
complaints in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against Southern
Company and four other electric power companies. The complaints allege that the companies’
emissions of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, contribute to global warming, which the plaintiffs
assert is a public nuisance. Under common law public and private nuisance theories, the plaintiffs
seek a judicial order (1) holding each defendant jointly and severally liable for creating,
contributing to, and/or maintaining global warming and (2) requiring each of the defendants to cap
its emissions of carbon dioxide and then reduce those emissions by a specified percentage each year
for at least a decade. The plaintiffs have not, however, requested that damages be awarded in
connection with their claims. Southern Company believes these claims are without merit and notes
that the complaint cites no statutory or regulatory basis for the claims. In September 2005, the
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York granted Southern Company’s and the other
defendants’ motions to dismiss these cases. The plaintiffs filed an appeal to the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit in October 2005, but no decision has been issued. The ultimate
outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Kivalina Case

On February 26, 2008, the Native Village of Kivalina and the City of Kivalina filed a suit in the
U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against several electric utilities
(including Southern Company), several oil companies, and a coal company. The plaintiffs are the
governing bodies of an Inupiat village in Alaska. The plaintiffs contend that the village is being
destroyed by erosion allegedly caused by global warming that the plaintiffs attribute to emissions
of greenhouse gases by the defendants. The plaintiffs assert claims for public and private
nuisance and contend that the defendants have acted in concert and are therefore jointly and
severally liable for the plaintiffs’ damages. The suit seeks damages for lost property values and
for the cost of relocating the village, which is alleged to be $95 million to $400 million. On
June 30, 2008, all defendants filed motions to dismiss this case. Southern Company believes that
these claims are without merit and notes that the complaint cites no statutory or regulatory basis
for the claims. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Environmental Remediation

The Company must comply with other environmental laws and regulations that cover the handling and
disposal of waste and releases of hazardous substances. Under these various laws and regulations,
the Company may also incur substantial costs to clean up properties. The Company has received
authority from the Alabama PSC to recover approved environmental compliance costs through a
specific retail rate clause that is adjusted annually. See “Retail Regulatory Matters — Rate CNP”
herein for additional information.

FERC Matters

Market-Based Rate Authority

The Company has authorization from the FERC to sell power to non-affiliates, including short-term
opportunity sales, at market-based prices. Specific FERC approval must be obtained with respect to
a market-based contract with an affiliate.

In December 2004, the FERC initiated a proceeding to assess Southern Company’s generation dominance
within its retail service territory. The ability to charge market-based rates in other markets is
not an issue in the proceeding. Any new market-based rate sales by the Company in Southern
Company’s retail service territory entered into during a 15-month refund period that ended in May
2006 could be subject to refund to a cost-based rate level.

In November 2007, the presiding administrative law judge issued an initial decision regarding the
methodology to be used in the generation dominance tests. The proceedings are ongoing. The
ultimate outcome of this generation dominance proceeding cannot now be determined, but an adverse
decision by the FERC in a final order could require the Company to charge cost-based rates for
certain wholesale sales in the Southern Company retail service territory, which may be lower than
negotiated market-based rates, and could also result in total refunds of up to $3.9 million, plus
interest. The Company believes that there is no meritorious basis for an adverse decision in this
proceeding and is vigorously defending itself in this matter.

In June 2007, the FERC issued its final rule in Order No. 697 regarding market-based rate
authority. The FERC generally retained its current market-based rate standards. Responding to a
number of requests for rehearing, the FERC issued Order No. 697-A on April 21, 2008 and Order No.
697-B on December 12, 2008. These orders largely affirmed the FERC’s prior revision and
codification of the regulations governing market-based rates for public utilities. In accordance
with the orders, Southern Company submitted to the FERC an updated market power analysis on
September 2, 2008 related to its continued market-based rate authority. The ultimate outcome of
this matter cannot now be determined.

On October 17, 2008, Southern Company filed with the FERC a revised market-based rate (MBR) tariff
and a new cost-based rate (CBR) tariff. The revised MBR tariff provides for a “must offer” energy
auction whereby Southern Company offers all of its available energy for sale in a day-ahead auction
and an hour-ahead auction with reserve prices not to exceed the CBR tariff price, after considering
Southern Company’s native load requirements, reliability obligations, and sales commitments to
third parties. All sales under the energy auction would be at market clearing prices established
under the auction rules. The new CBR tariff provides for a cost-based price for wholesale sales of
less than a year. On December 18, 2008, the FERC issued an order conditionally accepting the MBR
tariff subject to certain revisions to the auction proposal. On January 21, 2009, Southern Company
made a compliance filing that accepted all the conditions of the MBR tariff order. When this order
becomes final, Southern Company will have 30 days to implement the wholesale auction. On December
31, 2008, the FERC issued an order conditionally accepting the CBR tariff subject to providing
additional information concerning one aspect of the tariff. On January 30, 2009, Southern Company
filed a response addressing the FERC inquiry to the CBR tariff order. Implementation of the energy
auction in accordance with the MBR tariff order

II-155


NOTES (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2008 Annual Report

is expected to adequately mitigate going forward any presumption of market power that Southern
Company may have in the Southern Company retail service territory. The timing of when the FERC may
issue the final orders on the MBR and CBR tariffs and the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot
be determined at this time.

Intercompany Interchange Contract

The Company’s generation fleet is operated under the Intercompany Interchange Contract (IIC), as
approved by the FERC. In May 2005, the FERC initiated a new proceeding to examine (1) the
provisions of the IIC among the traditional operating companies (including the Company), Southern
Power, and SCS, as agent, under the terms of which the power pool of Southern Company is operated,
(2) whether any parties to the IIC have violated the FERC’s standards of conduct applicable to
utility companies that are transmission providers, and (3) whether Southern Company’s code of
conduct defining Southern Power as a “system company” rather than a “marketing affiliate” is just
and reasonable. In connection with the formation of Southern Power, the FERC authorized Southern
Power’s inclusion in the IIC in 2000. The FERC also previously approved Southern Company’s code of
conduct.

In October 2006, the FERC issued an order accepting a settlement resolving the proceeding subject
to Southern Company’s agreement to accept certain modifications to the settlement’s terms and
Southern Company notified the FERC that it accepted the modifications. The modifications largely
involve functional separation and information restrictions related to marketing activities
conducted on behalf of Southern Power. In November 2006, Southern Company filed with the FERC a
compliance plan in connection with the order. In April 2007, the FERC approved, with certain
modifications, the plan submitted by Southern Company. Implementation of the plan did not have a
material impact on the Company’s financial statements. In November 2007, Southern Company notified
the FERC that the plan had been implemented. On December 12, 2008, the FERC division of audits
issued, for public comment, its final audit report pertaining to compliance implementation and
related matters. No comments challenging the audit report’s findings were submitted. A decision
is now pending from the FERC.

Generation Interconnection Agreements

In November 2004, generator company subsidiaries of Tenaska, Inc. (Tenaska), as counterparties to
two previously executed interconnection agreements with the Company, filed complaints at the FERC
requesting that the FERC modify the agreements and that the Company refund a total of $11 million
previously paid for interconnection facilities. No other similar complaints are pending with the
FERC.

In January 2007, the FERC issued an order granting Tenaska’s requested relief. Although the FERC’s
order required the modification of Tenaska’s interconnection agreements, under the provisions of
the order, the Company determined that no refund was payable to Tenaska. The Company requested
rehearing asserting that the FERC retroactively applied a new principle to existing interconnection
agreements. Tenaska requested rehearing of FERC’s methodology for determining the amount of
refunds. The requested rehearings were denied and the Company and Tenaska have appealed the orders
to the U.S. Circuit Court for the District of Columbia. The final outcome of this matter cannot
now be determined.

Retail Regulatory Matters

The following retail ratemaking procedures will remain in effect until the Alabama PSC votes to
modify or discontinue them.

Rate RSE

The Alabama PSC has adopted a Rate Stabilization and Equalization plan (Rate RSE) that provides for
periodic annual adjustments based upon the Company’s earned return on retail common equity. Retail
rates remain unchanged when the retail return on common equity ranges between 13.0% and 14.5%. In
October 2005, the Alabama PSC approved a revision to Rate RSE. Effective January 2007 and
thereafter, Rate RSE adjustments are made based on forward-looking information for the applicable
upcoming calendar year. Rate adjustments for any two-year period, when averaged together, cannot
exceed 4.0% per year and any annual adjustment is limited to 5.0%. Prior to January 2007, annual
adjustments were limited to 3.0%. Retail rates remain unchanged when the return on retail common
equity is projected to be between 13.0% and 14.5%. If the Company’s actual retail return on common
equity is above the allowed equity return range, customer refunds will be required; however, there
is no provision for additional customer billings should the actual retail return on common equity
fall below the allowed equity return range. The Rate RSE increase for 2008 was 3.24% or $147
million annually and was effective in January 2008.

II-156


NOTES (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2008 Annual Report

On October 7, 2008, the Alabama PSC approved a corrective rate package primarily providing for
adjustments associated with customer charges to certain existing rate structures. This package,
effective in January 2009, is expected to generate additional annual revenues of approximately $168
million. The Company agreed to a moratorium on any increase in rates in 2009 under Rate RSE. On
December 1, 2008, the Company made its submission of projected data for calendar year 2009.

Rate CNP

The Company’s retail rates, approved by the Alabama PSC, provide for adjustments to recognize the
placing of new generating facilities into retail service and the recovery of retail costs
associated with certificated PPAs under a Rate Certificated New Plant (Rate CNP). In April 2006,
an annual adjustment to Rate CNP increased retail rates by approximately 0.5% or $19 million
annually. There was no rate adjustment associated with the annual true-up adjustment in April 2007
and 2008. There will be no adjustment to the current Rate CNP to recover certificated PPA costs in
April 2009.

Rate CNP also allows for the recovery of the Company’s retail costs associated with environmental
laws, regulations, or other such mandates. The rate mechanism is based on forward looking
information and provides for the recovery of these costs pursuant to a factor that is calculated
annually. Environmental costs to be recovered include operations and maintenance expenses,
depreciation, and a return on invested capital. Retail rates increased due to environmental costs
approximately 1.2% in January 2006, 0.6% in January 2007, and 2.4% in January 2008. On October 7,
2008, the Company agreed to defer collection during 2009 of any increase in rates under the portion
of Rate CNP, which permits recovery of costs associated with environmental laws and regulations
until 2010. The deferral of the retail rate adjustments will have an immaterial impact on annual
cash flows, and will have no significant effect on the Company’s revenues or net income. On
December 1, 2008, the Company made its submission of projected data for calendar year 2009.

Fuel Cost Recovery

The Company has established fuel cost recovery rates under an energy cost recovery clause (Rate
ECR) approved by the Alabama PSC. Rates are based on an estimate of future energy costs and the
current over or under recovered balance. The Company, along with the Alabama PSC, will continue to
monitor the under recovered fuel cost balance to determine whether an additional adjustment to
billing rates is required.

In June 2007, the Alabama PSC ordered the Company to increase its Rate ECR factor to 3.100 cents
per kilowatt-hour (KWH) effective with billings beginning July 2007 for the 30-month period ending
December 2009. The previous rate of 2.400 cents per KWH had been in effect since January 2006.
This increase was intended to permit recovery of energy costs based on an estimate of future energy
cost, as well as the collection of the existing under recovered energy cost by the end of 2009.
During the recovery period, the Company was allowed to include a carrying charge associated with
the under recovered fuel costs in the fuel expense calculation. In the event the application of
this increased Rate ECR factor results in an over recovered position during this period, the
Company would pay interest on any such over recovered balance at the same rate used to derive the
carrying cost.

On October 7, 2008, the Alabama PSC approved an increase in the Company’s Rate ECR factor to 3.983
cents per KWH for a 24-month period beginning with October 9, 2008 billings. Thereafter, the Rate
ECR factor is 5.910 cents per KWH, absent a contrary order by the Alabama PSC. The previous rate
of 3.100 cents per KWH had been in effect since July 2007. Rate ECR revenues, as recorded on the
financial statements, are adjusted for the difference in actual recoverable costs and amounts
billed in current regulated rates. During the 24-month period, the Company will be allowed to
continue to include a carrying charge associated with the under recovered fuel costs in the fuel
expense calculation. In the event the application of this increased Rate ECR factor results in an
over recovered position during this period, the Company will pay interest on any such over
recovered balance at the same rate used to derive the carrying cost.

The Company’s under recovered fuel costs as of December 31, 2008 totaled $305.8 million as compared
to $279.8 million at December 31, 2007. As a result of the Alabama PSC orders, the Company
classified $180.9 million and $81.7 million of the under recovered regulatory clause revenues as
deferred charges and other assets in the balance sheets as of December 31, 2008 and December 31,
2007, respectively. This classification is based on an estimate which includes such factors as
weather, generation availability, energy demand, and the price of energy. A change in any of these
factors could have a material impact on the timing of the recovery of the under recovered fuel
costs.

Alabama Power Company 2008 Annual Report

Natural Disaster Cost Recovery

Based on an order by the Alabama PSC, the Company maintains a reserve for operations and
maintenance expenses to cover the cost of damages from major storms to its transmission and
distribution facilities.

In December 2005, the Alabama PSC approved a request by the Company to replenish the depleted NDR
due to the hurricanes in 2005 and allow for recovery of future natural disaster costs. The Alabama
PSC order gives the Company authority to record a deficit balance in the NDR when costs of
uninsured storm damage exceed any established reserve balance. The order also approved a separate
monthly NDR charge consisting of two components which began in January 2006. The first component
is intended to establish and maintain a target reserve balance of $75 million for future storms and
is an on-going part of customer billing. The Company currently expects that the target reserve
balance could be achieved within three years. The second component of the NDR charge is intended
to allow recovery of the existing deferred hurricane related operations and maintenance costs and
any future reserve deficits over a 24-month period. Absent further Alabama PSC approval, the
maximum total NDR charge consisting of both components is $10 per month per non-residential
customer account and $5 per month per residential customer account.

At December 31, 2008, the Company had an accumulated balance of $33.2 million in the target reserve
for future storms, which is included in the balance sheets under “Other Regulatory Liabilities.”
In June 2007, the Company fully recovered its storm cost of $51.3 million resulting from previous
hurricanes. As a result, customer rates decreased by this portion of the NDR charge effective in
July 2007.

As revenue from the NDR charge is recognized, an equal amount of operations and maintenance expense
related to the NDR will also be recognized. As a result, this increase in revenue and expense will
not have an impact on net income, but will increase annual cash flow.

Nuclear Fuel Disposal Costs

The Company has a contract with the United States, acting through the U.S. Department of Energy
(DOE) that provides for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel. The DOE failed to begin
disposing of spent nuclear fuel in 1998 as required by the contract, and the Company is pursuing
legal remedies against the government for breach of contract.

In July 2007, the U.S. Court of Federal Claims awarded the Company approximately $17 million,
representing substantially all of the direct costs of the expansion of spent nuclear fuel storage
facilities at Plant Farley from 1998 through 2004. In July 2007, the government filed a motion for
reconsideration, which was denied in November 2007. On January 2, 2008, the government filed an
appeal, and on February 29, 2008, filed a motion to stay the appeal. On April 1, 2008, the court
granted the government’s motion to stay the appeal pending the court’s decisions in three other
similar cases already on appeal. Those cases were decided in August 2008. Based on the rulings in
those cases, the appeal is expected to proceed in first quarter 2009.

On April 3, 2008, a second claim against the government was filed for damages incurred after
December 31, 2004 (the court-mandated cut-off in the original claim), due to the government’s
alleged continuing breach of contract. On October 31, 2008, the court denied a similar request by
the government to stay this proceeding. The complaint does not contain any specific dollar amount
for recovery of damages. Damages will continue to accumulate until the issue is resolved or the
storage is provided. No amounts have been recognized in the financial statements as of December
31, 2008 for either claim. The final outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time,
but no material impact on net income is expected as any damage amounts collected from the
government are expected to be returned to customers.

An on-site dry spent fuel storage facility at Plant Farley is operational and can be expanded to
accommodate spent fuel through the expected life of the plant.

4. JOINT OWNERSHIP AGREEMENTS

The Company and Georgia Power own equally all of the outstanding capital stock of SEGCO, which owns
electric generating units with a total rated capacity of 1,020 megawatts, as well as associated
transmission facilities. The capacity of these units is sold equally to the Company and Georgia
Power under a contract which, in substance, requires payments sufficient to provide for the
operating expenses, taxes, interest expense, and a return on equity, whether or not SEGCO has any
capacity and energy available. The term of the contract extends automatically for two-year
periods, subject to either party’s right to cancel upon two years’ notice. The

Alabama Power Company 2008 Annual Report

Company’s share of purchased power totaled $124 million in 2008, $105 million in 2007, and
$95 million in 2006, and is included in “Purchased power from affiliates” in the statements of
income. The Company accounts for SEGCO using the equity method.

In addition, the Company has guaranteed unconditionally the obligation of SEGCO under an
installment sale agreement for the purchase of certain pollution control facilities at SEGCO’s
generating units, pursuant to which $24.5 million principal amount of pollution control revenue
bonds are outstanding. Also, the Company has guaranteed $50 million principal amount of unsecured
senior notes issued by SEGCO for general corporate purposes. Georgia Power has agreed to reimburse
the Company for the pro rata portion of such obligations corresponding to its then proportionate
ownership of stock of SEGCO if the Company is called upon to make such payment under its guaranty.

At December 31, 2008, the capitalization of SEGCO consisted of $68 million of equity and
$74 million of long-term debt on which the annual interest requirement is $3.2 million. SEGCO paid
dividends totaling $7.8 million in 2008, $2.6 million in 2007, and $8.5 million in 2006, of which
one-half of each was paid to the Company. In addition, the Company recognizes 50% of SEGCO’s net
income.

In addition to the Company’s ownership of SEGCO, the Company’s percentage ownership and investment
in jointly-owned coal-fired generating plants at December 31, 2008 is as follows:

co-owners. The Company’s proportionate share of its plant operating expenses is included in
operating expenses in the statements of income and the Company is responsible for providing its own
financing.

5. INCOME TAXES

Southern Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and combined income tax returns for
the State of Georgia, State of Mississippi, and the State of Alabama. Under a joint consolidated
income tax allocation agreement, each subsidiary’s current and deferred tax expense is computed on
a stand-alone basis and no subsidiary is allocated more expense than would be paid if it filed a
separate income tax return. In accordance with IRS regulations, each company is jointly and
severally liable for the tax liability.

At December 31, 2008, the Company’s tax-related regulatory assets and liabilities were $363 million
and $90 million, respectively. These assets are attributable to tax benefits flowed through to
customers in prior years and to taxes applicable to capitalized interest. These liabilities are
attributable to deferred taxes previously recognized at rates higher than the current enacted tax
law and to unamortized investment tax credits.

In accordance with regulatory requirements, deferred investment tax credits are amortized over the
lives of the related property with such amortization normally applied as a credit to reduce
depreciation in the statements of income. Credits amortized in this manner amounted to $8.0
million in 2008, 2007, and 2006. At December 31, 2008, all investment tax credits available to
reduce federal income taxes payable had been utilized.

Alabama Power Company 2008 Annual Report

The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 created a tax deduction for a portion of income attributable
to U. S. production activities as defined in Internal Revenue Code Section 199 (production
activities deduction). The deduction is equal to a stated percentage of qualified production
activities income. The percentage is phased in over the years 2005 through 2010 with a 3% rate
applicable to the years 2005 and 2006, a 6% rate applicable for years 2007 through 2009, and a 9%
rate thereafter. The increase from 3% in 2006 to 6% in 2007 was one of several factors that
increased the Company’s 2007 deduction by $7.8 million over the 2006 deduction. The resulting
additional tax benefit was approximately $3 million. The IRS has not clearly defined a methodology
for calculating this deduction. However, Southern Company has agreed with the IRS on a calculation
methodology and signed a closing agreement on December 11, 2008. Therefore, the Company reversed
the unrecognized tax benefit and adjusted the deduction for all previous years to conform to the
agreement which resulted in a decrease in the 2008 deduction when compared to the 2007 deduction.
The net impact of the reversal of the unrecognized tax benefits combined with the application of
the new methodology had no material effect on the Company’s financial statements.

Unrecognized Tax Benefits

FIN 48 requires companies to determine whether it is “more likely than not” that a tax position
will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities before any part of the
benefit can be recorded in the financial statements. It also provides guidance on the recognition,
measurement, and classification of income tax uncertainties, along with any related interest and
penalties. For 2008, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits decreased by $1.8 million,
resulting in a balance of $3.0 million as of December 31, 2008.

the Company’s unrecognized tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12
months. The possible conclusion or settlement of federal or state audits could impact the balances
significantly. At this time, an estimate of the range of reasonably possible outcomes cannot be

6. FINANCING

Long-Term Debt Payable to Affiliated Trusts

The Company has formed certain wholly owned trust subsidiaries for the purpose of issuing preferred
securities. The proceeds of the related equity investments and preferred security sales were
loaned back to the Company through the issuance of junior subordinated notes totaling $206 million,
which constitute substantially all assets of these trusts and are reflected in the balance sheets
as Long-term Debt Payable. The Company considers that the mechanisms and obligations relating to
the preferred securities issued for its benefit, taken together, constitute a full and
unconditional guarantee by it of the respective trusts’ payment obligations with respect to these
securities. At December 31, 2008, preferred securities of $200 million were outstanding. See Note
1 under “Variable Interest Entities” for additional information on the accounting treatment for
these trusts and the related securities.

Securities Due Within One Year

At December 31, 2008, the Company had scheduled maturities and redemptions of senior notes due
within one year totaling $250 million. At December 31, 2007, the Company had scheduled maturities
and redemptions of senior notes, and preferred stock due within one year totaling $535 million.

Maturities of senior notes through 2013 applicable to total long-term debt are as follows: $250
million in 2009; $100 million in 2010; $200 million in 2011; $500 million in 2012; and $250 million
in 2013.

Pollution Control Revenue Bonds

Pollution control obligations represent loans to the Company from public authorities of funds or
installment purchases of solid waste disposal facilities financed by funds derived from sales by
public authorities of revenue bonds. The Company is required to make payments sufficient for the
authorities to meet principal and interest requirements of such bonds. The Company incurred
obligations related to the issuance of $254 million of pollution control revenue bonds in 2008.
Proceeds from certain issuances are restricted until expenditures are incurred. During 2008, the
Company was required to purchase a total of approximately $11 million of variable rate pollution
control revenue bonds that were tendered by investors, all of which were subsequently remarketed.

Also, during 2008, the Company entered into $330 million notional amount of interest rate swaps
related to variable rate pollution control revenue bonds to hedge changes in interest rate for the
period February 2008 through February 2010. The weighted average fixed payment rate on these
hedges is 2.49% and the Company now has a total of $576 million of such hedges in place, with an
overall weighted average fixed payment rate of 2.69%.

Senior Notes

The Company issued a total of $850 million of unsecured senior notes in 2008. The proceeds of
these issuances were used to repay short-term indebtedness and for other general corporate
purposes.

At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had $4.6 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively, of
senior notes outstanding. These senior notes are subordinate to all secured debt of the Company
which amounted to approximately $153 million at December 31, 2008.

Preference and Common Stock

In 2008, the Company issued no new shares of preference stock. The Company issued 7.5 million new
shares of common stock to Southern Company at $40.00 per share and realized proceeds of $300
million. The proceeds of these issuances were used for general corporate purposes.

Alabama Power Company 2008 Annual Report

Outstanding Classes of Capital Stock

The Company currently has preferred stock, Class A preferred stock, preference stock, and common
stock authorized and outstanding. The Company’s preferred stock and Class A preferred stock,
without preference between classes, rank senior to the Company’s preference stock and common stock
with respect to payment of dividends and voluntary or involuntary dissolution. The Company’s
preference stock ranks senior to the common stock with respect to the payment of dividends and
voluntary or involuntary dissolution. Certain series of the preferred stock, Class A preferred
stock, and preference stock are subject to redemption at the option of the Company on or after a
specified date (typically 5 or 10 years after the date of issuance).

Dividend Restrictions

The Company can only pay dividends to Southern Company out of retained earnings or paid-in-capital.

Assets Subject to Lien

The Company has granted liens on certain property in connection with the issuance of certain series
of pollution control revenue bonds with an outstanding principal amount of $153 million, as of
December 31, 2008.

Bank Credit Arrangements

The Company maintains committed lines of credit in the amount of $1.3 billion (including $582
million of such lines which are dedicated to funding purchase obligations relating to variable rate
pollution control revenue bonds), of which $466 million will expire at various times during 2009.
$379 million of the credit facilities expiring in 2009 allow for the execution of one-year term
loans. $765 million of credit facilities expire in 2012.

Most of the credit arrangements require payment of a commitment fee based on the unused portion of
the commitment or the maintenance of compensating balances with the banks. Commitment fees average
less than one-fourth of 1% for the Company. Compensating balances are not legally restricted from
withdrawal.

Most of the Company’s credit arrangements with banks have covenants that limit the Company’s debt
to 65% of total capitalization, as defined in the arrangements. For purposes of calculating these
covenants, long-term notes payable to affiliated trusts are excluded from debt but included in
capitalization. Exceeding this debt level would result in a default under the credit arrangements.
At December 31, 2008, the Company was in compliance with the debt limit covenants. In addition,
the credit arrangements typically contain cross default provisions that would be triggered if the
Company defaulted on other indebtedness (including guarantee obligations) above a specified
threshold. None of the arrangements contain material adverse change clauses at the time of
borrowings.

The Company borrows through commercial paper programs that have the liquidity support of committed
bank credit arrangements. In addition, the Company borrows from time to time through uncommitted
credit arrangements. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had $25 million of commercial paper
outstanding. As of December 31, 2007, the Company had no commercial paper outstanding. During
2008 and 2007, the peak amount outstanding for short-term borrowings was $301 million and $214
million, respectively. The average amount outstanding in 2008 and 2007 was $40 million and $36
million, respectively. The average annual interest rate on short-term borrowings in 2008 was 2.31%
and in 2007 was 5.34%. Short-term borrowings are included in notes payable in the balance sheets.

At December 31, 2008, the Company had regulatory approval to have outstanding up to $2.0 billion of
short-term borrowings.

Financial Instruments

The Company enters into energy-related derivatives to hedge exposures to electricity, gas, and
other fuel price changes. However, due to cost-based rate regulations, the Company has limited
exposure to market volatility in commodity fuel prices and prices of electricity. The Company
manages a fuel-hedging program implemented per the guidelines of the Alabama PSC. The Company also
enters into hedges of forward electricity sales.

Energy-related derivative contracts which are designated as regulatory hedges relate primarily to
the Company’s fuel hedging program, where gains and losses are initially recorded as regulatory
liabilities and assets, respectively, and then are included in fuel expenses as they are recovered
through the fuel cost recovery clauses. Gains and losses on energy-related derivatives designated
as cash flow hedges are initially deferred in other comprehensive income before being recognized in
income in the same period as the hedged transactions. Gains and losses on energy-related
derivative contracts that are not designated or fail to qualify as hedges are recognized in the
statements of income as incurred. There was no material ineffectiveness recorded in earnings for
any period presented. The Company has energy-related hedges in place up to and including 2012.

The Company also enters into derivatives to hedge exposure to changes in interest rates.
Derivatives related to variable rate securities or forecasted transactions are accounted for as
cash flow hedges. The derivatives employed as hedging instruments are structured to minimize
ineffectiveness. As such, no material ineffectiveness has been recorded in earnings for any period
presented.

At December 31, 2008, the Company had $576 million notional amount of interest rate derivatives
outstanding that related to variable rate tax exempt debt, with net fair value losses of
approximately $11 million as follows:

The fair value gain or loss for cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income and are
reclassified into earnings at the same time the hedged items affect earnings. In 2007 and 2006,
the Company settled gains/(losses) of $(6) million, and $18 million, respectively, upon termination
of certain interest derivatives at the same time it issued debt and did not incur any such
settlement gains/(losses) in 2008. The effective portions of these gains/(losses) have been
deferred in other comprehensive income and will be amortized to interest expense over the life of
the original interest derivative, which approximates to the related underlying debt.

For the years 2008, 2007, and 2006, approximately $(3) million, $(1) million, and $10 million,
respectively, of pre-tax gains/(losses) were reclassified from other comprehensive income to
interest expense. For 2009, pre-tax losses of approximately $8 million are expected to be
reclassified from other comprehensive income to interest expense. The Company has interest-related
hedges in place through 2010 and has deferred realized gains/(losses) that are being amortized
through 2035.

All derivative financial instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are
measured at fair value. See Note 10 for additional information.

7. COMMITMENTS

Construction Program

The Company is engaged in continuous construction programs, currently estimated to total $1.4
billion in 2009, $1.0 billion in 2010, and $1.0 billion in 2011. These amounts include $48
million, $37 million, and $45 million in 2009, 2010, and 2011, respectively, for construction
expenditures related to contractual purchase commitments for nuclear fuel included under “Fuel
Commitments.” The construction programs are subject to periodic review and revision, and actual
construction costs may vary from these estimates

II-164


NOTES (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2008 Annual Report

because of numerous factors. These factors include: changes in business conditions; revised load
growth estimates; changes in environmental statutes and regulations; changes in nuclear plants to
meet new regulatory requirements; changes in FERC rules and regulations; Alabama PSC approvals; the
cost and efficiency of construction labor, equipment, and materials; and the cost of capital. In
addition, there can be no assurance that costs related to capital expenditures will be fully
recovered. At December 31, 2008, significant purchase commitments were outstanding in connection
with the construction program. The Company has no generating plants under construction.
Construction of new transmission and distribution facilities and capital improvements, including
those needed to meet environmental standards for existing generation, transmission, and
distribution facilities, will continue.

Long-Term Service Agreements

The Company has entered into Long-Term Service Agreements (LTSAs) with General Electric (GE) for
the purpose of securing maintenance support for its combined cycle and combustion turbine
generating facilities. The LTSAs provide that GE will perform all planned inspections on the
covered equipment, which includes the cost of all labor and materials. GE is also obligated to
cover the costs of unplanned maintenance on the covered equipment subject to a limit specified in
each contract.

In general, these LTSAs are in effect through two major inspection cycles per unit. Scheduled
payments to GE, which are subject to price escalation, are made at various intervals based on
actual operating hours of the respective units. Total remaining payments to GE under these
agreements for facilities owned are currently estimated at $119 million over the remaining life of
the agreements, which are currently estimated to range up to 8 years. However, the LTSAs contain
various cancellation provisions at the option of the Company. Payments made to GE prior to the
performance of any planned maintenance are recorded as either prepayments or other deferred charges
and assets in the balance sheets. Inspection costs are capitalized or charged to expense based on
the nature of the work performed.

Limestone Commitments

As part of the Company’s program to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions from its coal plants, the
Company has begun construction of flue gas desulfurization projects and has entered into various
long-term commitments for the procurement of limestone to be used in such equipment. Limestone
contracts are structured with tonnage minimums and maximums in order to account for fluctuations in
coal burn and sulfur content. The Company has a minimum contractual obligation of 3.0 million tons
equating to approximately $124 million through 2019. Estimated expenditures (based on minimum
contracted obligated dollars) over the next five years are $3 million in 2009, $10 million in 2010,
$14 million in 2011, $14 million in 2012, and $15 million in 2013.

Fuel Commitments

To supply a portion of the fuel requirements of its generating plants, the Company has entered into
various long-term commitments for the procurement of fossil and nuclear fuel. In most cases, these
contracts contain provisions for price escalations, minimum purchase levels, and other financial
commitments. Coal commitments include forward contract purchases for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen
oxide emission allowances. Natural gas purchase commitments contain fixed volumes with prices
based on various indices at the time of delivery; amounts included in the chart below represent
estimates based on New York Mercantile Exchange future prices at December 31, 2008. Total
estimated minimum long-term commitments at December 31, 2008 were as follows:

SCS may enter into various types of wholesale energy and natural gas contracts acting as an agent
for the Company and all of the other traditional operating companies and Southern Power. Under
these agreements, each of the traditional operating companies and Southern Power may be jointly and
severally liable. The creditworthiness of Southern Power is currently inferior to the
creditworthiness of the traditional operating companies. Accordingly, Southern Company has entered
into keep-well agreements with the Company and each of the other traditional operating companies to
ensure the Company will not subsidize or be responsible for any costs, losses, liabilities, or
damages resulting from the inclusion of Southern Power as a contracting party under these
agreements.

Operating Leases

The Company has entered into rental agreements for coal rail cars, vehicles, and other equipment
with various terms and expiration dates. These expenses totaled $26.1 million in 2008, $27.7
million in 2007, and $30.3 million in 2006. Of these amounts, $19.2 million, $20.5 million, and
$21.5 million for 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, relate to the rail car leases and are
recoverable through the Company’s Rate ECR. At December 31, 2008, estimated minimum rental
commitments for non-cancelable operating leases were as follows:

Subsequent to December 31, 2008, the Company entered into rental agreements for coal rail cars
resulting in the minimum lease commitments above increasing by $3 million in 2009, $4 million in
2010, $2 million in 2011, and $1 million each in years 2012 and 2013.

In addition to the rental commitments above, the Company has potential obligations upon expiration
of certain leases with respect to the residual value of the leased property. These leases expire
in 2010 and 2013, and the Company’s maximum obligations are $61.2 million and $18.6 million,
respectively. At the termination of the leases, at the Company’s option, the Company may negotiate
an extension, exercise its purchase option, or the property can be sold to a third party. The
Company expects that the fair market value of the leased property would substantially eliminate the
Company’s payments under the residual value obligations.

Guarantees

At December 31, 2008, the Company had outstanding guarantees related to SEGCO’s purchase of certain
pollution control facilities and issuance of senior notes, as discussed in Note 4, and to certain
residual values of leased assets as described above in “Operating Leases.”

8. STOCK OPTION PLAN

Southern Company provides non-qualified stock options to a large segment of the Company’s employees
ranging from line management to executives. As of December 31, 2008, there were 1,267 current and
former employees of the Company participating in the stock option plan and there were 33.2 million
shares of common stock remaining available for awards under this plan. The prices of options
granted to date have been at the fair market value of the shares on the dates of grant. Options
granted to date become exercisable pro rata over a maximum period of three years from the date of
grant. The Company generally recognizes stock option expense on a straight-line basis over the
vesting period which equates to the requisite service period; however, for employees who are
eligible for retirement, the total cost is expensed at the grant date. Options outstanding will
expire no later than 10 years after the date of grant, unless terminated earlier by the Southern
Company Board of Directors in accordance with the stock option plan. For certain stock option
awards, a change in control will provide accelerated vesting.

The estimated fair values of stock options granted in 2008, 2007, and 2006 were derived using the
Black-Scholes stock option pricing model. Expected volatility was based on historical volatility
of Southern Company’s stock over a period equal to the expected term. The Company used historical
exercise data to estimate the expected term that represents the period of time that options granted
to employees are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rate was based on the U.S. Treasury
yield curve in effect at the time of grant that covers the expected term of the stock options. The
following table shows the assumptions used in the pricing model and the weighted average grant-date
fair value of stock options granted:

stated above. As of December 31, 2008, the weighted average remaining contractual term for the
options outstanding and options exercisable was 6.1 years and 5.0 years, respectively, and the
aggregate intrinsic value for the options outstanding and options exercisable was $36.7 million and
$33.9 million, respectively.

As of December 31, 2008, there was $1.1 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to
stock option awards not yet vested. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average
period of approximately 10 months.

For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, total compensation cost for stock option
awards recognized in income was $3.1 million, $4.9 million and $4.8 million, respectively, with the
related tax benefit also recognized in income of $1.2 million, $1.9 million and $1.9 million,
respectively.

The compensation cost and tax benefits related to the grant and exercise of Southern Company stock
options to the Company’s employees are recognized in the Company’s financial statements with a
corresponding credit to equity, representing a capital contribution from Southern Company.

II-167


NOTES (continued)

The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and
2006 was $5.2 million, $9.7 million, and $4.9 million, respectively. The actual tax benefit
realized by the Company for the tax deductions from stock option exercises totaled $2.0 million,
$3.7 million, and $1.9 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and
2006.

9. NUCLEAR INSURANCE

Under the Price-Anderson Amendments Act (Act), the Company maintains agreements of indemnity with
the NRC that, together with private insurance, cover third-party liability arising from any nuclear
incident occurring at Plant Farley. The Act provides funds up to $12.5 billion for public
liability claims that could arise from a single nuclear incident. Plant Farley is insured against
this liability to a maximum of $300 million by American Nuclear Insurers (ANI), with the remaining
coverage provided by a mandatory program of deferred premiums that could be assessed, after a
nuclear incident, against all owners of commercial nuclear reactors. The Company could be assessed
up to $117.5 million per incident for each licensed reactor it operates but not more than an
aggregate of $17.5 million per incident to be paid in a calendar year for each reactor. Such
maximum assessment, excluding any applicable state premium taxes, for the Company is $235 million
per incident but not more than an aggregate of $35 million to be paid for each incident in any one
year. Both the maximum assessment per reactor and the maximum yearly assessment are adjusted for
inflation at least every five years. The next scheduled adjustment is due no later than October
29, 2013.

The Company is a member of Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL), a mutual insurer established
to provide property damage insurance in an amount up to $500 million for members’ nuclear
generating facilities.

Additionally, the Company has policies that currently provide decontamination, excess property
insurance, and premature decommissioning coverage up to $2.25 billion for losses in excess of the
$500 million primary coverage. This excess insurance is also provided by NEIL.

NEIL also covers the additional costs that would be incurred in obtaining replacement power during
a prolonged accidental outage at a member’s nuclear plant. Members can purchase this coverage,
subject to a deductible waiting period of up to 26 weeks, with a maximum per occurrence per unit
limit of $490 million. After the deductible period, weekly indemnity payments would be received
until either the unit is operational or until the limit is exhausted in approximately three years.
The Company purchases the maximum limit allowed by NEIL and has elected a 12-week waiting period.

Under each of the NEIL policies, members are subject to assessments if losses each year exceed the
accumulated funds available to the insurer under that policy. The current maximum annual
assessments for the Company under the NEIL policies would be $39 million.

Claims resulting from terrorist acts are covered under both the ANI and NEIL policies (subject to
normal policy limits). The aggregate, however, that NEIL will pay for all claims resulting from
terrorist acts in any 12 month period is $3.2 billion plus such additional amounts NEIL, can
recover through reinsurance, indemnity, or other sources.

For all on-site property damage insurance policies for commercial nuclear power plants, the NRC
requires that the proceeds of such policies shall be dedicated first for the sole purpose of
placing the reactor in a safe and stable condition after an accident. Any remaining proceeds are
to be applied next toward the costs of decontamination and debris removal operations ordered by the
NRC, and any further remaining proceeds are to be paid either to the Company or to its bond
trustees as may be appropriate under the policies and applicable trust indentures.

All retrospective assessments, whether generated for liability, property, or replacement power, may
be subject to applicable state premium taxes.

10. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

On January 1, 2008, the Company adopted FASB Statement No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (SFAS
No. 157) which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and
requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements. The criterion that is set forth
in SFAS No. 157 is applicable to fair value measurement where it is permitted or required under
other accounting pronouncements.

SFAS No. 157 defines fair value as the exit price, which is the price that would be received to
sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on inputs of
observable and unobservable market data that a market participant would use in pricing the asset
or liability. The use of observable inputs is maximized where available and the use of
unobservable inputs is minimized for fair value measurement. As a

II-168


NOTES (continued)

Alabama Power Company 2008 Annual Report

means to illustrate the inputs used, SFAS No. 157 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy
that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used for fair value measurement.

•

Level 1 consists of observable market data in an active market for identical assets
or liabilities.

•

Level 2 consists of observable market data, other than that included in Level 1, that
is either directly or indirectly observable.

•

Level 3 consists of unobservable market data. The input may reflect the assumptions
of the Company of what a market participant would use in pricing an asset or liability.
If there is little available market data, then the Company’s own assumptions are the
best available information.

In the case of multiple inputs being used in a fair value measurement, the lowest level input
that is significant to the fair value measurement represents the level in the fair value
hierarchy in which the fair value measurement is reported.

The adoption of SFAS No. 157 has not resulted in any significant changes to the methodologies
used for fair value measurement. Primarily all the changes in the fair value of assets and
liabilities are recorded in other comprehensive income or regulatory assets and liabilities, and
thus the impact on earnings is limited to derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting.

The fair value measurements performed on a recurring basis and the level of the fair value
hierarchy in which they fall at December 31, 2008 are as follows:

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Georgia Power Company 2008 Annual Report

The management of Georgia Power Company (the “Company”) is responsible for establishing and
maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting as required by the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). A control system can
provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.

Under management’s supervision, an evaluation of the design and effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting was conducted based on the framework in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2008.

This Annual Report does not include an attestation report of the Company’s independent registered
public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management’s report
was not subject to attestation by the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm
pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to
provide only management’s report in this Annual Report.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Georgia Power Company

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets and statements of capitalization of Georgia Power
Company (the “Company”) (a wholly owned subsidiary of Southern Company) as of December 31, 2008 and
2007, and the related statements of income, comprehensive income, common stockholder’s equity, and
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The
Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control
over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial
reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but
not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such financial statements (pages II-199 to II-238) present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Georgia Power Company at December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2008, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Georgia Power Company 2008 Annual Report

OVERVIEW

Business Activities

Georgia Power Company (the Company) operates as a vertically integrated utility providing
electricity to retail customers within its traditional service area located within the State of
Georgia and to wholesale customers in the Southeast.

Many factors affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of the Company’s business of selling
electricity. These factors include the ability to maintain a constructive regulatory environment,
to maintain energy sales in the midst of the current economic downturn, and to effectively manage
and secure timely recovery of rising costs. These costs include those related to projected
long-term demand growth, increasingly stringent environmental standards, and fuel prices. In
December 2007, the Company completed a major retail rate proceeding (2007 Retail Rate Plan) that
enables the recovery of substantial capital investments to facilitate the continued reliability of
the transmission and distribution networks, continued generation, and other investments as well as
the recovery of increased operating costs. The 2007 Retail Rate Plan includes a tariff
specifically for the recovery of costs related to environmental controls mandated by state and
federal regulations. Appropriately balancing required costs and capital expenditures with customer
prices will continue to challenge the Company for the foreseeable future. The Company is required
to file a general rate case by July 1, 2010, which will determine whether the 2007 Retail Rate Plan
should be continued, modified, or discontinued. The Company also received regulatory orders to
increase its fuel cost recovery rate effective July 1, 2006, March 1, 2007, and June 1, 2008. The
Company expects to file its next fuel cost recovery case on March 13, 2009.

Key Performance Indicators

In striving to maximize shareholder value while providing cost-effective energy to more than two
million customers, the Company continues to focus on several key indicators. These indicators
include customer satisfaction, plant availability, system reliability, and net income after
dividends on preferred and preference stock. The Company’s financial success is directly tied to
the satisfaction of its customers. Key elements of ensuring customer satisfaction include
outstanding service, high reliability, and competitive prices. Management uses customer
satisfaction surveys and reliability indicators to evaluate the Company’s results.

Peak season equivalent forced outage rate (Peak Season EFOR) is an indicator of fossil/hydro plant
availability and efficient generation fleet operations during the months when generation needs are
greatest. The rate is calculated by dividing the number of hours of forced outages by total
generation hours. The 2008 fossil/hydro Peak Season EFOR of 0.84% was better than the target. The
nuclear generating fleet also uses Peak Season EFOR as an indicator of availability and efficient
generation fleet operations during the peak season. The 2008 nuclear Peak Season EFOR of 1.64% was
also better than the target. Transmission and distribution system reliability performance is
measured by the frequency and duration of outages. Performance targets for reliability are set
internally based on historical performance, expected weather conditions, and expected capital
expenditures. The 2008 performance was better than the target for these reliability measures. Net
income after dividends on preferred and preference stock is the primary component of the Company’s
contribution to Southern Company’s earnings per share goal.

The Company’s 2008 results compared to its targets for some of these key indicators are reflected
in the following chart:

management’s expectations.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2008 Annual Report

Earnings

The Company’s 2008 net income after dividends on preferred and preference stock totaled $903
million representing a $66.8 million, or 8.0%, increase over 2007. The increase was primarily
related to increased contributions from market-response rates for large commercial and industrial
customers, higher retail base revenues resulting from the retail rate increase effective January 1,
2008, and increased allowance for equity funds used during construction. These increases were
partially offset by increased depreciation and amortization resulting from more plant in service
and changes to depreciation rates. The Company’s 2007 earnings totaled $836 million representing a
$48.9 million, or 6.2%, increase over 2006. Operating income increased slightly in 2007 primarily
due to increased operating revenues from transmission and outdoor lighting and decreased property
taxes, partially offset by higher non-fuel operating expenses. Net income increased primarily due
to higher allowance for equity funds used during construction and lower income tax expenses
resulting from the Company’s donation of Tallulah Gorge to the State of Georgia, partially offset
by higher financing costs. The Company’s 2006 earnings totaled $787 million representing a $42.9
million, or 5.8%, increase over 2005. Operating income increased in 2006 due to higher base retail
revenues and wholesale non-fuel revenues, partially offset by an increase in non-fuel operating
expenses.

Retail base revenues of $4.1 billion in 2008 increased by $338.3 million, or 9.0%, from 2007
primarily due to an increase in revenues from market-response rates to large commercial and
industrial customers, the retail rate increase effective January 1, 2008, and a 0.7% increase in
retail customers. The increase was partially offset by a weak economy in the Southeast and more
favorable weather impacts in 2007 than in 2008. Retail base revenues were $3.8 billion in 2007.
There was not a material change in total retail base revenues compared to 2006, although industrial
base revenues decreased $56.5 million, or 8.5%, primarily due to lower sales and a lower
contribution from market-response rates for large commercial and industrial customers. This
decrease was partially offset by a $31.8 million, or 2.1%, increase in residential base revenues as
well as a $22.6 million, or 1.5%, increase in commercial base revenues primarily due to higher
sales from favorable weather and customer growth of 1.2%. Retail base revenues of $3.8 billion in
2006 increased by $7 million, or 0.2%, from 2005 primarily due to customer growth of 1.9% and more
favorable weather, partially offset by lower contributions from market-response rates to large
commercial and industrial customers. See “Energy Sales” below for a discussion of changes in the
volume of energy sold, including changes related to sales growth and weather.

Electric rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, including the
energy component of purchased power costs. Under these fuel cost recovery provisions, fuel
revenues generally equal fuel expenses, including the fuel component of purchased power, and do not
affect net income. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL — “PSC Matters — Fuel Cost Recovery” herein for
additional information.

Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates will vary depending on the market cost of available
energy compared to the cost of the Company and Southern Company system-owned generation, demand for
energy within the Southern Company service territory, and availability of Southern Company system
generation.

Revenues from unit power sales increased $18.2 million, or 27.4%, in 2008 driven by higher fuel
rates and an 8.2% increase in the kilowatt-hour (KWH) energy sales primarily related to sales by
the Company’s generating units when other Southern Company system units were unavailable. Revenues
from unit power sales remained relatively constant in 2007 and 2006. Revenues from other
non-affiliated sales increased $12.7 million, or 2.7%, in 2008, decreased $9.6 million, or 2.0%, in
2007, and increased $21.0 million, or 4.6%, in 2006. The increase in 2008 was primarily driven by
the fuel component within non-affiliate wholesale prices which has increased with the effects of
higher fuel and purchased power costs. This increase was partially offset by a 9.8% decrease in
KWH energy sales and decreased contributions from the emissions allowance component of market-based
wholesale rates. The decrease in 2007 was primarily due to a decrease in revenues from large
territorial contracts resulting from lower emissions allowance prices. The increase in 2006 was
due to a 0.6% increase in the demand for KWH energy sales due to a new contract with an electrical
membership corporation that went into effect in April 2006.

Wholesale revenues from sales to affiliated companies within the Southern Company system will vary
from year to year depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each
company. These affiliated sales and purchases are made in accordance with the Intercompany
Interchange Contract (IIC), as approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). In
2008, KWH energy sales to affiliated companies decreased 28.8% while revenues from sales to
affiliates increased 3.0%. In 2007, KWH energy sales to affiliates decreased 5.0% while revenues
from sales to affiliates increased 10.0%. The revenue increases in 2008 and 2007 were primarily
due to the increased cost of fuel and other marginal generation components of the rates. In 2006,
KWH energy sales to affiliates increased 8.5% due to higher demand. However, revenues from these
sales decreased by 8.3% in 2006 due to reduced cost per KWH delivered. These transactions do not
have a significant impact on earnings since this energy is generally sold at marginal cost.

Other operating revenues increased $12.3 million, or 4.8%, in 2008 primarily due to a $6.7 million
increase in revenues from outdoor lighting resulting from a 15.8% increase in lighting customers
and a $7.6 million increase in customer fees resulting from higher rates that went into effect in
2008, partially offset by a $2.2 million decrease in equipment rentals revenue. Other operating
revenues increased $22.2 million, or 9.4%, in 2007 primarily due to an $11.6 million increase in
transmission revenues due to the increased usage of the Company’s transmission system by
non-affiliated companies, a $7.9 million increase in revenues from outdoor lighting activities due
to a 10% increase in the number of lighting customers, and a $4.0 million increase from customer
fees. Other operating revenues increased $24.6 million, or 11.6%, in 2006 primarily due to
increased revenues of $14.1 million related to work performed for the other owners of the
integrated transmission system in the State of Georgia, higher customer fees of $4.6 million, and
higher outdoor lighting revenues of $6.1 million.

Changes in retail energy sales are comprised of changes in electricity usage by customers, changes
in weather, and changes in the number of customers.

Residential KWH sales decreased 1.6% in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to less favorable
weather, partially offset by a 0.7% increase in residential customers. Commercial KWH sales
remained flat in 2008 compared to 2007 despite a 0.2% increase in commercial customers. Industrial
KWH sales decreased 5.2% in 2008 over 2007 primarily due to reduced demand and closures within the
textile and primary and fabricated metal industries, a result of the slowing economy that worsened
during the fourth quarter 2008.

Residential KWH sales increased 2.4% in 2007 over 2006 due to favorable weather and a 1.3% increase
in residential customers. Commercial KWH sales increased 2.9% in 2007 over 2006 primarily due to
favorable weather and a 0.3% increase in commercial customers. Industrial KWH sales decreased 0.3%
primarily due to reduced demand and closures within the textile industry; however, this was
partially offset by a 2.9% increase in the number of industrial customers.

Residential KWH sales increased 2.7% in 2006 over 2005 due to customer growth of 1.9% and more
favorable weather. Commercial KWH sales increased 2.5% in 2006 over 2005 due to customer growth of
2.0% and a reclassification of customers from industrial to commercial to be consistent with the
rate structure approved by the Georgia Public Service Commission (PSC). Industrial KWH sales
decreased 1.0% due to a 3.4% decrease in the number of customers as a result of this
reclassification.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2008 Annual Report

Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses

Fuel costs constitute the single largest expense for the Company. The mix of fuel sources for
generation of electricity is determined primarily by demand, the unit cost of fuel consumed, and
the availability of generating units. Additionally, the Company purchases a portion of its
electricity needs from the wholesale market. Details of the Company’s electricity generated and
purchased were as follows:

Fuel and purchased power expenses were $4.2 billion in 2008, an increase of $526.6 million, or
14.3%, above prior year costs. Substantially all of this increase was due to the higher average
cost of fuel and purchased power.

Fuel and purchased power expenses were $3.7 billion in 2007, an increase of $312.9 million, or
9.3%, above prior year costs. This increase was driven by a $414.5 million increase in total
energy costs due to the higher average cost of fuel and purchased power, partially offset by a
$101.6 million reduction due to fewer KWHs purchased.

Fuel and purchased power expenses were $3.4 billion in 2006, an increase of $124.4 million, or
3.8%, above prior year costs. This increase was driven by a $146.1 million increase related to
higher KWHs generated and purchased, partially offset by a $21.7 million decrease in the average
cost of fuel and purchased power.

Over the last several years, coal prices have been influenced by a worldwide increase in demand
from developing countries, as well as increases in mining and fuel transportation costs. In the
first half of 2008, coal prices reached unprecedented high levels primarily due to increased demand
following more moderate pricing in 2006 and 2007. Despite these fluctuations, fuel inventories
have been adequate and fuel supply markets have been sufficient to meet expected fuel requirements.
Demand for natural gas in the United States also increased in 2007 and the first half of 2008.
However, natural gas supplies increased in the last half of 2008 as a result of increased
production and higher storage levels due in part to weak industrial demand. Both coal and natural
gas prices moderated in the second half of 2008 as the result of a recessionary economy. During
2008, uranium prices continued to moderate from the highs set during 2007. While worldwide uranium
production levels appear to have increased slightly since 2007, secondary supplies and inventories
were still required to meet worldwide reactor demand.

Fuel expenses generally do not affect net income, since they are offset by fuel revenues under the
Company’s fuel cost recovery provisions. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL — “PSC MATTERS — Fuel
Cost Recovery” herein for additional information.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2008 Annual Report

Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses

In 2008, other operations and maintenance expenses increased $19.2 million, or 1.2%, compared to
2007. The increase was primarily the result of a $14.7 million increase in the accrual for
property damage approved under the 2007 Retail Rate Plan, a $14.6 million increase in scheduled
outages and maintenance for fossil generating plants, and a $22.0 million increase related to meter
reading, records and collections, and uncollectible account expenses. These increases were
partially offset by decreases of $24.7 million related to the timing of transmission and
distribution operations and maintenance and $7.4 million related to medical, pension, and other
employee benefits.

In 2007, the change in other operations and maintenance expenses was immaterial compared to 2006.

In 2006, other operations and maintenance expenses decreased $11.0 million, or 0.7%, from the prior
year. Maintenance for generating plants decreased $20.0 million in 2006 as a result of fewer
scheduled outages than 2005, offset by an increase of $18.2 million for transmission and
distribution expenses related to load dispatching and overhead line maintenance. Also contributing
to the decrease were lower employee benefit expenses related to medical benefits and lower workers
compensation expense of $23.2 million, partially offset by lower pension income of $13.7 million.

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation and amortization increased $125.8 million, or 24.6%, in 2008 compared to the prior
year primarily due to an increase in plant in service related to completed transmission,
distribution, and environmental projects, changes in depreciation rates effective January 1, 2008
approved under the 2007 Retail Rate Plan, and the expiration of amortization related to a
regulatory liability for purchased power costs under the terms of the retail rate plan for the
three years ended December 31, 2007 (2004 Retail Rate Plan).

Depreciation and amortization increased $12.4 million, or 2.5%, in 2007 compared to the prior year
primarily due to a 3.4% increase in plant in service from the prior year. This increase was
partially offset by a decrease in amortization of the regulatory liability for purchased power
costs as described above.

Depreciation and amortization decreased $27.9 million, or 5.3%, in 2006 compared to the prior year
due to the scheduled decrease in amortization related to the regulatory liability for purchased
power costs as described above. This decrease was partially offset by a $15.9 million, or 3.2%,
increase in depreciation in 2006 over 2005 due to an increase in plant in service. See Note 3 to
the financial statements under “Retail Regulatory Matters — Rate Plans” for additional
information.

Taxes Other Than Income Taxes

In 2008, taxes other than income taxes increased $25.1 million, or 8.6%, from the prior year
primarily due to higher municipal franchise fees resulting from retail revenue increases during
2008. Taxes other than income taxes decreased $7.7 million, or 2.6%, in 2007 primarily due to the
resolution of a dispute regarding property taxes in Monroe County, Georgia. Taxes other than
income taxes increased $22.8 million, or 8.3%, in 2006 primarily due to higher property taxes of
$13.3 million as a result of an increase in property values and higher municipal gross receipts
taxes of $9.1 million as a result of increased retail operating revenues.

Allowance for Equity Funds Used During Construction

Allowance for equity funds used during construction (AFUDC) increased $27.1 million, or 39.8%, in
2008 primarily due to the increase in construction work in progress balances related to ongoing
environmental and transmission projects as well as three combined cycle generating units at Plant
McDonough. AFUDC increased $36.7 million, or 116.3%, in 2007 primarily due to the increase in the
Company’s construction work in progress balance related to ongoing transmission, distribution, and
environmental projects. AFUDC remained relatively constant in 2006 when compared to 2005.

Interest Expense, Net of Amounts Capitalized

The increase in interest expense in 2008 was immaterial. Interest expense increased $25.5 million,
or 8.0%, in 2007 primarily due to a 13.9% increase in long-term debt levels due to the issuance of
additional senior notes and pollution control revenue bonds. Interest expense increased $22.5
million, or 7.6%, in 2006 primarily due to generally higher interest rates on variable rate debt
and commercial paper, the issuance of additional senior notes, and higher average balances of
short-term debt.

II-181


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2008 Annual Report

Other Income (Expense), Net

Other income (expense), net decreased $24.0 million, or 163.0%, in 2008 primarily due to a $12.9
million change in classification of revenues related to a residential pricing program to base
retail revenues in 2008 as ordered by the Georgia PSC under the 2007 Retail Rate Plan, as well as
decreased revenues of $7.3 million and $2.6 million related to non-operating rental income and
customer contracting, respectively. Other income (expense), net increased $5.8 million, or 66.5%,
in 2007 primarily due to $4.0 million from land and timber sales. Other income (expense), net
increased $1.9 million, or 26.7%, in 2006 primarily due to reduced expenses of $2.9 million and
$5.0 million related to the employee stock ownership plan and charitable donations, respectively,
and increased revenues of $3.6 million, $5.4 million, and $3.4 million related to a residential
pricing program, customer contracting, and customer facilities charges, respectively. These
increases were partially offset by net financial gains on gas hedges of $18.6 million in 2005.

Income Taxes

Income taxes increased $70.0 million, or 16.8%, in 2008 primarily due to increased pre-tax net
income and the 2007 Tallulah Gorge donation. These increases were partially offset by an increase
in AFUDC, which is non-taxable, as well as additional state tax credits and an increase in the
federal production activities deduction. Income taxes decreased $24.8 million, or 5.6%, in 2007
primarily due to state and federal deductions for the Company’s donation of 2,200 acres in the
Tallulah Gorge area to the State of Georgia and higher federal manufacturing deductions. In 2006,
income taxes decreased $5.1 million, or 1.1%, primarily due to the recognition of state tax
credits. See Note 5 to the financial statements for additional information.

Effects of Inflation

The Company is subject to rate regulation that is based on the recovery of historical costs. When
historical costs are included, or when inflation exceeds projected costs used in rate regulation or
market-based prices, the effects of inflation can create an economic loss since the recovery of
costs could be in dollars that have less purchasing power. In addition, income tax laws are based
on historical costs. While the inflation rate has been relatively low in recent years, it
continues to have an adverse effect on the Company because of the large investment in utility plant
with long economic lives. Conventional accounting for historical cost does not recognize this
economic loss or the partially offsetting gain that arises through financing facilities with
fixed-money obligations such as long-term debt, preferred securities, preferred stock, and
preference stock. Any recognition of inflation by regulatory authorities is reflected in the rate
of return allowed in the Company’s approved electric rates.

FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL

General

The Company operates as a vertically integrated utility providing electricity to retail customers
within its traditional service area located within the State of Georgia and to wholesale customers
in the Southeast. Prices for electricity provided by the Company to retail customers are set by
the Georgia PSC under cost-based regulatory principles. Prices for electricity relating to
wholesale electricity sales, interconnecting transmission lines, and the exchange of electric power
are set by the FERC. Retail rates and revenues are reviewed and adjusted periodically with certain
limitations. See ACCOUNTING POLICIES — “Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
— Electric Utility Regulation” herein and Note 3 to the financial statements under “Retail
Regulatory Matters” and “FERC Matters” for additional information about regulatory matters.

The results of operations for the past three years are not necessarily indicative of future
earnings potential. The level of the Company’s future earnings depends on numerous factors that
affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of the Company’s business of selling electricity.
These factors include the Company’s ability to maintain a constructive regulatory environment that
continues to allow for the recovery of all prudently incurred costs during a time of increasing
costs. Future earnings in the near term will depend, in part, upon maintaining energy sales during
the current economic downturn, which is subject to a number of factors. These factors include
weather, competition, new energy contracts with neighboring utilities, energy conservation
practiced by customers, the price of electricity, the price elasticity of demand, and the rate of
economic growth or decline in the service area. Recent recessionary conditions have negatively
impacted sales growth. The timing and extent of the economic recovery will impact future earnings.

II-182


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2008 Annual Report

Environmental Matters

Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act and other environmental statutes and regulations
could affect earnings if such costs cannot continue to be fully recovered in rates on a timely
basis. Environmental compliance spending over the next several years may exceed amounts estimated.
Some of the factors driving the potential for such an increase are higher commodity costs, market
demand for labor, and scope additions and clarifications. The timing, specific requirements, and
estimated costs could also change as environmental statutes and regulations are adopted or
modified. Under the 2007 Retail Rate Plan, an environmental compliance cost recovery (ECCR) tariff
was implemented on January 1, 2008 to allow for the recovery of most of the costs related to
environmental controls mandated by state and federal regulation scheduled for completion between
2008 and 2010. The Company has also requested that the Georgia PSC certify the construction of
environmental controls for Plants Branch and Hammond. See Note 3 to the financial statements under
“Retail Regulatory Matters — Rate Plans” for additional information.

New Source Review Actions

In November 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) brought a civil action in the U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against certain Southern Company subsidiaries,
including the Company, alleging that these subsidiaries had violated the New Source Review (NSR)
provisions of the Clean Air Act and related state laws at certain coal-fired generating facilities
including the Company’s Plants Bowen and Scherer. After Alabama Power was dismissed from the
original action for jurisdictional reasons, the EPA filed a separate action in January 2001 against
Alabama Power in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama. In these lawsuits,
the EPA alleged that NSR violations occurred at eight coal-fired generating facilities operated by
Alabama Power and the Company. The civil actions request penalties and injunctive relief,
including an order requiring installation of the best available control technology at the affected
units. The action against the Company has been administratively closed since the spring of 2001,
and the case has not been reopened.

In June 2006, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama entered a consent decree
between Alabama Power and the EPA, resolving a portion of the Alabama Power lawsuit relating to the
alleged NSR violations at Plant Miller. The consent decree required Alabama Power to pay $100,000
to resolve the government’s claim for a civil penalty and to donate $4.9 million of sulfur dioxide
emission allowances to a nonprofit charitable organization. It also formalized specific emissions
reductions to be accomplished by Alabama Power, consistent with other Clean Air Act programs that
require emissions reductions. In August 2006, the district court in Alabama granted Alabama
Power’s motion for summary judgment and entered final judgment in favor of Alabama Power on the
EPA’s claims related to all of the remaining plants: Plants Barry, Gaston, Gorgas, and Greene
County.

The plaintiffs appealed the district court’s decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh
Circuit, where the appeal was stayed, pending the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in a similar case
against Duke Energy. The Supreme Court issued its decision in the Duke Energy case in April 2007,
and in December 2007, the Eleventh Circuit vacated the district court’s decision in the Alabama
Power case and remanded the case back to the district court for consideration of the legal issues
in light of the Supreme Court’s decision in the Duke Energy case. On July 24, 2008, the U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of Alabama granted partial summary judgment in favor of
Alabama Power regarding the proper legal test for determining whether projects are routine
maintenance, repair, and replacement and therefore are excluded from NSR permitting. The decision
did not resolve the case.

The Company believes that it complied with applicable laws and the EPA regulations and
interpretations in effect at the time the work in question took place. The Clean Air Act
authorizes maximum civil penalties of $25,000 to $37,500 per day, per violation at each generating
unit, depending on the date of the alleged violation. An adverse outcome in this matter could
require substantial capital expenditures or affect the timing of currently budgeted capital
expenditures that cannot be determined at this time and could possibly require payment of
substantial penalties. Such expenditures could affect future results of operations, cash flows,
and financial condition if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates. The ultimate
outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Carbon Dioxide Litigation

New York Case

In July 2004, three environmental groups and attorneys general from eight states, each outside of
Southern Company’s service territory, and the corporation counsel for New York City filed
complaints in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against Southern
Company and four other electric power companies. The complaints allege that the companies’
emissions of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, contribute to global warming, which the plaintiffs
assert is a public nuisance. Under common law

II-183


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2008 Annual Report

public and private nuisance theories, the plaintiffs
seek a judicial order (1) holding each defendant jointly and severally liable for creating,
contributing to, and/or maintaining global warming and (2) requiring each of the defendants to cap
its emissions of carbon dioxide and then reduce those emissions by a specified percentage each year for at least a decade.
The plaintiffs have not, however, requested that damages be awarded in connection with their
claims. Southern Company believes these claims are without merit and notes that the complaint
cites no statutory or regulatory basis for the claims. In September 2005, the U.S. District Court
for the Southern District of New York granted Southern Company’s and the other defendants’ motions
to dismiss these cases. The plaintiffs filed an appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit in October 2005, but no decision has been issued. The ultimate outcome of these matters
cannot be determined at this time.

Kivalina Case

On February 26, 2008, the Native Village of Kivalina and the City of Kivalina filed a suit in the
U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against several electric utilities
(including Southern Company), several oil companies, and a coal company. The plaintiffs are the
governing bodies of an Inupiat village in Alaska. The plaintiffs contend that the village is being
destroyed by erosion allegedly caused by global warming that the plaintiffs attribute to emissions
of greenhouse gases by the defendants. The plaintiffs assert claims for public and private
nuisance and contend that the defendants have acted in concert and are therefore jointly and
severally liable for the plaintiffs’ damages. The suit seeks damages for lost property values and
for the cost of relocating the village, which is alleged to be $95 million to $400 million. On
June 30, 2008, all defendants filed motions to dismiss this case. Southern Company believes that
these claims are without merit and notes that the complaint cites no statutory or regulatory basis
for the claims. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Environmental Statutes and Regulations

General

The Company’s operations are subject to extensive regulation by state and federal environmental
agencies under a variety of statutes and regulations governing environmental media, including air,
water, and land resources. Applicable statutes include the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act; the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act; the Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act; the Toxic Substances Control Act; the Emergency Planning & Community
Right-to-Know Act; the Endangered Species Act; and related federal and state regulations.
Compliance with these environmental requirements involves significant capital and operating costs,
a major portion of which is expected to be recovered through existing ratemaking provisions.
Through 2008, the Company had invested approximately $3.1 billion in capital projects to comply
with these requirements, with annual totals of $689 million, $856 million, and $352 million for
2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. The Company expects that capital expenditures to ensure
compliance with existing and new statutes and regulations will be an additional $472 million, $334
million, and $399 million for 2009, 2010, and 2011, respectively. The Company’s compliance
strategy can be affected by changes to existing environmental laws, statutes, and regulations, the
cost, availability, and existing inventory of emission allowances, and the Company’s fuel mix.
Environmental costs that are known and estimable at this time are included in capital expenditures
discussed under FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY — “Capital Requirements and Contractual
Obligations” herein.

Compliance with any new federal or state legislation or regulations related to global climate
change, air quality, combustion byproducts, including coal ash, or other environmental and health
concerns could also significantly affect the Company. Although new or revised environmental
legislation or regulations could affect many areas of the Company’s operations, the full impact of
any such changes cannot be determined at this time.

Air Quality

Compliance with the Clean Air Act and resulting regulations has been and will continue to be a
significant focus for the Company. Through 2008, the Company had spent approximately $2.8 billion
in reducing sulfur dioxide (SO


) and nitrogen oxide (NO

x

) emissions and in
monitoring emissions pursuant to the Clean Air Act. Additional controls are currently being
installed at several plants to further reduce air emissions, maintain compliance with existing
regulations, and meet new requirements.

In 2004, the EPA designated nonattainment areas under an eight-hour ozone standard. Areas within
the Company’s service area that were designated as nonattainment under the eight-hour ozone
standard included Macon and a 20-county area within metropolitan Atlanta. The Macon area has since
been redesignated as an attainment area by the EPA, and a maintenance plan to address future
exceedances of the standard has been approved. A state plan for bringing the Atlanta area into
attainment with this standard was due to the EPA in 2007; however, in December 2006, the U.S. Court
of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated the EPA rules

II-184


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2008 Annual Report

designed to provide states
with the guidance necessary to develop such plans. State plans could require additional reductions
in NOx emissions from power plants. On March 12, 2008, the EPA issued a final rule establishing a
more stringent eight-hour ozone standard which will likely result in designation of new
nonattainment areas within the Company’s service territory. The EPA is expected to publish those
designations in 2010 and require state implementation plans for any
nonattainment areas by 2013.

During 2005, the EPA’s annual fine particulate matter nonattainment designations became effective
for several areas within the Company’s service area. State plans for addressing the nonattainment
designations for this standard were due by April 5, 2008 but have not been finalized. These state
plans could require further reductions in SO


and NO

x

emissions from power
plants.

The EPA issued the final Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) in March 2005. This cap-and-trade rule
addresses power plant SO


and NO

x

emissions that were found to contribute to
nonattainment of the eight-hour ozone and fine particulate matter standards in downwind states.
Twenty-eight eastern states, including Georgia, are subject to the requirements of the rule. The
rule calls for additional reductions of NO

x

and/or SO


to be achieved in two
phases, 2009/2010 and 2015. On July 11, 2008, in response to petitions brought by certain states
and regulated industries challenging particular aspects of CAIR, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit issued a decision vacating CAIR in its entirety and remanding it to
the EPA for further action consistent with its opinion. On December 23, 2008, however, the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit altered its July decision in response to
a rehearing petition and remanded CAIR to the EPA without vacatur, thereby leaving CAIR compliance
requirements in place while the EPA develops a revised rule. The State of Georgia has completed
plans to implement CAIR and has approved a “multi-pollutant rule” that requires plant-specific
emission controls on all but the smallest generating units in Georgia to be installed according to
a schedule set forth in the rule. The rule is designed to ensure reductions in emissions of
SO


, NO

x

, and mercury in Georgia

.

Emission reductions are thus being
accomplished by the installation of emission controls at the Company’s coal-fired facilities and/or
by the purchase of emission allowances. The full impact of the court’s remand and the outcome
of the EPA’s future rulemaking in response cannot be determined at this time.

The Clean Air Visibility Rule (formerly called the Regional Haze Rule) was finalized in July 2005.
The goal of this rule is to restore natural visibility conditions in certain areas (primarily
national parks and wilderness areas) by 2064. The rule involves (1) the application of Best
Available Retrofit Technology (BART) to certain sources built between 1962 and 1977 and (2) the
application of any additional emissions reductions which may be deemed necessary for each
designated area to achieve reasonable progress by 2018 toward the natural conditions goal.
Thereafter, for each 10-year planning period, additional emissions reductions will be required to
continue to demonstrate reasonable progress in each area during that period. For power plants, the
Clean Air Visibility Rule allows states to determine that the CAIR satisfies BART requirements for
SO


and NO

x

. Extensive studies were performed for each of the Company’s
affected units to demonstrate that additional particulate matter controls are not necessary under
BART. At the request of the State of Georgia, additional analyses were performed for certain units
in Georgia to demonstrate that no additional SO


controls were required to demonstrate
reasonable progress. States have completed or are currently completing implementation plans that
contain strategies for BART and any other measures required to achieve the first phase of
reasonable progress.

The impacts of the eight-hour ozone nonattainment designations, the fine particulate matter
nonattainment designations, and the Clean Air Visibility Rule on the Company cannot be determined
at this time and will depend on the resolution of any pending legal challenges and the development
and implementation of rules at the state level.

The Company has developed and continually updates a comprehensive environmental compliance strategy
to assess compliance obligations associated with the continuing and new environmental requirements
discussed above. As part of this strategy, the Company plans to install additional SO


and NO

x

emission controls within the next several years to ensure continued
compliance with applicable air quality requirements.

In March 2005, the EPA published the final Clean Air Mercury Rule, a cap-and-trade program for the
reduction of mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants. The final Clean Air Mercury Rule was
challenged in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The petitioners
alleged that the EPA was not authorized to establish a cap-and-trade program for mercury emissions
and instead the EPA must establish maximum achievable control technology standards for coal-fired
electric utility steam generating units. On February 8, 2008, the court ruled in favor of the
petitioners and vacated the Clean Air Mercury Rule. The Company’s overall environmental compliance
strategy relies primarily on a combination of SO


and NO

x

controls to reduce
mercury emissions. Any significant changes in the strategy will depend on the outcome of any
appeals and/or future federal and state rulemakings. Future rulemakings necessitated by the
court’s decision could require emission reductions more stringent than those required by the Clean
Air Mercury Rule.

II-185


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2008 Annual Report

Water Quality

In July 2004, the EPA published its final technology-based regulations under the Clean Water Act
for the purpose of reducing impingement and entrainment of fish, shellfish, and other forms of
aquatic life at existing power plant cooling water intake structures. The rules require baseline
biological information and, perhaps, installation of fish protection technology near some intake
structures at existing power plants. In January 2007, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit overturned and remanded several provisions of the rule, including the use of cost-benefit
analysis, to the EPA for revisions. The decision has been appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. The
full impact of these regulations will depend on subsequent legal proceedings, further rulemaking by
the EPA, the results of studies and analyses performed as part of the rules’ implementation, and
the actual requirements established by state regulatory agencies and, therefore, cannot be
determined at this time.

Environmental Remediation

The Company must comply with other environmental laws and regulations that cover the handling and
disposal of waste and releases of hazardous substances. Under these various laws and regulations,
the Company could incur substantial costs to clean up properties. The Company conducts studies to
determine the extent of any required cleanup and has recognized in its financial statements the
costs to clean up known sites. Amounts for cleanup and ongoing monitoring costs were not material
for any year presented. The Company may be liable for some or all required cleanup costs for
additional sites that may require environmental remediation. See Note 3 to the financial
statements under “Environmental Matters — Environmental Remediation” for additional information.

Global Climate Issues

Federal legislative proposals that would impose mandatory requirements related to greenhouse gas
emissions and renewable energy standards continue to be strongly considered in Congress, and the
reduction of greenhouse gas emissions has been identified as a high priority by the current
Administration. The ultimate outcome of these proposals cannot be determined at this time;
however, mandatory restrictions on the Company’s greenhouse gas emissions could result in
significant additional compliance costs that could affect future unit retirement and replacement
decisions and results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition if such costs are not
recovered through regulated rates.

In April 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the EPA has authority under the Clean Air Act to
regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles. The EPA is currently developing its
response to this decision. Regulatory decisions that will follow from this response may have
implications for both new and existing stationary sources, such as power plants. The ultimate
outcome of these rulemaking activities cannot be determined at this time; however, as with the
current legislative proposals, mandatory restrictions on the Company’s greenhouse gas emissions
could result in significant additional compliance costs that could affect future unit retirement
and replacement decisions and results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition if such
costs are not recovered through regulated rates.

In addition, some states are considering or have undertaken actions to regulate and reduce
greenhouse gas emissions. For example, on June 25, 2008, Florida’s Governor signed comprehensive
energy-related legislation that includes authorization for the Florida Department of Environmental
Protection to adopt rules for a cap-and-trade regulatory program to address greenhouse gas
emissions from electric utilities, conditioned upon their ratification by the legislature no sooner
than the 2010 legislative session. This legislation also authorizes the Florida PSC to adopt a
renewable portfolio standard for public utilities, subject to legislative ratification. The impact
of any similar state legislation on the Company will depend on the future development, adoption,
legislative ratification, implementation, and potential legal challenges to rules governing
greenhouse gas emissions and mandates regarding the use of renewable energy, and the ultimate
outcome cannot be determined at this time.

International climate change negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change also continue. Current efforts focus on a potential successor to the Kyoto Protocol for the
post 2012 timeframe, with a conclusion to this round of negotiations targeted for the end of 2009.
The outcome and impact of the international negotiations cannot be determined at this time.

The Company is actively evaluating and developing electric generating technologies with lower
greenhouse gas emissions. These include the proposed construction of two additional nuclear
generating units at Plant Vogtle and additional renewable energy investments, including the
proposed conversion of Plant Mitchell from coal-fired to biomass generation. The Company is
currently considering additional projects and is pursuing research into the costs and viability of
other renewable technologies for Georgia.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2008 Annual Report

FERC Matters

Market-Based Rate Authority

The Company has authorization from the FERC to sell power to non-affiliates, including short-term
opportunity sales, at market-based prices. Specific FERC approval must be obtained with respect to
a market-based contract with an affiliate.

In December 2004, the FERC initiated a proceeding to assess Southern Company’s generation dominance
within its retail service territory. The ability to charge market-based rates in other markets is
not an issue in the proceeding. Any new market-based rate sales by the Company in Southern
Company’s retail service territory entered into during a 15-month refund period that ended in May
2006 could be subject to refund to a cost-based rate level.

In November 2007, the presiding administrative law judge issued an initial decision regarding the
methodology to be used in the generation dominance tests. The proceedings are ongoing. The
ultimate outcome of this generation dominance proceeding cannot now be determined, but an adverse
decision by the FERC in a final order could require the Company to charge cost-based rates for
certain wholesale sales in the Southern Company retail service territory, which may be lower than
negotiated market-based rates, and could also result in total refunds of up to $5.8 million, plus
interest. The Company believes that there is no meritorious basis for an adverse decision in this
proceeding and is vigorously defending itself in this matter.

In June 2007, the FERC issued its final rule in Order No. 697 regarding market-based rate
authority. The FERC generally retained its current market-based rate standards. Responding to a
number of requests for rehearing, the FERC issued Order No. 697-A on April 21, 2008 and Order No.
697-B on December 12, 2008. These orders largely affirmed the FERC’s prior revision and
codification of the regulations governing market-based rates for public utilities. In accordance
with the orders, Southern Company submitted to the FERC an updated market power analysis on
September 2, 2008 related to its continued market-based rate authority. The ultimate outcome of
this matter cannot now be determined.

On October 17, 2008, Southern Company filed with the FERC a revised market-based rate (MBR) tariff
and a new cost-based rate (CBR) tariff. The revised MBR tariff provides for a “must offer” energy
auction whereby Southern Company offers all of its available energy for sale in a day-ahead auction
and an hour-ahead auction with reserve prices not to exceed the CBR tariff price, after considering
Southern Company’s native load requirements, reliability obligations, and sales commitments to
third parties. All sales under the energy auction would be at market clearing prices established
under the auction rules. The new CBR tariff provides for a cost-based price for wholesale sales of
less than a year. On December 18, 2008, the FERC issued an order conditionally accepting the MBR
tariff subject to certain revisions to the auction proposal. On January 21, 2009, Southern Company
made a compliance filing that accepted all the conditions of the MBR tariff order. When this order
becomes final, Southern Company will have 30 days to implement the wholesale auction. On December
31, 2008, the FERC issued an order conditionally accepting the CBR tariff subject to providing
additional information concerning one aspect of the tariff. On January 30, 2009, Southern Company
filed a response addressing the FERC inquiry to the CBR tariff order. Implementation of the energy
auction in accordance with the MBR tariff order is expected to adequately mitigate going forward
any presumption of market power that Southern Company may have in the Southern Company retail
service territory. The timing of when the FERC may issue the final orders on the MBR and CBR
tariffs and the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Generation Interconnection Agreements

In November 2004, generator company subsidiaries of Tenaska, Inc. (Tenaska), as counterparties to
three previously executed interconnection agreements with subsidiaries of Southern Company,
including the Company, filed complaints at the FERC requesting that the FERC modify the agreements
and that the Company refund a total of $7.9 million previously paid for interconnection facilities.
No other similar complaints are pending with the FERC.

In January 2007, the FERC issued an order granting Tenaska’s requested relief. Although the FERC’s
order required the modification of Tenaska’s interconnection agreements, under the provisions of
the order the Company determined that no refund was payable to Tenaska. The Company requested
rehearing asserting that the FERC retroactively applied a new principle to existing interconnection
agreements. Tenaska requested rehearing of the FERC’s methodology for determining the amount of
refunds. The requested rehearings were denied and the Company and Tenaska have appealed the orders
to the U.S. Circuit Court for the District of Columbia. The final outcome of this matter cannot
now be determined.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2008 Annual Report

PSC Matters

Rate Plans

In December 2007, the Georgia PSC approved the 2007 Retail Rate Plan for the years 2008 through
2010. Under the 2007 Retail Rate Plan, the Company’s earnings will continue to be evaluated
against a retail return on common equity (ROE) range of 10.25% to 12.25%. Two-thirds of any
earnings above 12.25% will be applied to rate refunds with the remaining one-third applied to an
ECCR tariff. The Company agreed that it will not file for a general base rate increase during this
period unless its projected retail ROE falls below 10.25%. Retail base rates increased by
approximately $99.7 million effective January 1, 2008 to provide for cost recovery of transmission,
distribution, generation and other investments, as well as increased operating costs. In addition,
the ECCR tariff was implemented to allow for the recovery of costs for required environmental
projects mandated by state and federal regulations. The ECCR tariff increased rates by
approximately $222 million effective January 1, 2008.

The Company is required to file a general rate case by July 1, 2010, in response to which the
Georgia PSC would be expected to determine whether the 2007 Retail Rate Plan should be continued,
modified, or discontinued. See Note 3 to the financial statements under “Retail Regulatory Matters
— Rate Plans” for additional information.

Fuel Cost Recovery

The Company has established fuel cost recovery rates approved by the Georgia PSC. In June 2006,
the Georgia PSC approved an increase in the Company’s total annual billings of approximately $400
million.

In February 2007, the Georgia PSC approved an increase in the Company’s total annual billings of
approximately $383 million effective March 1, 2007. On May 20, 2008, the Georgia PSC approved an
additional increase of approximately $222 million effective June 1, 2008. In compliance with the
order, the Company is required to file a new fuel cost recovery rate by March 1, 2009. On February
19, 2009, the Georgia PSC approved the Company’s request to delay the filing of that case until
March 13, 2009. The new rates are expected to become effective on June 1, 2009. As of December
31, 2008, the Company had a total under recovered fuel cost balance of approximately $764.4
million, of which approximately $223.9 million is not included in current rates.

Fuel cost recovery revenues as recorded on the financial statements are adjusted for differences in
actual recoverable costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates. Accordingly, a change in
the billing factor has no significant effect on the Company’s revenues or net income, but does
impact annual cash flow. Approximately $425.6 million of the under recovered regulatory clause
revenues for the Company is included in deferred charges and other assets at December 31, 2008.
See Note 1 to the financial statements under “Revenues” and Note 3 to the financial statements
under “Retail Regulatory Matters — Fuel Cost Recovery” for additional information.

Income Tax Matters

Legislation

On February 17, 2009, President Obama signed into law the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of
2009 (ARRA). Major tax incentives in the ARRA include an extension of bonus depreciation and
multiple renewable energy incentives. These incentives could have a significant impact on the
Company’s future cash flow and net income. Additionally, the ARRA includes programs for renewable
energy, transmission and smart grid enhancement, fossil energy and research, and energy efficiency
and conservation. The ultimate impact cannot be determined at this time.

Georgia State Income Tax Credits

The Company’s 2005 through 2008 income tax filings for the State of Georgia include state
income tax credits for increased activity through Georgia ports. The Company has also filed
similar claims for the years 2002 through 2004. The Georgia Department of Revenue (DOR) has not
responded to these claims. In July 2007, the Company filed a complaint in the Superior Court of
Fulton County to recover the credits claimed for the years 2002 through 2004. An unrecognized tax
benefit has been recorded related to these credits. If the Company prevails, these claims could
have a significant, and possibly material, positive effect on the Company’s net income. If the
Company is not successful, payment of the related state tax could have a significant, and possibly
material, negative effect on the Company’s cash flow. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot
now be determined. See Note 3 under “Income Tax Matters” and Note 5 under “Unrecognized Tax
Benefits” for additional information.

II-188


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2008 Annual Report

Internal Revenue Code Section 199 Domestic Production Deduction

The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 created a tax deduction for a portion of income attributable
to U.S. production activities as defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Internal
Revenue Code), Section 199 (production activities deduction). The deduction is equal to a stated
percentage of qualified production activities net income. The percentage is phased in over the
years 2005 through 2010 with a 3% rate applicable to the years 2005 and 2006, a 6% rate applicable
for years 2007 through 2009, and a 9% rate thereafter. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has not
clearly defined a methodology for calculating this deduction. However, Southern Company has agreed
with the IRS on a calculation methodology and signed a closing agreement on December 11, 2008.
Therefore, the Company reversed the unrecognized tax benefit and adjusted the deduction to conform
to the agreement. The net impact of the reversal of the unrecognized tax benefits combined with
the application of the new methodology had no material effect on the Company’s financial
statements. See Note 5 to the financial statements under “Effective Tax Rate” for additional
information.

Nuclear

Construction

In August 2006, Southern Nuclear, on behalf of the Company, Oglethorpe Power Corporation, the
Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia, and the City of Dalton, Georgia, an incorporated
municipality in the State of Georgia acting by and through its Board of Water, Light, and Sinking
Fund Commissioners (collectively, Owners), filed an application with the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission (NRC) for an early site permit relating to two additional nuclear units on the site of
Plant Vogtle. See Note 4 to the financial statements for additional information on these
co-owners. On March 31, 2008, Southern Nuclear filed an application with the NRC for a combined
construction and operating license (COL) for the new units.

On April 8, 2008, the Company, acting for itself and as agent for the Owners, and a consortium
consisting of Westinghouse Electric Company LLC and Stone & Webster, Inc. (collectively,
Consortium) entered into an engineering, procurement, and construction agreement to design,
engineer, procure, construct, and test two AP1000 nuclear units with electric generating capacity
of approximately 1,100 megawatts each and related facilities, structures, and improvements at Plant
Vogtle (Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement).

The Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement is an arrangement whereby the Consortium supplies and constructs the
entire facility with the exception of certain items provided by the Owners. Under the terms of the
Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement, the Owners will pay a purchase price that will be subject to certain
price escalation and adjustments, adjustments for change orders, and performance bonuses. Each
Owner is severally (and not jointly) liable for its proportionate share, based on its ownership
interest, of all amounts owed to the Consortium under the Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement. The Company’s
proportionate share, based on its current ownership interest, is 45.7%. Under the terms of a
separate joint development agreement, the Owners finalized their ownership percentages on July 2,
2008, except for allowed changes, under certain limited circumstances, during the Georgia PSC
certification process.

On August 1, 2008, the Company submitted an application for the Georgia PSC to certify the project.
Hearings began November 3, 2008 and a final certification decision is expected in March 2009.

If certified by the Georgia PSC and licensed by the NRC, Vogtle Units 3 and 4 are scheduled to be
placed in service in 2016 and 2017, respectively. The total plant value to be placed in service
will also include financing costs for each of the Owners, the impacts of inflation on costs, and
transmission and other costs that are the responsibility of the Owners. The Company’s
proportionate share of the estimated in-service costs, based on its current ownership interest, is
approximately $6.4 billion, subject to adjustments and performance bonuses under the Vogtle 3 and 4
Agreement.

The Owners and the Consortium have agreed to certain liquidated damages upon the Consortium’s
failure to comply with the schedule and performance guarantees. The Owners and the Consortium also
have agreed to certain bonuses payable to the Consortium for early completion and unit performance.
The Consortium’s liability to the Owners for schedule and performance liquidated damages and
warranty claims is subject to a cap.

The obligations of Westinghouse Electric Company LLC and Stone & Webster, Inc. under the Vogtle 3
and 4 Agreement are guaranteed by Toshiba Corporation and The Shaw Group, Inc., respectively. In
the event of certain credit rating downgrades of any Owner, such Owner will be required to provide
a letter of credit or other credit enhancement.

II-189


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2008 Annual Report

The Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement is subject to certification by the Georgia PSC. In addition, the
Owners may terminate the Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement at any time for their convenience, provided that
the Owners will be required to pay certain termination costs and, at certain stages of the work,
cancellation fees to the Consortium. The Consortium may terminate the Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement
under certain circumstances, including delays in receipt of the COL or delivery of full notice to
proceed, certain Owner suspension or delays of work, action by a governmental authority to
permanently stop work, certain breaches of the Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement by the Owners, Owner
insolvency, and certain other events.

In connection with the certification application, the Company has requested Georgia PSC approval to
include the construction work in progress accounts for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in rate base and
allow the Company to recover financing costs during the construction period.

On February 11, 2009, the Georgia State Senate passed Senate Bill 31 that would allow the Company
to recover financing costs for nuclear construction projects by including the related construction
work in progress accounts in rate base during the construction period. A similar bill is being
considered in the Georgia State House of Representatives.

If the Company is not permitted to recover these costs during the construction period, the
estimated capital expenditures would increase by approximately $144 million in 2011. See FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY — “Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations” herein and Note 7 to
the financial statements under “Construction Program” for these forecasted capital expenditures.

The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot now be determined.

Relicensing

The NRC operating licenses for Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2 currently expire in January 2027 and
February 2029, respectively. In June 2007, the Company filed an application with the NRC to extend
the licenses for Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2 for an additional 20 years. The Company anticipates
the NRC may make a decision regarding the license extension for Plant Vogtle in 2009.

Other Matters

The Company has initiated a voluntary attrition plan under which participating employees may elect
to resign from their positions as of March 31, 2009. Approximately 700 employees who have
indicated an interest in participating in the plan have been selected by the Company and are
permitted to resign and receive severance. Each participating employee who resigns under the plan
will be entitled to receive a severance payment equal to his or her annual base salary, accrued
vacation, and pro-rated bonus as of March 31, 2009. The Company will record a charge during the
first quarter of 2009 in connection with the plan. The ultimate amount of the charge will be
dependent on the total number of employees who elect to resign under the plan. Such charge could
have a material impact on the Company’s statements of income for the quarter ending March 31, 2009
and statements of cash flows for the six months ending June 30, 2009. The first quarter 2009
charge will generally be offset with lower salary costs for the remainder of the year and is not
expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements for the year ending
December 31, 2009.

The Company is involved in various other matters being litigated, regulatory matters, and certain
tax-related issues that could affect future earnings. In addition, the Company is subject to
certain claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company’s
business activities are subject to extensive governmental regulation related to public health and
the environment. Litigation over environmental issues and claims of various types, including
property damage, personal injury, common law nuisance, and citizen enforcement of environmental
requirements such as opacity and air and water quality standards, has increased generally
throughout the United States. In particular, personal injury claims for damages caused by alleged
exposure to hazardous materials have become more frequent. The ultimate outcome of such pending or
potential litigation against the Company cannot be predicted at this time; however, for current
proceedings not specifically reported herein, management does not anticipate that the liabilities,
if any, arising from such current proceedings would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
financial statements. See Note 3 to the financial statements for information regarding material
issues.

II-190


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2008 Annual Report

ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The Company prepares its financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. Significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the
financial statements. In the application of these policies, certain estimates are made that may
have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations and related disclosures. Different
assumptions and measurements could produce estimates that are significantly different from those
recorded in the financial statements. Senior management has reviewed and discussed the following
critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of Southern Company’s Board of
Directors.

Electric Utility Regulation

The Company is subject to retail regulation by the Georgia PSC and wholesale regulation by the
FERC. These regulatory agencies set the rates the Company is permitted to charge customers based
on allowable costs. As a result, the Company applies Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
Statement No. 71, “Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation” (SFAS No. 71), which
requires the financial statements to reflect the effects of rate regulation. Through the
ratemaking process, the regulators may require the inclusion of costs or revenues in periods
different than when they would be recognized by a non-regulated company. This treatment may result
in the deferral of expenses and the recording of related regulatory assets based on anticipated
future recovery through rates or the deferral of gains or creation of liabilities and the recording
of related regulatory liabilities. The application of SFAS No. 71 has a further effect on the
Company’s financial statements as a result of the estimates of allowable costs used in the
ratemaking process. These estimates may differ from those actually incurred by the Company;
therefore, the accounting estimates inherent in specific costs such as depreciation, nuclear
decommissioning, and pension and postretirement benefits have less of a direct impact on the
Company’s results of operations than they would on a non-regulated company.

As reflected in Note 1 to the financial statements, significant regulatory assets and liabilities
have been recorded. Management reviews the ultimate recoverability of these regulatory assets and
liabilities based on applicable regulatory guidelines and accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States. However, adverse legislative, judicial, or regulatory actions could
materially impact the amounts of such regulatory assets and liabilities and could adversely impact
the Company’s financial statements.

Contingent Obligations

The Company is subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, as well as other
factors and conditions that potentially subject it to environmental, litigation, income tax, and
other risks. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL herein and Note 3 to the financial statements for more
information regarding certain of these contingencies. The Company periodically evaluates its
exposure to such risks and, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, records
reserves for those matters where a non-tax-related loss is considered probable and reasonably
estimable and records a tax asset or liability if it is more likely than not that a tax position
will be sustained. The adequacy of reserves can be significantly affected by external events or
conditions that can be unpredictable; thus, the ultimate outcome of such matters could materially
affect the Company’s financial statements. These events or conditions include the following:

II-191


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2008 Annual Report

Unbilled Revenues

Revenues related to the retail sale of electricity are recorded when electricity is delivered to
customers. However, the determination of KWH sales to individual customers is based on the reading
of their meters, which is performed on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each
month, amounts of electricity delivered to customers, but not yet metered and billed, are
estimated. Components of the unbilled revenue estimates include total KWH territorial supply,
total KWH billed, estimated total electricity lost in delivery, and customer usage. These
components can fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including weather, generation patterns,
and power delivery volume and other operational constraints. These factors can be unpredictable
and can vary from historical trends. As a result, the overall estimate of unbilled revenues could
be significantly affected, which could have a material impact on the Company’s results of
operations.

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY

Overview

The Company’s financial condition remained stable at December 31, 2008. Throughout the recent
turmoil in the financial markets, the Company has maintained adequate access to capital without
drawing on any of its committed bank credit arrangements used to support its commercial paper
programs and variable rate pollution control revenue bonds. The Company has continued to issue
commercial paper at reasonable rates. The Company intends to continue to monitor its access to
short-term and long-term capital markets as well as its bank credit arrangements to meet future
capital and liquidity needs. No material changes in bank credit arrangements have occurred
although market rates for committed credit have increased and the Company may be subject to higher
costs as its existing facilities are replaced or renewed. The Company’s interest cost for
short-term debt has decreased as market short-term interest rates have declined. The ultimate
impact on future financing costs as a result of the financial turmoil cannot be determined at this
time. The Company experienced no material counterparty credit losses as a result of the turmoil in
the financial markets. See “Sources of Capital” and “Financing Activities” herein for additional
information.

The Company’s investments in pension and nuclear decommissioning trust funds declined in value as
of December 31, 2008. The Company expects that the earliest that cash may have to be contributed
to the pension trust fund is 2011 and such contribution could be significant; however, projections
of the amount vary significantly depending on interpretations of and decisions related to federal
legislation passed during 2008 as well as other key variables including future fund performance and
cannot be determined at this time. The Company does not expect any changes to funding obligations
to the nuclear decommissioning trusts at this time.

Cash flow from operations totaled $1.7 billion in 2008, an increase of $279.2 million from 2007,
primarily due to higher retail operating revenues partially offset by higher inventory additions.
Cash flow from operations in 2007 totaled $1.4 billion, an increase of $248.5 million from 2006,
primarily due to higher retail revenues primarily related to higher fuel cost recovery revenues and
less cash used for working capital primarily from lower inventory additions and increases in other
current liabilities. Cash flow from operations increased $117.4 million in 2006, primarily from
increased retail operating revenues partially offset by higher fuel inventories and an increase in
under recovered deferred fuel costs.

Net cash used for investing activities totaled $1.9 billion, $1.9 billion, and $1.2 billion in
2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, due to gross property additions primarily related to
installation of equipment to comply with environmental standards, construction of generation,
transmission and distribution facilities, and purchase of nuclear fuel. The majority of funds
needed for gross property additions for the last several years have been provided from operating
activities, capital contributions from Southern Company, and the issuance of long and short-term
debt and preference stock.

Cash provided from financing activities totaled $309.8 million, $429.7 million, and $46.4 million
for 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. These totals are primarily related to additional issuances
of senior notes in 2008 and 2007, and the issuance of short-term debt in 2006. The statements of
cash flows provide additional details. See “Financing Activities” herein.

Significant balance sheet changes in 2008 include a $1.1 billion increase in long-term debt
primarily to replace short-term debt and provide funds for the Company’s continuous construction
program and an increase in total property, plant, and equipment of $1.3 billion. Other significant
balance sheet changes include a decrease of $1.0 billion in prepaid pension costs, an increase of
$908 million in other regulatory assets, and a decrease of $462 million in other regulatory
liabilities primarily attributable to the decline in market value of the Company’s pension trust
fund. Significant balance sheet changes in 2007 include a $726 million increase in long-term debt
and a $221 million increase in preferred and preference stock primarily to replace short-term debt
and provide funds for the

II-192


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2008 Annual Report

Company’s continuous construction programs. Other balance sheet changes
in 2007 include an increase in total property, plant and equipment of $1.3 billion and a $206
million decrease in the under recovered fuel balance.

The Company’s ratio of common equity to total capitalization — including short-term debt — was
46.5% in 2008, 47.5% in 2007, and 48.6% in 2006. The Company has received investment grade credit
ratings from the major rating agencies with respect to debt, preferred securities, preferred stock,
and preference stock. See SELECTED FINANCIAL AND OPERATING DATA for additional information
regarding the Company’s security ratings.

Sources of Capital

The Company plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from sources
similar to those used in the past, which were primarily from operating cash flows, security
issuances, term loans, short-term borrowings, and equity contributions from Southern Company.
However, the type and timing of any future financings, if needed, will depend on market conditions,
regulatory approvals, and other factors. The issuance of long-term securities by the Company is
subject to the approval of the Georgia PSC. In addition, the issuance of short-term debt
securities by the Company is subject to regulatory approval by the FERC. Additionally, with
respect to the public offering of securities, the Company files registration statements with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The amounts
of securities authorized by the Georgia PSC and the FERC are continuously monitored and appropriate
filings are made to ensure flexibility in the capital markets.

The Company obtains financing separately without credit support from any affiliate. See Note 6 to
the financial statements under “Bank Credit Arrangements” for additional information. The Southern
Company system does not maintain a centralized cash or money pool. Therefore, funds of the Company
are not commingled with funds of any other company.

The Company’s current liabilities frequently exceed current assets because of the continued use of
short-term debt as a funding source for under recovered fuel costs and to meet cash needs which can
fluctuate significantly due to the seasonality of the business.

To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, at December 31, 2008 the Company had credit
arrangements with banks totaling $1.3 billion. See Note 6 to the financial statements under “Bank
Credit Arrangements” for additional information.

At December 31, 2008, bank credit arrangements were as follows:

Expires

Total

Unused



(in millions)

$1,345

$

1,333

$


$

1,120

Of the credit arrangements that expire in 2009, $40 million allow for the execution of term loans
for an additional two-year period.

The Company may also meet short-term cash needs through a Southern Company subsidiary organized to
issue and sell commercial paper at the request and for the benefit of the Company and the other
traditional operating companies. Proceeds from such issuances for the benefit of the Company are
loaned directly to the Company and are not commingled with proceeds from issuances for the benefit
of any other operating company. The obligations of each company under these arrangements are
several; there is no cross affiliate credit support. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had
$256.3 million of outstanding commercial paper and a $100 million short-term bank loan outstanding.

Financing Activities

During 2008, the Company issued $1.0 billion of senior notes and incurred $312 million of
obligations related to the issuance of pollution control revenue bonds. The issuances were used to
reduce the Company’s short-term indebtedness, fund senior note maturities totaling $198 million,
redeem pollution control revenue bonds totaling $259 million, and fund the Company’s ongoing
construction program.

During 2008, the Company settled interest rate hedges of $325 million related to the issuance of
senior notes at a loss of $20 million. Additionally, interest rate hedges of $100 million were
settled early at a loss of $2 million related to counterparty credit issues.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2008 Annual Report

In 2008, the Company converted its entire $819 million of obligations related to auction rate
pollution control revenue bonds from auction rate modes to other interest rate modes. Initially,
approximately $332 million of the auction rate pollution control revenue bonds were converted to
fixed interest rate modes and approximately $487 million were converted to variable rate modes.
The Company subsequently converted approximately $203 million of its variable rate pollution
control revenue bonds to fixed interest rate modes. The Company also incurred obligations related
to the issuance of $53 million of pollution control revenue bonds for the
Company’s Plant Hammond project. At December 31, 2008 the trustee held $22.4 million of the
proceeds, which will be transferred to the Company for reimbursement of project costs.

In September 2008, the Company was required to purchase a total of approximately $76.6 million of
variable rate pollution control revenue bonds that were tendered by investors. The Company
subsequently remarketed $74.5 million of the tendered bonds. The remaining $2.1 million were
extinguished.

In addition to any financings that may be necessary to meet capital requirements and contractual
obligations, the Company plans to continue, when economically feasible, a program to retire
higher-cost securities and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital if market conditions
permit.

Subsequent to December 31, 2008, the Company issued $500 million of Series 2009A 5.95% Senior Notes
due February 1, 2039. The proceeds were used by the Company to repay at maturity $150 million
aggregate principal amount of the Company’s Series U Floating Rate Senior Notes due February 7,
2009, to repay a portion of short-term indebtedness, and for general corporate purposes. The
Company settled $100 million of hedges related to the issuance at a loss of approximately $16
million.

Credit Rating Risk

The Company does not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in payment
schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade. There are certain contracts
that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of a credit rating change
to BBB- and/or Baa3 or below. These contracts are for physical electricity purchases and sales,
fuel purchases, fuel transportation and storage, emissions allowances, energy price risk
management, and for construction of new generation. At December 31, 2008, the maximum potential
collateral requirements under these contracts at a BBB- and/or Baa3 rating were approximately $27
million. At December 31, 2008, the maximum potential collateral requirements under these contracts
at a rating below BBB- and/or Baa3 were approximately $961 million. Included in these amounts are
certain agreements that could require collateral in the event that one or more power pool
participants has a credit rating change to below investment grade. Generally, collateral may be
provided by a Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit, or cash. Additionally, any credit
rating downgrade could impact the Company’s ability to access capital markets, particularly the
short-term debt market.

Market Price Risk

Due to cost-based rate regulation, the Company has limited exposure to market rate volatility in
interest rates, commodity fuel prices, and prices of electricity. To manage the volatility
attributable to these exposures, where possible, the Company nets the exposures to take advantage
of natural offsets and enters into various derivative transactions for the remaining exposures
pursuant to the Company’s policies in areas such as counterparty exposure and hedging practices.
The Company’s policy is that derivatives are to be used primarily for hedging purposes and mandates
strict adherence to all applicable risk management policies. Derivative positions are monitored
using techniques including, but not limited to, market valuation, value at risk, stress tests, and
sensitivity analysis.

To mitigate future exposure to changes in interest rates, the Company enters into forward starting
interest rate swaps and other derivatives that have been designated as hedges. These derivatives
have a notional amount of $851 million and are related to anticipated debt issuances and certain
variable rate debt over the next two years. The weighted average interest rate on $291 million of
outstanding variable rate long-term debt that has not been hedged at January 1, 2009 was 2.24%. If
the Company sustained a 100 basis point change in interest rates for all unhedged variable rate
long-term debt, the change would affect annualized interest expense by approximately $3 million at
January 1, 2009. See Notes 1 and 6 to the financial statements under “Financial Instruments” for
additional information.

To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity prices, the Company enters into
fixed-price contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity through the wholesale electricity
market and, to a lesser extent, into financial hedge contracts for gas purchases.

The changes in fair value of energy-related derivative contracts were as follows at December 31:

(a)

Current period changes also include the changes in fair value of new contracts entered into
during the period, if any

The decrease in the fair value positions of the energy-related derivative contracts for the year
ended December 31, 2008 was $112.8 million, substantially all of which is due to natural gas
positions. This change is attributable to both the volume and prices of natural gas. At December
31, 2008, the Company had a net hedge volume of 59.3 billion cubic feet (Bcf) with a weighted
average contract cost approximately $1.96 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) above market
prices, compared to 44.1 Bcf at December 31, 2007 with a weighted average contract cost
approximately $0.02 per mmBtu above market prices. These natural gas hedges are designated as
regulatory hedges.

Energy-related derivative contracts which are designated as regulatory hedges relate to the
Company’s fuel hedging program where gains and losses are initially recorded as regulatory
liabilities and assets, respectively, and then are included in fuel expense as they are recovered
through the fuel cost recovery mechanism.

Gains and losses on energy-related derivative contracts that are not designated or fail to qualify
as hedges are recognized in the statements of income as incurred.

Unrealized pre-tax gains/(losses) recognized in income for energy-related derivative contracts that
are not hedges were not material for any year presented.

The maturities of the energy-related derivative contracts and the level of the fair value hierarchy
in which they fall at December 31, 2008 are as follows:

As part of the adoption of FASB Statement No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” to increase
consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, the table above
now uses the three-tier fair value hierarchy, as discussed in Note 10 to the financial statements,
as opposed to the previously used descriptions “actively quoted,” “external sources,” and “models
and other methods.” The three-tier fair value hierarchy focuses on the fair value of the contract
itself, whereas the previous descriptions focused on the source of the inputs. Because the Company
uses over-the-counter contracts that are not exchange traded but are fair valued using prices which
are actively quoted, the valuations of those contracts now appear in Level 2; previously they were
shown as “actively quoted.”

The Company is exposed to market risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to the
energy-related and interest rate derivative contracts. The Company’s practice is to enter into
agreements with counterparties that have investment grade credit ratings by Moody’s and Standard &
Poor’s or with counterparties who have posted collateral to cover potential credit exposure.
Therefore, the Company does not anticipate market risk exposure from nonperformance by the
counterparties. For additional information, see Notes 1 and 6 to the financial statements under
“Financial Instruments.”

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2008 Annual Report

Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations

The construction program of the Company is currently estimated to be $2.8 billion for 2009, $2.6
billion for 2010, and $2.6 billion for 2011. This estimate assumes the Company’s current request
to include construction work in progress for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in rates is granted by the
Georgia PSC or the Georgia legislature, beginning in 2011. If not, the estimate will increase by
approximately $144 million in 2011. Environmental expenditures included in these estimated amounts
are $472 million, $334 million, and $399 million for 2009, 2010, and 2011, respectively. The
construction programs are subject to periodic review and revision, and actual construction costs
may vary from these estimates because of numerous factors. These factors include: changes in
business conditions; revised load growth estimates; changes in environmental statutes and
regulations; changes in nuclear plants to meet new regulatory requirements; changes in FERC rules
and regulations; Georgia PSC approvals; changes in legislation; the cost and efficiency of
construction labor, equipment, and materials; and the cost of capital. In addition, there can be
no assurance that costs related to capital expenditures will be fully recovered.

As a result of requirements by the NRC, the Company has established external trust funds for
nuclear decommissioning costs. For additional information, see Note 1 to the financial statements
under “Nuclear Decommissioning.”

In addition, as discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company provides
postretirement benefits to substantially all employees and funds trusts to the extent required by
the Georgia PSC and the FERC.

Other funding requirements related to obligations associated with scheduled maturities of long-term
debt and preferred securities and the related interest, preferred and preference stock dividends,
leases, derivative obligations, and other purchase commitments are as follows. See Notes 1, 6, and
7 to the financial statements for additional information.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Georgia Power Company 2008 Annual Report

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

General

Georgia Power Company (the Company) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Southern Company, which is the
parent company of four traditional operating companies, Southern Power Company (Southern Power),
Southern Company Services, Inc. (SCS), Southern Communications Services, Inc. (SouthernLINC
Wireless), Southern Company Holdings, Inc. (Southern Holdings), Southern Nuclear Operating Company,
Inc. (Southern Nuclear), and other direct and indirect subsidiaries. The traditional operating
companies — Alabama Power Company (Alabama Power), the Company, Gulf Power Company (Gulf Power),
and Mississippi Power Company (Mississippi Power) — provide electric service in four Southeastern
states. The Company operates as a vertically integrated utility providing electricity to retail
customers within its traditional service area located within the State of Georgia and to wholesale
customers in the Southeast. Southern Power constructs, acquires, owns, and manages generation
assets and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market. SCS, the system
service company, provides at cost, specialized services to Southern Company and its subsidiary
companies. SouthernLINC Wireless provides digital wireless communications for use by Southern
Company and its subsidiary companies and also markets these services to the public, and provides
fiber cable services within the Southeast. Southern Holdings is an intermediate holding company
subsidiary for Southern Company’s investments in leveraged leases and various other energy-related
businesses. Southern Nuclear operates and provides services to Southern Company’s nuclear power
plants.

The equity method is used for subsidiaries in which the Company has significant influence but does
not control and for variable interest entities where the Company is not the primary beneficiary.

The Company is subject to regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the
Georgia Public Service Commission (PSC). The Company follows accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States and complies with the accounting policies and practices prescribed by
its regulatory commissions. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires the use of estimates, and the actual
results may differ from those estimates.

Reclassifications

Certain prior years’ data presented in the financial statements have been reclassified to conform
to the current year presentation. The statements of income have been modified within the operating
expenses section to combine the line items “Other operations” and “Maintenance” into a single line
item entitled “Other operations and maintenance.” Due to materiality in the current period, the
statements of cash flows for the prior periods presented were modified within the operating
activities section to separately report the amount of “Deferred revenues” and “Hedge settlements”
previously included in “Other, net” while the line item “Tax benefit of stock options” was
collapsed into “Other, net.” Within the financing activities section of the statements of cash
flows in the prior periods, the amount of “Gross excess tax benefit of stock options” was combined
into “Other.” These reclassifications had no effect on total assets, net income, or cash flows.

Affiliate Transactions

The Company has an agreement with SCS under which the following services are rendered to the
Company at direct or allocated cost: general and design engineering, purchasing, accounting and
statistical analysis, finance and treasury, tax, information resources, marketing, auditing,
insurance and pension administration, human resources, systems and procedures, digital wireless
communications, and other services with respect to business and operations and power pool
operations. Costs for these services amounted to $490 million in 2008, $449 million in 2007, and
$393 million in 2006. Cost allocation methodologies used by SCS were approved by the Securities
and Exchange Commission prior to the repeal of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as
amended, and management believes they are reasonable. The FERC permits services to be rendered at
cost by system service companies.

The Company has an agreement with Southern Nuclear under which the following nuclear-related
services are rendered to the Company at cost: general executive and advisory services, general
operations, management and technical services, administrative services including procurement,
accounting, employee relations, systems and procedures services, strategic planning and budgeting
services, and other services with respect to business and operations. Costs for these services
amounted to $410 million in 2008, $380 million in 2007, and $348 million in 2006.

II-205


NOTES (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2008 Annual Report

The Company had an agreement with Southern Power under which the Company operated and maintained
Southern Power’s Plants Dahlberg, Franklin, and Wansley at cost. In August 2007, that agreement
was terminated and replaced with a service agreement under which the Company provides to Southern
Power specifically requested services. Billings under these agreements with Southern Power
amounted to $1.9 million in 2008, $6.8 million in 2007, and $5.4 million in 2006.

Southern Company’s 30% ownership interest in Alabama Fuel Products, LLC (AFP), which produced
synthetic fuel, was terminated in July 2006. The Company had an agreement with an indirect
subsidiary of Southern Company that provided services for AFP. Under this agreement, the Company
provided certain accounting functions, including processing and paying fuel transportation
invoices, and the Company was reimbursed for its expenses. Amounts billed under this agreement
totaled approximately $85 million in 2007, and $76 million in 2006. In addition, the Company
purchased synthetic fuel from AFP for use at Plant Branch. Synthetic fuel purchases totaled $278
million in both 2007 and 2006. The related party transactions and synthetic fuel purchases were
terminated as of December 31, 2007.

The Company has entered into several power purchase agreements (PPAs) with Southern Power for
capacity and energy. Expenses associated with these PPAs were $480 million, $440 million, and $407
million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. Additionally, the Company had $25 million and $26
million of prepaid capacity expenses included in deferred charges and other assets in the balance
sheets at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. See Note 7 under “Purchased Power Commitments”
for additional information.

The Company has an agreement with Gulf Power under which Gulf Power jointly owns a portion of Plant
Scherer. Under this agreement, the Company operates Plant Scherer, and Gulf Power reimburses the
Company for its proportionate share of the related expenses which were $8.1 million in 2008, $5.1
million in 2007, and $8.0 million in 2006. See Note 4 for additional information.

In 2008, the Company purchased a compressor assembly from Southern Power for $3.9 million.

In 2007, the Company sold equipment at cost to Gulf Power for $4.0 million.

The Company provides incidental services to other Southern Company subsidiaries which are generally
minor in duration and amount. The Company provided no significant storm assistance to affiliates
in 2008, 2007, or 2006.

Also see Note 4 for information regarding the Company’s ownership in and PPA with Southern Electric
Generating Company (SEGCO) and Note 5 for information on certain deferred tax liabilities due to
affiliates.

The traditional operating companies, including the Company, and Southern Power may jointly enter
into various types of wholesale energy, natural gas, and certain other contracts, either directly
or through SCS as agent. Each participating company may be jointly and severally liable for the
obligations incurred under these agreements. See Note 7 under “Fuel Commitments” for additional
information.

Regulatory Assets and Liabilities

The Company is subject to the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement
No. 71, “Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation” (SFAS No. 71). Regulatory
assets represent probable future revenues associated with certain costs that are expected to be
recovered from customers through the ratemaking process. Regulatory liabilities represent probable
future reductions in revenues associated with amounts that are expected to be credited to customers
through the ratemaking process.

In the event that a portion of the Company’s operations is no longer subject to the provisions of
SFAS No. 71, the Company would be required to write off or reclassify to accumulated other
comprehensive income related regulatory assets and liabilities that are not specifically
recoverable through regulated rates. In addition, the Company would be required to determine if
any impairment to other assets, including plant, exists and write down the assets, if impaired, to
their fair value. All regulatory assets and liabilities are reflected in rates.

Revenues

Energy and other revenues are recognized as services are provided. Unbilled revenues are accrued
at the end of each fiscal period. Electric rates for the Company include provisions to adjust
billings for fluctuations in fuel costs and the energy component of purchased power costs, and
certain other costs. Revenues are adjusted for differences between the actual recoverable costs
and amounts billed in current regulated rates.

II-207


NOTES (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2008 Annual Report

Retail fuel cost recovery rates require periodic filings with the Georgia PSC. In compliance with
the order, the Company is required to file a new fuel cost recovery rate by March 1, 2009. On
February 19, 2009, the Georgia PSC approved the Company’s request to delay the filing of that case
until March 13, 2009. The new rates are expected to become effective on June 1, 2009. See Note 3
under “Retail Regulatory Matters — Fuel Cost Recovery.” The Company has a diversified base of
customers. No single customer or industry comprises 10% or more of revenues. For all periods
presented, uncollectible accounts averaged less than 1% of revenues.

Fuel Costs

Fuel costs are expensed as the fuel is used. Fuel expense includes the cost of purchased emission
allowances as they are used. Fuel expense also includes the amortization of the cost of nuclear
fuel and a charge, based on nuclear generation, for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel.
See Note 3 under “Nuclear Fuel Disposal Costs” for additional information.

Income and Other Taxes

The Company uses the liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes and provides deferred
income taxes for all significant income tax temporary differences. Investment tax credits utilized
are deferred and amortized to income over the average life of the related property. Taxes that are
collected from customers on behalf of governmental agencies to be remitted to these agencies are
presented net on the statements of income. In accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 48,
“Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,” the Company recognizes tax positions that are “more
likely than not” of being sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities. See
Note 5 under “Unrecognized Tax Benefits” for additional information.

Property, Plant, and Equipment

Property, plant, and equipment is stated at original cost, less regulatory disallowances and
impairments. Original cost includes: materials; labor; minor items of property; appropriate
administrative and general costs; payroll-related costs such as taxes, pensions, and other
benefits; and the interest capitalized and/or cost of funds used during construction.

The Company’s property, plant, and equipment consisted of the following at December 31:

The cost of replacements of property, exclusive of minor items of property, is capitalized. The
cost of maintenance, repairs, and replacement of minor items of property is charged to maintenance
expense as incurred or performed with the exception of certain generating plant maintenance costs.
As mandated by the Georgia PSC, the Company defers and amortizes nuclear refueling costs over the
unit’s operating cycle before the next refueling. The refueling cycles are 18 and 24 months for
Plants Vogtle and Hatch, respectively. Also, in accordance with the Georgia PSC, the Company defers the costs of certain
significant inspection costs for the combustion turbines at Plant McIntosh and amortizes such costs
over 10 years, which approximates the expected maintenance cycle.

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation of the original cost of utility plant in service is provided primarily by using
composite straight-line rates, which approximated 2.9% in 2008 and 2.6% in 2007 and 2006.
Depreciation studies are conducted periodically to update the composite rates that are approved by
the Georgia PSC. Effective January 1, 2008, the Company’s depreciation rates were revised by the
Georgia PSC.

II-208


NOTES (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2008 Annual Report

When property subject to depreciation is retired or otherwise disposed of in the normal course of
business, its original cost, together with the cost of removal, less salvage, is charged to
accumulated depreciation. Minor items of property included in the original cost of the plant are
retired when the related property unit is retired.

Under the Company’s retail rate plan for the three years ended December 31, 2007 (2004 Retail Rate
Plan), the Company was ordered to recognize Georgia PSC—certified capacity costs in rates evenly
over the three years covered by the 2004 Retail Rate Plan. The Company recorded credits to
amortization of $19 million and $14 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The retail rate plan
for the three years ending December 31, 2010 (2007 Retail Rate Plan) did not include a similar
order. See Note 3 under “Retail Regulatory Matters — Rate Plans” for additional information.

Asset Retirement Obligations and Other Costs of Removal

Asset retirement obligations are computed as the present value of the ultimate costs for an asset’s
future retirement and are recorded in the period in which the liability is incurred. The costs are
capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset’s useful life.
The Company has received accounting guidance from the Georgia PSC allowing the continued accrual of
other future retirement costs for long-lived assets that the Company does not have a legal
obligation to retire. Accordingly, the accumulated removal costs for these obligations will
continue to be reflected in the balance sheets as a regulatory liability.

The liability recognized to retire long-lived assets primarily relates to the Company’s nuclear
facilities, which include the Company’s ownership interests in Plants Hatch and Vogtle. The fair
value of assets legally restricted for settling retirement obligations related to nuclear
facilities as of December 31, 2008 was $460 million. In addition, the Company has retirement
obligations related to various landfill sites, ash ponds, underground storage tanks, and asbestos
removal. The Company also has identified retirement obligations related to certain transmission
and distribution facilities, leasehold improvements, equipment on customer property, and property
associated with the Company’s rail lines. However, liabilities for the removal of these assets
have not been recorded because the range of time over which the Company may settle these
obligations is unknown and cannot be reasonably estimated. The Company will continue to recognize
in the statements of income the allowed removal costs in accordance with its regulatory treatment.
Any difference between costs recognized under FASB Statement No. 143, “Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations” and FASB Interpretation No. 47, “Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations”
and those reflected in rates are recognized as either a regulatory asset or liability in the
balance sheets as ordered by the Georgia PSC. See “Nuclear Decommissioning” herein for further
information on amounts included in rates.

Nuclear Decommissioning

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) requires licensees of commercial nuclear power reactors to
establish a plan for providing reasonable assurance of funds for future decommissioning. The
Company has external trust funds (the Funds) to comply with the NRC’s regulations. Use of the
Funds is restricted to nuclear decommissioning activities and the Funds are managed and invested in
accordance with applicable requirements of various regulatory bodies, including the NRC, the FERC,
and the Georgia PSC, as well as

II-209


NOTES (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2008 Annual Report

the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Funds are invested in a tax-efficient manner in a
diversified mix of equity and fixed income securities and are reported as of December 31, 2008 as
trading securities pursuant to FASB Statement No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt
and Equity Securities” (SFAS No. 115).

On January 1, 2008, the Company adopted FASB Statement No. 159, “Fair Value Option for Financial
Assets and Financial Liabilities — Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115” (SFAS No.
159). This standard permits an entity to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain
other items at fair value. The Company elected the fair value option only for investment
securities held in the Funds. The Funds are included in the balance sheets at fair value, as
disclosed in Note 10.

Management elected to continue to record the Funds at fair value because management believes that
fair value best represents the nature of the Funds. Management has delegated day-to-day management
of the investments in the Funds to unrelated third party managers with oversight by Southern
Company and Company management. The managers of the Funds are authorized, within broad limits, to
actively buy and sell securities at their own discretion in order to maximize the investment return
on the Funds’ investments. Because of the Company’s inability to choose to hold securities that
have experienced unrealized losses until recovery of their value, all unrealized losses incurred
during 2006 and 2007, prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 159, were considered other-than-temporary
impairments under SFAS No. 115.

The adoption of SFAS No. 159 had no impact on the results of operations, cash flows, or financial
condition of the Company. For all periods presented, all gains and losses, whether realized,
unrealized, or identified as other-than-temporary, have been and will continue to be recorded in
the regulatory liability for asset retirement obligations in the balance sheets and are not
included in net income or other comprehensive income. Fair value adjustments, realized gains, and
other-than-temporary impairment losses are determined on a specific identification basis.

At December 31, 2008, investment securities in the Funds totaled $459.1 million consisting of
equity securities of $261.4 million, debt securities of $187.3 million, and $10.4 million of other
securities. These amounts exclude receivables related to investment income and pending investment
sales, and payables related to pending investment purchases.

At December 31, 2007, investment securities in the Funds totaled $589.0 million consisting of
equity securities of $402.4 million, debt securities of $171.8 million, and $14.8 million of other
securities. Unrealized gains were $125.5 million for equity securities and $4.8 million for debt
securities. Other-than-temporary impairments were $(12.2) million for equity securities and $(1.8)
million for debt securities.

Sales of the securities held in the Funds resulted in cash proceeds of $412.2 million, $441.4
million, and $457.4 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively, all of which were re-invested.
For 2008, fair value reductions, including reinvested interest and dividends, were $(143.9)
million, of which $(151.0) million related to securities held in the Funds at December 31, 2008.
Realized gains and other-than-temporary impairment losses were $43.7 million and $(39.1) million,
respectively, in 2007 and $17.8 million and $(12.1) million, respectively, in 2006. While the
investment securities held in the Funds are reported as trading securities from the perspective of
SFAS No. 115, the Funds continue to be managed with a long-term focus. Accordingly, all purchases
and sales within the Funds are presented separately in the statements of cash flows as investing
cash flows, consistent with the nature of and purpose for which the securities were acquired.

Amounts previously recorded in internal reserves are being transferred into the external trust
funds over periods approved by the Georgia PSC. The NRC’s minimum external funding requirements
are based on a generic estimate of the cost to decommission only the radioactive portions of a
nuclear unit based on the size and type of reactor. The Company has filed plans with the NRC
designed to ensure that, over time, the deposits and earnings of the external trust funds will
provide the minimum funding amounts prescribed by the NRC.

Site study cost is the estimate to decommission a specific facility as of the site study year. The
estimated costs of decommissioning are based on the most current study performed in 2006. The site
study costs and accumulated provisions for decommissioning as of December 31, 2008 based on the
Company’s ownership interests were as follows:

The decommissioning cost estimates are based on prompt dismantlement and removal of the plant from
service. The actual decommissioning costs may vary from these estimates because of changes in the
assumed date of decommissioning, changes in NRC requirements, or changes in the assumptions used in
making these estimates.

For ratemaking purposes, the Company’s decommissioning costs are based on the NRC generic estimate
to decommission the radioactive portion of the facilities. Under the 2004 Retail Rate Plan, the
annual decommissioning costs for ratemaking were $7 million for Plant Vogtle for 2006 and 2007.
Under the 2007 Retail Rate Plan, effective for the years 2008 through 2010, the annual
decommissioning cost for ratemaking is $3 million for Plant Vogtle. Based on estimates approved in
the 2007 Retail Rate Plan, the Company projected the external trust funds for Plant Hatch would be
adequate to meet the decommissioning obligations with no further contributions. The NRC estimates
are $495 million and $334 million for Plants Hatch and Vogtle, respectively. Significant
assumptions used to determine the costs for ratemaking include an estimated inflation rate of 2.9%
and an estimated trust earnings rate of 4.9%. Another significant assumption was that the
operating licenses for Plant Vogtle would remain at 40 years until a 20-year extension requested by
the Company in June 2007 is authorized by the NRC. The Company anticipates the NRC will make a
decision regarding the license extension for Plant Vogtle in 2009.

Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC) and Interest Capitalized

In accordance with regulatory treatment, the Company records AFUDC, which represents the estimated
debt and equity costs of capital funds that are necessary to finance the construction of new
regulated facilities. While cash is not realized currently from such allowance, it increases the
revenue requirement over the service life of the plant through a higher rate base and higher
depreciation. The equity component of AFUDC is not included in calculating taxable income. For
the years 2008, 2007, and 2006, the average AFUDC rates were 8.2%, 8.4%, and 8.3%, respectively,
and AFUDC capitalized was $135.1 million, $96.8 million, and $44.1 million, respectively. AFUDC
and interest capitalized, net of taxes were 13.3%, 10.3%, and 5.0% of net income after dividends on
preferred and preference stock for 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles

The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. The determination of
whether an impairment has occurred is based on either a specific regulatory disallowance or an
estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets, as compared with the
carrying value of the assets. If an impairment has occurred, the amount of the impairment
recognized is determined by either the amount of regulatory disallowance or by estimating the fair
value of the assets and recording a loss if the carrying value is greater than the fair value. For
assets identified as held for sale, the carrying value is compared to the estimated fair value less
the cost to sell in order to determine if an impairment loss is required. Until the assets are
disposed of, their estimated fair value is re-evaluated when circumstances or events change.

Storm Damage Reserve

The Company maintains a reserve for property damage to cover the cost of damages from major storms
to its transmission and distribution lines and the cost of uninsured damages to its generation
facilities and other property as mandated by the Georgia PSC. Under the 2004 Retail Rate Plan, the
Company accrued $6.6 million annually that was recoverable through base rates. Effective

II-211


NOTES (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2008 Annual Report

January 1, 2008, the Company is accruing $21.4 million annually under the 2007 Retail Rate Plan.
The Company expects the Georgia PSC to periodically review and adjust, if necessary, the amounts
collected in rates for storm damage costs.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

For purposes of the financial statements, temporary cash investments are considered cash
equivalents. Temporary cash investments are securities with original maturities of 90 days or
less.

Materials and Supplies

Generally, materials and supplies include the average costs of transmission, distribution, and
generating plant materials. Materials are charged to inventory when purchased and then expensed or
capitalized to plant, as appropriate, at weighted average cost when installed.

Fuel Inventory

Fuel inventory includes the average costs of oil, coal, natural gas, and emission allowances. Fuel
is charged to inventory when purchased and then expensed as used and recovered by the Company
through fuel cost recovery rates approved by the Georgia PSC. Emission allowances granted by the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are included in inventory at zero cost.

Financial Instruments

The Company uses derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to fluctuations in interest
rates, the prices of certain fuel purchases, and electricity purchases and sales. All derivative
financial instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities (categorized in “Other” or
shown separately as “Risk Management Activities”) and are measured at fair value. See Note 10 for
additional information. Substantially all of the Company’s bulk energy purchases and sales
contracts that meet the definition of a derivative are exempt from fair value accounting
requirements and are accounted for under the accrual method. Other derivative contracts qualify as
cash flow hedges of anticipated transactions or are recoverable through the Georgia PSC-approved
fuel hedging program. This results in the deferral of related gains and losses in other
comprehensive income or regulatory assets and liabilities, respectively, until the hedged
transactions occur. Any ineffectiveness arising from cash flow hedges is recognized currently in
net income. Other derivative contracts are marked to market through current period income and are
recorded on a net basis in the statements of income. See Note 6 under “Financial Instruments” for
additional information.

The Company does not offset fair value amounts recognized for multiple derivative instruments
executed with the same counterparty under a master netting arrangement. Additionally, the Company
has no outstanding collateral repayment obligations or rights to reclaim collateral arising from
derivative instruments recognized at December 31, 2008.

The Company is exposed to losses related to financial instruments in the event of counterparties’
nonperformance. The Company has established controls to determine and monitor the creditworthiness
of counterparties in order to mitigate the Company’s exposure to counterparty credit risk.

The Company’s financial instruments for which the carrying amount did not equal fair value at
December 31 were as follows:

Carrying Amount

Fair Value

(in millions)

Long-term debt:


$

7,219

$

7,096


$

6,066

$

5,969

The fair values were based on either closing market prices (Level 1) or closing prices of
comparable instruments (Level 2). See Note 10 for all other items recognized at fair value in the
financial statements.

Comprehensive Income

The objective of comprehensive income is to report a measure of all changes in common stock equity
of an enterprise that result from

II-212


NOTES (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2008 Annual Report

transactions and other economic events of the period other than transactions with owners.
Comprehensive income consists of net income, changes in the fair value of qualifying cash flow
hedges and marketable securities, and prior to the adoption of SFAS No.158, “Employers’ Accounting
for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans” (SFAS No. 158) the minimum pension
liability, less income taxes and reclassifications for amounts included in net income.

Variable Interest Entities

The primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity must consolidate the related assets and
liabilities. The Company has established certain wholly-owned trusts to issue preferred
securities. However, the Company is not considered the primary beneficiary of the trusts.
Therefore, the investments in these trusts are reflected as Other Investments, and the related
loans from the trusts are reflected as Long-term Debt in the balance sheets. See Note 6 under
“Long-Term Debt Payable to Affiliated Trusts” for additional information.

2. RETIREMENT BENEFITS

The Company has a defined benefit, trusteed, pension plan covering substantially all employees.
The plan is funded in accordance with requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
of 1974, as amended (ERISA). No contributions to the plan are expected for the year ending
December 31, 2009. The Company also provides certain defined benefit pension plans for a selected
group of management and highly compensated employees. Benefits under these non-qualified pension
plans are funded on a cash basis. In addition, the Company provides certain medical care and life
insurance benefits for retired employees through other postretirement benefit plans. The Company
funds trusts to the extent required by the FERC. For the year ending December 31, 2009,
postretirement trust contributions are expected to total approximately $39 million.

The measurement date for plan assets and obligations for 2008 was December 31 while the measurement
date for prior years was September 30. Pursuant to SFAS No. 158, the Company was required to
change the measurement date for its defined benefit postretirement plans from September 30 to
December 31 beginning with the year ended December 31, 2008. As permitted, the Company adopted the
measurement date provisions of SFAS No. 158 effective January 1, 2008 resulting in an increase in
long-term liabilities of approximately $10 million and an increase in prepaid pension costs of
approximately $10 million.

Pension Plans

The total accumulated benefit obligation for the pension plans was $2.1 billion in 2008 and $2.0
billion in 2007. Changes during the 15-month period ended December 31, 2008 and the 12-month
period ended September 30, 2007 in the projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan
assets were as follows:

Georgia Power Company 2008 Annual Report

At December 31, 2008, the projected benefit obligations for the qualified and non-qualified pension
plans were $2.1 billion and $128 million, respectively. All pension plan assets are related to the
qualified pension plan.

Pension plan assets are managed and invested in accordance with all applicable requirements,
including ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Internal Revenue Code). The
Company’s investment policy covers a diversified mix of assets, including equity and fixed income
securities, real estate, and private equity. Derivative instruments are used primarily as hedging
tools but may also be used to gain efficient exposure to the various asset classes. The Company
primarily minimizes the risk of large losses through diversification but also monitors and manages
other aspects of risk. The actual composition of the Company’s pension plan assets as of the end

Net periodic pension cost (income) is the sum of service cost, interest cost, and other costs
netted against the expected return on plan assets. The expected return on plan assets is
determined by multiplying the expected rate of return on plan assets and the market-related value
of plan assets. In determining the market-related value of plan assets, the Company has elected to
amortize changes in the market value of all plan assets over five years rather than recognize the
changes immediately. As a result, the accounting value of plan assets that is used to calculate
the expected return on plan assets differs from the current fair value of the plan assets.

Future benefit payments reflect expected future service and are estimated based on assumptions used
to measure the projected benefit obligation for the pension plans. At December 31, 2008, estimated
benefit payments were as follows:

The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (Medicare Act) provides
a 28% prescription drug subsidy for Medicare eligible retirees. The effect of the subsidy reduced
the Company’s expenses for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006 by approximately $14
million, $14 million, and $16 million, respectively.

Future benefit payments, including prescription drug benefits, reflect expected future service and

Actuarial Assumptions

The weighted average rates assumed in the actuarial calculations used to determine both the benefit
obligations as of the measurement date and the net periodic costs for the pension and other
postretirement benefit plans for the following year are presented below. Net periodic benefit
costs were calculated in 2005 for the 2006 plan year using a discount rate of 5.50%.

An additional assumption used in measuring the APBO was a weighted average medical care cost trend
rate of 9.15% for 2009, decreasing gradually to 5.50% through the year 2015 and remaining at that
level thereafter. An annual increase or decrease in the assumed medical care cost trend rate of 1%

The Company provides an 85% matching contribution up to 6% of an employee’s base salary. Prior to
November 2006, the Company matched employee contributions at a rate of 75% up to 6% of the
employee’s base salary. Total matching contributions made to the plan for 2008, 2007, and 2006
were $25 million, $24 million, and $21 million, respectively.

3. CONTINGENCIES AND REGULATORY MATTERS

General Litigation Matters

The Company is subject to certain claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of
business. In addition, the Company’s business activities are subject to extensive governmental
regulation related to public health and the environment. Litigation over environmental issues and
claims of various types, including property damage, personal injury, common law nuisance, and
citizen enforcement of environmental requirements such as opacity and air and water quality
standards, has increased generally throughout the United States. In particular, personal injury
claims for damages caused by alleged exposure to hazardous materials have become more frequent.
The ultimate outcome of such pending or potential litigation against the Company cannot be
predicted at this time; however, for current proceedings not specifically reported herein,
management does not anticipate that the liabilities, if any, arising from such current proceedings
would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial statements.

Environmental Matters

New Source Review Actions

In November 1999, the EPA brought a civil action in the U.S.District Court for the Northern
District of Georgia against certain Southern Company subsidiaries, including the Company, alleging
that these subsidiaries had violated the New Source Review (NSR) provisions of the Clean Air Act
and related state laws at certain coal-fired generating facilities including the Company’s Plants
Bowen and Scherer. After Alabama Power was dismissed from the original action for jurisdictional
reasons, the EPA filed a separate action in January 2001 against Alabama Power in the U.S. District
Court for the Northern District of Alabama. In these lawsuits, the EPA alleged that NSR violations
occurred at eight coal-fired generating facilities operated by Alabama Power and the Company. The
civil actions request penalties and injunctive relief, including an order requiring installation of
the best available control technology at the affected units. The action against the Company has
been administratively closed since the spring of 2001, and the case has not been reopened.

In June 2006, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama entered a consent decree
between Alabama Power and the EPA, resolving a portion of the Alabama Power lawsuit relating to the
alleged NSR violations at Plant Miller. The consent decree required Alabama Power to pay $100,000
to resolve the government’s claim for a civil penalty and to donate $4.9 million of sulfur dioxide
emission allowances to a nonprofit charitable organization. It also formalized specific emissions
reductions to be accomplished by Alabama Power, consistent with other Clean Air Act programs that
require emissions reductions. In August 2006, the district court in Alabama granted Alabama
Power’s motion for summary judgment and entered final judgment in favor of Alabama Power on the
EPA’s claims related to all of the remaining plants: Plants Barry, Gaston, Gorgas, and Greene
County.

The plaintiffs appealed the district court’s decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh
Circuit, where it was stayed, pending the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in a similar case against
Duke Energy. The Supreme Court issued its decision in the Duke Energy case in April 2007, and in
December 2007, the Eleventh Circuit vacated the district court’s decision in the Alabama Power case
and remanded the case back to the district court for consideration of the legal issues in light of
the Supreme Court’s decision in the Duke Energy case. On July 24, 2008, the U.S. District Court
for the Northern District of Alabama granted partial summary judgment in favor of Alabama Power
regarding the proper legal test for determining whether projects are routine maintenance, repair,
and replacement and therefore are excluded from NSR permitting. The decision did not resolve the
case.

The Company believes that it complied with applicable laws and the EPA regulations and
interpretations in effect at the time the work in question took place. The Clean Air Act
authorizes maximum civil penalties of $25,000 to $37,500 per day, per violation at each generating
unit, depending on the date of the alleged violation. An adverse outcome in this matter could
require substantial capital expenditures or affect the timing of currently budgeted capital
expenditures that cannot be determined at this time and could possibly require payment of
substantial penalties. Such expenditures could affect future results of operations, cash flows,
and financial condition if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates. The ultimate
outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Georgia Power Company 2008 Annual Report

Carbon Dioxide Litigation

New York Case

In July 2004, three environmental groups and attorneys general from eight states, each outside of
Southern Company’s service territory, and the corporation counsel for New York City filed
complaints in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against Southern
Company and four other electric power companies. The complaints allege that the companies’
emissions of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, contribute to global warming, which the plaintiffs
assert is a public nuisance. Under common law public and private nuisance theories, the plaintiffs
seek a judicial order (1) holding each defendant jointly and severally liable for creating,
contributing to, and/or maintaining global warming and (2) requiring each of the defendants to cap
its emissions of carbon dioxide and then reduce those emissions by a specified percentage each year
for at least a decade. The plaintiffs have not, however, requested that damages be awarded in
connection with their claims. Southern Company believes these claims are without merit and notes
that the complaint cites no statutory or regulatory basis for the claims. In September 2005, the
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York granted Southern Company’s and the other
defendants’ motions to dismiss these cases. The plaintiffs filed an appeal to the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit in October 2005, but no decision has been issued. The ultimate
outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Kivalina Case

On February 26, 2008, the Native Village of Kivalina and the City of Kivalina filed a suit in the
U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against several electric utilities
(including Southern Company), several oil companies, and a coal company. The plaintiffs are the
governing bodies of an Inupiat village in Alaska. The plaintiffs contend that the village is being
destroyed by erosion allegedly caused by global warming that the plaintiffs attribute to emissions
of greenhouse gases by the defendants. The plaintiffs assert claims for public and private
nuisance and contend that the defendants have acted in concert and are therefore jointly and
severally liable for the plaintiffs’ damages. The suit seeks damages for lost property values and
for the cost of relocating the village, which is alleged to be $95 million to $400 million. On
June 30, 2008, all defendants filed motions to dismiss this case. Southern Company believes that
these claims are without merit and notes that the complaint cites no statutory or regulatory basis
for the claims. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Environmental Remediation

The Company must comply with environmental laws and regulations that cover the handling and
disposal of waste and releases of hazardous substances. Under these various laws and regulations,
the Company may also incur substantial costs to clean up properties.

Through 2007, the Company recovered environmental costs through its base rates. Beginning in 2005,
such rates included an annual accrual of $5.4 million for environmental remediation. Beginning in
January 2008, the Company is recovering environmental remediation costs through a new base rate
tariff (see “Retail Regulatory Matters — Rate Plans” herein) that includes an annual accrual of
$1.2 million for environmental remediation. Environmental remediation expenditures are charged
against the reserve as they are incurred. The annual accrual amount will be reviewed and adjusted
in future regulatory proceedings. Under Georgia PSC ratemaking provisions, $22 million had
previously been deferred in a regulatory liability account for use in meeting future environmental
remediation costs of the Company and was amortized over a three-year period that ended December 31,
2007. As of December 31, 2008, the balance of the environmental remediation liability was $10.1
million.

The Company has been designated or identified as a potentially responsible party (PRP) at sites
governed by the Georgia Hazardous Site Response Act and/or by the federal Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), including a large site in
Brunswick, Georgia on the CERCLA National Priorities List (NPL). The parties have completed the
removal of wastes from the Brunswick site as ordered by the EPA. Additional claims for recovery of
natural resource damages at this site or for the assessment and potential cleanup of other sites on
the Georgia Hazardous Sites Inventory and the CERCLA NPL are anticipated. The final outcome of
these matters cannot now be determined. Based on the currently known conditions at these sites and
the nature and extent of activities relating to these sites, management does not believe that
additional liabilities, if any, at these sites would be material to the financial statements.

By letter dated September 30, 2008, the EPA advised the Company that it has been designated as a
PRP at the Ward Transformer Superfund site located in Raleigh, North Carolina. Numerous other
entities have also received notices from the EPA. The Company, along with other named PRPs, will
participate in negotiations with the EPA to address cleanup of the site and reimbursement for the
EPA’s past expenditures related to work performed at the site. The ultimate outcome of this matter
will depend upon further environmental assessment and the ultimate number of PRPs and cannot be
determined at this time; however, it is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s
financial statements.

FERC Matters

Market-Based Rate Authority

The Company has authorization from the FERC to sell power to non-affiliates, including short-term
opportunity sales, at market-based prices. Specific FERC approval must be obtained with respect to
a market-based contract with an affiliate.

In December 2004, the FERC initiated a proceeding to assess Southern Company’s generation dominance
within its retail service territory. The ability to charge market-based rates in other markets is
not an issue in the proceeding. Any new market-based rate sales by the Company in Southern
Company’s retail service territory entered into during a 15-month refund period that ended in May
2006 could be subject to refund to a cost-based rate level.

In November 2007, the presiding administrative law judge issued an initial decision regarding the
methodology to be used in the generation dominance tests. The proceedings are ongoing. The
ultimate outcome of this generation dominance proceeding cannot now be determined, but an adverse
decision by the FERC in a final order could require the Company to charge cost-based rates for
certain wholesale sales in the Southern Company retail service territory, which may be lower than
negotiated market-based rates, and could also result in total refunds of up to $5.8 million, plus
interest. The Company believes that there is no meritorious basis for an adverse decision in this
proceeding and is vigorously defending itself in this matter.

In June 2007, the FERC issued its final rule in Order No. 697 regarding market-based rate
authority. The FERC generally retained its current market-based rate standards. Responding to a
number of requests for rehearing, the FERC issued Order No. 697-A on April 21, 2008 and Order No.
697-B on December 12, 2008. These orders largely affirmed the FERC’s prior revision and
codification of the regulations governing market-based rates for public utilities. In accordance
with the orders, Southern Company submitted to the FERC an updated market power analysis on
September 2, 2008 related to its continued market-based rate authority. The ultimate outcome of
this matter cannot now be determined.

On October 17, 2008, Southern Company filed with the FERC a revised market-based rate (MBR) tariff
and a new cost-based rate (CBR) tariff. The revised MBR tariff provides for a “must offer” energy
auction whereby Southern Company offers all of its available energy for sale in a day-ahead auction
and an hour-ahead auction with reserve prices not to exceed the CBR tariff price, after considering
Southern Company’s native load requirements, reliability obligations, and sales commitments to
third parties. All sales under the energy auction would be at market clearing prices established
under the auction rules. The new CBR tariff provides for a cost-based price for wholesale sales of
less than a year. On December 18, 2008, the FERC issued an order conditionally accepting the MBR
tariff subject to certain revisions to the auction proposal. On January 21, 2009, Southern Company
made a compliance filing that accepted all the conditions of the MBR tariff order. When this order
becomes final, Southern Company will have 30 days to implement the wholesale auction. On December
31, 2008, the FERC issued an order conditionally accepting the CBR tariff subject to providing
additional information concerning one aspect of the tariff. On January 30, 2009, Southern Company
filed a response addressing the FERC inquiry to the CBR tariff order. Implementation of the energy
auction in accordance with the MBR tariff order is expected to adequately mitigate going forward
any presumption of market power that Southern Company may have in the Southern Company retail
service territory. The timing of when the FERC may issue the final orders on the MBR and CBR
tariffs and the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Intercompany Interchange Contract

The Company’s generation fleet is operated under the Intercompany Interchange Contract (IIC), as
approved by the FERC. In May 2005, the FERC initiated a new proceeding to examine (1) the
provisions of the IIC among the traditional operating companies (including the Company), Southern
Power, and SCS, as agent, under the terms of which the power pool of Southern Company is operated,
(2) whether any parties to the IIC have violated the FERC’s standards of conduct applicable to
utility companies that are transmission providers, and (3) whether Southern Company’s code of
conduct defining Southern Power as a “system company” rather than a “marketing affiliate” is just
and reasonable. In connection with the formation of Southern Power, the FERC authorized Southern
Power’s inclusion in the IIC in 2000. The FERC also previously approved Southern Company’s code of
conduct.

In October 2006, the FERC issued an order accepting a settlement resolving the proceeding subject
to Southern Company’s agreement to accept certain modifications to the settlement’s terms and
Southern Company notified the FERC that it accepted the modifications. The modifications largely
involve functional separation and information restrictions related to marketing activities
conducted on behalf of Southern Power. In November 2006, Southern Company filed with the FERC a
compliance plan in connection with the

II-221


NOTES (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2008 Annual Report

order. In April 2007, the FERC approved, with certain modifications, the plan submitted by
Southern Company. Implementation of the plan did not have a material impact on the Company’s
financial statements. In November 2007, Southern Company notified the FERC that the plan had been
implemented. On December 12, 2008 the FERC division of audits issued for public comment its final
audit report pertaining to compliance implementation and related matters. No comments challenging
the audit report’s findings were submitted. A decision is now pending from the FERC.

Generation Interconnection Agreements

In November 2004, generator company subsidiaries of Tenaska, Inc. (Tenaska), as counterparties to
three previously executed interconnection agreements with subsidiaries of Southern Company,
including the Company, filed complaints at the FERC requesting that the FERC modify the agreements
and that the Company refund a total of $7.9 million previously paid for interconnection facilities.
No other similar complaints are pending with the FERC.

In January 2007, the FERC issued an order granting Tenaska’s requested relief. Although the FERC’s
order required the modification of Tenaska’s interconnection agreements, under the provisions of
the order the Company determined that no refund was payable to Tenaska. The Company requested
rehearing asserting that the FERC retroactively applied a new principle to existing interconnection
agreements. Tenaska requested rehearing of FERC’s methodology for determining the amount of
refunds. The requested rehearings were denied and the Company and Tenaska have appealed the orders
to the U.S. Circuit Court for the District of Columbia. The final outcome of this matter cannot
now be determined.

Income Tax Matters

The Company’s 2005 through 2008 income tax filings for the State of Georgia included state income
tax credits for increased activity through Georgia ports. The Company has also filed similar
claims for the years 2002 through 2004. The Georgia Department of Revenue has not responded to
these claims. In July 2007, the Company filed a complaint in the Superior Court of Fulton County
to recover the credits claimed for the years 2002 through 2004. If the Company prevails, these
claims could have a significant, and possibly material, positive effect on the Company’s net
income. If the Company is not successful, payment of the related state tax could have a
significant, and possibly material, negative effect on the Company’s cash flow. The ultimate
outcome of this matter cannot now be determined. See Note 5 under “Unrecognized Tax Benefits” for
additional information.

Retail Regulatory Matters

Merger

Effective July 1, 2006, Savannah Electric, which was also a wholly owned subsidiary of Southern
Company, was merged into the Company. The Company has accounted for the merger in a manner similar
to a pooling of interests, and the Company’s financial statements included herein now reflect the
merger as though it had occurred on January 1, 2006.

Rate Plans

In December 2007, the Georgia PSC approved the 2007 Retail Rate Plan for the years 2008 through
2010. Retail base rates increased by approximately $99.7 million effective January 1, 2008 to
provide for cost recovery of transmission, distribution, generation, and other investment, as well
as increased operating costs. In addition, the new ECCR tariff was implemented to recover costs
incurred for environmental projects required by state and federal regulations. The ECCR tariff
increased rates by approximately $222 million effective January 1, 2008. Under the 2007 Retail
Rate Plan, the Company’s earnings will continue to be evaluated against a retail return on equity
(ROE) range of 10.25% to 12.25%. Two thirds of any earnings above 12.25% will be applied to rate
refunds with the remaining one-third applied to the ECCR tariff. The Company agreed that it will
not file for a general base rate increase during this period unless its projected retail ROE falls
below 10.25%. There were no refunds related to earnings for the year 2008.

In December 2004, the Georgia PSC approved the 2004 Retail Rate Plan for the Company. Under the
terms of the 2004 Retail Rate Plan, the Company’s earnings were evaluated against a retail ROE
range of 10.25% to 12.25%. Two-thirds of any earnings above 12.25% were applied to rate refunds,
with the remaining one-third retained by the Company. Retail rates and customer fees increased by
approximately $203 million effective January 1, 2005 to cover the higher costs of purchased power,
operating and maintenance expenses, environmental compliance, and continued investment in new
generation, transmission, and distribution facilities to support growth and ensure reliability. In
2007, the Company refunded 2005 earnings above 12.25% retail ROE. There were no refunds related to
earnings for the years 2006 and 2007.

II-222


NOTES (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2008 Annual Report

The Company is required to file a general rate case by July 1, 2010, in response to which the
Georgia PSC would be expected to determine whether the 2007 Retail Rate Plan should be continued,
modified, or discontinued.

Fuel Cost Recovery

The Company has established fuel cost recovery rates approved by the Georgia PSC. In June 2006,
the Georgia PSC approved an increase in the Company’s total annual billings of approximately
$400 million.

In February 2007, the Georgia PSC approved an increase in the Company’s total annual billings of
approximately $383 million effective March 1, 2007. On May 20, 2008, the Georgia PSC approved an
additional increase of approximately $222 million effective June 1, 2008. In compliance with the
order, the Company is required to file a new fuel cost recovery rate by March 1, 2009. On February
19, 2009, the Georgia PSC approved the Company’s request to delay the filing of that case until
March 13, 2009. The new rates are expected to become effective on June 1, 2009. As of
December 31, 2008, the Company had a total under recovered fuel cost balance of approximately
$764.4 million, of which approximately $223.9 million is not included in current rates.

Fuel cost recovery revenues as recorded on the financial statements are adjusted for differences in
actual recoverable costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates. Accordingly, a change in
the billing factor has no significant effect on the Company’s revenues or net income, but does
impact annual cash flow. Approximately $425.6 million of the under recovered regulatory clause
revenues for the Company is included in deferred charges and other assets at December 31, 2008.

Fuel Hedging Program

The Georgia PSC has approved a natural gas, oil procurement, and hedging program that allows the
Company to use financial instruments to hedge price and commodity risk associated with these fuels,
subject to certain limits in terms of time, volume, dollars, and physical amounts hedged. The
costs of the program, including any net losses, are recovered as a fuel cost through the fuel cost
recovery clause. Annual net financial gains from the hedging program, through June 30, 2006, were
shared with the retail customers receiving 75% and the Company retaining 25% of the total net
gains. Effective July 1, 2006, the profit sharing framework related to the fuel hedging program
was terminated. The Company realized net losses in 2008, 2007, and 2006 of $1.9 million, $68
million, and $66 million, respectively.

Nuclear Construction

In August 2006, Southern Nuclear, on behalf of the Company, Oglethorpe Power Corporation (OPC), the
Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia (MEAG), and the City of Dalton, Georgia (Dalton)
(collectively, Owners), filed an application with the NRC for an early site permit relating to two
additional nuclear units on the site of Plant Vogtle. See Note 4 for additional information on
these co-owners. On March 31, 2008, Southern Nuclear filed an application with the NRC for a COL
for the new units.

On April 8, 2008, the Company, acting for itself and as agent for the Owners, and a consortium
consisting of Westinghouse Electric Company LLC and Stone & Webster, Inc. (collectively,
Consortium) entered into an engineering, procurement, and construction agreement to design,
engineer, procure, construct, and test two AP1000 nuclear units with electric generating capacity
of approximately 1,100 megawatts each and related facilities, structures, and improvements at Plant
Vogtle (Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement).

The Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement is an arrangement whereby the Consortium supplies and constructs the
entire facility with the exception of certain items provided by the Owners. Under the terms of the
Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement, the Owners will pay a purchase price that will be subject to certain
price escalation and adjustments, adjustments for change orders, and performance bonuses. Each
Owner is severally (and not jointly) liable for its proportionate share, based on its ownership
interest, of all amounts owed to the Consortium under the Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement. The Company’s
proportionate share, based on its current ownership interest, is 45.7%. Under the terms of a
separate joint development agreement, the Owners finalized their ownership percentages on July 2,
2008, except for allowed changes, under certain limited circumstances, during the Georgia PSC
certification process.

On August 1, 2008, the Company submitted an application for the Georgia PSC to certify the project.
Hearings began November 3, 2008 and a final certification decision is expected in March 2009.

II-223


NOTES (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2008 Annual Report

If certified by the Georgia PSC and licensed by the NRC, Vogtle Units 3 and 4 are scheduled to be
placed in service in 2016 and 2017, respectively. The total plant value to be placed in service
will also include financing costs for each of the Owners, the impacts of inflation on costs, and
transmission and other costs that are the responsibility of the Owners. The Company’s
proportionate share of the estimated in-service costs, based on its current ownership interest, is
approximately $6.4 billion, subject to adjustments and performance bonuses under the Vogtle 3 and 4
Agreement. In June 2006, the Georgia PSC approved the Company’s request to defer for future
recovery early site permit and COL costs, of which the Company’s portion is estimated to total
approximately $53 million. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, approximately $49.0 million and $28.4
million, respectively, were included in deferred charges and other assets. Such costs will be
included in construction work in progress if the project is certified by the Georgia PSC.

The Owners and the Consortium have agreed to certain liquidated damages upon the Consortium’s
failure to comply with the schedule and performance guarantees. The Owners and the Consortium also
have agreed to certain bonuses payable to the Consortium for early completion and unit performance.
The Consortium’s liability to the Owners for schedule and performance liquidated damages and
warranty claims is subject to a cap.

The obligations of Westinghouse Electric Company LLC and Stone & Webster, Inc. under the Vogtle 3
and 4 Agreement are guaranteed by Toshiba Corporation and The Shaw Group, Inc., respectively. In
the event of certain credit rating downgrades of any Owner, such Owner will be required to provide
a letter of credit or other credit enhancement.

The Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement is subject to certification by the Georgia PSC. In addition, the
Owners may terminate the Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement at any time for their convenience, provided that
the Owners will be required to pay certain termination costs and, at certain stages of the work,
cancellation fees to the Consortium. The Consortium may terminate the Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement
under certain circumstances, including delays in receipt of the COL or delivery of full notice to
proceed, certain Owner suspension or delays of work, action by a governmental authority to
permanently stop work, certain breaches of the Vogtle 3 and 4 Agreement by the Owners, Owner
insolvency, and certain other events.

Nuclear Fuel Disposal Costs

The Company has contracts with the United States, acting through the U.S. Department of Energy
(DOE), which provide for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel. The DOE failed to begin
disposing of spent nuclear fuel in 1998 as required by the contracts, and the Company is pursuing
legal remedies against the government for breach of contract.

In July 2007, the U.S. Court of Federal Claims awarded the Company approximately $30 million, based
on its ownership interests, representing substantially all of the direct costs of the expansion of
spent nuclear fuel storage facilities at Plants Hatch and Vogtle from 1998 through 2004. In July
2007, the government filed a motion for reconsideration, which was denied in November 2007. On
January 2, 2008, the government filed an appeal, and on February 29, 2008, filed a motion to stay
the appeal. On April 1, 2008, the court granted the government’s motion to stay the appeal pending
the court’s decisions in three other similar cases already on appeal. Those cases were decided in
August 2008. Based on the rulings in those cases, the appeal is expected to proceed in first
quarter 2009.

On April 3, 2008, a second claim against the government was filed for damages incurred after
December 31, 2004 (the court-mandated cut-off in the original claim), due to the government’s
alleged continuing breach of contract. On October 31, 2008, the court denied a similar request by
the government to stay this proceeding. The complaint does not contain any specific dollar amount
for recovery of damages. Damages will continue to accumulate until the issue is resolved or the
storage is provided. No amounts have been recognized in the financial statements as of December
31, 2008 for either claim. The final outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time,
but no material impact on net income is expected as any damage amounts collected from the
government are expected to be returned to customers.

Sufficient pool storage capacity for spent fuel is available at Plant Vogtle to maintain full-core
discharge capability for both units into 2014. Expanded wet storage capacity and construction of
an on-site dry storage facility at Plant Vogtle is expected to begin in sufficient time to maintain
pool full-core discharge capability. At Plant Hatch, an on-site dry storage facility is
operational and can be expanded to accommodate spent fuel through the expected life of the plant.

5. INCOME TAXES

Southern Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and combined income tax returns for
the States of Alabama, Georgia, and Mississippi. Under a joint consolidated income tax allocation
agreement, each subsidiary’s current and deferred tax expense is computed on a stand-alone basis
and no subsidiary is allocated more expense than would be paid if it filed a separate income tax
return. In accordance with IRS regulations, each company is jointly and severally liable for the
tax liability.

Current and Deferred Income Taxes

The transfer of the Plant McIntosh construction project from Southern Power to the Company in 2005
resulted in a deferred gain to Southern Power for federal income tax purposes. The Company is
reimbursing Southern Power for the remaining balance of the related deferred taxes of $4.6 million
as it is reflected in Southern Power’s future taxable income. Of this amount, $3.8 million is
included in Other Deferred Credits and $0.8 million is included in Affiliated Accounts Payable in
the balance sheets at December 31, 2008.

The transfer of the Dahlberg, Wansley, and Franklin projects to Southern Power from the Company in
2001 and 2002 also resulted in a deferred gain for federal income tax purposes. Southern Power is
reimbursing the Company for the remaining balance of the related deferred taxes of $8.3 million as
it is reflected in the Company’s future taxable income. Of this amount, $6.7 million is included
in Other Deferred Debits and $1.6 million is included in Affiliated Accounts Receivable in the
balance sheets at December 31, 2008.

At December 31, 2008, tax-related regulatory assets were $573 million and tax-related regulatory
liabilities were $141 million. The assets are attributable to tax benefits flowed through to
customers in prior years and to taxes applicable to capitalized interest. The liabilities are
attributable to deferred taxes previously recognized at rates higher than current enacted tax law
and to unamortized investment tax credits. In accordance with regulatory requirements, deferred
investment tax credits are amortized over the life of the related property with such amortization
normally applied as a credit to reduce depreciation in the statements of income. Credits amortized
in this manner amounted to $13.0 million annually in 2008, 2007, and 2006. At December 31, 2008,
all investment tax credits available to reduce federal income taxes payable had been utilized.

The increase in 2008’s effective tax rate is primarily the result of a decrease in donations for
2008 as a result of the significant Tallulah Gorge land donation in 2007 combined with an increase
in non-taxable AFUDC equity.

In 2007, the Company donated 2,200 acres of land in the Tallulah Gorge State Park to the State of
Georgia. The estimated value of this donation along with an increase in non-taxable AFUDC equity
and available state tax credits as well as higher federal tax deductions caused a lower effective
income tax rate for the year ended 2007, when compared to prior years. For additional information
regarding litigation related to state tax credits, see Note 3 under “Income Tax Matters.”

The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 created a tax deduction for a portion of income attributable
to U.S. production activities as defined in Internal Revenue Code Section 199 (production
activities deduction). The deduction is equal to a stated percentage of qualified production
activities net income. The percentage is phased in over the years 2005 through 2010 with a 3% rate
applicable to the years 2005 and 2006, a 6% rate applicable for years 2007 through 2009, and a 9%
rate thereafter. This increase from 3% in 2006 to 6% in 2007 was one of several factors that
increased the Company’s 2007 deduction by $18.6 million over the 2006 deduction. The resulting
additional tax benefit was $6.5 million. The IRS has not clearly defined a methodology for
calculating this deduction. However, the Company has agreed with the IRS on a calculation
methodology and signed a closing agreement on December 11, 2008. Therefore, the Company reversed
the unrecognized tax benefit and adjusted the deduction for all previous years to conform to the
agreement which resulted in a decrease in the 2008 deduction when compared to the 2007 deduction.
The net impact of the reversal of the unrecognized tax benefits combined with the application of
the new methodology had no material effect on the Company’s financial statements.

Unrecognized Tax Benefits

FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes” requires companies to
determine whether it is “more likely than not” that a tax position will be sustained upon
examination by the appropriate taxing authorities before any part of the benefit can be recorded in
the financial statements. It also provides guidance on the recognition, measurement, and
classification of income tax uncertainties, along with any related interest and penalties. For
2008, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits increased by $47.9 million, resulting in a
balance of $137.1 million as of December 31, 2008.

Changes during the year in unrecognized tax benefits were as follows:

The Company classifies interest on tax uncertainties as interest expense. Net interest accrued for
the year ended December 31, 2008 was $6.5 million. The Company did not accrue any penalties on
uncertain tax positions.

The IRS has audited and closed all tax returns prior to 2004. The audits for the state returns
have either been concluded, or the statute of limitations has expired, for years prior to 2002.

Substantially all of the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits impacting the effective tax rate are
associated with the state income tax credits discussed in Note 3 under “Income Tax Matters.”
Settlement of this litigation could occur within the next 12 months, which would reduce the balance
of the uncertain tax position by these amounts.

6. FINANCING

Long-Term Debt Payable to Affiliated Trusts

The Company has formed certain wholly owned trust subsidiaries for the purpose of issuing preferred
securities. The proceeds of the related equity investments and preferred security sales were
loaned back to the Company through the issuance of junior subordinated notes totaling $206 million,
which constitute substantially all of the assets of these trusts and are reflected in the balance
sheets as “Long-term Debt.” The Company considers that the mechanisms and obligations relating to
the preferred securities issued for its benefit, taken together, constitute a full and
unconditional guarantee by it of the respective trusts’ payment obligations with respect to these
securities. At December 31, 2008, preferred securities of $200 million were outstanding. See
Note 1 under “Variable Interest Entities” for additional information on the accounting treatment
for these trusts and the related securities.

in 2013.

Pollution Control Revenue Bonds

Pollution control obligations represent loans to the Company from public authorities of funds
derived from sales by such authorities of revenue bonds issued to finance pollution control
facilities. The Company is required to make payments sufficient for the authorities to meet
principal and interest requirements of such bonds. The Company has incurred obligations in
connection with the sale by public authorities of tax-exempt pollution control revenue bonds. The
amount of tax-exempt pollution control revenue bonds outstanding at December 31, 2008 was $1.9
billion. Proceeds from certain issuances are restricted until the expenditures are incurred.

Senior Notes

The Company issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes in 2008. The
proceeds of the issuance were used to repay a portion of the Company’s short term indebtedness,
fund note maturities, and fund the Company’s continuous construction program. At December 31, 2008
and 2007, the Company had $4.8 billion and $4.0 billion of senior notes outstanding, respectively.
These senior notes are effectively subordinated to all secured debt of the Company, which
aggregated $68 million at December 31, 2008. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, the Company issued
$500 million of Series 2009A 5.95% Senior Notes due February 2039. The proceeds from the sale of
the Series 2009A Senior Notes were used by the Company to repay at maturity $150 million aggregate
principal amount of the Company’s Series U Floating Rate Senior Notes, to repay a portion of its
outstanding short-term indebtedness, and for general corporate purposes.

Bank Term Loans

During 2008, the Company borrowed $300 million under a three-year term loan agreement and $100
million under a short-term loan agreement. The proceeds of these issuances were used for general
corporate purposes, including the Company’s continuous construction program.

Capital Leases

Assets acquired under capital leases are recorded in the balance sheets as utility plant in
service, and the related obligations are classified as long-term debt. At December 31, 2008 and
2007, the Company had a capitalized lease obligation for its corporate headquarters building of $66
million and $69 million, respectively, with an interest rate of 8.0%. For ratemaking purposes, the
Georgia PSC has treated the lease as an operating lease and has allowed only the lease payments in
cost of service. The difference between the accrued expense and the lease payments allowed for
ratemaking purposes has been deferred and is being amortized to expense as ordered by the Georgia
PSC. See Note 1 under “Regulatory Assets and Liabilities.” At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the
Company had capitalized lease obligations of $0.8 million and $1.9 million, respectively, for its
vehicles. However, for ratemaking purposes, these obligations are treated as operating leases and,
as such, lease payments are charged to expense as incurred. The annual expense incurred for these
leases in 2008, 2007, and 2006 was $9.7 million, $9.2 million, and $9.6 million, respectively.

Outstanding Classes of Capital Stock

The Company currently has preferred stock, Class A preferred stock, preference stock, and common
stock authorized. The Company has shares of its Class A preferred stock, preference stock, and
common stock outstanding. The Company’s Class A preferred stock ranks senior to the Company’s
preference stock and common stock with respect to payment of dividends and voluntary or involuntary

dissolution. The Company’s preference stock ranks senior to the common stock with respect to the
payment of dividends and voluntary or involuntary dissolution. Certain series of the Class A
preferred stock and preference stock are subject to redemption at the option of the Company on or
after a specified date (typically 5 or 10 years after the date of issuance) at a redemption price
equal to 100% of the liquidation amount of the stock. In addition, the Company may redeem the
outstanding series of the preference stock at a redemption price equal to 100% of the liquidation
amount plus a make-whole premium based on the present value of the liquidation amount and future
dividends.

Dividend Restrictions

The Company can only pay dividends to Southern Company out of retained earnings or paid-in-capital.

Bank Credit Arrangements

At December 31, 2008, the Company had credit arrangements with banks totaling $1.3 billion, of
which $12 million was used to support outstanding letters of credit. Of these facilities,
$225 million expire during 2009, with the remaining $1.1 billion expiring in 2012. $40 million of
the facilities that expire in 2009 provides the option of converting borrowings into a two-year
term loan. The Company expects to renew its facilities, as needed, prior to expiration. The
agreements contain stated borrowing rates. All the agreements require payment of commitment fees
based on the unused portion of the commitments or the maintenance of compensating balances with the
banks. Commitment fees average less than 1/8 of 1% for the Company. Compensating balances are not
legally restricted from withdrawal.

The credit arrangements contain covenants that limit the ratio of indebtedness to capitalization
(each as defined in the arrangements) to 65%. For purposes of these definitions, indebtedness
excludes the long-term debt payable to affiliated trusts and, in certain cases, other hybrid
securities. In addition, the credit arrangements contain cross default provisions that would
trigger an event of default if the Company defaulted on other indebtedness above a specified
threshold. At December 31, 2008, the Company was in compliance with all such covenants. None of
the arrangements contain material adverse change clauses at the time of borrowings.

The $1.3 billion of unused credit arrangements provides liquidity support to the Company’s variable
rate pollution control revenue bonds and its commercial paper borrowings. The amount of variable
rate pollution control revenue bonds outstanding requiring liquidity support as of December 31,
2008 was $636 million. In addition, the Company borrows under a commercial paper program. The
amount of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006 was $256 million,
$616 million, and $733 million, respectively. The Company also had $100 million of short-term bank
loans outstanding at December 31, 2008. Commercial paper and short-term bank loans are included in
notes payable on the balance sheets.

During 2008, the peak amount of short-term debt outstanding was $908 million and the average amount
outstanding was $460 million. The average annual interest rate on short-term debt in 2008 was
2.9%.

Financial Instruments

The Company enters into energy-related derivatives to hedge exposures to electricity, gas, and
other fuel price changes. However, due to cost-based rate regulations, the Company has limited
exposure to market volatility in commodity fuel prices and prices of electricity. The Company
manages a fuel-hedging program as discussed in Note 3 under “Retail Regulatory Matters – Fuel
Hedging Program.” The Company also enters into hedges of forward electricity sales. At
December 31, 2008, the Company had a net $113 million fair value liability of energy-related
derivative contracts designated as regulatory hedges in the financial statements. The gains and
losses arising from these regulatory hedges are initially recorded as regulatory liabilities and
assets, respectively, and then are included in fuel expense as they are recovered through the fuel
cost recovery mechanism. There was no material ineffectiveness related to energy related
derivatives recorded in earnings for any period presented. The Company has energy-related hedges
in place up to and including 2012.

The Company also enters into derivatives to hedge exposure to changes in interest rates.
Derivatives related to existing variable rate securities or forecasted transactions are accounted
for as cash flow hedges. The derivatives employed as hedging instruments are structured to
minimize ineffectiveness. As such, no material ineffectiveness has been recorded in earnings for
any period presented.

The fair value gains or losses for cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income and
are reclassified into earnings at the same time the hedged items affect earnings. In 2008, 2007,
and 2006, the Company settled gains/(losses) totaling approximately $(20) million, $12 million, and
$(4) million, respectively, upon termination of certain interest derivatives at the same time it
issued debt. The effective portion of these gains/(losses) have been deferred in other
comprehensive income and will be amortized to interest expense over the life of the original
interest derivative. In 2008, the Company also settled an interest derivative early because of
counterparty credit issues at a loss of approximately $(2) million. This loss is deferred in other
comprehensive income and will be amortized into earnings once the forecasted debt is issued in
2009. Amounts reclassified from other comprehensive income to interest expense were immaterial for
all periods presented. For 2009, pre-tax losses of approximately $(14) million are expected to be
reclassified from other comprehensive income to interest expense. The Company has interest-related
hedges in place through 2019 and has deferred realized gains/(losses) that are being amortized
through 2037.

Subsequent to December 31, 2008, the Company settled $100 million of hedges related to the
forecasted debt issuance in February 2009 at a loss of approximately $16 million. This loss will
be amortized into earnings over 10 years.

All derivative financials instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are
measured at fair value. See Note 10 for additional information.

7. COMMITMENTS

Construction Program

The Company currently estimates property additions to be approximately $2.8 billion, $2.6 billion,
and $2.6 billion in 2009, 2010, and 2011, respectively. This estimate assumes the Company’s
current request to include construction work in progress for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in rates is
granted by regulators, beginning in 2011. If not, the estimate will increase by approximately $144
million in 2011. These amounts include $139 million, $114 million, and $105 million in 2009, 2010,
and 2011, respectively, for construction expenditures related to contractual purchase commitments
for nuclear fuel included under “Fuel Commitments.” The construction programs are subject to
periodic review and revision, and actual construction costs may vary from these estimates because
of numerous factors. These factors include: changes in business conditions; revised load growth
estimates; changes in environmental statutes and regulations; changes in nuclear plants to meet new
regulatory requirements; changes in FERC rules and regulations; Georgia PSC approvals; changes in
legislation; the cost and efficiency of construction labor, equipment, and materials; and the cost
of capital. In addition, there can be no assurance that costs related to capital expenditures will
be fully recovered. At December 31, 2008, significant purchase commitments were outstanding in
connection with the construction program.

Long-Term Service Agreements

The Company has entered into a Long-Term Service Agreement (LTSA) with General Electric (GE) for
the purpose of securing maintenance support for the combustion turbines at the Plant McIntosh
combined cycle facility. In summary, the LTSA stipulates that

II-232


NOTES (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2008 Annual Report

GE will perform all planned inspections on the covered equipment, which includes the cost of all
labor and materials. GE is also obligated to cover the costs of unplanned maintenance on the
covered equipment subject to a limit specified in the contract.

In general, this LTSA is in effect through two major inspection cycles per unit. Scheduled
payments to GE, which are subject to price escalation, are made quarterly based on actual operating
hours of the respective units. Total payments to GE under this agreement are currently estimated
at $183 million over the remaining term of the agreement, which is currently projected to be
approximately 10 years. However, the LTSA contains various cancellation provisions at the option
of the Company.

The Company has also entered into an LTSA with GE through 2014 for neutron monitoring system parts
and electronics at Plant Hatch. Total remaining payments to GE under this agreement are currently
estimated at $9.8 million. The contract contains cancellation provisions at the option of the
Company. Payments made to GE prior to the performance of any work are recorded as a prepayment in
the balance sheets. Work performed by GE is capitalized or charged to expense as appropriate net
of any joint owner billings, based on the nature of the work.

The Company has entered into a LTSA with Mitsubishi Power Systems Americas, Inc. (MPS) for the
purpose of providing certain parts and maintenance services for the three combined cycle units
under construction at Plant McDonough, which are scheduled to go into service in February 2011,
June 2011, and June 2012, respectively. The LTSA stipulates that MPS will perform all planned
maintenance on each covered unit which includes the cost of all materials and services. MPS is
also obligated to cover costs of unplanned maintenance on the gas turbines subject to limits
specified in the LTSA. This LTSA will begin in 2011 and is in effect through two major inspection
cycles per covered unit. Periodic payments to MPS are to be made quarterly and will also be made
based on the scheduled inspections for the respective covered units. Payments to MPS under this
agreement, which are subject to price escalation, are currently estimated to be $536.8 million for
the term of the agreement which is expected to be between 12 and 13 years. However, the LTSA
contains various termination provisions at the option of the Company.

Limestone Commitments

As part of the Company’s program to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions from its coal plants, the
Company has begun construction of flue gas desulfurization projects and has entered into various
long-term commitments for the procurement of limestone to be used in such equipment. Limestone
contracts are structured with tonnage minimums and maximums in order to account for fluctuations in
coal burn and sulfur content. The Company has a minimum contractual obligation of 3.6 million
tons, equating to approximately $111.7 million through 2019. Estimated expenditures (based on
minimum contracted obligated dollars) over the next five years are $10.3 million in 2009, $19.3
million in 2010, $14.9 million in 2011, $15.3 million in 2012, and $15.7 million in 2013.

Fuel Commitments

To supply a portion of the fuel requirements of its generating plants, the Company has entered into
various long-term commitments for the procurement of fossil and nuclear fuel. In most cases, these
contracts contain provisions for price escalations, minimum purchase levels, and other financial
commitments. Coal commitments include forward contract purchases for sulfur dioxide emission
allowances. Natural gas purchase commitments contain fixed volumes with prices based on various
indices at the time of delivery; amounts included in the chart below represent estimates based on
New York Mercantile Exchange future prices at December 31, 2008.

Total estimated minimum long-term obligations at December 31, 2008 were as follows:

NOTES (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2008 Annual Report

SCS may enter into various types of wholesale energy and natural gas contracts acting as an agent
for the Company and all of the other Southern Company traditional operating companies and Southern
Power. Under these agreements, each of the traditional operating companies and Southern Power may
be jointly and severally liable. The creditworthiness of Southern Power is currently inferior to
the creditworthiness of the traditional operating companies. Accordingly, Southern Company has
entered into keep-well agreements with the Company and each of the other traditional operating
companies to ensure they will not subsidize or be responsible for any costs, losses, liabilities,
or damages resulting from the inclusion of Southern Power as a contracting party under these
agreements.

Purchased Power Commitments

The Company has commitments regarding a portion of a 5% interest in Plant Vogtle owned by MEAG that
are in effect until the latter of the retirement of the plant or the latest stated maturity date of
MEAG’s bonds issued to finance such ownership interest. The payments for capacity are required
whether or not any capacity is available. The energy cost is a function of each unit’s variable
operating costs. Portions of the capacity payments relate to costs in excess of Plant Vogtle’s
allowed investment for ratemaking purposes. The present value of these portions at the time of the
disallowance was written off. Generally, the cost of such capacity and energy is included in
purchased power from non-affiliates in the statements of income. Capacity payments totaled $48
million, $46 million, and $49 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. The Company also has
entered into other various long-term PPAs. Estimated total long-term obligations under these
commitments at December 31, 2008 were as follows:

the Company’s option, the Company may either exercise its purchase option or the property can be
sold to

a third party. The Company expects that the fair market value of the leased property would
substantially reduce or eliminate the Company’s payments under the residual value obligation. A
portion of the rail car lease obligations is shared with the joint owners of Plants Scherer and
Wansley. A majority of the rental expenses related to the rail car leases are fully recoverable
through the fuel cost recovery clause as ordered by the Georgia PSC and the remaining portion is
recovered through base rates.

Guarantees

Alabama Power has guaranteed unconditionally the obligation of SEGCO under an installment sale
agreement for the purchase of certain pollution control facilities at SEGCO’s generating units,
pursuant to which $24.5 million principal amount of pollution control revenue bonds are
outstanding. Alabama Power has also guaranteed $50 million in senior notes issued by SEGCO. The
Company has agreed to reimburse Alabama Power for the pro rata portion of such obligations
corresponding to the Company’s then proportionate ownership of stock of SEGCO if Alabama Power is
called upon to make such payment under its guaranty.

As discussed earlier in this Note under “Operating Leases,” the Company has entered into certain
residual value guarantees related to rail car leases.

8. STOCK OPTION PLAN

Southern Company provides non-qualified stock options to a large segment of the Company’s employees
ranging from line management to executives. As of December 31, 2008, there were 1,744 current and
former employees of the Company participating in the stock option plan, and there were 33.2 million
shares of Southern Company common stock remaining available for awards under this plan. The prices
of options granted to date have been at the fair market value of the shares on the dates of grant.
Options granted to date become exercisable pro rata over a maximum period of three years from the
date of grant. The Company generally recognizes stock option expense on a straight-line basis over
the vesting period which equates to the requisite service period; however, for employees who are
eligible for retirement the total cost is expensed at the grant date. Options outstanding will
expire no later than 10 years after the date of grant, unless terminated earlier by the Southern
Company Board of Directors in accordance with the stock option plan. For certain stock option
awards, a change in control will provide accelerated vesting.

The estimated fair values of stock options granted in 2008, 2007, and 2006 were derived using the
Black-Scholes stock option pricing model. Expected volatility was based on historical volatility
of Southern Company’s stock over a period equal to the expected term. The Company used historical
exercise data to estimate the expected term that represents the period of time that options granted
to employees are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rate was based on the U.S. Treasury
yield curve in effect at the time of grant that covers the expected term of the stock options. The
following table shows the assumptions used in the pricing model and the weighted average grant-date
fair value of stock options granted:

The number of stock options vested, and expected to vest in the future, as of December 31, 2008 was
not significantly different from the number of stock options outstanding at December 31, 2008 as
stated above. At December 31, 2008, the weighted average remaining contractual term for the
options outstanding and options exercisable was 6.2 years and 5.0 years, respectively, and the
aggregate intrinsic value for the options outstanding and options exercisable was $40.8 million and
$37.3 million, respectively.

As of December 31, 2008, there was $1.5 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to
stock option awards not yet vested. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average
period of approximately 10 months.

For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, total compensation cost for stock option
awards recognized in income was $4.2 million, $6.0 million, and $5.8 million, respectively, with
the related tax benefit also recognized in income of $1.6 million, $2.3 million, and $2.0 million,
respectively.

The compensation cost and tax benefits related to the grant and exercise of Southern Company stock
options to the Company’s employees are recognized in the Company’s financial statements with a
corresponding credit to equity, representing a capital contribution from Southern Company.

The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and
2006 was $10.6 million, $17.4 million, and $10.3 million, respectively. The actual tax benefit
realized by the Company for the tax deductions from stock option exercises totaled $4.1 million,
$6.7 million, and $4.0 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and
2006.

9. NUCLEAR INSURANCE

Under the Price-Anderson Amendments Act (Act), the Company maintains agreements of indemnity with
the NRC that, together with private insurance, cover third-party liability arising from any nuclear
incident occurring at the Company’s Plants Hatch and Vogtle. The Act provides funds up to $12.5
billion for public liability claims that could arise from a single nuclear incident. Each nuclear
plant is insured against this liability to a maximum of $300 million by American Nuclear Insurers
(ANI), with the remaining coverage provided by a mandatory program of deferred premiums that could
be assessed, after a nuclear incident, against all owners of commercial nuclear reactors. The
Company could be assessed up to $117.5 million per incident for each licensed reactor it operates
but not more than an aggregate of $17.5 million per incident to be paid in a calendar year for each
reactor. Such maximum assessment, excluding any applicable state premium taxes, for the Company,
based on its ownership and buyback interests, is $237 million, per incident, but not more than an
aggregate of $35 million to be paid for each incident in any one year. Both the maximum assessment
per reactor and the maximum yearly assessment are adjusted for inflation at least every five years.
The next scheduled adjustment is due no later than October 29, 2013.

The Company is a member of Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL), a mutual insurer established
to provide property damage insurance in an amount up to $500 million for members’ nuclear
generating facilities.

Additionally, the Company has policies that currently provide decontamination, excess property
insurance, and premature decommissioning coverage up to $2.25 billion for losses in excess of the
$500 million primary coverage. This excess insurance is also provided by NEIL.

NEIL also covers the additional costs that would be incurred in obtaining replacement power during
a prolonged accidental outage at a member’s nuclear plant. Members can purchase this coverage,
subject to a deductible waiting period of up to 26 weeks, with a maximum per occurrence per unit
limit of $490 million. After the deductible period, weekly indemnity payments would be received
until either the unit is operational or until the limit is exhausted in approximately three years.
The Company purchases the maximum limit allowed by NEIL, subject to ownership limitations. Each
facility has elected a 12-week waiting period.

Under each of the NEIL policies, members are subject to assessments if losses each year exceed the
accumulated funds available to the insurer under that policy. The current maximum annual
assessments for the Company under the NEIL policies would be $51 million.

Claims resulting from terrorist acts are covered under both the ANI and NEIL policies (subject to
normal policy limits). The aggregate, however, that NEIL will pay for all claims resulting from
terrorist acts in any 12-month period is $3.2 billion plus such additional amounts NEIL can recover
through reinsurance, indemnity, or other sources.

NOTES (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2008 Annual Report

For all on-site property damage insurance policies for commercial nuclear power plants, the NRC
requires that the proceeds of such policies shall be dedicated first for the sole purpose of
placing the reactor in a safe and stable condition after an accident. Any remaining proceeds are
to be applied next toward the costs of decontamination and debris removal operations ordered by the
NRC, and any further remaining proceeds are to be paid either to the Company or to its bond
trustees as may be appropriate under the policies and applicable trust indentures.

All retrospective assessments, whether generated for liability, property, or replacement power, may
be subject to applicable state premium taxes.

10. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

On January 1, 2008, the Company adopted FASB Statement No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (SFAS
No. 157) which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and
requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements. The criterion that is set forth
in SFAS No. 157 is applicable to fair value measurement where it is permitted or required under
other accounting pronouncements.

SFAS No. 157 defines fair value as the exit price, which is the price that would be received to
sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on inputs of
observable and unobservable market data that a market participant would use in pricing the asset
or liability. The use of observable inputs is maximized where available and the use of
unobservable inputs is minimized for fair value measurement. As a means to illustrate the
inputs used, SFAS No. 157 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy that prioritizes inputs
to valuation techniques used for fair value measurement.

•

Level 1 consists of observable market data in an active market for identical assets
or liabilities.

•

Level 2 consists of observable market data, other than that included in Level 1, that
is either directly or indirectly observable.

•

Level 3 consists of unobservable market data. The input may reflect the assumptions
of the Company of what a market participant would use in pricing an asset or liability.
If there is little available market data, then the Company’s own assumptions are the
best available information.

In the case of multiple inputs being used in a fair value measurement, the lowest level input
that is significant to the fair value measurement represents the level in the fair value
hierarchy in which the fair value measurement is reported.

The adoption of SFAS No. 157 has not resulted in any significant changes to the methodologies
used for fair value measurement. Primarily all the changes in the fair value of assets and
liabilities are recorded in other comprehensive income or regulatory assets and liabilities, and
thus the impact on earnings is limited to derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting.

The fair value measurements performed on a recurring basis and the level of the fair value
hierarchy in which they fall at December 31, 2008 are as follows:

At December 31, 2008:

NOTES (continued)

Georgia Power Company 2008 Annual Report

Energy-related derivatives and interest rate derivatives primarily consist of over-the-counter
contracts. See Note 6 under “Financial Instruments” for additional information. The nuclear
decommissioning trust funds are invested in a diversified mix of equity and fixed income
securities. See Note 1 under “Nuclear Decommissioning” for additional information. The cash
equivalents and restricted cash consist of securities with original maturities of 90 days or less. All of these
financial instruments and investments are valued primarily using the market approach.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Gulf Power Company 2008 Annual Report

The management of Gulf Power Company (the “Company”) is responsible for establishing and
maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting as required by the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). A control system can
provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.

Under management’s supervision, an evaluation of the design and effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting was conducted based on the framework in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2008.

This Annual Report does not include an attestation report of the Company’s independent registered
public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management’s report
was not subject to attestation by the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm
pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to
provide only management’s report in this Annual Report.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Gulf Power Company

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets and statements of capitalization of Gulf Power
Company (the “Company”) (a wholly owned subsidiary of Southern Company) as of December 31, 2008 and
2007, and the related statements of income, comprehensive income, common stockholder’s equity, and
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The
Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control
over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial
reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but
not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such financial statements (pages II-266 to II-296) present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Gulf Power Company at December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2008, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Gulf Power Company 2008 Annual Report

OVERVIEW

Business Activities

Gulf Power Company (the Company) operates as a vertically integrated utility providing electricity
to retail customers within its traditional service area located in northwest Florida and to
wholesale customers in the Southeast.

Many factors affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of the Company’s business of selling
electricity. These factors include the ability to maintain a constructive regulatory environment,
to maintain energy sales in the midst of the current economic downturn, and to effectively manage
and secure timely recovery of rising costs. These costs include those related to projected
long-term demand growth, increasingly stringent environmental standards, fuel prices, and storm
restoration costs. Appropriately balancing the need to recover these increasing costs with
customer prices will continue to challenge the Company for the foreseeable future.

In July 2006, the Florida Public Service Commission (PSC) extended the storm-recovery surcharge
currently being collected by the Company until June 2009. See Notes 1 and 3 to the financial
statements under “Property Damage Reserve” and “Retail Regulatory Matters – Storm Damage Cost
Recovery,” respectively, for additional information.

Key Performance Indicators

In striving to maximize shareholder value while providing cost-effective energy to over 425,000
customers, the Company continues to focus on several key indicators. These indicators include
customer satisfaction, plant availability, system reliability, and net income after dividends on
preference stock. The Company’s financial success is directly tied to the satisfaction of its
customers. Key elements of ensuring customer satisfaction include outstanding service, high
reliability, and competitive prices. Management uses customer satisfaction surveys and reliability
indicators to evaluate the Company’s results.

Peak season equivalent forced outage rate (Peak Season EFOR) is an indicator of plant availability
and efficient generation fleet operations during the months when generation needs are greatest.
The rate is calculated by dividing the number of hours of forced outages by total generation hours.
The 2008 Peak Season EFOR of 2.47% was better than the target. Transmission and distribution
system reliability performance is measured by the frequency and duration of outages. Performance
targets for reliability are set internally based on historical performance, expected weather
conditions, and expected capital expenditures. The performance for 2008 was at target for these
reliability measures. The performance for net income after dividends on preference stock in 2008
was below target. Net income after dividends on preference stock is the primary component of the
Company’s contribution to Southern Company’s earnings per share goal.

The Company’s 2008 results compared with its targets for some of these key indicators are reflected
in the following chart:

See RESULTS OF OPERATIONS herein for additional information on the Company’s financial performance.

Earnings

The Company’s 2008 net income after dividends on preference stock was $98.3 million, an increase of
$14.2 million from the previous year. In 2007, earnings were $84.1 million, an increase of
$8.1 million from the previous year. In 2006, earnings were $76.0 million, an increase of
$0.8 million from the previous year. The increase in earnings in 2008 was due primarily to higher
wholesale revenues from non-affiliates, increased allowance for equity funds used during
construction, and a gain on the sale of assets.

II-244


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Gulf Power Company 2008 Annual Report

The increase in earnings in 2007 was due primarily to increases in retail revenues, earnings on
additional investments in environmental controls through the environment cost recovery provision,
and related allowance for equity funds used during construction, partially offset by non-fuel
operating expenses. The increase in earnings in 2006 was due primarily to higher operating
revenues partially offset by higher operating expenses, higher financing costs, and increases in
depreciation expense. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – “PSC Matters – Storm Damage Cost Recovery”
herein.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Gulf Power Company 2008 Annual Report

Revenues associated with changes in rates and pricing include cost recovery provisions for energy
conservation costs and environmental compliance costs. Annually, the Company petitions the Florida
PSC for recovery of projected costs, including any true-up amount from prior periods, and approved
rates are implemented each January. The recovery provisions include related expenses and a return
on average net investment. See Note 3 to the financial statements under “Retail Regulatory Matters
– Environmental Cost Recovery” for additional information.

Fuel and other cost recovery provisions include fuel expenses, the energy component of purchased
power costs, and purchased power capacity costs. Annually, the Company petitions the Florida PSC
for recovery of projected fuel and purchased power costs, including any true-up amount from prior
periods, and approved rates are implemented each January. Cost recovery provisions also include
revenues related to the recovery of storm damage restoration costs. The recovery provisions
generally equal the related expenses and have no material effect on net income. See Note 1 to the
financial statements under “Revenues” and “Property Damage Reserve” and Note 3 to the financial
statements under “Retail Regulatory Matters – Storm Damage Cost Recovery” and “Retail Regulatory
Matters – Fuel Cost Recovery” for additional information.

Total wholesale revenues were $204.1 million in 2008, an increase of $7.4 million, or 3.7%,
compared to 2007, primarily due to higher capacity revenues associated with new and existing
territorial wholesale contracts with non-affiliated companies. Total wholesale revenues were
$196.7 million in 2007, a decrease of $8.5 million, or 4.2%, compared to 2006, primarily due to
decreased energy sales to affiliates at a lower cost per kilowatt-hour (KWH) supplied by lower-cost
generating resources. Total wholesale revenues were $205.2 million in 2006, an increase of
$29.5 million, or 16.8%, compared to 2005, primarily due to increased energy sales to affiliates to
serve their territorial energy requirements.

Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates will vary depending on the market cost of available
energy compared to the cost of the

Company and Southern Company system-owned generation, demand for energy with the Southern Company
service territory, and availability of Southern Company system generation.

Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates include unit power sales under long-term contracts
to other Florida utilities. Wholesale revenues from contracts have both capacity and energy
components. Capacity revenues reflect the recovery of fixed costs and a return on investment.
Energy is generally sold at variable cost. The capacity and energy components under these unit
power sales contracts were as follows:

Wholesale revenues from sales to affiliated companies within the Southern Company system will vary
from year to year depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each
company. These affiliated sales and purchases are made in accordance with the Intercompany
Interchange Contract (IIC), as approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). These
transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings, since the energy is generally sold at
marginal cost and energy purchases are generally offset by revenues through the Company’s fuel cost
recovery clause.

Other operating revenues increased $5.6 million, or 9.9%, in 2008, primarily due to transmission
and distribution network services and other energy services. The increased revenues from other
energy services did not have a material impact on earnings since they were generally offset by
associated expenses. Other operating revenues increased $10.2 million, or 21.8%, in 2007,
primarily due to other energy services and an increase in franchise fees, which were proportional
to changes in revenue. Other operating revenues increased $3.6 million, or 8.3%, in 2006,
primarily due to an increase in franchise fees, which were proportional to changes in revenue.

Changes in retail energy sales are comprised of changes in electricity usage by customers, changes
in weather, and changes in the number of customers.

Residential energy sales decreased 2.3% in 2008, compared to 2007, primarily due to decreased
customer usage as a result of a slowing economy, partially offset by more favorable weather.
Residential energy sales increased 0.9% in 2007, compared to 2006, primarily due to more favorable
weather conditions and customer growth, partially offset by customer response to higher prices.
Residential energy sales increased 2.0% in 2006, compared to 2005, primarily due to more favorable
weather conditions and customer growth.

The change in commercial energy sales in 2008, compared to 2007, was immaterial. Commercial energy
sales increased 3.3% in 2007, compared to 2006, primarily due to more favorable weather conditions
and customer growth. Commercial energy sales increased 2.9% in 2006, compared to 2005, primarily
due to more favorable weather conditions and customer growth.

Industrial energy sales increased 7.9% in 2008, compared to 2007, primarily due to decreased
customer co-generation due to the higher cost of natural gas

.

Industrial energy sales decreased
4.1% in 2007, compared to 2006, primarily due to a conversion project by a major forest products
manufacturer and a production process change by a major petroleum company. Industrial energy sales
decreased 1.1% in 2006, compared to 2005, due to reduced demand for and production of building
materials and a conversion project by a major paper manufacturer.

Wholesale energy sales to non-affiliates decreased 18.4% in 2008, increased 7.1% in 2007, and
decreased 9.4% in 2006, each compared to the prior year primarily as a result of fluctuations in
the fuel cost to produce energy sold to non-affiliated utilities under both long-term and
short-term contracts. The degree to which oil and natural gas prices, which are the primary fuel
sources for these customers, differ from the Company’s fuel costs will influence these changes in
sales. The fluctuations in sales have a minimal effect on earnings because the energy is generally
sold at marginal cost.

Wholesale energy sales to affiliates decreased 35.1% in 2008 and decreased 1.8% in 2007, compared
to prior years, primarily due to the availability of lower cost generation resources at affiliated
companies. Wholesale energy sales to affiliates increased 48.6% in 2006 compared to 2005,
primarily due to increased territorial energy requirements of affiliates.

Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses

Fuel costs constitute the single largest expense for the Company. The mix of fuel sources for
generation of electricity is determined primarily by demand, the unit cost of fuel consumed, and
the availability of generating units. Additionally, the Company purchases a portion of its
electricity needs from the wholesale market.

Total fuel and purchased power expenses were $745.0 million in 2008, an increase of $100.1 million,
or 15.5%, above the prior year costs. The net increase in fuel and purchased power expenses was
due to a $130.5 million increase in the average cost of fuel and purchased power as well as a $34.9
million increase in KWHs purchased, offset by a $65.3 million decrease in KWHs generated. Total
fuel and purchased power expenses were $644.9 million in 2007, an increase of $36.2 million, or
5.9%, above the prior year costs. The net increase in fuel and purchased power expenses was due to
a $32.6 million increase in the average cost of fuel and purchased power as well as a $10.1 million
increase in KWHs generated, offset by a $6.5 million decrease in KWHs purchased. Total fuel and
purchased power expenses were $608.7 million in 2006, an increase of $94.5 million, or 18.4%, above
the prior year costs. The net increase in fuel and purchased power expenses was due to an $82.7
million increase in the average cost of fuel and purchased power as well as a $36.7 million
increase in KWHs generated, offset by a $24.9 million decrease in KWHs purchased.

Fuel expense was $635.6 million in 2008, an increase of $62.2 million, or 10.9%, above the prior
year costs. This increase was the result of a $127.5 million increase in the average cost of fuel,
offset by a $65.3 million decrease related to total KWHs generated. Fuel expense was
$573.4 million in 2007, an increase of $38.5 million, or 7.2%, above the prior year costs. This
increase was the result of a $28.4 million increase in the average cost of fuel and a $10.1 million
increase related to total KWHs generated. Fuel expense was $534.9 million in 2006, an increase of
$119.1 million, or 28.7%, above the prior year costs. This increase was the result of an
$82.4 million increase in the average cost of fuel and a $36.7 million increase related to total
KWHs generated.

Purchased power expense was $109.4 million in 2008, an increase of $37.9 million, or 53.0%, above
the prior year costs. This increase was the result of a $34.9 million increase in total KWHs
purchased and a $3.0 million increase resulting from the higher average cost per net KWH.
Purchased power expense was $71.5 million in 2007, a decrease of $2.3 million, or 3.1%, below the
prior year costs. This decrease was the result of a $6.5 million decrease in total KWHs purchased,
offset by a $4.2 million increase resulting from the higher average cost per net KWH. Purchased
power expense was $73.8 million in 2006, a decrease of $24.6 million, or 25.0%, below the prior
year costs. This decrease was the result of a $24.9 million decrease in total KWHs purchased,
offset by a $0.3 million increase resulting from the higher average cost per net KWH.

Over the last several years, coal prices have been influenced by a worldwide increase in demand
from developing countries, as well as increases in mining and fuel transportation costs. In the
first half of 2008, coal prices reached unprecedented high levels primarily due to increased demand
following more moderate pricing in 2006 and 2007. Despite these fluctuations, fuel inventories
have been adequate and fuel supply markets have been sufficient to meet expected fuel requirements.
Demand for natural gas in the United States also increased in 2007 and the first half of 2008.
However, natural gas supplies increased in the last half of 2008 as a result of increased
production and higher storage levels due in part to weak industrial demand. Both coal and natural
gas prices moderated in the second half of 2008 as the result of a recessionary economy.

Fuel expenses generally do not affect net income, since they are offset by fuel revenues under the
Company’s fuel cost recovery provisions. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – “PSC Matters – Fuel Cost
Recovery” herein for additional information.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Gulf Power Company 2008 Annual Report

Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses

In 2008, other operations and maintenance expenses increased $7.1 million, or 2.6%, compared to the
prior year primarily due to an $8.2 million increase in scheduled and unscheduled maintenance at
generation facilities. In 2007, other operations and maintenance expenses increased $10.9 million,
or 4.2%, compared to the prior year primarily due to a $5.0 million increase in other energy
services and a $4.3 million increase in severance costs associated with a reorganization. The
increased expenses from other energy services did not have a material impact on earnings since they
were generally offset by associated revenue. In 2007, the Company offered both voluntary and
involuntary severance to a number of employees in connection with a reorganization of certain
functions. In 2006, other operations and maintenance expenses increased $9.8 million, or 3.9%,
compared to the prior year primarily due to a $4.2 million increase in the recovery of incurred
costs for storm damage activity as approved by the Florida PSC, a $1.9 million increase in employee
benefit expenses, and a $1.1 million increase in property insurance costs. See FUTURE EARNINGS
POTENTIAL – “PSC Matters – Storm Damage Cost Recovery” herein and Notes 1 and 3 to the financial
statements under “Property Damage Reserve” and “Retail Regulatory Matters – Storm Damage Cost
Recovery,” respectively, for additional information.

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $0.8 million, or 0.9%, in 2008 compared to the
prior year primarily as a result of a $3.8 million gain on the sale of a building. The decrease
was partially offset by an increase of $3.0 million in depreciation due to net additions to
generation and distribution facilities. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased
$3.6 million, or 4.0%, in 2007 compared to the prior year primarily due to new depreciation rates
implemented in January 2007. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $4.2 million, or
4.9%, in 2006 compared to the prior year primarily due to the construction of environmental control
projects at Plants Crist and Daniel that were placed in service in 2005.

Taxes Other Than Income Taxes

Taxes other than income taxes increased $4.2 million, or 5.1%, in 2008, compared to the prior year
primarily due to a $1.9 million decrease in 2007 related to the resolution of a dispute regarding
property taxes in Monroe County, Georgia and a $1.9 million increase in franchise and gross receipt
taxes, which were directly related to the increase in retail revenues. Taxes other than income
taxes increased $3.2 million, or 4.0%, in 2007, and $3.4 million, or 4.5%, in 2006 primarily due to
increases in franchise and gross receipts taxes, which were directly related to the increase in
retail revenues.

Allowance for Equity Funds Used During Construction

Allowance for equity funds used during construction (AFUDC) increased $7.6 million, or 319.9%, in
2008 compared to the prior year primarily due to construction of environmental control projects at
Plant Crist and Plant Scherer. AFUDC increased $2.0 million, or 554.0%, in 2007 compared to the
prior year primarily due to construction of an environmental control project at Plant Crist. AFUDC
decreased $0.8 million, or 68.9%, in 2006 compared to the prior year primarily due to the
completion of an environmental control project at Plant Crist Unit 7 during 2005. See FUTURE
EARNINGS POTENTIAL – “Environmental Matters – Environmental Statutes and Regulations” herein and
Note 1 to the financial statements under “Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC)” for
additional information.

Interest Income

Interest income decreased $2.2 million, or 41%, in 2008, primarily as a result of lower variable
interest rates charged against the under recovered fuel balance and a decrease in the property
damage reserve balance. Interest income increased $0.1 million, or 2.3%, in 2007, and increased
$1.4 million, or 37.4%, in 2006 compared to the prior year primarily due to interest received
related to the recovery of financing costs associated with the fuel clause and incurred costs for
storm damage activity as approved by the Florida PSC. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – “PSC Matters
– Storm Damage Cost Recovery” herein and Note 3 to the financial statements under “Retail
Regulatory Matters – Storm Damage Cost Recovery” for additional information.

II-249


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Gulf Power Company 2008 Annual Report

Interest Expense, Net of Amounts Capitalized

Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized decreased $1.6 million, or 3.5%, in 2008 compared to
the prior year as the result of an increase in capitalization of AFUDC related to the construction
of environmental control projects and the redemption of $41.2 million of long-term debt payable to
an affiliated trust in 2007. These decreases were offset by the issuance of a $110 million term
loan agreement in 2008. Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized increased $0.5 million, or
1.2%, in 2007 compared to the prior year and was not material. Interest expense, net of amounts
capitalized increased $3.8 million, or 9.5%, in 2006 compared to the prior year as the result of
higher interest rates on variable rate pollution control bonds, increased levels of short-term
borrowings at higher interest rates, and the issuance of $60 million in senior notes in August
2005. These increases were partially offset by the maturity of a $100 million bank note in October
2005 and the extinguishment of $30 million aggregate principal amount of first mortgage bonds in
2005.

Other Income (Expense), Net

Other expense, net increased $0.2 million, or 4.9%, in 2008, and increased $0.3 million, or 9.2%,
in 2007, compared to prior years and was not material. Other expense, net increased $1.5 million,
or 79.1%, in 2006 compared to the prior year primarily as a result of changes in charitable
contributions.

Income Taxes

Income taxes increased $7.0 million, or 14.9%, in 2008, compared to the prior year primarily due to
higher earnings before income taxes and a decrease in the federal production activities deduction,
partially offset by the tax benefit associated with an increase in AFUDC, which is non-taxable.
Income taxes increased $1.8 million, or 4.0%, in 2007, and increased $0.3 million, or 0.7%, in 2006
compared to the prior years primarily as a result of higher earnings before income taxes. See
Note 5 to the financial statements under “Effective Tax Rate” for additional information.

Effects of Inflation

The Company is subject to rate regulation based on the recovery of historical costs. When
historical costs are included, or when inflation exceeds projected costs used in rate regulation or
market-based prices, the effects of inflation can create an economic loss since the recovery of
costs could be in dollars that have less purchasing power. In addition, the income tax laws are
based on historical costs. While the inflation rate has been relatively low in recent years, it
continues to have an adverse effect on the Company because of the large investment in utility plant
with long economic lives. Conventional accounting for historical cost does not recognize this
economic loss or the partially offsetting gain that arises through financing facilities with
fixed-money obligations such as long-term debt, preference stock, and preferred securities. Any
recognition of inflation by regulatory authorities is reflected in the rate of return allowed in
the Company’s approved electric rates.

FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL

General

The Company operates as a vertically integrated utility providing electricity to retail customers
within its traditional service area located in northwest Florida and to wholesale customers in the
Southeast. Prices for electricity provided by the Company to retail customers are set by the
Florida PSC under cost-based regulatory principles. Prices for electricity relating to wholesale
electricity sales, interconnecting transmission lines, and the exchange of electric power are
regulated by the FERC. Retail rates and earnings are reviewed and may be adjusted periodically
within certain limitations. See ACCOUNTING POLICIES – “Application of Critical Accounting Policies
and Estimates – Electric Utility Regulation” herein and Note 3 to the financial statements for
additional information about regulatory matters.

The results of operations for the past three years are not necessarily indicative of future
earnings potential. The level of the Company’s future earnings depends on numerous factors that
affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of the Company’s business of selling electricity.
These factors include the Company’s ability to maintain a constructive regulatory environment that
continues to allow for the recovery of all prudently incurred costs during a time of increasing
costs. Future earnings in the near term will depend,

II-250


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Gulf Power Company 2008 Annual Report

in part, upon maintaining energy sales during the current economic downturn, which is subject to a
number of factors. These factors include weather, competition, new energy contracts with
neighboring utilities, energy conservation practiced by customers, the price of electricity, the
price elasticity of demand, and the rate of economic growth or decline in the Company’s service
area. Recent recessionary conditions have negatively impacted sales growth. The timing and extent
of the economic recovery will impact future earnings.

Environmental Matters

Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act and other environmental statutes and regulations
could affect earnings if such costs cannot continue to be fully recovered in rates on a timely
basis. Environmental compliance spending over the next several years may exceed amounts estimated.
Some of the factors driving the potential for such an increase are higher commodity costs, market
demand for labor, and scope additions and clarifications. The timing, specific requirements, and
estimated costs could also change as environmental statutes and regulations are adopted or
modified. See Note 3 to the financial statements under “Environmental Matters” for additional
information.

New Source Review Actions

In November 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) brought a civil action in the U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against certain Southern Company subsidiaries,
including Alabama Power Company (Alabama Power) and Georgia Power Company (Georgia Power), alleging
that these subsidiaries had violated the New Source Review (NSR) provisions of the Clean Air Act
and related state laws at certain coal-fired generating facilities. The EPA concurrently issued
notices of violation relating to the Company’s Plant Crist and a unit at Georgia Power’s Plant
Scherer that is partially owned by the Company. In early 2000, the EPA filed a motion to amend its
complaint to add the allegations in the notice of violation and to add the Company as a defendant.
However, in March 2001, the court denied the motion based on lack of jurisdiction, and the EPA has
not refiled. After Alabama Power was dismissed from the original action for jurisdictional
reasons, the EPA filed a separate action in January 2001 against Alabama Power in the U.S. District
Court for the Northern District of Alabama. In these lawsuits, the EPA alleged that NSR violations
occurred at eight coal-fired generating facilities operated by Alabama Power and Georgia Power.
The civil actions request penalties and injunctive relief, including an order requiring
installation of the best available control technology at the affected units. The action against
Georgia Power has been administratively closed since the spring of 2001, and the case has not been
reopened.

In June 2006, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama entered a consent decree
between Alabama Power and the EPA, resolving a portion of the Alabama Power lawsuit relating to the
alleged NSR violations at Plant Miller. The consent decree required Alabama Power to pay $100,000
to resolve the government’s claim for a civil penalty and to donate $4.9 million of sulfur dioxide
emission allowances to a nonprofit charitable organization. It also formalized specific emissions
reductions to be accomplished by Alabama Power, consistent with other Clean Air Act programs that
require emissions reductions. In August 2006, the district court in Alabama granted Alabama
Power’s motion for summary judgment and entered final judgment in favor of Alabama Power on the
EPA’s claims related to all of the remaining plants: Plants Barry, Gaston, Gorgas, and Greene
County.

The plaintiffs appealed the district court’s decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh
Circuit, where the appeal was stayed, pending the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in a similar case
against Duke Energy. The Supreme Court issued its decision in the Duke Energy case in April 2007,
and in December 2007, the Eleventh Circuit vacated the district court’s decision in the Alabama
Power case and remanded the case back to the district court for consideration of the legal issues
in light of the Supreme Court’s decision in the Duke Energy case. On July 24, 2008, the U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of Alabama granted partial summary judgment in favor of
Alabama Power regarding the proper legal test for determining whether projects are routine
maintenance, repair, and replacement and therefore are excluded from NSR permitting. The decision
did not resolve the case and the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this
time.

The Company believes that it complied with applicable laws and the EPA regulations and
interpretations in effect at the time the work in question took place. The Clean Air Act
authorizes maximum civil penalties of $25,000 to $37,500 per day, per violation at each generating
unit, depending on the date of the alleged violation. An adverse outcome in this matter could
require substantial capital expenditures or affect the timing of currently budgeted capital
expenditures that cannot be determined at this time and could possibly require payment of
substantial penalties. Such expenditures could affect future results of operations, cash flows,
and financial condition if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Gulf Power Company 2008 Annual Report

Carbon Dioxide Litigation

New York Case

In July 2004, three environmental groups and attorneys general from eight states, each outside of
Southern Company’s service territory, and the corporation counsel for New York City filed
complaints in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against Southern
Company and four other electric power companies. The complaints allege that the companies’
emissions of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, contribute to global warming, which the plaintiffs
assert is a public nuisance. Under common law public and private nuisance theories, the plaintiffs
seek a judicial order (1) holding each defendant jointly and severally liable for creating,
contributing to, and/or maintaining global warming and (2) requiring each of the defendants to cap
its emissions of carbon dioxide and then reduce those emissions by a specified percentage each year
for at least a decade. The plaintiffs have not, however, requested that damages be awarded in
connection with their claims. Southern Company believes these claims are without merit and notes
that the complaint cites no statutory or regulatory basis for the claims. In September 2005, the
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York granted Southern Company’s and the other
defendants’ motions to dismiss these cases. The plaintiffs filed an appeal to the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit in October 2005, but no decision has been issued. The ultimate
outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Kivalina Case

On February 26, 2008, the Native Village of Kivalina and the City of Kivalina filed a suit in the
U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against several electric utilities
(including Southern Company), several oil companies, and a coal company. The plaintiffs are the
governing bodies of an Inupiat village in Alaska. The plaintiffs contend that the village is being
destroyed by erosion allegedly caused by global warming that the plaintiffs attribute to emissions
of greenhouse gases by the defendants. The plaintiffs assert claims for public and private
nuisance and contend that the defendants have acted in concert and are therefore jointly and
severally liable for the plaintiffs’ damages. The suit seeks damages for lost property values and
for the cost of relocating the village, which is alleged to be $95 million to $400 million. On
June 30, 2008, all defendants filed motions to dismiss this case. Southern Company believes that
these claims are without merit and notes that the complaint cites no statutory or regulatory basis
for the claims. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Environmental Statutes and Regulations

General

The Company’s operations are subject to extensive regulation by state and federal environmental
agencies under a variety of statutes and regulations governing environmental media, including air,
water, and land resources. Applicable statutes include the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act; the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act; the Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act; the Toxic Substances Control Act; the Emergency Planning & Community
Right-to-Know Act; the Endangered Species Act; and related federal and state regulations.
Compliance with these environmental requirements involves significant capital and operating costs,
a major portion of which is expected to be recovered through existing ratemaking provisions.
Through 2008, the Company had invested approximately $718 million in capital projects to comply
with these requirements, with annual totals of $296 million, $124 million, and $46 million for
2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. The Company expects that capital expenditures to assure
compliance with existing and new statutes and regulations will be an additional $335 million, $164
million, and $233 million for 2009, 2010, and 2011, respectively. The Company’s compliance
strategy can be affected by changes to existing environmental laws, statutes, and regulations, the
cost, availability, and existing inventory of emission allowances, and the Company’s fuel mix.
Environmental costs that are known and estimable at this time are included in capital expenditures
discussed under FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY – “Capital Requirements and Contractual
Obligations” herein.

The Florida Legislature has adopted legislation that allows a utility to petition the Florida PSC
for recovery of prudent environmental compliance costs that are not being recovered through base
rates or any other recovery mechanism. The legislation is discussed in Note 3 to the financial
statements under “Retail Regulatory Matters – Environmental Cost Recovery.” Substantially all of
the costs for the Clean Air Act and other new environmental legislation discussed below are
expected to be recovered through the environmental cost recovery clause.

Compliance with any new federal or state legislation or regulations related to global climate
change, air quality, combustion byproducts, including, coal ash, or other environmental and health
concerns could also significantly affect the Company. Although

II-252


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Gulf Power Company 2008 Annual Report

new or revised environmental legislation or regulations could affect many areas of the Company’s
operations, the full impact of any such changes cannot be determined at this time.

Air Quality

Compliance with the Clean Air Act and resulting regulations has been and will continue to be a
significant focus for the Company. Through 2008, the Company had spent approximately $508 million
in reducing sulfur dioxide (SO


) and nitrogen oxide (NO

x

) emissions and in
monitoring emissions pursuant to the Clean Air Act. Additional controls are currently being
installed at several plants to further reduce air emissions, maintain compliance with existing
regulations, and meet new requirements.

In 2004, the EPA designated nonattainment areas under an eight-hour ozone standard. No area within
the Company’s service area was designated as nonattainment under the eight-hour ozone standard.
Macon, Georgia, where Plant Scherer is located, was designated as nonattainment under the
eight-hour ozone standard. However, the Macon area has since been redesignated as an attainment
area by the EPA, and a maintenance plan to address future exceedances of the standard have been
approved. On March 12, 2008, the EPA issued a final rule establishing a more stringent eight-hour
ozone standard which could result in designation of new nonattainment areas within the Company’s
service territory. The EPA is expected to publish those designations in 2010, and require state
implementation plans for any nonattainment areas by 2013.

During 2005, the EPA’s annual fine particulate matter nonattainment designations became effective
for several areas within Georgia. State plans for addressing the nonattainment designations for
this standard were due by April 5, 2008 but have not been finalized. These state plans could
require further reductions in SO


and NO

x

emissions from power plants
including plants owned in part by the Company.

The EPA issued the final Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) in March 2005. This cap-and-trade rule
addresses power plant SO


and NO

x

emissions that were found to contribute to
nonattainment of the eight-hour ozone and fine particulate matter standards in downwind states.
Twenty-eight eastern states, including Florida, Georgia, and Mississippi, are subject to the
requirements of the rule. The rule calls for additional reductions of NO

x

and/or
SO


to be achieved in two phases, 2009/2010 and 2015. On July 11, 2008, in response to
petitions brought by certain states and regulated industries challenging particular aspects of
CAIR, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued a decision vacating
CAIR in its entirety and remanding it to the EPA for further action consistent with its opinion.
On December 23, 2008, however, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit
altered its July decision in response to a rehearing petition and remanded CAIR to the EPA without
vacatur, thereby leaving CAIR compliance requirements in place while the EPA develops a revised
rule. The State of Florida has an EPA-approved plan to implement this rule. These reductions will
be accomplished by the installation of additional emission controls at the Company’s coal-fired
facilities and/or by the purchase of emission allowances. The State of Georgia has completed plans
to implement CAIR, and has approved a “multi-pollutant rule” that requires plant-specific emission
controls on all but the smallest generating units in Georgia, to be installed according to a
schedule set forth in the rule. The rule is designed to ensure reductions in emissions of
SO


, NO

x

, and mercury in Georgia. The full impact of the court’s remand and
the outcome of the EPA’s future rulemaking in response cannot be determined at this time.

The Clean Air Visibility Rule (CAVR) (formerly called the Regional Haze Rule) was finalized in July
2005. The goal of this rule is to restore natural visibility conditions in certain areas (primarily
national parks and wilderness areas) by 2064. The rule involves (1) the application of Best
Available Retrofit Technology (BART) to certain sources built between 1962 and 1977 and (2) the
application of any additional emissions reductions which may be deemed necessary for each
designated area to achieve reasonable progress by 2018 toward the natural conditions goal.
Thereafter, for each 10-year planning period, additional emissions reductions will be required to
continue to demonstrate reasonable progress in each area during that period. For power plants, the
CAVR allows states to determine that the CAIR satisfies BART requirements for SO


and
NO

x

. Extensive studies were performed for each of the Company’s affected units to
demonstrate that additional particulate matter controls are not necessary under BART. States have
completed or are currently completing implementation plans that contain strategies for BART and any
other measures required to achieve the first phase of reasonable progress.

The impacts of the eight-hour ozone nonattainment designations, the fine particulate matter
nonattainment designations, and the CAVR on the Company cannot be determined at this time and will
depend on the resolution of any pending legal challenges and the development and implementation of
rules at the state level.

The Company has developed and continually updates a comprehensive environmental compliance strategy
to assess compliance obligations associated with the continuing and new environmental requirements
discussed above. As part of this strategy, the

II-253


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Gulf Power Company 2008 Annual Report

Company plans to install additional SO


and NO

x

emission
controls within the
next several years to ensure continued compliance with applicable air quality requirements.

In March 2005, the EPA published the final Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR), a cap-and-trade program
for the reduction of mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants. The final CAMR was challenged
in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The petitioners alleged that
the EPA was not authorized to establish a cap-and-trade program for mercury emissions and instead
the EPA must establish maximum achievable control technology standards for coal-fired electric
utility steam generating units. On February 8, 2008, the court ruled in favor of the petitioners
and vacated the CAMR. The Company’s overall environmental compliance strategy relies primarily on
a combination of SO


and NO

x

controls to reduce mercury emissions. Any
significant changes in the strategy will depend on the outcome of any appeals and/or future federal
and state rulemakings. Future rulemakings necessitated by the court’s decision could require
emission reductions more stringent than those required by the CAMR.

Water Quality

In July 2004, the EPA published its final technology-based regulations under the Clean Water Act
for the purpose of reducing impingement and entrainment of fish, shellfish, and other forms of
aquatic life at existing power plant cooling water intake structures. The rules require baseline
biological information and, perhaps, installation of fish protection technology near some intake
structures at existing power plants. In January 2007, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit overturned and remanded several provisions of the rule, including the use of cost-benefit
analysis, to the EPA for revisions. The decision has been appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. The
full impact of these regulations will depend on subsequent legal proceedings, further rulemaking by
the EPA, the results of studies and analyses performed as part of the rules’ implementation, and
the actual requirements established by state regulatory agencies and, therefore, cannot be
determined at this time.

Environmental Remediation

The Company must comply with other environmental laws and regulations that cover the handling and
disposal of waste and releases of hazardous substances. Under these various laws and regulations,
the Company could incur substantial costs to clean up properties. The Company conducts studies to
determine the extent of any required cleanup and has recognized in its financial statements the
costs to clean up known sites. Included in this amount are costs associated with remediation of
the Company’s substation sites. These projects have been approved by the Florida PSC for recovery
through the environmental cost recovery clause; therefore, there is no impact to the Company’s net
income as a result of these liabilities. The Company may be liable for some or all required
cleanup costs for additional sites that may require environmental remediation. See Note 3 to the
financial statements under “Environmental Matters – Environmental Remediation” for additional
information.

Global Climate Issues

Federal legislative proposals that would impose mandatory requirements related to greenhouse gas
emissions and renewable energy standards continue to be strongly considered in Congress, and the
reduction of greenhouse gas emissions has been identified as a high priority by the current
Administration. The ultimate outcome of these proposals cannot be determined at this time;
however, mandatory restrictions on the Company’s greenhouse gas emissions could result in
significant additional compliance costs that could affect future unit retirement and replacement
decisions and results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition if such costs are not
recovered through regulated rates.

In April 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the EPA has authority under the Clean Air Act to
regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles. The EPA is currently developing its
response to this decision. Regulatory decisions that will follow from this response may have
implications for both new and existing stationary sources, such as power plants. The ultimate
outcome of these rulemaking activities cannot be determined at this time; however, as with the
current legislative proposals, mandatory restrictions on the Company’s greenhouse gas emissions
could result in significant additional compliance costs that could affect future unit retirement
and replacement decisions and results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition if such
costs are not recovered through regulated rates.

In addition, some states are considering or have undertaken actions to regulate and reduce
greenhouse gas emissions. On June 25, 2008, Florida’s Governor signed comprehensive energy-related
legislation that includes authorization for the Florida Department of Environmental Protection to
adopt rules for a cap-and-trade regulatory program to address greenhouse gas emissions from
electric utilities, conditioned upon their ratification by the legislature no sooner than the 2010
legislative session.  This legislation also authorizes the Florida PSC to adopt a renewable
portfolio standard for public utilities, subject to legislative ratification. The impact of

II-254


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Gulf Power Company 2008 Annual Report

this and any similar legislation on the Company will depend on the future development, adoption,
legislative ratification, implementation, and potential legal challenges to rules governing
greenhouse gas emissions and mandates regarding the use of renewable energy, and the ultimate
outcome cannot be determined at this time.

International climate change negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change also continue. Current efforts focus on a potential successor to the Kyoto Protocol for the
post 2012 timeframe, with a conclusion to this round of negotiations targeted for the end of 2009.
The outcome and impact of the international negotiations cannot be determined at this time.

The Company continues to evaluate its future energy and emission profiles and is participating in
voluntary programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to help develop and advance technology to
reduce emissions.

FERC Matters

Market-Based Rate Authority

The Company has authorization from the FERC to sell power to non-affiliates, including short-term
opportunity sales, at market-based prices. Specific FERC approval must be obtained with respect to
a market-based contract with an affiliate.

In December 2004, the FERC initiated a proceeding to assess Southern Company’s generation dominance
within its retail service territory. The ability to charge market-based rates in other markets is
not an issue in the proceeding. Any new market-based rate sales by the Company in Southern
Company’s retail service territory entered into during a 15-month refund period that ended in May
2006 could be subject to refund to a cost-based rate level.

In November 2007, the presiding administrative law judge issued an initial decision regarding the
methodology to be used in the generation dominance tests. The proceedings are ongoing. The
ultimate outcome of this generation dominance proceeding cannot now be determined, but an adverse
decision by the FERC in a final order could require the Company to charge cost-based rates for
certain wholesale sales in the Southern Company retail service territory, which may be lower than
negotiated market-based rates, and could also result in total refunds of up to $0.8 million, plus
interest. The Company believes that there is no meritorious basis for an adverse decision in this
proceeding and is vigorously defending itself in this matter.

In June 2007, the FERC issued its final rule in Order No. 697 regarding market-based rate
authority. The FERC generally retained its current market-based rate standards. Responding to a
number of requests for rehearing, the FERC issued Order No. 697-A on April 21, 2008 and Order No.
697-B on December 12, 2008. These orders largely affirmed the FERC’s prior revision and
codification of the regulations governing market-based rates for public utilities. In accordance
with the orders, Southern Company submitted to the FERC an updated market power analysis on
September 2, 2008 related to its continued market-based rate authority. The ultimate outcome of
this matter cannot now be determined.

On October 17, 2008, Southern Company filed with the FERC a revised market-based rate (MBR) tariff
and a new cost-based rate (CBR) tariff.   The revised MBR tariff provides for a “must offer” energy
auction whereby Southern Company, offers all of its available energy for sale in a day-ahead
auction and an hour-ahead auction with reserve prices not to exceed the CBR tariff price, after
considering Southern Company’s native load requirements, reliability obligations, and sales
commitments to third parties. All sales under the energy auction would be at market clearing
prices established under the auction rules. The new CBR tariff provides for a cost-based price for
wholesale sales of less than a year. On December 18, 2008, the FERC issued an order conditionally
accepting the MBR tariff subject to certain revisions to the auction proposal. On January 21,
2009, Southern Company made a compliance filing that accepted all the conditions of the MBR tariff
order. When this order becomes final, Southern Company will have 30 days to implement the
wholesale auction. On December 31, 2008, the FERC issued an order conditionally accepting the CBR
tariff subject to providing additional information concerning one aspect of the tariff. On January
30, 2009, Southern Company filed a response addressing the FERC inquiry to the CBR tariff order.
Implementation of the energy auction in accordance with the MBR tariff order is expected to
adequately mitigate going forward any presumption of market power that Southern Company may have in
the Southern Company retail service territory. The timing of when the FERC may issue the final
orders on the MBR and CBR tariffs and the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at
this time.

Gulf Power Company 2008 Annual Report

PSC Matters

Fuel Cost Recovery

The Company petitions for fuel cost recovery rates to be approved by the Florida PSC on an annual
basis. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the under recovered balance was $96.7 million and
$56.6 million, respectively, primarily due to lower non-territorial sales, increased costs for
coal, and a higher percentage of natural gas fired generation. The Company continuously monitors
the over or under recovered fuel cost balance in light of the inherent variability in fuel costs.
If the projected fuel cost over or under recovery exceeds 10% of the projected fuel revenue
applicable for the period, the Company is required to notify the Florida PSC and indicate if an
adjustment to the fuel cost recovery factor is being requested.

On July 29, 2008, the Florida PSC approved a request by the Company to increase the fuel cost
recovery factor effective with billings beginning September 2008. The remaining portion of the
projected under recovered balance is expected to be recovered in 2009. On September 2, 2008, the
Company filed its 2009 projected fuel cost recovery filing with the Florida PSC which includes the
fuel factors proposed for January 2009 through December 2009. On October 13, 2008, the Company
notified the Florida PSC that the updated projected fuel cost under recovery balance at year-end
exceeds the 10% threshold, but no adjustment to the fuel factor was requested.

On November 6, 2008, the Florida PSC approved an increase of approximately 12.9% in the fuel factor
for retail customers, effective with billings beginning January 2009. The fuel factors are
intended to allow the Company to recover its projected 2009 fuel and purchased power costs as well
as the 2008 under recovered amounts in 2009. Fuel cost recovery revenues, as recorded on the
financial statements, are adjusted for differences in actual recoverable costs and amounts billed
in current regulated rates. Accordingly, changing the billing factor has no significant effect on
the Company’s revenues or net income, but does impact annual cash flow. See Notes 1 and 3 to the
financial statements under “Revenues” and “Retail Regulatory Matters — Fuel Cost Recovery,”
respectively.

Environmental Cost Recovery

In August 2007, the Florida PSC voted to approve a stipulation among the Company, the Office of
Public Counsel, and the Florida Industrial Power Users Group regarding the Company’s plan for
complying with certain federal and state regulations addressing air quality. The Company’s
environmental compliance plan as filed in March 2007 contemplated implementation of specific
projects identified in the plan from 2007 through 2018. The stipulation covers all elements of the
current plan that are scheduled to be implemented in the 2007 through 2011 timeframe. On September
18, 2008, the Company filed an update to the plan, which was approved by the Florida PSC on
November 4, 2008. The Florida PSC acknowledged that the costs associated with the Company’s
CAIR/CAMR/CAVR compliance plan are clearly eligible for recovery through the environmental cost
recovery clause. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY — “Capital Requirements and Contractual
Obligations” herein, Note 3 to the financial statements under “Retail Regulatory Matters -
Environmental Cost Recovery,” and Note 7 to the financial statements under “Construction Program”
for additional information.

Storm Damage Cost Recovery

Under authority granted by the Florida PSC, the Company maintains a reserve for property damage to
cover the cost of uninsured damages from major storms to its transmission and distribution
facilities, generation facilities, and other property. Funds collected by the Company related to
the storm-recovery costs associated with previous hurricanes had been fully recovered by August 31,
2008. Funds collected by the Company through its storm-recovery surcharge are now being credited
to the property reserve and will continue through June 2009 when the approved surcharge ends. As
of December 31, 2008, the balance in the Company’s property damage reserve totaled approximately
$9.8 million, which is included in deferred liabilities in the balance sheets.

See Notes 1 and 3 to the financial statements under “Property Damage Reserve” and “Retail
Regulatory Matters – Storm Damage Cost Recovery,” respectively, for additional information.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Gulf Power Company 2008 Annual Report

Income Tax Matters

Legislation

On February 17, 2009, President Obama signed into law the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of
2009 (ARRA). Major tax incentives in the ARRA include an extension of bonus depreciation and
multiple renewable energy incentives. These incentives could have a significant impact on the
Company’s future cash flow and net income. Additionally, the ARRA includes programs for renewable
energy, transmission and smart grid enhancement, fossil energy and research, and energy efficiency
and conservation. The ultimate impact cannot be determined at this time.

Internal Revenue Code Section 199 Domestic Production Deduction

The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 created a tax deduction for a portion of income attributable
to U.S. production activities as defined in the Section 199 (production activities deduction) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Internal Revenue Code). The deduction is equal to a
stated percentage of qualified production activities net income. The percentage is phased in over
the years 2005 through 2010 with a 3% rate applicable to the years 2005 and 2006, a 6% rate
applicable for years 2007 through 2009, and a 9% rate thereafter. The Internal Revenue Service
(IRS) has not clearly defined a methodology for calculating this deduction. However, Southern
Company has agreed with the IRS on a calculation methodology and signed a closing agreement on
December 11, 2008. Therefore, the Company reversed the unrecognized tax benefit and adjusted the
deduction to conform to the agreement. The net impact of the reversal of the unrecognized tax
benefits combined with the application of the new methodology had no material effect on the
Company’s financial statements. See Note 5 to the financial statements under “Effective Tax Rate”
for additional information.

Other Matters

In 2004, Georgia Power and the Company entered into power purchase agreements (PPAs) with Florida
Power & Light Company (FP&L) and Progress Energy Florida. Under the agreements, Georgia Power and
the Company will provide FP&L and Progress Energy Florida with 165 megawatts and 74 megawatts,
respectively, of capacity annually from the jointly owned Plant Scherer Unit 3 for the period from
June 2010 through December 2015. The contracts provide for fixed capacity payments and variable
energy payments based on actual energy delivered. The Florida PSC approved the contracts in 2005.

Also in 2004, Georgia Power and the Company entered into a PPA with Flint Electric Membership
Corporation. Under the agreement, Georgia Power and the Company will provide Flint Electric
Membership Corporation with 75 megawatts of capacity annually from the jointly owned Plant Scherer
Unit 3 for the period from June 2010 through December 2019. The contract provides for fixed
capacity payments and variable energy payments based on actual energy delivered.

The Company is involved in various other matters being litigated and regulatory matters that could
affect future earnings. In addition, the Company is subject to certain claims and legal actions
arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company’s business activities are subject to
extensive governmental regulation related to public health and the environment. Litigation over
environmental issues and claims of various types, including property damage, personal injury,
common law nuisance, and citizen enforcement of environmental requirements such as opacity and air
and water quality standards, has increased generally throughout the United States. In particular,
personal injury claims for damages caused by alleged exposure to hazardous materials have become
more frequent. The ultimate outcome of such pending or potential litigation against the Company
cannot be predicted at this time; however, for current proceedings not specifically reported
herein, management does not anticipate that the liabilities, if any, arising from such current
proceedings would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial statements. See Note 3
to the financial statements for information regarding material issues.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Gulf Power Company 2008 Annual Report

ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The Company prepares its financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. Significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the
financial statements. In the application of these policies, certain estimates are made that may
have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations and related disclosures. Different
assumptions and measurements could produce estimates that are significantly different from those
recorded in the financial statements. Senior management has reviewed and discussed critical
accounting policies and estimates described below with the Audit Committee of Southern Company’s
Board of Directors.

Electric Utility Regulation

The Company is subject to retail regulation by the Florida PSC and wholesale regulation by the
FERC. These regulatory agencies set the rates the Company is permitted to charge customers based
on allowable costs. As a result, the Company applies Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
Statement No. 71, “Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation” (SFAS No. 71), which
requires the financial statements to reflect the effects of rate regulation. Through the
ratemaking process, the regulators may require the inclusion of costs or revenues in periods
different than when they would be recognized by a non-regulated company. This treatment may result
in the deferral of expenses and the recording of related regulatory assets based on anticipated
future recovery through rates or the deferral of gains or creation of liabilities and the recording
of related regulatory liabilities. The application of SFAS No. 71 has a further effect on the
Company’s financial statements as a result of the estimates of allowable costs used in the
ratemaking process. These estimates may differ from those actually incurred by the Company;
therefore, the accounting estimates inherent in specific costs such as depreciation and pension and
postretirement benefits have less of a direct impact on the Company’s results of operations than
they would on a non-regulated company.

As reflected in Note 1 to the financial statements, significant regulatory assets and liabilities
have been recorded. Management reviews the ultimate recoverability of these regulatory assets and
liabilities based on applicable regulatory guidelines and accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States. However, adverse legislative, judicial, or regulatory actions could
materially impact the amounts of such regulatory assets and liabilities and could adversely impact
the Company’s financial statements.

Contingent Obligations

The Company is subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, as well as other
factors and conditions that potentially subject it to environmental, litigation, income tax, and
other risks. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL herein and Note 3 to the financial statements for more
information regarding certain of these contingencies. The Company periodically evaluates its
exposure to such risks and, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, records
reserves for those matters where a non-tax-related loss is considered probable and reasonably
estimable and records a tax asset or liability if it is more likely than not that a tax position
will be sustained. The adequacy of reserves can be significantly affected by external events or
conditions that can be unpredictable; thus, the ultimate outcome of such matters could materially
affect the Company’s financial statements. These events or conditions include the following:

•

Changes in existing state or federal regulation by governmental authorities having
jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances, hazardous and solid
wastes, and other environmental matters.

•

Changes in existing income tax regulations or changes in IRS or state revenue department
interpretations of existing regulations.

•

Identification of additional sites that require environmental remediation or the filing of
other complaints in which the Company may be asserted to be a potentially responsible party.

•

Identification and evaluation of other potential lawsuits or complaints in which the Company
may be named as a defendant.

•

Resolution or progression of new or existing matters through the legislative process, the
court systems, the IRS, the FERC, or the EPA.

II-258


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Gulf Power Company 2008 Annual Report

Unbilled Revenues

Revenues related to the retail sale of electricity are recorded when electricity is delivered to
customers. However, the determination of KWH sales to individual customers is based on the
reading of their meters, which is performed on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the
end of each month, amounts of electricity delivered to customers, but not yet metered and billed,
are estimated. Components of the unbilled revenue estimates include total KWH territorial supply,
total KWH billed, estimated total electricity lost in delivery, and customer usage. These
components can fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including weather, generation
patterns, and power delivery volume and other operational constraints. These factors can be
unpredictable and can vary from historical trends. As a result, the overall estimate of unbilled
revenues could be significantly affected, which could have a material impact on the Company’s
results of operations.

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY

Overview

The Company’s financial condition remained stable at December 31, 2008. Throughout the recent
turmoil in the financial markets, the Company has maintained adequate access to capital without
drawing on any of its bank credit arrangements used to support its commercial paper programs and
variable rate pollution control revenue bonds. The Company has continued to issue commercial paper
at reasonable rates. The Company intends to continue to monitor its access to short-term and
long-term capital markets as well as its bank credit arrangements to meet future capital and
liquidity needs. No material changes in bank credit arrangements have occurred, although market
rates for committed credit have increased and the Company may be subject to higher costs as its
existing facilities are replaced or renewed. The Company’s interest cost for short-term debt has
decreased as market short-term interest rates have declined. The ultimate impact on future
financing costs as a result of the financial turmoil cannot be determined at this time. The
Company experienced no material counterparty credit losses as a result of the turmoil in the
financial markets. See “Sources of Capital” and “Financing Activities” herein for additional
information.

The Company’s investments in pension trust funds declined in value as of December 31, 2008. The
Company expects that the earliest that cash may have to be contributed to the pension trust fund is
2011 and such contribution could be significant; however, projections of the amount vary
significantly depending on interpretations of and decisions related to federal legislation passed
during 2008 as well as other key variables including future trust fund performance and cannot be
determined at this time.

Net cash flow from operating activities totaled $147.9 million, $217.0 million, and $143.4 million
for 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. The $69.1 million decrease in net cash flows from
operating activities in 2008 was due primarily to a $61.0 million increase in cash used for the
under recovered regulatory clause related to fuel. The $73.6 million increase in net cash flows
from operating activities in 2007 was due primarily to increased cash inflows for fuel cost
recovery. The $9.3 million decrease in net cash flows from operating activities in 2006 was due
primarily to increased payments related to income taxes and fuel. Net cash flow used by investing
activities totaled $348.7 million, $239.3 million, and $164.4 million for 2008, 2007, and 2006,
respectively. The increases in cash flows used by investing activities were primarily due to gross
property additions to utility plant of $390.7 million, $239.3 million, and $147.1 million for 2008,
2007, and 2006, respectively. Funds for the Company’s property additions were provided by
operating activities, capital contributions, and other financing activities. Net cash flow from
financing activities totaled $198.8 million, $20.2 million, and $24.7 million for 2008, 2007, and
2006, respectively. The $178.6 million increase in net cash flows from financing activities in
2008 was due primarily to the issuance of $110 million in long-term debt and $50 million in
short-term debt, and a $49.1 million change in commercial paper cash flows in 2008. The increase
was partially offset by the issuance of $85 million in senior notes in 2007. The $4.5 million
decrease in net cash flows from financing activities in 2007 was due primarily to a $105.6 million
change in commercial paper cash flows and a $25.0 million decrease in senior note proceeds. These
decreases were partially offset by the issuance of $80 million in common stock and $45 million in
preference stock in 2007. The $77.4 million increase in net cash flows from financing activities
in 2006 was due primarily to a $50.0 million increase in senior note proceeds and the redemption of
$100.0 million in long-term debt in 2005. These increases were partially offset by the issuance of
$55.0 million in preference stock in 2005 and the redemption of $30.9 million of long-term debt
payable to affiliated trusts in 2006. See the statements of cash flows for additional information.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Gulf Power Company 2008 Annual Report

Significant balance sheet changes in 2008 included a net increase of $308.2 million in property,
plant, and equipment, primarily related to environmental control projects, the issuance of $110
million in long-term debt and $50 million in short-term debt, a $40.1 million increase in under
recovered regulatory clause revenues related to fuel, and a $31.0 million change in energy-related
derivative contracts. Other significant balance sheet changes which are primarily attributable to
the decline in market value of the Company’s pension trust fund include a decrease of $107.2
million in prepaid pension costs, an increase of $73.3 million in other deferred regulatory assets,
and a decrease of $54.1 million in other deferred regulatory liabilities.

The Company’s ratio of common equity to total capitalization, including short-term debt, was 42.9%
in 2008, 45.3% in 2007, and 42.1% in 2006. See Note 6 to the financial statements for additional
information.

The Company has received investment grade credit ratings from the major rating agencies with
respect to its debt and preference stock. See “SELECTED FINANCIAL AND OPERATING DATA” for
additional information regarding the Company’s security ratings.

Sources of Capital

The Company plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other purposes from sources
similar to those used in the past, which were primarily from operating cash flows, securities
issuances, term loans, and short-term indebtedness. However, the type and timing of any future
financings, if needed, will depend on market conditions, regulatory approval, and other factors.

Security issuances are subject to regulatory approval by the Florida PSC pursuant to its rules and
regulations. Additionally, with respect to the public offering of securities, the Company files
registration statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended (1933 Act). The amounts of securities authorized by the Florida PSC, as well
as the amounts, if any, registered under the 1933 Act, are continuously monitored and appropriate
filings are made to ensure flexibility in the capital markets.

The Company obtains financing separately without credit support from any affiliate. See Note 6 to
the financial statements under “Bank Credit Arrangements” for additional information. The Southern
Company system does not maintain a centralized cash or money pool. Therefore, funds of the Company
are not commingled with funds of any other company.

The Company’s current liabilities frequently exceed current assets because of the continued use of
short-term debt as a funding source to meet cash needs which can fluctuate significantly due to the
seasonality of the business. To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, the Company has
various internal and external sources of liquidity. At December 31, 2008, the Company had
approximately $3.4 million of cash and cash equivalents, along with $120 million of unused
committed lines of credit with banks to meet its short-term cash needs. Of these bank credit
arrangements, $120 million will expire in 2009 and $90 million contain provisions allowing one-year
term loans executable at expiration. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, the Company obtained an
additional $20 million of committed credit, which expires in 2009. The Company plans to renew
these lines of credit during 2009 prior to their expiration. In addition, the Company has
substantial cash flow from operating activities and access to the capital markets including a
commercial paper program to meet liquidity needs. See Note 6 to the financial statements under
“Bank Credit Arrangements” for additional information.

The Company may also meet short-term cash needs through a Southern Company subsidiary organized to
issue and sell commercial paper and extendible commercial notes at the request and for the benefit
of the Company and the other traditional operating companies. Proceeds from such issuances for the
benefit of the Company are loaned directly to the Company and are not commingled with proceeds from
such issuances for the benefit of any other traditional operating company. There is no cross
affiliate credit support. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $89.9 million of commercial paper
outstanding. In addition, the Company had a $50 million short-term bank loan outstanding and $8.3
million in notes payable outstanding related to other energy services contracts.

Financing Activities

In 2008, the Company borrowed $110 million under a three-year term loan agreement and $50 million
under a short-term loan agreement. Proceeds were used to repay a portion of the Company’s
short-term indebtedness and for other general corporate purposes, including Gulf Power’s continuous
construction activities. Interest rate hedges of $80 million were settled related to issuance of
senior debt at a loss of approximately $5 million.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Gulf Power Company 2008 Annual Report

In the first and second quarters of 2008, the Company converted its entire $141 million of
obligations related to auction rate pollution control revenue bonds from auction rate modes to
other interest rate modes. Approximately $75 million of the auction rate pollution control revenue
bonds were converted to fixed interest rate modes and approximately $66 million were converted to
variable rate modes.

During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company converted $66 million in obligations related to
variable rate pollution control revenue bonds to a fixed interest rate mode, eliminating the
committed credit backup requirement for these bonds. Of this amount, the Company purchased from
investors approximately $37 million of variable rate pollution control revenue bonds that were
subject to mandatory tender, all of which were subsequently remarketed at a fixed rate.

On January 22, 2009, the Company issued to Southern Company 1,350,000 shares of the Company’s
common stock, without par value, and realized proceeds of $135 million. The proceeds were used to
repay a portion of the Company’s short-term debt and for other general corporate purposes.

In addition to any financings that may be necessary to meet capital requirements, contractual
obligations, and storm-recovery, the Company plans to continue, when economically feasible, a
program to retire higher-cost securities and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital if
market conditions permit.

Credit Rating Risk

The Company does not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in payment
schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade. There are certain contracts
that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of a credit rating change
to BBB- and/or Baa3 or below. These contracts are for physical electricity purchases and sales,
fuel transportation and storage, emissions allowances and energy price risk management. At
December 31, 2008, the maximum potential collateral requirements under these contracts at a BBB-
and/or Baa3 rating were approximately $49 million. At December 31, 2008, the maximum potential
collateral requirements under these contracts at a rating below BBB- and/or Baa3 were approximately
$205 million. Included in these amounts are certain agreements that could require collateral in
the event that one or more power pool participants has a credit rating change to below investment
grade. Generally, collateral may be provided by a Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit, or
cash. Additionally, any credit rating downgrade could impact the Company’s ability to access
capital markets, particularly the short-term debt market.

Market Price Risk

The Company’s market risk exposures relative to interest rate changes have not changed materially
compared with the December 31, 2007 reporting period. Since a significant portion of outstanding
indebtedness is at fixed rates, the Company is not aware of any facts or circumstances that would
significantly affect exposures on existing indebtedness in the near term. However, the impact on
future financing costs cannot now be determined.

Due to cost-based rate regulation, the Company has limited exposure to market volatility in
interest rates, commodity fuel prices, and prices of electricity. To manage the volatility
attributable to these exposures, the Company nets the exposures, where possible, to take advantage
of natural offsets and enters into various derivative transactions for the remaining exposures
pursuant to the Company’s policies in areas such as counterparty exposure and risk management
practices. Company policy is that derivatives are to be used primarily for hedging purposes and
mandates strict adherence to all applicable risk management policies. Derivative positions are
monitored using techniques including but not limited to market valuation, value at risk, stress
testing, and sensitivity analysis.

To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity prices, the Company enters into
fixed-price contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity through the wholesale electricity
market and, to a lesser extent, into financial hedge contracts for natural gas purchases. The
Company has implemented a fuel-hedging program per the guidelines of the Florida PSC.

The weighted average interest rate on $114 million variable rate long-term debt at January 1, 2009
was 1.62%. If the Company sustained a 100 basis point change in interest rates for all variable
rate long-term debt, the change would affect annualized interest expense by approximately $1
million at January 1, 2009. See Notes 1 and 6 to the financial statements under “Financial
Instruments” for additional information.

Current period changes also include the changes in fair value of new contracts entered into
during the period, if any.

The decrease in the fair value positions of the energy-related derivative contracts for the year
ended December 31, 2008 was $31.0 million, substantially all of which is due to natural gas
positions. This change is attributable to both the volume and prices of natural gas. At December
31, 2008, the Company had a net hedge volume of 14.2 billion cubic feet (Bcf) with a weighted
average contract cost approximately $2.24 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) above market
prices, and 7.5 Bcf at December 31, 2007 with a weighted average contract cost approximately $0.03
per mmBtu above market prices. Natural gas hedges are recovered through the fuel cost recovery
clause.

At December 31, the net fair value of energy-related derivative contracts by hedge designation was
reflected in the financial statements as assets/ (liabilities) as follows:

Energy-related derivative contracts designated as regulatory hedges are related to the Company’s
fuel hedging programs, where gains and losses are initially recorded as regulatory liabilities and
assets, respectively, and then are included in fuel expense as they are recovered through the fuel
cost recovery clause. Certain other gains and losses on energy-related derivatives, designated as
cash flow hedges, are initially deferred in other comprehensive income before being recognized in
income in the same period as the hedged transaction. Gains and losses on energy-related derivative
contracts that are not designated or fail to qualify as hedges are recognized in the statements of
income as incurred.

Unrealized pre-tax gains and losses from energy-related derivative contracts recognized in income
were not material for any year presented.

The maturities of the energy-related derivative contracts and the level of the fair value hierarchy

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Gulf Power Company 2008 Annual Report

As part of the adoption of FASB Statement No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” to increase
consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, the table above
now uses the three-tier fair value hierarchy, as discussed in Note 9 to the financial statements,
as opposed to the previously used descriptions “actively quoted,” “external sources,” and “models
and other methods.” The three-tier fair value hierarchy focuses on the fair value of the contract
itself, whereas the previous descriptions focused on the source of the inputs. Because the Company
uses over-the-counter contracts that are not exchange traded but are fair valued using prices which
are actively quoted, the valuations of those contracts now appear in Level 2; previously they were
shown as “actively quoted.”

The Company is exposed to market price risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to the
derivative energy contracts. The Company’s practice is to enter into agreements with
counterparties that have investment grade credit ratings by Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s or with
counterparties who have posted collateral to cover potential credit exposure. Therefore, the
Company does not anticipate market risk exposure from nonperformance by the counterparties. See
Notes 1 and 6 to the financial statements under “Financial Instruments” for additional information.

Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations

The construction program of the Company is currently estimated to be $478 million in 2009,
$337 million in 2010, and $400 million in 2011. Environmental expenditures included in these
estimated amounts are $335 million in 2009, $164 million in 2010, and $233 million in 2011. The
construction programs are subject to periodic review and revision, and actual construction costs
may vary from these estimates because of numerous factors. These factors include: changes in
business conditions; revised load growth estimates; storm impacts; changes in environmental
statutes and regulations; changes in FERC rules and regulations; Florida PSC approvals; the cost
and efficiency of construction labor, equipment, and materials; and the cost of capital. In
addition, there can be no assurance that costs related to capital expenditures will be fully
recovered.

The Company plans to construct a new landfill gas to energy generation facility. Construction of
new transmission and distribution facilities and capital improvements, including those needed to
meet environmental standards for the Company’s existing generation, transmission, and distribution
facilities, is ongoing.

As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company provides postretirement benefits to
substantially all employees and funds trusts to the extent required by the FERC and the Florida
PSC.

Other funding requirements related to obligations associated with scheduled maturities of long-term
debt, as well as the related interest, derivative obligations, preference stock dividends, leases,
and other purchase commitments are as follows. See Notes 1, 6, and 7 to the financial statements
for additional information.

Natural gas purchase commitments are based on various indices at the time of delivery.
Amounts reflected have been estimated based on the New York Mercantile Exchange future prices
at December 31, 2008.

(h)

Long-term service agreements include price escalation based on inflation indices.

(i)

The Company forecasts postretirement trust contributions over a three-year period. The
Company expects that the earliest that cash may have to be contributed to the pension trust
fund is 2011 and such contribution could be significant; however, projections of the amount
vary significantly depending on interpretations of and decisions related to federal
legislation passed during 2008 as well as other key variables including future trust fund
performance and cannot be determined at this time. Therefore, no amounts related to the
pension trust fund are included in the table. See Note 2 to the financial statements for
additional information related to the pension and postretirement plans, including estimated
benefit payments. Certain benefit payments will be made through the related trusts. Other
benefit payments will be made from the Company’s corporate assets.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Gulf Power Company 2008 Annual Report

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

General

Gulf Power Company (the Company) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Southern Company, which is the
parent company of four traditional operating companies, Southern Power Company (Southern Power),
Southern Company Services, Inc. (SCS), Southern Communications Services, Inc. (SouthernLINC
Wireless), Southern Company Holdings, Inc. (Southern Holdings), Southern Nuclear Operating Company,
Inc. (Southern Nuclear), and other direct and indirect subsidiaries. The traditional operating
companies, Alabama Power Company (Alabama Power), Georgia Power Company (Georgia Power), the
Company, and Mississippi Power Company (Mississippi Power), are vertically integrated utilities
providing electric service in four Southeastern states. The Company provides retail service to
customers in northwest Florida and to wholesale customers in the Southeast. Southern Power
constructs, acquires, owns, and manages generation assets and sells electricity at market-based
rates in the wholesale market. SCS, the system service company, provides, at cost, specialized
services to Southern Company and the subsidiary companies. SouthernLINC Wireless provides digital
wireless communications for use by Southern Company and its subsidiary companies and also markets
these services to the public and provides fiber cable services within the Southeast. Southern
Holdings is an intermediate holding company subsidiary for Southern Company’s investments in
leveraged leases and various other energy-related businesses. Southern Nuclear operates and
provides services to Southern Company’s nuclear power plants.

The equity method is used for subsidiaries in which the Company has significant influence but does
not control and for variable interest entities where the Company is not the primary beneficiary.

The Company is subject to regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the
Florida Public Service Commission (PSC). The Company follows accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States and complies with the accounting policies and practices prescribed by
its regulatory commissions. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires the use of estimates, and the actual
results may differ from those estimates.

Reclassifications

Certain prior years’ data presented in the financial statements have been reclassified to conform
to current year presentation. For presentation purposes, the statements of income for the prior
periods presented have been modified within the operating expenses section to combine the line
items “Other operations” and “Maintenance” into a single line item entitled “Other operations and
maintenance.” In addition, the statements of income were modified to report a separate line item
for “Allowance for equity funds used during construction” previously included in “Other income and
expense, net.” In conjunction with such modification, the Company modified its statement of cash
flows within the operating activities section to present a separate line item for “Allowance for
equity funds used during construction” previously included in “Other, net.” The balance sheet at
December 31, 2007 was modified to present
a separate line for “Liabilities for risk management activities” previously included in “Other.”
These reclassifications had no effect on total assets, net income, or cash flows.

Affiliate Transactions

The Company has an agreement with SCS under which the following services are rendered to the
Company at direct or allocated cost: general and design engineering, purchasing, accounting and
statistical analysis, finance and treasury, tax, information resources, marketing, auditing,
insurance and pension administration, human resources, systems and procedures, digital wireless
communications, and other services with respect to business and operations and power pool
operations. Costs for these services amounted to $86 million, $73 million, and $59 million during
2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. Cost allocation methodologies used by SCS were approved by the
Securities and Exchange Commission prior to the repeal of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of
1935, as amended, and management believes they are reasonable. The FERC permits services to be
rendered at cost by system service companies.

The Company has agreements with Georgia Power and Mississippi Power under which the Company owns a
portion of Plant Scherer
and Plant Daniel, respectively. Georgia Power operates Plant Scherer and Mississippi Power
operates Plant Daniel. The Company reimbursed Georgia Power $8.1 million, $5.1 million, and
$8.0 million, and Mississippi Power $22.8 million, $23.1 million, and $19.7 million in 2008, 2007,
and 2006, respectively, for its proportionate share of related expenses. See Note 4 and Note 7
under “Operating Leases” for additional information.

II-272


NOTES (continued)

Gulf Power Company 2008 Annual Report

The Company entered into a power purchase agreement (PPA), with Southern Power for a total of
approximately 292 megawatts annually from June 2009 through May 2014. The PPA was the result of a
competitive request for proposal process initiated by the Company in January 2006 to address the
anticipated need for additional capacity beginning in 2009. In May 2007, the Florida PSC issued an
order approving the PPA for purpose of cost recovery through the Company’s purchased power capacity
clause. The PPA with Southern Power was approved by the FERC in July 2007.

The Company provides incidental services to and receives such services from other Southern Company
subsidiaries which are generally minor in duration and amount. There were no significant services
provided or received in 2008, 2007, and 2006.

The traditional operating companies, including the Company, and Southern Power jointly enter into
various types of wholesale energy, natural gas, and certain other contracts, either directly or
through SCS, as agent. Each participating company may be jointly and severally liable for the
obligations incurred under these agreements. See Note 7 under “Fuel Commitments” for additional
information.

In 2008, the Company sold a turbine rotor assembly and a distance piece component to Southern Power
for $9.4 million and $0.7 million, respectively. In 2007, the Company purchased a compressor
assembly from Georgia Power and a turbine rotor assembly from Southern Power for $4.0 million and
$7.9 million, respectively. The affiliate transactions were made in accordance with FERC and state
PSC rules and guidelines. The purchases are included in property, plant, and equipment in the
balance sheets.

Regulatory Assets and Liabilities

The Company is subject to the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement
No. 71, “Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation” (SFAS No. 71). Regulatory
assets represent probable future revenues associated with certain costs that are expected to be
recovered from customers through the ratemaking process. Regulatory liabilities represent probable
future reductions in revenues associated with amounts that are expected to be credited to customers
through the ratemaking process. Regulatory assets and (liabilities) reflected in the balance sheets
at December 31 relate to:

NOTES (continued)

Gulf Power Company 2008 Annual Report

In the event that a portion of the Company’s operations is no longer subject to the provisions of
SFAS No. 71, the Company would be required to write off or reclassify to accumulated other
comprehensive income related regulatory assets and liabilities that are not specifically
recoverable through regulated rates. In addition, the Company would be required to determine if
any impairment to other assets, including plant assets, exists and write down the assets, if
impaired, to their fair values. All regulatory assets and liabilities are reflected in rates.

Revenues

Energy and other revenues are recognized as services are provided. Unbilled revenues related to
retail sales are accrued at the end of each fiscal period. Wholesale capacity revenues are
generally recognized on a levelized basis over the appropriate contract period. The Company’s
retail electric rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, the
energy component of purchased power costs, and certain other costs. The Company continuously
monitors the over or under recovered fuel cost balance in light of the inherent variability in fuel
costs. The Company is required to notify the Florida PSC if the projected fuel cost over or under
recovery is expected to exceed 10% of the projected fuel revenue applicable for the period and
indicate if an adjustment to the fuel cost recovery factor is being requested. The Company has
similar retail cost recovery clauses for energy conservation costs, purchased power capacity costs,
and environmental compliance costs. Revenues are adjusted for differences between these actual
costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates. Under or over recovered regulatory clause
revenues are recorded in the balance sheets and are recovered or returned to customers through
adjustments to the billing factors. Annually, the Company petitions for recovery of projected
costs including any true-up amount from prior periods, and approved rates are implemented each
January. In November 2008, the Florida PSC approved billing factors for 2009 intended to allow the
Company to recover projected 2009 costs as well as refund or collect the 2008 over or under
recovered amounts in 2009. See Note 3 under “Regulatory Matters — Fuel Cost Recovery” for
additional information.

The Company has a diversified base of customers. No single customer or industry comprises 10% or
more of revenues. For all periods presented, uncollectible accounts averaged less than 1% of
revenues.

Fuel Costs

Fuel costs are expensed as the fuel is used.

Income and Other Taxes

The Company uses the liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes and provides deferred
income taxes for all significant income tax temporary differences. Investment tax credits utilized
are deferred and amortized to income over the average life of the related property. Taxes that are
collected from customers on behalf of governmental agencies to be remitted to these agencies are
presented net on the statements of income.

In accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes” (FIN
48), the Company recognizes tax positions that are “more likely than not” of being sustained upon
examination by the appropriate taxing authorities. See Note 5 under “Unrecognized Tax Benefits”
for additional information.

Property, Plant, and Equipment

Property, plant, and equipment is stated at original cost less regulatory disallowances and
impairments. Original cost includes: materials; labor; minor items of property; appropriate
administrative and general costs; payroll-related costs such as taxes, pensions, and other
benefits; and the interest capitalized and/or cost of funds used during construction.

The cost of replacements of property, exclusive of minor items of property, is capitalized. The
cost of maintenance, repairs, and replacement of minor items of property is charged to maintenance
expense as incurred or performed.

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation of the original cost of utility plant in service is provided primarily by using
composite straight-line rates, which approximated 3.4% in 2008, 3.4% in 2007, and 3.7% in 2006.
Depreciation studies are conducted periodically to update the composite rates. These studies are
approved by the Florida PSC. When property subject to depreciation is retired or otherwise
disposed of in the normal course of business, its original cost, together with the cost of removal,
less salvage, is charged to accumulated depreciation. For other property dispositions, the
applicable cost and accumulated depreciation is removed from the balance sheet accounts and a gain
or loss is recognized. Minor items of property included in the original cost of the plant are
retired when the related property unit is retired.

Asset Retirement Obligations and Other Costs of Removal

Asset retirement obligations are computed as the present value of the ultimate costs for an asset’s
future retirement and are recorded in the period in which the liability is incurred. The costs are
capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset’s useful life.
The Company has received an order from the Florida PSC allowing the continued accrual of other
future retirement costs for long-lived assets that the Company does not have a legal obligation to
retire. Accordingly, the accumulated removal costs for these obligations will continue to be
reflected in the balance sheets as a regulatory liability.

The liability recognized to retire long-lived assets primarily relates to the Company’s combustion
turbines at its Pea Ridge facility, various landfill sites, a barge unloading dock, asbestos
removal, ash ponds, and disposal of polychlorinated biphenyls in certain transformers. The Company
also has identified retirement obligations related to certain transmission and distribution
facilities, certain wireless communication towers, and certain structures authorized by the United
States Army Corps of Engineers. However, liabilities for the removal of these assets have not been
recorded because the range of time over which the Company may settle these obligations is unknown
and cannot be reasonably estimated. The Company will continue to recognize in the statements of
income allowed removal costs in accordance with its regulatory treatment. Any differences between
costs recognized under FASB Statement No. 143 “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations” and
FASB Interpretation No. 47, “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations” and those
reflected in rates are recognized as either a regulatory asset or liability, as ordered by the
Florida PSC, and are reflected in the balance sheets.

Gulf Power Company 2008 Annual Report

Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC)

In accordance with regulatory treatment, the Company records AFUDC, which represents the estimated
debt and equity costs of capital funds that are necessary to finance the construction of new
regulated facilities. While cash is not realized currently from such allowance, it increases the
revenue requirement over the service life of the plant through a higher rate base and higher
depreciation expense. The equity component of AFUDC is not included in calculating taxable income.
The average annual AFUDC rate was 7.65%, 7.48%, and 7.48%, respectively, for the years 2008, 2007,
and 2006. AFUDC, net of taxes, as a percentage of net income after dividends on preference stock
was 12.62%, 3.59%, and 0.61%, respectively, for 2008, 2007, and 2006.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles

The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. The determination of
whether an impairment has occurred is based on either a specific regulatory disallowance or an
estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets, as compared with the
carrying value of the assets. If an impairment has occurred, the amount of the impairment
recognized is determined by either the amount of regulatory disallowance or by estimating the fair
value of the assets and recording a loss if the carrying value is greater than the fair value. For
assets identified as held for sale, the carrying value is compared to the estimated fair value less
the cost to sell in order to determine if an impairment loss is required. Until the assets are
disposed of, their estimated fair value is re-evaluated when circumstances or events change.

Property Damage Reserve

The Company accrues for the cost of repairing damages from major storms and other uninsured
property damages, including uninsured damages to transmission and distribution facilities,
generation facilities, and other property. The cost of such damages is charged to the reserve.
The Florida PSC approved annual accrual to the property damage reserve is $3.5 million, with a
target level for the reserve between $25.1 million and $36.0 million. The Florida PSC also
authorized the Company to make additional accruals above the $3.5 million at the Company’s
discretion. The Company accrued total expenses of $3.5 million in 2008, $3.5 million in 2007, and
$6.5 million in 2006. As of December 31, 2008, the balance in the Company’s property damage
reserve totaled approximately $9.8 million, which is included in deferred liabilities in the
balance sheets. See Note 3 under “Retail Regulatory Matters — Storm Damage Cost Recovery” for
additional information regarding the surcharge mechanism approved by the Florida PSC to replenish
these reserves.

Injuries and Damages Reserve

The Company is subject to claims and suits arising in the ordinary course of business. As
permitted by the Florida PSC, the Company accrues for the uninsured costs of injuries and damages
by charges to income amounting to $1.6 million annually. The Florida PSC has also given the
Company the flexibility to increase its annual accrual above $1.6 million to the extent the balance
in the reserve does not exceed $2 million and to defer expense recognition of liabilities greater
than the balance in the reserve. The cost of settling claims is charged to the reserve. The
injuries and damages reserve was $2.5 million and $2.2 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
respectively, and is included in Current Liabilities in the balance sheets. Liabilities in excess
of the reserve balance of $0.8 million and $0.8 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
respectively, are included in Deferred Credits and Other Liabilities in the balance sheets.
Corresponding regulatory assets of $0.8 million and $0.8 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
respectively, are included in Current Assets in the balance sheets.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

For purposes of the financial statements, temporary cash investments are considered cash
equivalents. Temporary cash investments are securities with original maturities of 90 days or
less.

Materials and Supplies

Generally, materials and supplies include the average cost of transmission, distribution, and
generating plant materials. Materials are charged to inventory when purchased and then expensed or
capitalized to plant, as appropriate, at weighted average cost when installed.

II-276


NOTES (continued)

Gulf Power Company 2008 Annual Report

Fuel Inventory

Fuel inventory includes the average costs of oil, coal, natural gas, and emission allowances. Fuel
is charged to inventory when purchased and then expensed as used and recovered through fuel cost
recovery rates approved by the Florida PSC. Emission allowances granted by the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) are included in inventory at zero cost.

Financial Instruments

The Company uses derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to fluctuations in interest
rates, the prices of certain fuel purchases, and electricity purchases and sales. All derivative
financial instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities (categorized in “Other” or
shown separately as “Risk Management Activities”) and are measured at fair value. See Note 9 for
additional information. Substantially all of the Company’s bulk energy purchases and sales
contracts that meet the definition of a derivative are exempt from fair value accounting
requirements and are accounted for under the accrual method. Other derivative contracts qualify as
cash flow hedges of anticipated transactions or are recoverable through the Florida PSC-approved
hedging program. This results in the deferral of related gains and losses in other comprehensive
income or regulatory assets and liabilities, respectively, until the hedged transactions occur.
Any ineffectiveness arising from cash flow hedges is recognized currently in net income. Other
derivative contracts are marked to market through current period income and are recorded on a net
basis in the statements of income. See Note 6 under “Financial Instruments” for additional
information.

The Company does not offset fair value amounts recognized for multiple derivative instruments
executed with the same counterparty under a master netting arrangement. Additionally, the Company
has no outstanding collateral repayment obligations or rights to reclaim collateral arising from
derivative instruments recognized at December 31, 2008.

The Company is exposed to losses related to financial instruments in the event of counterparties’
nonperformance. The Company has established controls to determine and monitor the creditworthiness
of counterparties in order to mitigate the Company’s exposure to counterparty credit risk.

Other financial instruments for which the carrying amounts did not equal fair values at December 31
were as follows:

Long-term debt:


$

849,265

The fair values were based on either closing market prices (Level 1) or closing prices of
comparable instruments (Level 2). See Note 9 for all other items recognized at fair value in the
financial statements.

Comprehensive Income

The objective of comprehensive income is to report a measure of all changes in common stock equity
of an enterprise that result from transactions and other economic events of the period other than
transactions with owners. Comprehensive income consists of net income and changes in the fair
value of qualifying cash flow hedges, and prior to the adoption of SFAS No.158, “Employers’
Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans” (SFAS No. 158) the minimum
pension liability, less income taxes and reclassifications for amounts included in net income.

Variable Interest Entities

The primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity must consolidate the related assets and
liabilities. The Company had established certain wholly-owned trusts to issue preferred
securities. The Company is not considered the primary beneficiary of the trusts. Therefore, the
investments in these trusts were reflected as Other Investments for the Company, and the related
loans from the trusts were included in Long-term Debt in the balance sheets. In November 2007, the
Company redeemed $41.2 million of its Series E Junior Subordinated Notes and the related trust
preferred and common securities of Gulf Power Capital Trust IV. As of December 31, 2008, the
Company no longer had any outstanding trust preferred securities. See Note 6 under “Long-Term Debt
Payable to Affiliated Trusts” for additional information.

2.  RETIREMENT BENEFITS

The Company has a defined benefit, trusteed, pension plan covering substantially all employees.
The plan is funded in accordance with requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
of 1974, as amended (ERISA). No contributions to the plan are expected for the year ending
December 31, 2009. The Company also provides a defined benefit pension plan for a selected group
of management and highly compensated employees. Benefits under this non-qualified plan are funded
on a cash basis. In addition, the Company provides certain medical care and life insurance
benefits for retired employees through other postretirement benefit plans. The Company funds
related trusts to the extent required by the FERC. For the year ending December 31, 2009,
postretirement trust contributions are expected to total approximately $34,000.

The measurement date for plan assets and obligations for 2008 was December 31 while the measurement
date for prior years was September 30. Pursuant to SFAS No. 158, the Company was required to
change the measurement date for its defined benefit postretirement plans from September 30 to
December 31 beginning with the year ending December 31, 2008. As permitted, the Company adopted
the measurement date provisions of SFAS No. 158 effective January 1, 2008 resulting in an increase
in long-term liabilities of approximately $1.4 million and an increase in prepaid pension costs of
approximately $0.6 million.

Pension Plans

The total accumulated benefit obligation for the pension plans was $243 million in 2008 and
$230 million in 2007. Changes during the 15-month period ended December 31, 2008 and the 12-month
period ended September 30, 2007 in the projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan
assets were as follows:

At December 31, 2008, the projected benefit obligations for the qualified and non-qualified pension
plans were $247.9 million and $12.9 million, respectively. All pension plan assets are related to
the qualified pension plan.

Pension plan assets are managed and invested in accordance with all applicable requirements,
including ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Internal Revenue Code). The
Company’s investment policy covers a diversified mix of assets, including equity and fixed income
securities, real estate, and private equity. Derivative instruments are used primarily as hedging
tools but may also be used to gain efficient exposure to the various asset classes. The Company
primarily minimizes the risk of large losses through diversification but also monitors and manages
other aspects of risk.

Net periodic pension cost (income) is the sum of service cost, interest cost, and other costs
netted against the expected return on plan assets. The expected return on plan assets is
determined by multiplying the expected rate of return on plan assets and the market-related value
of plan assets. In determining the market-related value of plan assets, the Company has elected to
amortize changes in the market value of all plan assets over five years rather than recognize the
changes immediately. As a result, the accounting value of plan assets that is used to calculate
the expected return on plan assets differs from the current fair value of the plan assets.

Future benefit payments reflect expected future service and are estimated based on assumptions used
to measure the projected benefit obligation for the pension plans. At December 31, 2008, estimated
benefit payments were as follows:

Gulf Power Company 2008 Annual Report

The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (Medicare Act) provides
a 28% prescription drug subsidy for Medicare eligible retirees. The effect of the subsidy reduced
the Company’s expenses for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006 by approximately $1.4
million, $1.5 million, and $1.7 million, respectively.

Future benefit payments, including prescription drug benefits, reflect expected future service and

Actuarial Assumptions

The weighted average rates assumed in the actuarial calculations used to determine both the benefit
obligations as of the measurement date and the net periodic costs for the pension and other
postretirement benefit plans for the following year are presented below. Net periodic benefit
costs were calculated in 2005 for the 2006 plan year using a discount rate of 5.50%.

An additional assumption used in measuring the APBO was a weighted average medical care cost trend
rate of 9.15% for 2009, decreasing gradually to 5.50% through the year 2015 and remaining at that
level thereafter. An annual increase or decrease in the assumed medical care cost trend rate of 1%

3.  CONTINGENCIES AND REGULATORY MATTERS

General Litigation Matters

The Company is subject to certain claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of
business. In addition, the Company’s business activities are subject to extensive governmental
regulation related to public health and the environment. Litigation over environmental issues and
claims of various types, including property damage, personal injury, common law nuisance, and
citizen enforcement of environmental requirements such as opacity and air and water quality
standards, has increased generally throughout the United States. In particular, personal injury
claims for damages caused by alleged exposure to hazardous materials have become more frequent.
The ultimate outcome of such pending or potential litigation against the Company cannot be
predicted at this time; however, for current proceedings not specifically reported herein,
management does not anticipate that the liabilities, if any, arising from such current proceedings
would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial statements.

Environmental Matters

New Source Review Actions

In November 1999, the EPA brought a civil action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of Georgia against certain Southern Company subsidiaries, including Alabama Power and
Georgia Power, alleging that these subsidiaries had violated the New Source Review (NSR) provisions
of the Clean Air Act and related state laws at certain coal-fired generating facilities. The EPA
concurrently issued notices of violation relating to the Company’s Plant Crist and a unit at
Georgia Power’s Plant Scherer that is partially owned by the Company. In early 2000, the EPA filed
a motion to amend its complaint to add the allegations in the notice of violation and to add the
Company as a defendant. However, in March 2001, the court denied the motion based on lack of
jurisdiction, and the EPA has not refiled. After Alabama Power was dismissed from the original
action for jurisdictional reasons, the EPA filed a separate action in January 2001 against Alabama
Power in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama. In these lawsuits, the EPA
alleged that NSR violations occurred at eight coal-fired generating facilities operated by Alabama
Power and Georgia Power. The civil actions request penalties and injunctive relief, including an
order requiring installation of the best available control technology at the affected units. The
action against Georgia Power has been administratively closed since the spring of 2001, and the
case has not been reopened.

In June 2006, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama entered a consent decree
between Alabama Power and the EPA, resolving a portion of the Alabama Power lawsuit relating to the
alleged NSR violations at Plant Miller. The consent decree required Alabama Power to pay $100,000
to resolve the government’s claim for a civil penalty and to donate $4.9 million of sulfur dioxide
emission allowances to a nonprofit charitable organization. It also formalized specific emissions
reductions to be accomplished by Alabama Power, consistent with other Clean Air Act programs that
require emissions reductions. In August 2006, the district court in Alabama granted Alabama
Power’s motion for summary judgment and entered final judgment in favor of Alabama Power on the
EPA’s claims related to all of the remaining plants: Plants Barry, Gaston, Gorgas, and Greene
County.

The plaintiffs appealed the district court’s decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh
Circuit, where it was stayed, pending the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in a similar case against
Duke Energy. The Supreme Court issued its decision in the Duke Energy case in April 2007, and in
December 2007, the Eleventh Circuit vacated the district court’s decision in the Alabama Power case
and remanded the case back to the district court for consideration of the legal issues in light of
the Supreme Court’s decision in the Duke Energy case. On July 24, 2008, the U.S. District Court
for the Northern District of Alabama granted partial summary judgment in favor of Alabama Power
regarding the proper legal test for determining whether projects are routine maintenance, repair,
and replacement and therefore are excluded from NSR permitting. The ultimate outcome of these
matters cannot be determined at this time.

The Company believes that it complied with applicable laws and the EPA regulations and
interpretations in effect at the time the work in question took place. The Clean Air Act
authorizes maximum civil penalties of $25,000 to $37,500 per day, per violation at each generating
unit, depending on the date of the alleged violation. An adverse outcome in this matter could
require substantial capital expenditures or affect the timing of currently budgeted capital
expenditures that cannot be determined at this time and could possibly require payment of
substantial penalties. Such expenditures could affect future results of operations, cash flows,
and financial condition if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates.

Carbon Dioxide Litigation

New York Case

In July 2004, three environmental groups and attorneys general from eight states, each outside of
Southern Company’s service territory, and the corporation counsel for New York City filed
complaints in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against Southern
Company and four other electric power companies. The complaints allege that the companies’
emissions of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, contribute to global warming, which the plaintiffs
assert is a public nuisance. Under common law public and private nuisance theories, the plaintiffs
seek a judicial order (1) holding each defendant jointly and severally liable for creating,
contributing to, and/or maintaining global warming and (2) requiring each of the defendants to cap
its emissions of carbon dioxide and then reduce those emissions by a specified percentage each year
for at least a decade. The plaintiffs have not, however, requested that damages be awarded in
connection with their claims. Southern Company believes these claims are without merit and notes
that the complaint cites no statutory or regulatory basis for the claims. In September 2005, the
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York granted Southern Company’s and the other
defendants’ motions to dismiss these cases. The plaintiffs filed an appeal to the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit in October 2005, but no decision has been issued. The ultimate
outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Kivalina Case

On February 26, 2008, the Native Village of Kivalina and the City of Kivalina filed a suit in the
U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against several electric utilities
(including Southern Company), several oil companies, and a coal company. The plaintiffs are the
governing bodies of an Inupiat village in Alaska. The plaintiffs contend that the village is being
destroyed by erosion allegedly caused by global warming that the plaintiffs attribute to emissions
of greenhouse gases by the defendants. The plaintiffs assert claims for public and private
nuisance and contend that the defendants have acted in concert and are therefore jointly and
severally liable for the plaintiffs’ damages. The suit seeks damages for lost property values and
for the cost of relocating the village, which is alleged to be $95 million to $400 million. On
June 30, 2008, all defendants filed motions to dismiss this case. Southern Company believes that
these claims are without merit and notes that the complaint cites no statutory or regulatory basis
for the claims. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Environmental Remediation

The Company must comply with other environmental laws and regulations that cover the handling and
disposal of waste and releases of hazardous substances. Under these various laws and regulations,
the Company may also incur substantial costs to clean up properties. The Company received
authority from the Florida PSC to recover approved environmental compliance costs through the
environmental cost recovery clause. The Florida PSC reviews costs and adjusts rates up or down
annually.

The Company’s environmental remediation liability includes estimated costs of environmental
remediation projects of approximately $66.8 million as of December 31, 2008. These estimated costs
relate to site closure criteria by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) for
potential impacts to soil and groundwater from herbicide applications at the Company’s substations.
The schedule for completion of the remediation projects will be subject to FDEP approval. The
projects have been approved by the Florida PSC for recovery through the Company’s environmental
cost recovery clause; therefore, there is no impact to net income as a result of these liabilities.

The final outcome of these matters cannot now be determined. However, based on the currently known
conditions at these sites and the nature and extent of activities relating to these sites, the
Company does not believe that additional liabilities, if any, at these sites would be material to
the Company’s financial statements.

FERC Matters

Market-Based Rate Authority

The Company has authorization from the FERC to sell power to non-affiliates, including short-term
opportunity sales, at market-based prices. Specific FERC approval must be obtained with respect to
a market-based contract with an affiliate.

II-285


NOTES (continued)

Gulf Power Company 2008 Annual Report

In December 2004, the FERC initiated a proceeding to assess Southern Company’s generation dominance
within its retail service territory. The ability to charge market-based rates in other markets is
not an issue in the proceeding. Any new market-based rate sales by the Company in Southern
Company’s retail service territory entered into during a 15-month refund period that ended in May
2006 could be subject to refund to a cost-based rate level.

In November 2007, the presiding administrative law judge issued an initial decision regarding the
methodology to be used in the generation dominance tests. The proceedings are ongoing. The
ultimate outcome of this generation dominance proceeding cannot now be determined, but an adverse
decision by the FERC in a final order could require the Company to charge cost-based rates for
certain wholesale sales in the Southern Company retail service territory, which may be lower than
negotiated market-based rates, and could also result in total refunds of up to $0.8 million, plus
interest. The Company believes that there is no meritorious basis for an adverse decision in this
proceeding and is vigorously defending itself in this matter.

In June 2007, the FERC issued its final rule in Order No. 697 regarding market-based rate
authority. The FERC generally retained its current market-based rate standards. Responding to a
number of requests for rehearing, the FERC issued Order No. 697-A on April 21, 2008 and Order No.
697-B on December 12, 2008. These orders largely affirmed the FERC’s prior revision and
codification of the regulations governing market-based rates for public utilities. In accordance
with the orders, Southern Company submitted to the FERC an updated market power analysis on
September 2, 2008 related to its continued market-based rate authority. The ultimate outcome of
this matter cannot now be determined.

On October 17, 2008, Southern Company filed with the FERC a revised market-based rate (MBR) tariff
and a new cost-based rate (CBR) tariff.   The revised MBR tariff provides for a “must offer” energy
auction whereby Southern Company, offers all of its available energy for sale in a day-ahead
auction and an hour-ahead auction with reserve prices not to exceed the CBR tariff price, after
considering Southern Company’s native load requirements, reliability obligations, and sales
commitments to third parties. All sales under the energy auction would be at market clearing
prices established under the auction rules. The new CBR tariff provides for a cost-based price for
wholesale sales of less than a year. On December 18, 2008, the FERC issued an order conditionally
accepting the MBR tariff subject to certain revisions to the auction proposal. On January 21,
2009, Southern Company made a compliance filing that accepted all the conditions of the MBR tariff
order. When this order becomes final, Southern Company will have 30 days to implement the
wholesale auction. On December 31, 2008, the FERC issued an order conditionally accepting the CBR
tariff subject to providing additional information concerning one aspect of the tariff. On January
30, 2009, Southern Company filed a response addressing the FERC inquiry to the CBR tariff order.
Implementation of the energy auction in accordance with the MBR tariff order is expected to
adequately mitigate going forward any presumption of market power that Southern Company may have in
the Southern Company retail service territory. The timing of when FERC may issue the final orders
on the MBR and CBR tariffs and the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this
time.

Intercompany Interchange Contract

The Company’s generation fleet is operated under the Intercompany Interchange Contract (IIC), as
approved by the FERC. In May 2005, the FERC initiated a new proceeding to examine (1) the
provisions of the IIC among the traditional operating companies (including the Company), Southern
Power, and SCS, as agent, under the terms of which the power pool of Southern Company is operated,
(2) whether any parties to the IIC have violated the FERC’s standards of conduct applicable to
utility companies that are transmission providers, and (3) whether Southern Company’s code of
conduct defining Southern Power as a “system company” rather than a “marketing affiliate” is just
and reasonable. In connection with the formation of Southern Power, the FERC authorized Southern
Power’s inclusion in the IIC in 2000. The FERC also previously approved Southern Company’s code of
conduct.

In October 2006, the FERC issued an order accepting a settlement resolving the proceeding subject
to Southern Company’s agreement to accept certain modifications to the settlement’s terms and
Southern Company notified the FERC that it accepted the modifications. The modifications largely
involve functional separation and information restrictions related to marketing activities
conducted on behalf of Southern Power. In November 2006, Southern Company filed with the FERC a
compliance plan in connection with the order. In April 2007, the FERC approved, with certain
modifications, the plan submitted by Southern Company. Implementation of the plan did not have a
material impact on the Company’s financial statements. In November 2007 Southern Company notified
the FERC that the plan had been implemented. On December 12, 2008 the FERC division of audits
issued for public comment its final audit report pertaining to compliance implementation and
related matters. No comments challenging the audits report’s findings were submitted. A decision
is now pending from the FERC.

Gulf Power Company 2008 Annual Report

Retail Regulatory Matters

Fuel Cost Recovery

The Company petitions for fuel cost recovery rates to be approved by the Florida PSC on an annual
basis. The Company continuously monitors the under recovered fuel cost balance in light of the
inherent variability in fuel costs. If the projected fuel cost over or under recovery exceeds 10%
of the projected fuel revenue applicable for the period, the Company is required to notify the
Florida PSC and indicate if an adjustment to the fuel cost recovery is being requested.

On July 29, 2008, the Florida PSC approved a request by the Company to increase the fuel cost
recovery factor effective with billings beginning September 2008. The remaining portion of the
projected under recovered balance is expected to be recovered in 2009. On September 2, 2008, the
Company filed its 2009 projected fuel cost recovery filing with the Florida PSC which includes the
fuel factors proposed for January 2009 through December 2009. On October 13, 2008, the Company
notified the Florida PSC that the updated projected fuel cost under recovery balance at year-end
exceeds the 10% threshold, but no adjustment to the fuel factors were requested.

On November 6, 2008, the Florida PSC approved an increase of approximately 12.9% in the fuel factor
for retail customers, effective with billings beginning January 2009. The fuel factors are
intended to allow the Company to recover its projected 2009 fuel and purchased power costs as well
as the 2008 under recovered amounts in 2009. Fuel cost recovery revenues, as recorded on the
financial statements, are adjusted for differences in actual recoverable costs and amounts billed
in current regulated rates. Accordingly, changing the billing factor has no significant effect on
the Company’s revenues or net income, but does impact annual cash flow. As of December 31, 2008,
the Company had an under recovered fuel balance of approximately $97 million, which is included in
current assets in the balance sheets.

Environmental Cost Recovery

The Florida Legislature adopted legislation for an environmental cost recovery clause, which allows
an electric utility to petition the Florida PSC for recovery of prudent environmental compliance
costs that are not being recovered through base rates or any other recovery mechanism. Such
environmental costs include operation and maintenance expense, emission allowance expense,
depreciation, and a return on invested capital. This legislation also allows recovery of costs
incurred as a result of an agreement between the Company and the FDEP for the purpose of ensuring
compliance with ozone ambient air quality standards adopted by the EPA. In August 2007, the
Florida PSC voted to approve a stipulation among the Company, the Office of Public Counsel, and the
Florida Industrial Power Users Group regarding the Company’s plan for complying with certain
federal and state regulations addressing air quality. The Company’s environmental compliance plan
as filed in March 2007 contemplates implementation of specific projects identified in the plan from
2007 through 2018. The stipulation covers all elements of the current plan that are scheduled to
be implemented in the 2007 through 2011 timeframe. On September 18, 2008, the Company filed an
update to the plan which was approved by the Florida PSC on November 4, 2008. The Florida PSC
acknowledged that the costs associated with the Company’s Clean Air Interstate Rule/Clean Air
Mercury Rule/Clean Air Visibility Rule compliance plan are eligible for recovery through the
environmental cost recovery clause. During 2008, 2007, and 2006, the Company recorded
environmental cost recovery clause revenues of $50.0 million, $43.6 million, and $40.9 million,
respectively. Annually, the Company seeks recovery of projected costs including any true-up
amounts from prior periods. At December 31, 2008, the over recovered balance was approximately
$71,000.

Storm Damage Cost Recovery

Under authority granted by the Florida PSC, the Company maintains a reserve for property damage to
cover the cost of uninsured damages from major storms to its transmission and distribution
facilities, generation facilities, and other property.

In July 2006, the Florida PSC issued an order (2006 Order) approving a stipulation and settlement
between the Company and several consumer groups that resolved all matters relating to the Company’s
request for recovery of incurred costs for storm-recovery activities and the replenishment of the
Company’s property damage reserve. The 2006 Order provided for an extension of the storm-recovery
surcharge then being collected by the Company for an additional 27 months, expiring in June 2009.

Funds collected by the Company related to the storm-recovery costs associated with previous
hurricanes had been fully recovered by August 2008. Funds collected by the Company through its
storm-recovery surcharge are now being credited to the property damage reserve and will continue
through June 2009 when the approved surcharge ends.

II-287


NOTES (continued)

Gulf Power Company 2008 Annual Report

According to the 2006 Order, in the case of future storms, if the Company incurs cumulative costs
for storm-recovery activities in excess of $10 million during any calendar year, the Company will
be permitted to file a streamlined formal request for an interim surcharge. Any interim surcharge
would provide for the recovery, subject to refund, of up to 80% of the claimed costs for
storm-recovery activities. The Company would then petition the Florida PSC for full recovery
through a final or non-interim surcharge or other cost recovery mechanism.

See Note 1 under “Property Damage Reserve” for additional information.

4.  JOINT OWNERSHIP AGREEMENTS

The Company and Mississippi Power jointly own Plant Daniel Units 1 and 2, which together represent
capacity of 1,000 megawatts. Plant Daniel is a generating plant located in Jackson County,
Mississippi. In accordance with the operating agreement, Mississippi Power acts as the Company’s
agent with respect to the construction, operation, and maintenance of these units.

The Company and Georgia Power jointly own the 818 megawatts capacity Plant Scherer Unit 3. Plant
Scherer is a generating plant located near Forsyth, Georgia. In accordance with the operating
agreement, Georgia Power acts as the Company’s agent with respect to the construction, operation,
and maintenance of the unit.

The Company’s pro rata share of expenses related to both plants is included in the corresponding
operating expense accounts in the statements of income and the Company is responsible for providing
its own financing.

At December 31, 2008, the Company’s percentage ownership and its investment in these jointly owned
facilities were as follows:

Southern Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and combined State of Mississippi
and State of Georgia income tax returns. Under a joint consolidated income tax allocation
agreement, each subsidiary’s current and deferred tax expense is computed on a stand-alone basis
and no subsidiary is allocated more expense than would be paid if it filed a separate income tax
return. In accordance with Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regulations, each company is jointly and
severally liable for the tax liability.

At December 31, 2008, the tax-related regulatory assets to be recovered from customers were $24.2
million. These assets are attributable to tax benefits flowed through to customers in prior years
and to taxes applicable to capitalized allowance for funds used during construction. At
December 31, 2008, the tax-related regulatory liabilities to be credited to customers were
$13.0 million. These liabilities are attributable to deferred taxes previously recognized at rates
higher than the current enacted tax law and to unamortized investment tax credits.

In accordance with regulatory requirements, deferred investment tax credits are amortized over the
lives of the related property with such amortization normally applied as a credit to reduce
depreciation in the statements of income. Credits amortized in this manner amounted to $1.7
million in 2008, $1.7 million in 2007, and $1.8 million in 2006. At December 31, 2008, all
investment tax credits available to reduce federal income taxes payable had been utilized.

NOTES (continued)

Gulf Power Company 2008 Annual Report

The decrease in the 2008 effective tax rate is primarily the result of an increase in nontaxable
allowance for equity funds used during construction.

The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 created a tax deduction for a portion of income attributable
to U.S. production activities as defined in Internal Revenue Code Section 199 (production
activities deduction). The deduction is equal to a stated percentage of qualified production
activities net income. The percentage is phased in over the years 2005 through 2010 with a 3% rate
applicable to the years 2005 and 2006, a 6% rate applicable for years 2007 through 2009, and a 9%
rate thereafter. The increase from 3% in 2006 to 6% in 2007 was one of several factors that
increased the Company’s 2007 deduction by $4 million over the 2006 deduction. The resulting
additional tax benefit was over $1 million. The IRS has not clearly defined a methodology for
calculating this deduction. However, Southern Company has agreed with the IRS on a calculation
methodology and signed a closing agreement on December 11, 2008. Therefore, the Company reversed
the unrecognized tax benefit and adjusted the deduction for all previous years to conform to the
agreement which resulted in a decrease in the 2008 deduction when compared to the 2007 deduction.
The net impact of the reversal of unrecognized tax benefits combined with the true-up to the new
methodology was immaterial.

Unrecognized Tax Benefits

FIN 48 requires companies to determine whether it is “more likely than not” that a tax position
will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities before any part of the
benefit can be recorded in the financial statements. It also provides guidance on the recognition,
measurement, and classification of income tax uncertainties, along with any related interest and
penalties. For 2008, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits decreased by $0.6 million,
resulting in a balance of $0.3 million as of December 31, 2008.

Changes during the year in unrecognized tax benefits were as follows:

NOTES (continued)

Gulf Power Company 2008 Annual Report

The IRS has audited and closed all tax returns prior to 2004. The audits for the state returns
have either been concluded, or the statute of limitations has expired, for years prior to 2002.

It is reasonably possible that the amount of the unrecognized benefit with respect to the majority
of the Company’s unrecognized tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next
12 months. The possible conclusion or settlement of federal or state audits could impact the
balances significantly. At this time, an estimate of the range of reasonably possible outcomes
cannot be determined.

6.  FINANCING

Long-Term Debt Payable to Affiliated Trusts

The Company has formed certain wholly owned trust subsidiaries for the purpose of issuing preferred
securities. The proceeds of the related equity investments and preferred security sales were
loaned back to the Company through the issuance of junior subordinated notes which constitute
substantially all of the assets of these trusts and are reflected in the balance sheets as
Long-Term Debt. The Company considers that the mechanisms and obligations relating to the
preferred securities issued for its benefit, taken together, constitute a full and unconditional
guarantee by it of the trusts’ payment obligations with respect to these securities. During 2007,
the Company redeemed its last remaining series, which totaled $41.2 million. See Note 1 under
“Variable Interest Entities” for additional information on the accounting treatment for these
trusts and the related securities.

Bank Term Loans

In 2008, the Company borrowed $110 million under a three-year term loan agreement and $50 million
under a short-term loan agreement. The proceeds of these issuances were used for general corporate
purposes, including the Company’s continuous construction program.

Senior Notes

At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had a total of $588.7 million and $590.0 million of
senior notes outstanding, respectively. These senior notes are subordinate to all secured debt of
the Company which amounts to approximately $41 million at December 31, 2008.

Pollution Control Revenue Bonds

Pollution control obligations represent loans to the Company from public authorities of funds
derived from sales by such authorities of revenue bonds issued to finance pollution control
facilities. The Company has $157.6 million of outstanding pollution control revenue bonds and is
required to make payments sufficient for the authorities to meet principal and interest
requirements of such bonds.

Outstanding Classes of Capital Stock

The Company currently has preferred stock, Class A preferred stock, preference stock, and common
stock authorized. The Company’s preferred stock and Class A preferred stock, without preference
between classes, rank senior to the Company’s preference stock and common stock with respect to
payment of dividends and voluntary or involuntary dissolution. No shares of preferred stock or
Class A preferred stock were outstanding at December 31, 2008. The Company’s preference stock
ranks senior to the common stock with respect to the payment of dividends and voluntary or
involuntary dissolution. Certain series of the preference stock are subject to redemption at the
option of the Company on or after a specified date (typically 5 or 10 years after the date of
issuance) at a redemption price equal to 100% of the liquidation amount of the preference stock.
In addition, one series of the preference stock may be redeemed earlier at a redemption price equal
to 100% of the liquidation amount plus a make-whole premium based on the present value of the
liquidation amount and future dividends.

In January 2007, the Company issued to Southern Company 800,000 shares of the Company’s common
stock, without par value, and realized proceeds of $80 million. The proceeds were used to repay a
portion of the Company’s short-term indebtedness and for other general corporate purposes.
Subsequent to December 31, 2008, the Company issued to Southern Company 1,350,000 shares of the
Company’s common stock, without par value, and realized proceeds of $135 million.

II-291


NOTES (continued)

Gulf Power Company 2008 Annual Report

Dividend Restrictions

The Company can only pay dividends to Southern Company out of retained earnings or paid-in-capital.

Assets Subject to Lien

In January 2007, the Company’s first mortgage bond indenture was discharged. As a result, there
are no longer any first mortgage liens on the Company’s property and the Company no longer has to
comply with the covenants and restrictions of the first mortgage bond indenture. The Company has
granted a lien on its property at Plant Daniel in connection with the issuance of two series of
pollution control bonds with an outstanding principal amount of $41 million.

There are no agreements or other arrangements among the affiliated companies under which the assets
of one company have been pledged or otherwise made available to satisfy obligations of Southern
Company or any of its subsidiaries.

Bank Credit Arrangements

At December 31, 2008, the Company had $120 million of lines of credit with banks, all of which
remained unused. These bank credit arrangements will expire in 2009 and $90 million contain
provisions allowing one-year term loans executable at expiration. Of the $120 million,
$116 million provides liquidity support for the Company’s commercial paper program and $4 million
provides support for variable rate pollution control bonds. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, the
Company obtained an additional $20 million of committed credit. Commitment fees average less than
1/4 of 1% for the Company.

Certain credit arrangements contain covenants that limit the level of indebtedness to
capitalization to 65%, as defined in the arrangements. At December 31, 2008, the Company was in
compliance with these covenants.

In addition, certain credit arrangements contain cross default provisions to other indebtedness
that would trigger an event of default if the Company defaulted on indebtedness over a specified
threshold. The cross default provisions are restricted only to indebtedness of the Company. The
Company is currently in compliance with all such covenants.

The Company borrows primarily through a commercial paper program that has the liquidity support of
committed bank credit arrangements. The Company may also borrow through various other arrangements
with banks. At December 31, 2008, the Company had $89.9 million of commercial paper and $50
million of bank notes outstanding. At December 31, 2007, the Company had $40.8 million of
commercial paper outstanding. During 2008, the peak amount outstanding for short term debt was
$141.2 million and the average amount outstanding was $36.9 million. The average annual interest
rate on commercial paper was 2.2%.

Financial Instruments

The Company enters into energy-related derivatives to hedge exposures to electricity, gas, and
other fuel price changes. However, due to cost-based rate regulations, the Company has limited
exposure to market volatility in commodity fuel prices and prices of electricity. The Company has
implemented a fuel-hedging program per the guidelines of the Florida PSC. The Company enters into
hedges of forward electricity sales.

At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company had a net $31.2 million and $0.2 million fair value
liability, respectively, of energy-related derivative contracts designated as regulatory hedges in
the financial statements.

The gains and losses arising from these regulatory hedges are initially recorded as regulatory
liabilities and assets, respectively, and then are included in fuel expense as they are recovered
through the fuel cost recovery clause. There was no ineffectiveness recorded in the earnings for
any period presented. The Company has energy-related hedges in place up to and including 2011.

The Company also enters into derivatives to hedge exposure to changes in interest rates.
Derivatives related to forecasted transactions are accounted for as cash flow hedges and will be
terminated at the time the underlying debt is issued. The derivatives employed as hedging
instruments are structured to minimize ineffectiveness. As such, no ineffectiveness has been
recorded in earnings for any period presented. At December 31, 2008, the Company had no interest
rate derivatives outstanding.

The fair value gains or losses for cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income and
are reclassified into earnings at the same time the hedged items affect earnings. In 2008, 2007,
and 2006, the Company settled gains/(losses) totaling $(5.2) million,

NOTES (continued)

Gulf Power Company 2008 Annual Report

$3.0 million, and $(5.4) million, respectively, upon termination of certain interest derivatives at
the same time it issued debt. The effective portion of these gains/(losses) have been deferred in
other comprehensive income and will be amortized to interest expense over the life of the original
interest derivative. For the years 2008, 2007, and 2006, approximately $0.9 million, $0.7 million,
and $0.4 million, respectively, of pre-tax losses were reclassified from other comprehensive income
to interest expense. For 2009, pre-tax losses of approximately $1.1 million are expected to be
reclassified from other comprehensive income to interest expense. The Company has deferred
realized net losses that are being amortized through 2018.

All derivative financial instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are
measured at fair value. See Note 9 for additional information.

7.  COMMITMENTS

Construction Program

The Company is engaged in a continuous construction program, the cost of which is currently
estimated to total $478 million in 2009, $337 million in 2010, and $400 million in 2011. The
construction programs are subject to periodic review and revision, and actual construction costs
may vary from these estimates because of numerous factors. These factors include: changes in
business conditions; revised load growth estimates; storm impacts; changes in environmental
statutes and regulations; changes in FERC rules and regulations; Florida PSC approvals; the cost
and efficiency of construction labor, equipment, and materials; and the cost of capital. In
addition, there can be no assurance that costs related to capital expenditures will be fully
recovered. At December 31, 2008, significant purchase commitments were outstanding in connection
with the ongoing construction program.

Included in the amounts above are $335 million in 2009, $164 million in 2010, and $233 million in
2011 for environmental expenditures. The Company does not have any new generating capacity under
construction. Construction of new transmission and distribution facilities and other capital
improvements, including those needed to meet environmental standards for the Company’s existing
generation, transmission, and distribution facilities, are ongoing.

Long-Term Service Agreements

The Company has a Long-Term Service Agreement (LTSA) with General Electric (GE) for the purpose of
securing maintenance support for a combined cycle generating facility. The LTSA provides that GE
will perform all planned inspections on the covered equipment, which generally includes the cost of
all labor and materials. GE is also obligated to cover the costs of unplanned maintenance on the
covered equipment subject to limits and scope specified in the LTSA.

In general, the LTSA is in effect through two major inspection cycles of the unit. Scheduled
payments to GE, which are subject to price escalation, are made at various intervals based on
actual operating hours of the unit. Total remaining payments to GE under the LTSA for facilities
owned are currently estimated at $62.5 million over the remaining life of the LTSA, which is
currently estimated to be up to 9 years. However, the LTSA contains various cancellation
provisions at the option of the Company.

Payments made under the LTSA prior to the performance of any planned inspections are recorded as
prepayments. These amounts are included in Current Assets and Deferred Charges and Other Assets in
the balance sheets, for 2008 and 2007, respectively. Inspection costs are capitalized or charged
to expense based on the nature of the work performed.

Limestone Commitments

As part of the Company’s program to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions from certain of its coal
plants, the Company has begun construction of flue gas desulfurization projects and has entered
into various long-term commitments for the procurement of limestone to be used in such equipment.
Limestone contracts are structured with tonnage minimums and maximums in order to account for
fluctuations in coal burn and sulfur content. The Company has a minimum contractual obligation of
0.8 million tons equating to approximately $63.8 million, through 2019. Estimated expenditures
(based on minimum contracted obligated dollars) over the next five years are none in 2009, $5.7
million in 2010, $5.8 million in 2011, $6.0 million in 2012, and $6.1 million in 2013. Limestone
costs are expected to be recovered through the environmental cost recovery clause.

Fuel and Purchased Power Commitments

To supply a portion of the fuel requirements of the generating plants, the Company has entered into
various long-term commitments for the procurement of fossil fuel. In most cases, these contracts
contain provisions for price escalations, minimum purchase levels, and other financial commitments.
Coal commitments include forward contract purchases for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emission
allowances. Natural gas purchase commitments contain fixed volumes with prices based on various
indices at the time of delivery; amounts included in the chart below represent estimates based on
New York Mercantile Exchange future prices at December 31, 2008. Also, the Company has entered
into various long-term commitments for the purchase of capacity, electricity, and transmission.

Total estimated minimum long-term obligations at December 31, 2008 were as follows:

Additional commitments for fuel will be required to supply the Company’s future needs.

SCS may enter into various types of wholesale energy and natural gas contracts acting as an agent
for the Company and all of the other Southern Company traditional operating companies and Southern
Power. Under these agreements, each of the traditional operating companies and Southern Power may
be jointly and severally liable. The creditworthiness of Southern Power is currently inferior to
the creditworthiness of the traditional operating companies. Accordingly, Southern Company has
entered into keep-well agreements with the Company and each of the other traditional operating
companies to ensure the Company will not subsidize or be responsible for any costs, losses,
liabilities, or damages resulting from the inclusion of Southern Power as a contracting party under
these agreements.

Operating Leases

The Company has operating lease agreements with various terms and expiration dates. Total
operating lease expenses were $5.0 million, $4.7 million, and $4.9 million, for 2008, 2007, and
2006, respectively. Included in these lease expenses are railcar lease costs which are charged to
fuel inventory and are allocated to fuel expense as the fuel is used. These expenses are then
recovered through the Company’s fuel cost recovery clause. The Company’s share of the lease costs
charged to fuel inventories was $4.0 million in 2008, $4.4 million in 2007, and $4.6 million in
2006. The Company includes any step rents, escalations, and lease concessions in its computation
of minimum lease payments, which are recognized on a straight-line basis over the minimum lease
term.

At December 31, 2008, estimated minimum rental commitments for noncancelable operating leases were

Gulf Power Company 2008 Annual Report

The Company and Mississippi Power jointly entered into operating lease agreements for aluminum
railcars for the transportation of coal to Plant Daniel. The Company has the option to purchase
the railcars at the greater of lease termination value or fair market value or to renew the leases
at the end of each lease term. The Company and Mississippi Power also have separate lease
agreements for other railcars that do not include purchase options.

In addition to railcar leases, the Company has other operating leases for fuel handling equipment
at Plant Daniel. The Company’s share of these leases was charged to fuel handling expense in the
amount of $0.3 million in 2008. The Company’s annual lease payments for 2009 to 2010 will average
approximately $0.1 million.

8.  STOCK OPTION PLAN

Southern Company provides non-qualified stock options to a large segment of the Company’s employees
ranging from line management to executives. As of December 31, 2008, there were 292 current and
former employees of the Company participating in the stock option plan, and there were 33.2 million
shares of common stock remaining available for awards under this plan. The prices of options
granted to date have been at the fair market value of the shares on the dates of grant. Options
granted to date become exercisable pro rata over a maximum period of three years from the date of
grant. The Company generally recognizes stock option expense on a straight-line basis over the
vesting period which equates to the requisite service period; however, for employees who are
eligible for retirement the total cost is expensed at the grant date. Options outstanding will
expire no later than 10 years after the date of grant, unless terminated earlier by the Southern
Company Board of Directors in accordance with the stock option plan. For certain stock option
awards a change in control will provide accelerated vesting.

The estimated fair values of stock options granted in 2008, 2007, and 2006 were derived using the
Black-Scholes stock option pricing model. Expected volatility was based on historical volatility
of Southern Company’s stock over a period equal to the expected term. The Company used historical
exercise data to estimate the expected term that represents the period of time that options granted
to employees are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rate was based on the U.S. Treasury
yield curve in effect at the time of grant that covers the expected term of the stock options. The
following table shows the assumptions used in the pricing model and the weighted average grant-date
fair value of stock options granted:

The number of stock options vested, and expected to vest in the future, as of December 31, 2008 was
not significantly different from the number of stock options outstanding at December 31, 2008 as
stated above. As of December 31, 2008, the weighted average remaining contractual term for the
options outstanding and options exercisable was 6.3 years and 5.1 years, respectively, and the
aggregate intrinsic value for the options outstanding and options exercisable was $6.1 million and
$5.5 million, respectively.

As of December 31, 2008, there was $0.4 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to
stock option awards not yet vested. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average
period of approximately 8 months.

II-295


NOTES (continued)

Gulf Power Company 2008 Annual Report

For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, total compensation cost for stock option
awards recognized in income was $0.8 million, $1.1 million, and $1.0 million, respectively, with
the related tax benefit also recognized in income of $0.3 million, $0.4 million, and $0.4 million,
respectively.

The compensation cost and tax benefits related to the grant and exercise of Southern Company stock
options to the Company’s employees are recognized in the Company’s financial statements with a
corresponding credit to equity, representing a capital contribution from Southern Company.

The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and
2006 was $1.3 million, $3.0 million, and $1.6 million, respectively. The actual tax benefit
realized by the Company for the tax deductions from stock option exercises for the years ended
December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006 totaled $0.5 million, $1.1 million, and $0.6 million,
respectively.

9. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

On January 1, 2008, the Company adopted FASB Statement No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (SFAS
No. 157) which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and
requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements. The criterion that is set forth
in SFAS No. 157 is applicable to fair value measurement where it is permitted or required under
other accounting pronouncements.

SFAS No. 157 defines fair value as the exit price, which is the price that would be received to
sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on inputs of
observable and unobservable market data that a market participant would use in pricing the asset
or liability. The use of observable inputs is maximized where available and the use of
unobservable inputs is minimized for fair value measurement. As a means to illustrate the
inputs used, SFAS No. 157 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy that prioritizes inputs
to valuation techniques used for fair value measurement.

•

Level 1 consists of observable market data in an active market for identical assets
or liabilities.

•

Level 2 consists of observable market data, other than that included in Level 1, that
is either directly or indirectly observable.

•

Level 3 consists of unobservable market data. The input may reflect the assumptions
of the Company of what a market participant would use in pricing an asset or liability.
If there is little available market data, then the Company’s own assumptions are the
best available information.

In the case of multiple inputs being used in a fair value measurement, the lowest level input
that is significant to the fair value measurement represents the level in the fair value
hierarchy in which the fair value measurement is reported.

The adoption of SFAS No. 157 has not resulted in any significant changes to the methodologies
used for fair value measurement. Primarily all the changes in the fair value of assets and
liabilities are recorded in other comprehensive income or regulatory assets and liabilities, and
thus the impact on earnings is limited to derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting.

The fair value measurements performed on a recurring basis and the level of the fair value
hierarchy in which they fall at December 31, 2008 are as follows:

At December 31, 2008:

Level 2

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Mississippi Power Company 2008 Annual Report

The management of Mississippi Power Company (the “Company”) is responsible for establishing and
maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting as required by the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). A control system can
provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.

Under management’s supervision, an evaluation of the design and effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting was conducted based on the framework in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2008.

This Annual Report does not include an attestation report of the Company’s independent registered
public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management’s report
was not subject to attestation by the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm
pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to
provide only management’s report in this Annual Report.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Mississippi Power Company

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets and statements of capitalization of Mississippi
Power Company (the “Company”) (a wholly owned subsidiary of Southern Company) as of December 31,
2008 and 2007, and the related statements of income, comprehensive income, common stockholder’s
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008.  These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management.  Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  The
Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control
over financial reporting.  Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial
reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but
not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion.  An audit also includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such financial statements (pages II-328 to II-362) present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Mississippi Power Company at December 31, 2008 and 2007, and
the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2008, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Mississippi Power Company 2008 Annual Report

OVERVIEW

Business Activities

Mississippi Power Company (the Company) operates as a vertically integrated utility providing
electricity to retail customers within its traditional service area located within the State of
Mississippi and to wholesale customers in the Southeast.

Many factors affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of the Company’s business of selling
electricity. These factors include the ability to maintain a constructive regulatory environment,
to maintain energy sales in the midst of the current economic downturn, and to effectively manage
and secure timely recovery of rising costs. The Company has various regulatory mechanisms that
operate to address cost recovery. Since 2005, the Company has completed a number of regulatory
proceedings that provide for the timely recovery of costs.

Appropriately balancing required costs and capital expenditures with reasonable retail rates will
continue to challenge the Company for the foreseeable future. Hurricane Katrina, the worst natural
disaster in the Company’s history, hit the Gulf Coast of Mississippi in August 2005, causing
substantial damage to the Company’s service territory. All of the Company’s 195,000 customers were
without service immediately after the storm. Through a coordinated effort with Southern Company,
as well as non-affiliated companies, the Company restored power to all who could receive it within
12 days. However, due to obstacles in the rebuilding process, the Company has over 7,500 fewer
retail customers as of December 31, 2008 as compared to pre-storm levels. In 2006, the Company
received from the Mississippi Development Authority (MDA) a Community Development Block Grant
(CDBG) in the amount of $276.4 million for costs related to Hurricane Katrina, of which
$267.6 million was for the retail portion of the Hurricane Katrina restoration costs. In 2007, the
Company received $109.3 million of storm restoration bond proceeds under the state bond program of
which $25.2 million was for retail storm restoration cost, $60.0 million was to increase the
Company’s retail property damage reserve, and $24.1 million was to cover the retail portion of
construction of a new storm operations center. In 2008, the Company received an additional $7.3
million of storm restoration bond proceeds related to the retail portion of construction for the
storm operations center and anticipates the receipt of approximately $3.2 million in 2009 as final
recovery of these retail costs.

The Company’s retail base rates are set under the Performance Evaluation Plan (PEP), a rate plan
approved by the Mississippi Public Service Commission (PSC). PEP was designed with the objective
to reduce the impact of rate changes on the customer and provide incentives for the Company to keep
customer prices low and customer satisfaction and reliability high.

Key Performance Indicators

In striving to maximize shareholder value while providing cost effective energy to customers, the
Company continues to focus on several key indicators. These indicators are used to measure the
Company’s performance for customers and employees.

In recognition that the Company’s long-term financial success is dependent upon how well it
satisfies its customers’ needs, the Company’s retail base rate mechanism, PEP, includes performance
indicators that directly tie customer service indicators to the Company’s allowed return. PEP
measures the Company’s performance on a 10-point scale as a weighted average of results in three
areas: average customer price, as compared to prices of other regional utilities (weighted at 40%);
service reliability, measured in outage minutes per customer (40%); and customer satisfaction,
measured in a survey of residential customers (20%). See Note 3 to the financial statements under
“Retail Regulatory Matters — Performance Evaluation Plan” for more information on PEP.

In addition to the PEP performance indicators, the Company focuses on other performance measures,
including broader measures of customer satisfaction, plant availability, system reliability, and
net income. The Company’s financial success is directly tied to the satisfaction of its customers.
Management uses customer satisfaction surveys to evaluate the Company’s results. Peak season
equivalent forced outage rate (Peak Season EFOR) is an indicator of plant availability and
efficient generation fleet operations during the months when generation needs are greatest. The
rate is calculated by dividing the number of hours of forced outages by total generation hours.
The actual EFOR performance for 2008 did not meet the target due to the effects of an unanticipated
turbine rotor outage at Plant Daniel Unit 1. Net income after dividends on preferred stock is the
primary component of the Company’s contribution to Southern Company’s earnings per share goal.
Recognizing the critical role in the Company’s success played by the Company’s employees,
employee-related measures are a significant management focus. These measures include safety and
inclusion. The 2008 safety performance of the Company was the second best in the history of the
Company with an Occupational Safety and Health Administration Incidence Rate of 0.53. This
achievement resulted in the Company being recognized as one of the top in safety performance among
all utilities in the Southeastern Electric Exchange. Inclusion initiatives resulted in performance
at target levels for the year. The Company’s 2008 results compared with its targets for some of
these key indicators are reflected in the following chart.

The financial performance achieved in 2008 reflects the continued emphasis that management places
on all of these indicators, as well as the commitment shown by employees in achieving or exceeding
management’s expectations.

Earnings

The Company’s net income after dividends on preferred stock was $86.0 million in 2008 compared to
$84.0 million in 2007. The 2.4% increase in 2008 was primarily the result of an increase in
territorial base revenues due to a retail base rate increase effective January 2008 and an increase
in wholesale capacity revenues, partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization
primarily due to the amortization of regulatory items, an increase in non-fuel related expenses,
and an increase in charitable contributions. See Note 3 to the financial statements under “Retail
Regulatory Matters” for additional information.

Net income after dividends on preferred stock was $84.0 million in 2007 compared to $82.0 million
in 2006. The 2.4% increase in 2007 was primarily the result of an increase in territorial base
revenues due to a retail base rate increase effective April 1, 2006, territorial sales growth, and
an increase in total other income and expense as a result of charitable contributions in 2006.
These factors were partially offset by an increase in non-fuel related expenses and an increase in
depreciation and amortization expenses. See Note 3 to the financial statements under “Retail
Regulatory Matters” for additional information.

Net income after dividends on preferred stock of $82.0 million in 2006 increased when compared to
$73.8 million in 2005 primarily as a result of an increase in retail base rates which became
effective April 1, 2006, an increase in wholesale base revenues partially offset by an increase in
depreciation and amortization expenses, a decrease in total other income and expense as a result of
charitable contributions, and higher interest rates on long-term debt.

Total retail revenues for 2008 increased 8.0% when compared to 2007 primarily as a result of a
retail base rate increase effective January 2008 and higher fuel revenues. Total retail revenues
for 2007 increased 12.4% when compared to 2006 primarily as a result of an increase in territorial
sales growth, a retail base rate increase effective April 1, 2006, and the Environmental Compliance
Overview (ECO) Plan rate effective May 2007. Higher fuel revenues also contributed to the
increase. Total retail revenues for 2006 increased 4.6% when compared to 2005 primarily as a
result of a retail base rate increase effective April 1, 2006. Higher fuel revenues also
contributed to the increase.

Electric rates for the Company include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel
costs, including the energy component of purchased power costs. Under these provisions, fuel
revenues generally equal fuel expenses, including the fuel component of purchased power, and do not
affect net income. The fuel and other cost recovery revenues increased in 2008 when compared to
2007 primarily as a result of the increase in fuel and purchased power expenses. The fuel and
other cost recovery revenues increased in 2007 when compared to 2006 as a result of higher fuel
costs. In 2006, fuel and other cost recovery revenues increased as compared to 2005 as a result of
higher fuel costs and an increase in kilowatt-hours (KWH) generated.

Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates will vary depending on the market cost of available
energy compared to the cost of the Company and Southern Company system-owned generation, demand for
energy within the Southern Company service territory, and availability of Southern Company system
generation. Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates increased $30.7 million, or 9.5%, in
2008 as compared to 2007 as a result of a $30.4 million increase in energy revenues, of which $40.4
million was associated with higher fuel prices and a $0.3 million increase in capacity revenues,
partially offset by a $10.0 million decrease in KWH sales. Wholesale revenues from sales to
non-affiliates increased $54.3 million, or 20.2%, in 2007 as compared to 2006 as a result of a
$51.5 million increase in energy revenues, of which $32.0 million was associated with increased KWH
sales and $19.5 million was associated with higher fuel prices, and a $2.8 million increase in
capacity revenues. In 2006, wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates decreased
$14.6 million, or 5.1%, compared to 2005. This decrease resulted from a $14.7 million decrease in
energy revenues, of which $10.1 million was associated with decreased KWH sales and $4.6 million
was associated with lower fuel prices.

Included in wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliates are revenues from rural electric
cooperative associations and municipalities located in southeastern Mississippi. The related
revenues increased 8.3%, 12.6%, and 7.1%, in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. The 2008 increase
was driven by higher fuel costs. The customer demand experienced by these utilities is determined
by factors very similar to those experienced by the Company.

II-305


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2008 Annual Report

Short-term opportunity energy sales are also included in sales for resale to non-affiliates. These
opportunity sales are made at market-based rates (MBRs) that generally provide a margin above the
Company’s variable cost to produce the energy.

Wholesale revenues from sales to affiliated companies within the Southern Company system will vary
from year to year depending on demand, availability and cost of generating resources at each
company. These affiliated sales and purchases are made in accordance with the Intercompany
Interchange Contract (IIC), as approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).
Wholesale revenues from sales to affiliated companies increased 118.6% in 2008, when compared to
2007, decreased 39.5% in 2007, when compared to 2006, and increased 51.6% in 2006, when compared to
2005. These energy sales do not have a significant impact on earnings since the energy is
generally sold at marginal cost.

Energy Sales

Changes in revenues are influenced heavily by the change in the volume of energy sold from year to
year. KWH sales for 2008 and percent change by year were as follows:

Changes in retail energy sales are comprised of changes in electricity usage by customers, changes
in weather, and changes in the number of customers. Residential energy sales decreased 0.6% in
2008 compared to 2007, due to decreased customer usage mainly due to a slowing economy and milder
summer weather. Residential energy sales increased 0.8% in 2007 compared to 2006, primarily due to
more favorable weather conditions, which offset slow customer growth. Residential energy sales
decreased 2.8% in 2006 compared to 2005, due to mild winter weather and fewer customers following
Hurricane Katrina.

Commercial energy sales decreased 0.7% in 2008 compared to 2007, due to mild weather and slower
than expected customer growth due to the economy. Commercial energy sales increased 7.5% in 2007
compared to 2006, due to customer growth mainly in the casino and hotel industries. Commercial
energy sales decreased 1.8% in 2006 compared to 2005, primarily due to commercial customer losses
following Hurricane Katrina.

Industrial energy sales decreased 3.0% in 2008 compared to 2007, due to lower customer use from a
slowing economy. Industrial energy sales increased 4.2% in 2007 compared to 2006, due to continued
recovery after Hurricane Katrina. Industrial energy sales increased 9.1% in 2006 compared to 2005,
primarily due to the recovery of load lost in 2005 resulting from Hurricane Katrina.

Wholesale energy sales to non-affiliates decreased 3.3%, increased 12.1%, and decreased 3.9%, in
2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. Included in wholesale sales from sales to non-affiliates are
sales from rural electric cooperative associations and municipalities located in southeastern
Mississippi. Compared to the prior year, KWH sales to these utilities decreased 0.9% in 2008 due
to slowing growth and milder weather, increased 4.3% in 2007 due to growth in the service
territory, and increased 8.9% in 2006 compared to 2005 due to growth in the service territory and
recovery from Hurricane Katrina in 2006. KWH sales to non-territorial customers located outside
Mississippi Power’s service territory decreased 9.6% in 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily due to
lower off-system sales. KWH sales to non-territorial customers increased 41.0% in 2007 as compared
to 2006 primarily due to more off-system sales. KWH sales to non-territorial customers decreased
33.0% percent in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily due to less off-system sales. Wholesale sales
to non-affiliates will vary depending on the market cost of available energy compared to the cost
of the Company and

II-306


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2008 Annual Report

Southern Company system-owned generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company service
territory, and availability of Southern Company system generation.

Wholesale energy sales to affiliates increased 44.9% in 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily due to
the availability of the Company’s lower cost generation resources sold to affiliated companies.
Wholesale energy sales to affiliates decreased 38.9% in 2007 when compared to 2006 primarily due to
a decrease in the Company’s generation and an increase in territorial sales, therefore, less
available to sell to affiliate companies. Wholesale energy sales to affiliates increased 87.4% in
2006 when compared to 2005 primarily due to the availability of the Company’s lower cost generation
resources sold to affiliated companies.

Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses

Fuel costs constitute the single largest expense for the Company. The mix of fuel sources for
generation of electricity is determined primarily by demand, the unit cost of fuel consumed, and
the availability of generating units. Additionally, the Company purchases a portion of its
electricity needs from the wholesale market. Details of the Company’s electricity generated and
purchased were as follows:

Fuel and purchased power expenses were $713.1 million in 2008, an increase of $122.9 million, or
20.8%, above the prior year costs. This increase was primarily due to a $116.5 million increase in
the cost of fuel and purchased power and a $6.4 million increase related to total KWHs generated
and purchased. Fuel and purchased power expenses were $590.1 million in 2007, an increase of
$78.3 million, or 15.3%, above the prior year costs. This increase was primarily due to a
$63.8 million increase in the cost of fuel and purchased power and a $14.5 million increase related
to total KWHs generated and purchased. In 2006, fuel and purchased power expenses were
$511.9 million, an increase of $9.8 million, or 2.0%, above the prior year costs. This increase
was primarily due to an increase of $9.7 million in the cost of fuel and purchased power.

Fuel expense increased $92.2 million in 2008 as compared to 2007. Approximately $86.1 million in
additional fuel expenses resulted from higher coal, gas, and transportation prices and a $6.1
million increase in generation from Mississippi Power-owned facilities. Fuel expense increased
$55.6 million in 2007 as compared to 2006. Approximately $56.8 million in additional fuel expenses
resulted from higher coal, gas, transportation prices, and emission allowances, which were
partially offset by a $1.2 million decrease in generation from Mississippi Power-owned facilities.
Fuel expense increased $80.1 million in 2006 as compared to 2005 as a result of increases in fuel
costs and an increase in generation. This increase in fuel expense is due to a $30.0 million
increase in the cost of fuel due to higher coal, gas, transportation, and emission allowance prices
and a $50.0 million increase related to more KWHs generated.

Purchased power expense increased $30.7 million, or 32.0%, in 2008 when compared to 2007. The
increase was primarily due to an increase in the cost of purchased power. Purchased power expense
increased $22.6 million, or 30.9%, in 2007 when compared to 2006. The increase was primarily due
to an increase in the cost of purchased power and an increase in the amount of energy purchased
which was partially due to a decrease in generation resulting from plant outages. Purchased power
expense decreased $70.2 million, or 49%, in 2006 when compared to 2005. The decrease was primarily
due to more generation being available to meet customer demand and a decrease in the cost of
purchased power. Energy purchases vary from year to year depending on demand and the availability
and cost of the Company’s generating resources. These expenses do not have a significant impact on
earnings since the energy purchases are generally offset by energy revenues through the Company’s
fuel cost recovery clause.

II-307


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2008 Annual Report

Over the last several years, coal prices have been influenced by a worldwide increase in demand
from developing countries, as well as increases in mining and fuel transportation costs. In the
first half of 2008, coal prices reached unprecedented high levels primarily due to increased demand
following more moderate pricing in 2006 and 2007. Despite these fluctuations, fuel inventories
have been adequate and fuel supply markets have been sufficient to meet expected fuel requirements.
Demand for natural gas in the United States also increased in 2007 and the first half of 2008.
However, natural gas supplies increased in the last half of 2008 as a result of increased
production and higher storage levels due in part to weak industrial demand. Both coal and natural
gas prices moderated in the second half of 2008 as the result of a recessionary economy.

Fuel expenses generally do not affect net income, since they are offset by fuel revenues under the
Company’s fuel cost recovery clause. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL — “PSC Matters — Fuel Cost
Recovery” and Note 1 to the financial statements under “Fuel Costs” for additional information.

Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses

Total other operations and maintenance expenses increased $4.8 million in 2008 as compared to 2007
primarily due to a $6.9 million increase in transmission and distribution expenses, an increase in
administrative expenses primarily resulting from the reclassification of System Restoration Rider
(SRR) revenues of $3.8 million to expense pursuant to an order from the Mississippi PSC dated
January 9, 2009, a $1.9 million increase in generation related environmental expenses, and a $1.1
million increase in generation operations and outage related expenses. These increases were
partially offset by a $9.3 million reclassification of generation construction screening expenses
to a regulatory asset upon the FERC acceptance of the wholesale filing on October 24, 2008.

Total other operations and maintenance expenses increased $18.6 million from 2006 to 2007. Other
operations expense increased $15.1 million, or 8.8%, in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily as a result
of a $4.1 million increase in generation construction screening, a $3.3 million insurance recovery
for storm restoration expense recognized in 2006, a $2.1 million increase in employee benefits
primarily due to increase in medical expense, a $2.0 million increase in outside and other contract
services, and a $2.0 million increase in scheduled production projects. Maintenance expense
increased $3.5 million, or 5.2%, in 2007 when compared to 2006, primarily as a result of a $5.5
million increase in generation maintenance expense primarily due to outage work in 2007, partially
offset by a $2.0 million decrease in transmission and distribution maintenance expenses due
primarily to the deferral of these expenses pursuant to the regulatory accounting order from the
Mississippi PSC.

In 2006, total other operations and maintenance expenses decreased $3.0 million compared to 2005.
Other operations expense increased $1.9 million, or 1.1%, in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily as a
result of a $1.8 million increase in distribution operations expense and a $1.5 million increase in
employee benefit expenses, partially offset by a $1.0 million decrease in bad debt expense.
Maintenance expense decreased $4.9 million, or 6.8%, in 2006, primarily due to the $3.4 million
accrual of certain expenses arising from Hurricane Katrina related to the wholesale portion of the
business in 2005 and the $2.8 million partial recovery of these expenses from the CDBG in 2006,
partially offset by a $0.5 million increase in 2006 due to the increased operation of combined
cycle units as gas costs decreased in 2006 when compared to 2005.

See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL — “PSC Matters — System Restoration Rider and — Storm Damage Cost
Recovery” and “FERC Matters — Wholesale Rate Filing” herein for additional information.

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $10.7 million in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily
due to a $5.7 million increase in amortization related to a regulatory liability recorded in 2003
that ended in December 2007 in connection with the Mississippi PSC’s accounting order on Plant
Daniel capacity, a $2.9 million increase in depreciation expense primarily due to an increase in
plant in service, and a $2.4 million increase for amortization of certain reliability-related
maintenance costs deferred in 2007 in accordance with a Mississippi PSC order. Depreciation and
amortization expenses increased $13.5 million in 2007 compared to 2006 due to a regulatory
liability recorded in 2003 in connection with the Mississippi PSC’s accounting order on Plant
Daniel capacity and an increase in amortization of environmental costs related to the approved ECO
Plan. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $13.3 million in 2006 compared to 2005 due
to amortization related to a regulatory liability recorded in 2003 in connection with the
Mississippi PSC’s accounting order on Plant Daniel capacity and the impact of a new depreciation
study effective January 1, 2006. See Note 3 under “Retail Regulatory Matters — Performance
Evaluation Plan” and “Environmental Compliance Overview Plan” for additional information.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2008 Annual Report

Taxes Other Than Income Taxes

Taxes other than income taxes increased 7.9% in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily as a result of a
$2.7 million increase in ad valorem taxes and a $1.3 million increase in municipal franchise taxes.
Taxes other than income taxes decreased 0.9% in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily as a result of a
$2.0 million decrease in ad valorem taxes, partially offset by a $1.5 million increase in municipal
franchise taxes. In 2006, taxes other than income taxes increased 1.4% over the prior year
primarily as a result of a $0.5 million increase in ad valorem taxes and a $0.3 million increase in
municipal franchise taxes. The retail portion of the increase in ad valorem taxes is recoverable
under the Company’s ad valorem tax cost recovery clause and, therefore, does not affect net income.
The increase in municipal franchise taxes is directly related to the increase in total retail
revenues.

Total Other Income and (Expense)

The $1.1 million decrease in total other income and (expense) in 2008 compared to 2007 is primarily
due to higher charitable contributions of $3.1 million partially offset by $0.4 million increase in
revenues from contracting work performed for customers, a $0.6 million decrease in other
deductions, and a $0.6 million increase in allowance for equity funds used during construction.
The $10.9 million increase in total other income and (expense) in 2007 compared to 2006 is
primarily due to higher charitable contributions in 2006 as compared to 2007 and a gain on a
contract termination approved by the FERC in 2007. The $8.6 million decrease in total other income
and (expense) in 2006 compared to 2005 is primarily due to charitable contributions and higher
interest rates on long-term debt.

Income Taxes

Income taxes decreased $3.4 million, or 6.7%, in 2008 primarily due to decreased pre-tax income,
the amortization of a regulatory liability pursuant to a December 2007 regulatory accounting order
from the Mississippi PSC, and a State of Mississippi manufacturing investment tax credit, partially
offset by a decrease in the federal production activities deduction. See Note 3 to the financial
statements under “Retail Regulatory Matters” for additional information. Income taxes increased
$3.7 million, or 7.8%, in 2007 primarily due to increased pre-tax income and lower federal and
state tax credits. Income taxes increased $1.7 million, or 3.7%, in 2006 primarily due to
increased pre-tax income, partially offset by higher federal and state tax credits. See Note 5 to
the financial statements under “Effective Tax Rate.”

Effects of Inflation

The Company is subject to rate regulation that is based on the recovery of costs. PEP is based on
annual projected costs, including estimates for inflation. When historical costs are included, or
when inflation exceeds projected costs used in rate regulation or market- based prices, the effects
of inflation can create an economic loss since the recovery of costs could be in dollars that have
less purchasing power. In addition, the income tax laws are based on historical costs. The
inflation rate has been relatively low in recent years and any adverse effect of inflation on the
Company has not been significant.

FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL

General

The Company operates as a vertically integrated utility providing electricity to retail customers
within its traditional service area located in southeast Mississippi and to wholesale customers in
the southeastern United States. Prices for electricity provided by the Company to retail customers
are set by the Mississippi PSC under cost-based regulatory principles. Retail rates and earnings
are reviewed and may be adjusted periodically within certain limitations. Prices for wholesale
electricity sales, interconnecting transmission lines and the exchange of electric power are
regulated by the FERC. See ACCOUNTING POLICIES — “Application of Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates — Electric Utility Regulation” herein and Note 3 to the financial statements under “FERC
Matters” and “Retail Regulatory Matters” for additional information about regulatory matters.

The results of operations for the past three years are not necessarily indicative of future
earnings potential. The level of the Company’s future earnings depends on numerous factors that
affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of the Company’s primary business of selling
electricity. These factors include the Company’s ability to maintain a constructive regulatory
environment that continues to allow for the recovery of all prudently incurred costs during a time
of increasing costs. Future earnings in the near term will depend, in part, upon maintaining
energy sales during the current economic downturn, which is subject to a number of factors. These
factors include weather, competition, new energy contracts with neighboring utilities, energy
conservation practiced by

II-309


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2008 Annual Report

customers, the price of electricity, the price elasticity of demand, and the rate of economic
growth or decline in the Company’s service area. Recent recessionary conditions have negatively
impacted sales growth. The timing and extent of the economic recovery will impact future earnings.

Environmental Matters

Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act and other environmental statutes and regulations
could affect earnings if such costs cannot continue to be fully recovered in rates on a timely
basis. Environmental compliance spending over the next several years may exceed amounts estimated.
Some of the factors driving the potential for such an increase are higher commodity costs, market
demand for labor, and scope additions and clarifications. The timing, specific requirements, and
estimated costs could also change as environmental statutes and regulations are adopted or
modified. See Note 3 to the financial statements under “Environmental Matters” for additional
information.

New Source Review Actions

In November 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) brought a civil action in the U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against certain Southern Company subsidiaries,
including Alabama Power and Georgia Power, alleging that these subsidiaries had violated the New
Source Review (NSR) provisions of the Clean Air Act and related state laws at certain coal-fired
generating facilities. After Alabama Power was dismissed from the original action for
jurisdictional reasons, the EPA filed a separate action in January 2001 against Alabama Power in
the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama. In these lawsuits, the EPA alleged
that NSR violations occurred at eight coal-fired generating facilities operated by Alabama Power
and Georgia Power, including one co-owned by the Company. The civil actions request penalties and
injunctive relief, including an order requiring installation of the best available control
technology at the affected units. The action against Georgia Power has been administratively
closed since the spring of 2001, and the case has not been reopened.

In June 2006, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama entered a consent decree
between Alabama Power and the EPA, resolving a portion of the Alabama Power lawsuit relating to the
alleged NSR violations at Plant Miller. The consent decree required Alabama Power to pay $100,000
to resolve the government’s claim for a civil penalty and to donate $4.9 million of sulfur dioxide
emission allowances to a nonprofit charitable organization. It also formalized specific emissions
reductions to be accomplished by Alabama Power, consistent with other Clean Air Act programs that
require emissions reductions. In August 2006, the district court in Alabama granted Alabama
Power’s motion for summary judgment and entered final judgment in favor of Alabama Power on the
EPA’s claims related to all of the remaining plants: Plants Barry, Gaston, Gorgas, and Greene
County.

The plaintiffs appealed the district court’s decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh
Circuit, where the appeal was stayed pending the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in a similar case
against Duke Energy. The Supreme Court issued its decision in the Duke Energy case in April 2007,
and in December 2007, the Eleventh Circuit vacated the district court’s decision in the Alabama
Power case and remanded the case back to the district court for consideration of the legal issues
in light of the Supreme Court’s decision in the Duke Energy case. On July 24, 2008, the U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of Alabama granted partial summary judgment in favor of
Alabama Power regarding the proper legal test for determining whether projects are routine
maintenance, repair, and replacement and therefore are excluded from NSR permitting. The decision
did not resolve the case, and the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this
time.

The Company believes that it complied with applicable laws and the EPA regulations and
interpretations in effect at the time the work in question took place. The Clean Air Act
authorizes maximum civil penalties of $25,000 to $37,500 per day, per violation at each generating
unit, depending on the date of the alleged violation. An adverse outcome in either of these cases
could require substantial capital expenditures or affect the timing of currently budgeted capital
expenditures that cannot be determined at this time and could possibly require payment of
substantial penalties. Such expenditures could affect future results of operations, cash flows,
and financial condition if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates.

Carbon Dioxide Litigation

New York Case

In July 2004, three environmental groups and attorneys general from eight states, each outside of
Southern Company’s service territory, and the corporation counsel for New York City filed
complaints in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against Southern
Company and four other electric power companies. The complaints allege that the companies’
emissions of

II-310


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2008 Annual Report

carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, contribute to global warming, which the plaintiffs assert is a
public nuisance. Under common law public and private nuisance theories, the plaintiffs seek a
judicial order (1) holding each defendant jointly and severally liable for creating, contributing
to, and/or maintaining global warming and (2) requiring each of the defendants to cap its emissions
of carbon dioxide and then reduce those emissions by a specified percentage each year for at least
a decade. The plaintiffs have not, however, requested that damages be awarded in connection with
their claims. Southern Company believes these claims are without merit and notes that the
complaint cites no statutory or regulatory basis for the claims. In September 2005, the U.S.
District Court for the Southern District of New York granted Southern Company’s and the other
defendants’ motions to dismiss these cases. The plaintiffs filed an appeal to the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit in October 2005, but no decision has been issued. The ultimate
outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Kivalina Case

On February 26, 2008, the Native Village of Kivalina and the City of Kivalina filed a suit in the
U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against several electric utilities
(including Southern Company), several oil companies, and a coal company. The plaintiffs are the
governing bodies of an Inupiat village in Alaska. The plaintiffs contend that the village is being
destroyed by erosion allegedly caused by global warming that the plaintiffs attribute to emissions
of greenhouse gases by the defendants. The plaintiffs assert claims for public and private
nuisance and contend that the defendants have acted in concert and are therefore jointly and
severally liable for the plaintiffs’ damages. The suit seeks damages for lost property values and
for the cost of relocating the village, which is alleged to be $95 million to $400 million. On
June 30, 2008, all defendants filed motions to dismiss this case. Southern Company believes that
these claims are without merit and notes that the complaint cites no statutory or regulatory basis
for the claims. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Environmental Statutes and Regulations

General

The Company’s operations are subject to extensive regulation by state and federal environmental
agencies under a variety of statutes and regulations governing environmental media, including air,
water, and land resources. Applicable statutes include the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act; the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act; the Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act; the Toxic Substances Control Act; the Emergency Planning & Community
Right-to-Know Act; the Endangered Species Act; and related federal and state regulations.
Compliance with these environmental requirements involves significant capital and operating costs,
a major portion of which is expected to be recovered through existing ratemaking provisions.
Through 2008, the Company had invested approximately $202 million in capital projects to comply
with these requirements, with annual totals of $41 million, $17 million, and $4.8 million for 2008,
2007, and 2006, respectively. The Company expects that capital expenditures to assure compliance
with existing and new statutes and regulations will be an additional $28 million, $61 million, and
$111 million for 2009, 2010, and 2011, respectively. The Company’s compliance strategy can be
affected by changes to existing environmental laws, statutes, and regulations, the cost,
availability, and existing inventory of emission allowances, and the Company’s fuel mix.
Environmental costs that are known and estimable at this time are included in capital expenditures
discussed under FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY — “Capital Requirements and Contractual
Obligations” herein.

Compliance with any new federal or state legislation or regulations related to global climate
change, air quality, combustion byproducts, including coal ash, or other environmental and health
concerns could also significantly affect the Company. Although new or revised environmental
legislation or regulations could affect many areas of the Company’s operations, the full impact of
any such changes cannot be determined at this time.

Air Quality

Compliance with the Clean Air Act and resulting regulations has been and will continue to be a
significant focus for the Company. Through 2008, the Company had spent approximately $102 million
in reducing sulfur dioxide (SO


) and nitrogen oxide (NO

x

) emissions and in
monitoring emissions pursuant to the Clean Air Act. Additional controls are currently being
installed at several plants to further reduce air emissions, maintain compliance with existing
regulations, and meet new requirements.

II-311


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2008 Annual Report

In 2004, the EPA designated nonattainment areas under an eight-hour ozone standard. No area within
the Company’s service area was designated as nonattainment under the eight-hour ozone standard. On
March 12, 2008, the EPA issued a final rule establishing a more stringent eight-hour ozone standard
which will likely result in designation of new nonattainment areas within the Company’s service
territory. The EPA is expected to publish those designations in 2010, and require state
implementation plans for any nonattainment areas by 2013.

The EPA issued the final Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) in March 2005. This cap-and-trade rule
addresses power plant SO


and NO

x

emissions that were found to contribute to
nonattainment of the eight-hour ozone and fine particulate matter standards in downwind states.
Twenty-eight eastern states, including the State of Mississippi, are subject to the requirements of
the rule. The rule calls for additional reductions of NO

x

and/or SO


to be
achieved in two phases, 2009/2010 and 2015. On July 11, 2008, in response to petitions brought by
certain states and regulated industries challenging particular aspects of CAIR, the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued a decision vacating CAIR in its entirety and
remanding it to the EPA for further action consistent with its opinion. On December 23, 2008,
however, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit altered its July decision
in response to a rehearing petition and remanded CAIR to the EPA without vacatur, thereby leaving
CAIR compliance requirements in place while the EPA develops a revised rule. The State of
Mississippi has an EPA-approved plan for implementing this rule. These reductions will be
accomplished by the installation of additional emission controls at the Company’s coal-fired
facilities and/or by the purchase of emission allowances. The full impact of the court’s remand
and the outcome of EPA’s future rulemaking in response cannot be determined at this time.

The Clean Air Visibility Rule (formerly called the Regional Haze Rule) was finalized in July 2005.
The goal of this rule is to restore natural visibility conditions in certain areas (primarily
national parks and wilderness areas) by 2064. The rule involves (1) the application of Best
Available Retrofit Technology (BART) to certain sources built between 1962 and 1977 and (2) the
application of any additional emissions reductions which may be deemed necessary for each
designated area to achieve reasonable progress by 2018 toward the natural conditions goal.
Thereafter, for each 10-year planning period, additional emissions reductions will be required to
continue to demonstrate reasonable progress in each area during that period. For power plants, the
Clean Air Visibility Rule allows states to determine that the CAIR satisfies BART requirements for
SO


and NO

x

. Extensive studies were performed for each of the Company’s
affected units to demonstrate that additional particulate matter controls are not necessary under
BART. The states of Alabama and Mississippi have determined that no additional SO


controls necessary under BART. States have completed or are currently completing
implementation plans that contain strategies for BART and any other measures required to achieve
the first phase of reasonable progress.

The impacts of the eight-hour ozone and nonattainment designations, and the Clean Air Visibility
Rule on the Company cannot be determined at this time and will depend on the resolution of any
pending legal challenges and the development and implementation of rules at the state level.

The Company has developed and continually updates a comprehensive environmental compliance strategy
to assess compliance obligations associated with the continuing and new environmental requirements
discussed above. As part of this strategy, the Company plans to install additional SO


and NO

x

emission controls within the next several years to ensure continued
compliance with applicable air quality requirements.

In March 2005, the EPA published the final Clean Air Mercury Rule, a cap-and-trade program for the
reduction of mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants. The final Clean Air Mercury Rule was
challenged in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The petitioners
alleged that the EPA was not authorized to establish a cap-and-trade program for mercury emissions
and instead the EPA must establish maximum achievable control technology standards for coal-fired
electric utility steam generating units. On February 8, 2008, the court ruled in favor of the
petitioners and vacated the Clean Air Mercury Rule. The Company’s overall environmental compliance
strategy relies primarily on a combination of SO


and NOx controls to reduce mercury
emissions. Any significant changes in the strategy will depend on the outcome of any appeals
and/or future federal and state rulemakings. Future rulemakings necessitated by the court’s
decision could require emission reductions more stringent than those required by the Clean Air
Mercury Rule.

II-312


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2008 Annual Report

Water Quality

In July 2004, the EPA published its final technology-based regulations under the Clean Water Act
for the purpose of reducing impingement and entrainment of fish, shellfish, and other forms of
aquatic life at existing power plant cooling water intake structures. The rules require baseline
biological information and, perhaps, installation of fish protection technology near some intake
structures at existing power plants. In January 2007, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit overturned and remanded several provisions of the rule, including the use of cost-benefit
analysis, to the EPA for revisions. The decision has been appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. The
full impact of these regulations will depend on subsequent legal proceedings, further rulemaking by
the EPA, the results of studies and analyses performed as part of the rules’ implementation, and
the actual requirements established by state regulatory agencies and, therefore, cannot be
determined at this time.

Environmental Remediation

The Company must comply with other environmental laws and regulations that cover the handling and
disposal of waste and releases of hazardous substances. Under these various laws and regulations,
the Company could incur substantial costs to clean up properties. The Company conducts studies to
determine the extent of any required cleanup and has recognized in its respective financial
statements the costs to clean up known sites. Amounts for cleanup and ongoing monitoring costs
were not material for any year presented. The Company could be liable for some or all required
cleanup costs for additional sites that may require environmental remediation. See Note 3 to the
financial statements under “Environmental Matters — Environmental Remediation” for additional
information.

Global Climate Issues

Federal legislative proposals that would impose mandatory requirements related to greenhouse gas
emissions and renewable energy standards continue to be strongly considered in Congress, and the
reduction of greenhouse gas emissions has been identified as a high priority by the current
Administration. The ultimate outcome of these proposals cannot be determined at this time;
however, mandatory restrictions on the Company’s greenhouse gas emissions could result in
significant additional compliance costs that could affect future unit retirement and replacement
decisions and results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition if such costs are not
recovered through regulated rates.

In April 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the EPA has authority under the Clean Air Act to
regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles. The EPA is currently developing its
response to this decision. Regulatory decisions that will follow from this response may have
implications for both new and existing stationary sources, such as power plants. The ultimate
outcome of these rulemaking activities cannot be determined at this time; however, as with the
current legislative proposals, mandatory restrictions on the Company’s greenhouse gas emissions
could result in significant additional compliance costs that could affect future unit retirement
and replacement decisions and results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition if such
costs are not recovered through regulated rates.

In addition, some states are considering or have undertaken actions to regulate and reduce
greenhouse gas emissions. For example, on June 25, 2008, Florida’s Governor signed comprehensive
energy-related legislation that includes authorization for the Florida Department of Environmental
Protection to adopt rules for a cap-and-trade regulatory program to address greenhouse gas
emissions from electric utilities, conditioned upon their ratification by the legislature no sooner
than the 2010 legislative session.  This legislation also authorizes the Florida PSC to adopt a
renewable portfolio standard for public utilities, subject to legislative ratification. The impact
of any similar legislation on the Company will depend on the future development, adoption,
legislative ratification, implementation, and potential legal challenges to rules governing
greenhouse gas emissions and mandates regarding the use of renewable energy, and the ultimate
outcome cannot be determined at this time.

International climate change negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change also continue. Current efforts focus on a potential successor to the Kyoto Protocol for the
post 2012 timeframe, with a conclusion to this round of negotiations targeted for the end of 2009.
The outcome and impact of the international negotiations cannot be determined at this time.

The Company is actively evaluating and developing electric generating technologies with lower
greenhouse gas emissions. This includes the proposed construction of an advanced Integrated Coal
Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) unit with approximately 50% carbon capture in Kemper County,
Mississippi. The Company is currently considering additional projects and is pursuing research
into the costs and viability of other renewable technologies for the Southeast.

II-313


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2008 Annual Report

FERC Matters

Market-Based Rate Authority

The Company has authorization from the FERC to sell power to non-affiliates, including short-term
opportunity sales, at market-based prices. Specific FERC approval must be obtained with respect to
a market-based contract with an affiliate.

In December 2004, the FERC initiated a proceeding to assess Southern Company’s generation dominance
within its retail service territory. The ability to charge market-based rates in other markets is
not an issue in the proceeding. Any new market-based rate sales by the Company in Southern
Company’s retail service territory entered into during a 15-month refund period that ended in May
2006 could be subject to refund to a cost-based rate level.

In November 2007, the presiding administrative law judge issued an initial decision regarding the
methodology to be used in the generation dominance tests. The proceedings are ongoing. The
ultimate outcome of this generation dominance proceeding cannot now be determined, but an adverse
decision by the FERC in a final order could require the Company to charge cost-based rates for
certain wholesale sales in the Southern Company retail service territory, which may be lower than
negotiated market-based rates, and could also result in total refunds of up to $8.4 million, plus
interest. The Company believes that there is no meritorious basis for an adverse decision in this
proceeding and is vigorously defending itself in this matter.

In June 2007, the FERC issued its final rule in Order No. 697 regarding market-based rate
authority. The FERC generally retained its current market-based rate standards. Responding to a
number of requests for rehearing, the FERC issued Order No. 697-A on April 21, 2008 and Order No.
697-B on December 12, 2008. These orders largely affirmed the FERC’s prior revision and
codification of the regulations governing market-based rates for public utilities. In accordance
with the orders, Southern Company submitted to the FERC an updated market power analysis on
September 2, 2008 related to its continued market-based rate authority. The ultimate outcome of
this matter cannot now be determined.

On October 17, 2008, Southern Company filed with the FERC a revised market-based rate (MBR) tariff
and a new cost-based rate (CBR) tariff.   The revised MBR tariff provides for a “must offer” energy
auction whereby Southern Company offers all of its available energy for sale in a day-ahead auction
and an hour-ahead auction with reserve prices not to exceed the CBR tariff price, after considering
Southern Company’s native load requirements, reliability obligations, and sales commitments to
third parties. All sales under the energy auction would be at market clearing prices established
under the auction rules. The new CBR tariff provides for a cost-based price for wholesale sales of
less than a year. On December 18, 2008, the FERC issued an order conditionally accepting the MBR
tariff subject to certain revisions to the auction proposal. On January 21, 2009, Southern Company
made a compliance filing that accepted all the conditions of the MBR tariff order. When this order
becomes final, Southern Company will have 30 days to implement the wholesale auction. On December
31, 2008, the FERC issued an order conditionally accepting the CBR tariff subject to providing
additional information concerning one aspect of the tariff. On January 30, 2009, Southern Company
filed a response addressing the FERC inquiry to the CBR tariff order. Implementation of the energy
auction in accordance with the MBR tariff order is expected to adequately mitigate going forward
any presumption of market power that Southern Company may have in the Southern Company retail
service territory. The timing of when the FERC may issue the final orders on the MBR and CBR
tariffs and the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Wholesale Rate Filing

On August 29, 2008, Mississippi Power filed with the FERC a request for revised wholesale electric
tariff and rates. Prior to making this filing, Mississippi Power reached a settlement with all of
its customers who take service under the tariff. This settlement agreement was filed with the FERC
as part of the request. The settlement agreement provided for an increase in annual base wholesale
revenues in the amount of $5.8 million, effective January 1, 2009. In addition, the settlement
agreement allows Mississippi Power to increase its annual accrual for the wholesale portion of
property damage to $303,000 per year, to defer any property damage costs prudently incurred in
excess of the wholesale property damage reserve balance, and to defer the wholesale portion of the
generation screening and evaluation costs associated with the IGCC project to be located in Kemper
County Mississippi. The settlement agreement also provided that Mississippi Power will not seek a
change in wholesale full-requirements rates before November 1, 2010, except for changes associated
with the fuel adjustment clause and the energy cost management clause, changes associated with
property damages that exceed the amount in the wholesale property damage reserve, and changes
associated with costs and expenses associated with environmental requirements affecting fossil fuel
generating facilities. On October 24, 2008, Mississippi

II-314


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2008 Annual Report

Power received notice that the FERC had accepted the filing effective November 1, 2008, and the
revised monthly charges were applied beginning January 1, 2009. As result of the order, the
Company reclassified $9.3 million of previously expensed generation screening and evaluation costs
to a regulatory asset. See Note 3 to the financial statements under “Integrated Coal Gasification
Combined Cycle” for additional information.

PSC Matters

Statewide Electric Generation Needs Review

On April 30, 2008, in accordance with the Mississippi Public Utility Act, the Mississippi PSC
issued an order to develop, publicize, and keep current an analysis of the five-year long-range
needs for expansion of facilities for the generation of electricity in the State of Mississippi.
In its order, the Mississippi PSC directed all affected utilities to submit evidence in support of
their forecasts and plans in accordance with the Mississippi PSC’s Public Utilities Rules of
Practice and Procedure. Comments were filed on June 10, 2008, and hearings were held in August
2008. On January 16, 2009, the Company filed for a request for a Certificate of Public Convenience
to construct generating capacity. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.
See Note 3 to the financial statements under “Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle” for
additional information.

Mississippi Base Load Construction Legislation

In the 2008 regular session of the Mississippi legislature, a bill was passed and signed by the
Governor on May 9, 2008 to enhance the Mississippi PSC’s authority to facilitate development and
construction of base load generation in the State of Mississippi (Baseload Act). The Baseload
Act authorizes, but does not require, the Mississippi PSC to adopt a cost recovery mechanism
that includes in retail base rates, prior to and during construction, all or a portion of the
prudently incurred pre-construction and construction costs incurred by a utility in constructing
a base load electric generating plant. Prior to the passage of the Baseload Act, such costs
would traditionally be recovered only after the plant was placed in service. The Baseload Act
also provides for periodic prudence reviews by the Mississippi PSC and prohibits the
cancellation of any such generating plant without the approval of the Mississippi PSC. In the
event of cancellation of the construction of the plant without approval of the Mississippi PSC,
the Baseload Act authorizes the Mississippi PSC to make a public interest determination as to
whether and to what extent the utility will be afforded rate recovery for costs incurred in
connection with such cancelled generating plant. The effect of this legislation on Mississippi
Power cannot now be determined.

Performance Evaluation Plan

In May 2004, the Mississippi PSC approved the Company’s request to reclassify 266 megawatts of
Plant Daniel Units 3 and 4 capacity to jurisdictional cost of service effective January 1, 2004,
and authorized the Company to include the related costs and revenue credits in jurisdictional rate
base, cost of service, and revenue requirement calculations for purposes of retail rate recovery.
In the May 2004 order establishing the Company’s forward-looking Rate Schedule PEP, the Mississippi
PSC ordered that the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff and the Company review the operations of
the PEP in 2007. By mutual agreement, this review was deferred until 2008 and is currently
ongoing. The outcome of this review cannot now be determined.

In April 2007, the Mississippi PSC issued an order allowing the Company to defer certain
reliability related maintenance costs beginning January 1, 2007, and recover them evenly over a
four-year period beginning January 1, 2008. These costs related to maintenance that was needed as
follow-up to emergency repairs that were made subsequent to Hurricane Katrina. At December 31,
2007, the Company had incurred and deferred the retail portion of $9.5 million of such costs. At
December 31, 2008, the Company had a balance of the deferred retail portion of $7.1 million with
$2.4 million included in current assets as other regulatory assets and $4.7 million included in
long-term other regulatory assets.

In December 2007, the Company submitted its annual PEP filing for 2008, which resulted in a rate
increase of 1.983% or $15.5 million annually, effective January 2008. In December 2006, the
Company submitted its annual PEP filing for 2007, which resulted in no rate change.

In December 2007, the Company received an order from the Mississippi PSC requiring it to defer $1.4
million associated with the retail portion of certain tax credits and favorable adjustments related
to permanent differences pertaining to its 2006 income tax returns filed in September 2007. These
tax differences were recorded in a regulatory liability included in the current portion of other
regulatory liabilities and were amortized ratably over the twelve month period beginning January
2008.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2008 Annual Report

On March 14, 2008, the Company submitted its annual PEP lookback filing for 2007, which recommended
no surcharge or refund. At the conclusion of the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff’s review of
the PEP lookback filing for 2007, the Company and the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff jointly
submitted a stipulation to the Mississippi PSC which recommended no surcharge or refund.

The Mississippi Public Utilities Staff, pursuant to the Mississippi PSC’s 2004 order approving the
current PEP plan, is reviewing PEP to determine if any modifications should be made to the plan.
Concurrent with this review, the annual PEP evaluation filing for 2009 was delayed by order of the
Mississippi PSC and was scheduled to be filed on or before March 9, 2009. On February 23, 2009,
however, the Company requested that the Mississippi PSC issue an order suspending the 2009 PEP
evaluation filing to continue the scheduled review of the plan. The Company does not anticipate
that suspending the PEP filing for 2009 will have a material impact on 2009 earnings. The Company
anticipates that, as a result of the required review, changes to the plan will be made. Annual
evaluations would resume for 2010 under a revised PEP plan. The final outcome cannot be determined
at this time. See Note 3 to the financial statements under “Retail Regulatory Matters –
Performance Evaluation Plan” for more information on PEP.

System Restoration Rider

In September 2006, the Company filed with the Mississippi PSC a request to implement a SRR to
increase the Company’s cap on the property damage reserve and to authorize the calculation of an
annual property damage accrual based on a formula.  The purpose of the SRR is to provide for
recovery of costs associated with property damage (including certain property insurance and the
costs of self insurance) and to facilitate the Mississippi PSC’s review of these costs. In
November 2007, the Company along with the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff agreed and stipulated
to a revised SRR calculation method that would no longer require the Mississippi PSC to set a cap
on the property damage reserve or to authorize the calculation of an annual property damage
accrual.  Under the revised SRR calculation method, the Mississippi PSC would periodically agree on
SRR revenue levels that would be developed based on historical data, expected exposure, type and
amount of insurance coverage excluding insurance costs, and other relevant information.

On January 9, 2009, the Mississippi PSC issued an order accepting the stipulation and the revised
SRR calculation method.  The applicable SRR rate level will be adjusted every three years, unless a
significant change in circumstances occurs such that the Company and the Mississippi Public
Utilities Staff or the Mississippi PSC deems that a more frequent change would be appropriate.  The
Company will submit annual filings setting forth SRR-related revenues, expenses and investment for
the projected filing period, as well as the true-up for the prior period. As a result the December
2008 retail regulatory liability of $6.8 million was reclassified to the property damage
reserve.   On February 2, 2009, the Company submitted its 2009 SRR rate filing with the Mississippi
PSC, which proposed that the 2009 SRR rate level remain at zero and the Company be allowed to
accrue approximately $4.0 million to the property damage reserve in 2009. The final outcome of
this matter cannot now be determined.

Environmental Compliance Overview Plan

On February 3, 2009, the Company submitted its 2009 ECO Plan Notice which proposes an increase of
19 cents per 1,000 KWH for residential customers. The final outcome of this matter cannot now be
determined. On February 1, 2008, the Company filed with the Mississippi PSC its annual ECO Plan
evaluation for 2008. After the filing of the ECO Plan evaluation, the regulations addressing
mercury emissions were altered by a decision issued by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District
of Columbia Circuit on February 8, 2008. On April 7, 2008, the Company filed with the Mississippi
PSC a supplemental ECO Plan evaluation in which the projects included in the ECO Plan evaluation on
February 1, 2008 being undertaken primarily for mercury control were removed. In this supplemental
ECO Plan filing, the Company requested a 15 cent per 1,000 KWH decrease for retail residential
customers. The Mississippi PSC approved the supplemental ECO Plan evaluation on June 11, 2008,
with the new rates effective in June 2008. In April 2007, the Mississippi PSC approved the
Company’s 2007 ECO Plan, which included an 86 cents per 1,000 KWH increase for retail residential
customers. This increase represented an addition of approximately $7.5 million in annual revenues
for the Company. The new rates were effective in April 2007.

Fuel Cost Recovery

The Company establishes, annually, a retail fuel cost recovery factor that is approved by the
Mississippi PSC. Over the past several years, the Company has continued to experience higher than
expected fuel costs for coal and natural gas. The Company is required to file for an adjustment to
the retail fuel cost recovery factor annually; such filing occurred in November 2008. On December
29, 2008, the Mississippi PSC held a hearing on the Company’s proposed increase in its fuel cost
recovery factor. On February 11, 2009, the hearing examiner submitted a formal recommendation to
the Mississippi PSC for approval of the factor as filed, with recovery proposed for the remaining
calendar months of 2009. Any over or under recovery of fuel costs for 2009 would be addressed in
the

II-316


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2008 Annual Report

Company’s 2010 fuel cost recovery filing. The recommendation is under review by the Mississippi
PSC at this time; therefore, the final outcome of this matter cannot now be determined. The
proposed retail fuel cost recovery factor will result in an annual increase in an amount equal to
12.2% of total 2008 retail revenue. At December 31, 2008, the amount of under recovered retail
fuel costs included in the balance sheet was $36.0 million compared to $24.5 million at December
31, 2007. The Company also has a wholesale Municipal and Rural Associations (MRA) and Market Base
(MB) fuel cost recovery factor. Effective January 1, 2009, the wholesale MRA fuel rate increased
resulting in an annual increase in an amount equal to 13.9% of total 2008 MRA revenue. Effective
February 1, 2009, the wholesale MB fuel rate increased resulting in an annual increase in an amount
equal to 16.7% of total 2008 MB revenue. At December 31, 2008, the amount of under recovered
wholesale MRA and MB fuel costs included in the balance sheets was $15.4 million and $3.7 million
compared to $13.7 million and $2.3 million, respectively, at December 31, 2007. The Company’s
operating revenues are adjusted for differences in actual recoverable fuel cost and amounts billed
in accordance with the currently approved cost recovery rate. Accordingly, this increase to the
billing factor will have no significant effect on the Company’s revenues or net income, but will
increase annual cash flow.

On October 7, 2008, the Mississippi PSC opened a docket to investigate and review interest and
carrying charges under the fuel adjustment clause for utilities within the State of Mississippi
including the Company. A hearing was held November 6, 2008 to hear testimony regarding the method
of calculating carrying charges on over and under recoveries of fuel-related costs. The ultimate
outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.

Storm Damage Cost Recovery

In August 2005, Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast of the United States and caused significant
damage within the Company’s service area. The estimated total storm restoration costs relating to
Hurricane Katrina through December 31, 2007 of $302.4 million, which was net of expected insurance
proceeds of approximately $77 million, without offset for the property damage reserve of
$3.0 million, was affirmed by the Mississippi PSC in June 2006, and the Company was ordered to
establish a regulatory asset for the retail portion. The Mississippi PSC issued an order directing
the Company to file an application with the MDA for a CDBG. In October 2006, the Company received
from the MDA a CDBG in the amount of $276.4 million, which was allocated to both the retail and
wholesale jurisdictions. In the same month, the Mississippi PSC issued a financing order that
authorized the issuance of system restoration bonds for the remaining $25.2 million of the retail
portion of storm recovery costs not covered by the CDBG. These funds were received in June 2007.
The Company affirmed the $302.4 million total storm costs incurred as of December 31, 2007. The
Company plans to file with the Mississippi PSC its final accounting of the restoration cost
relating to Hurricane Katrina and the storm operations center by the end of the first quarter 2009,
at which time the final net retail receivable of approximately $3.2 million is expected to be
recovered.

Income Tax Matters

Legislation

On February 17, 2009, President Obama signed into law the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of
2009 (ARRA). Major tax incentives in the ARRA include an extension of bonus depreciation and
multiple renewable energy incentives. These incentives could have a significant impact on the
Company’s future cash flow and net income. Additionally, the ARRA includes programs for renewable
energy, transmission and smart grid enhancement, fossil energy and research, and energy efficiency
and conservation. The ultimate impact cannot be determined at this time.

Internal Revenue Code Section 199 Domestic Production Deduction

The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 created a tax deduction for a portion of income attributable
to U.S. production activities as defined in Section 199 (production activities deduction) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended (Internal Revenue Code). The deduction is equal to a
stated percentage of qualified production activities net income. The percentage is phased in over
the years 2005 through 2010 with a 3% rate applicable to the years 2005 and 2006, a 6% rate
applicable for years 2007 through 2009, and a 9% rate thereafter. The Internal Revenue Service
(IRS) has not clearly defined a methodology for calculating this deduction. However, Southern
Company has agreed with the IRS on a calculation methodology and signed a closing agreement on
December 11, 2008. Therefore, the Company reversed the unrecognized tax benefit and adjusted the
deduction to conform to the agreement. The net impact of the reversal of the unrecognized tax
benefits combined with the application of the new methodology had no material effect on the
Company’s financial statements. See Note 5 to the financial statements under “Effective Tax Rate”
for additional information.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2008 Annual Report

Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle

On January 16, 2009, the Company filed for a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity with
the Mississippi PSC to allow construction of a new electric generating plant located in Kemper
County, Mississippi. The plant would utilize an advanced coal IGCC with an output capacity of 582
megawatts. The Kemper IGCC will use locally mined lignite (an abundant, lower heating value coal)
from a proposed mine adjacent to the plant as fuel. This certificate, if approved by the
Mississippi PSC, would authorize the Company to acquire, construct and operate the Kemper IGCC and
related facilities. The Kemper IGCC, subject to federal and state environmental reviews and
certain regulatory approvals, is expected to begin commercial operation in November 2013. As part
of its filing, the Company has requested certain rate recovery treatment in accordance with the
base load construction legislation. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL — “PSC Matters — Mississippi
Base Load Construction Legislation” herein for additional information.

The Company filed an application in June 2006 with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for certain
tax credits available to projects using clean coal technologies under the Energy Policy Act of
2005. The DOE subsequently certified the Kemper IGCC, and in November 2006 the IRS allocated
Internal Revenue Code Section 48A tax credits of $133 million to the Company. The utilization of
these credits is dependent upon meeting the certification requirements for the Kemper IGCC,
including an in-service date no later than November 2013. The Company has secured all
environmental reviews and permits necessary to commence construction of the Kemper IGCC and has
entered into a binding contract for the steam turbine generator, completing two milestone
requirements for the Section 48A credits.

On February 14, 2008, the Company also requested that the DOE transfer the remaining funds
previously granted to a cancelled Southern Company project that would have been located in Orlando,
Florida. On December 12, 2008, an agreement was reached to assign the remaining funds to the
Kemper IGCC. The estimated construction cost of the Kemper IGCC is approximately $2.2 billion,
which is net of $220 million related to funding to be received from the DOE related to project
construction. The remaining DOE funding of $50 million is projected to be used for demonstration
over the first few years of operation.

Beginning in December 2006, the Mississippi PSC has approved the Company’s requested accounting
treatment to defer the costs associated with the Company’s generation resource planning,
evaluation, and screening activities as a regulatory asset. On December 22, 2008, the Company
requested an amendment to its original order that would allow these costs to continue to be charged
to and remain in a regulatory asset until January 1, 2010. In its application, the Company
reported that it anticipated spending approximately $61 million by or before May 31, 2009. At
December 31, 2008, the Company had spent $42.3 million of the $61 million, of which $3.7 million related to land
purchases capitalized. Of the remaining amount, $0.8 million was expensed and $37.8 million was
deferred in other regulatory assets.

The final outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.

Other Matters

On February 15, 2008, the Company received notice of termination from South Mississippi Electric
Power Association (SMEPA) of an approximately 100 MW territorial wholesale market based contract
effective March 31, 2011 which will result in a decrease in annual revenues of approximately $12
million. On December 17, 2008, the Company entered into a 10-year power supply agreement with
SMEPA for approximately 152 MW. This contract is effective April 1, 2011, upon approval from the
U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Rural Utilities Service. This contract is expected to increase
the Company’s annual territorial wholesale base revenues by approximately $16.1 million.

The Company is involved in various other matters being litigated and regulatory matters that could
affect future earnings. In addition, the Company is subject to certain claims and legal actions
arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company’s business activities are subject to
extensive governmental regulation related to public health and the environment. Litigation over
environmental issues and claims of various types, including property damage, personal injury,
common law nuisance, and citizen enforcement of environmental requirements such as opacity and air
and water quality standards, has increased generally throughout the United States. In particular,
personal injury claims for damages caused by alleged exposure to hazardous materials have become
more frequent. The ultimate outcome of such pending or potential litigation against the Company
cannot be predicted at this time; however, for current proceedings not specifically reported
herein, management does not anticipate that the liabilities, if any, arising from such current
proceedings would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial statements. See Note 3
to the financial statements for information regarding material issues.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2008 Annual Report

ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The Company prepares its financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. Significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the
financial statements. In the application of these policies, certain estimates are made that may
have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations and related disclosures. Different
assumptions and measurements could produce estimates that are significantly different from those
recorded in the financial statements. Senior management has reviewed and discussed critical
accounting policies and estimates described below with the Audit Committee of Southern Company’s
Board of Directors.

Electric Utility Regulation

The Company is subject to retail regulation by the Mississippi PSC and wholesale regulation by the
FERC. These regulatory agencies set the rates the Company is permitted to charge customers based
on allowable costs. As a result, the Company applies Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
Statement No. 71, “Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation” (SFAS No. 71), which
requires the financial statements to reflect the effects of rate regulation. Through the
ratemaking process, the regulators may require the inclusion of costs or revenues in periods
different than when they would be recognized by a non-regulated company. This treatment may result
in the deferral of expenses and the recording of related regulatory assets based on anticipated
future recovery through rates or the deferral of gains or creation of liabilities and the recording
of related regulatory liabilities. The application of SFAS No. 71 has a further effect on the
Company’s financial statements as a result of the estimates of allowable costs used in the
ratemaking process. These estimates may differ from those actually incurred by the Company;
therefore, the accounting estimates inherent in specific costs such as depreciation and pension and
postretirement benefits have less of a direct impact on the Company’s results of operations than
they would on a non-regulated company.

As reflected in Note 1 to the financial statements, significant regulatory assets and liabilities
have been recorded. Management reviews the ultimate recoverability of these regulatory assets and
liabilities based on applicable regulatory guidelines and accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States. However, adverse legislative, judicial, or regulatory actions could
materially impact the amounts of such regulatory assets and liabilities and could adversely impact
the Company’s financial statements.

Contingent Obligations

The Company is subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, as well as other
factors and conditions that potentially subject it to environmental, litigation, income tax, and
other risks. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL herein and Note 3 to the financial statements for more
information regarding certain of these contingencies. The Company periodically evaluates its
exposure to such risks and, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, records
reserves for those matters where a non-tax-related loss is considered probable and reasonably
estimable and records a tax asset or liability if it is more likely than not that a tax position
will be sustained. The adequacy of reserves can be significantly affected by external events or
conditions that can be unpredictable; thus, the ultimate outcome of such matters could materially
affect the Company’s financial statements. These events or conditions include the following:

II-319


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2008 Annual Report

Unbilled Revenues

Revenues related to the retail sale of electricity are recorded when electricity is delivered to
customers. However, the determination of KWH sales to individual customers is based on the
reading of their meters, which is performed on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the
end of each month, amounts of electricity delivered to customers, but not yet metered and billed,
are estimated. Components of the unbilled revenue estimates include total KWH territorial supply,
total KWH billed, estimated total electricity lost in delivery, and customer usage. These
components can fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including weather, generation
patterns, and power delivery volume and other operational constraints. These factors can be
unpredictable and can vary from historical trends. As a result, the overall estimate of unbilled
revenues could be significantly affected, which could have a material impact on the Company’s
results of operations.

Plant Daniel Operating Lease

As discussed in Note 7 to the financial statements under “Operating Leases — Plant Daniel Combined
Cycle Generating Units,” the Company leases a 1,064 megawatt natural gas combined cycle facility at
Plant Daniel (Facility) from Juniper Capital L.P. (Juniper). For both accounting and rate recovery
purposes, this transaction is treated as an operating lease, which means that the related
obligations under this agreement are not reflected in the balance sheets. See FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND LIQUIDITY — “Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements” herein for further information. The
operating lease determination was based on assumptions and estimates related to the following:

The determination of operating lease treatment was made at the inception of the lease agreement and
is not subject to change unless subsequent changes are made to the agreement. However, the Company
is also required to monitor Juniper’s ongoing status as a voting interest entity. Changes in that
status could require the Company to consolidate the Facility’s assets and the related debt and to
record interest and depreciation expense of approximately $37 million annually, rather than annual
lease expense of approximately $26 million.

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY

Overview

The Company’s financial condition remained stable at December 31, 2008. Throughout the recent
turmoil in the financial markets, the Company has maintained adequate access to capital without
drawing on any of its committed bank credit arrangements used to support its commercial paper
programs and variable rate pollution control revenue bonds. The Company has continued to issue
commercial paper at reasonable rates. The Company intends to continue to monitor its access to
short-term and long-term capital markets as well as its bank credit arrangements to meet future
capital and liquidity needs. No material changes in bank credit arrangements have occurred
although market rates for committed credit have increased and the Company may be subject to higher
costs as its existing facilities are replaced or renewed. The Company’s interest cost for
short-term debt has decreased as market short-term interest rates have declined. The Company
experienced no material counterparty credit losses as a result of the turmoil in the financial
markets. The ultimate impact on future financing costs as a result of the financial turmoil cannot
be determined at this time. See “Sources of Capital” and “Financing Activities” herein for
additional information.

II-320


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2008 Annual Report

The Company’s investments in pension trust funds declined in value as of December 31, 2008. The
Company expects that the earliest that cash may have to be contributed to the pension trust fund is
2011 and such contribution could be significant; however, projections of the amount vary
significantly depending on interpretations of and decisions related to federal legislation passed
during 2008 as well as other key variables including future trust fund performance and cannot be
determined at this time.

Net cash provided from operating activities decreased from 2007 by $112.2 million. The decrease in
net cash provided from operating activities was primarily due to the receipt of grant proceeds of
$74.3 million in June 2007 and a decrease in operating activities related to receivables in 2008 in
the amount of $49.5 million. The decrease in receivables is primarily due to the change in under
recovered regulatory clause revenues of $24.7 million and a $24.1 change in affiliate receivables.
Also impacting operating activities were decreases related to fossil fuel stock of $33.3 million
primarily due to increases in coal and coal in-transit of $22.0 million and $15.6 million,
respectively. These were offset by an increase in deferred income taxes and investment tax credits
of $61.4 million. Net cash flow from operating activities increased in 2007 compared to 2006 by
$11.7 million primarily due to the Company’s receipt of $74.3 million in bond proceeds during 2007
related to Hurricane Katrina recovery, of which $60 million was used to fund the property damage
reserve and $14.3 million to recover retail operations and maintenance storm restoration cost. The
$153.0 million increase in net cash from operating activities for 2006 compared to 2005 resulted
primarily from $120.3 million received from the CDBG program.

The $55.3 million increase in net cash used for investing activities in 2008 was primarily due to a
$12.1 million increase in construction payables and a $27.6 million increase due to the capital
portion of Hurricane Katrina grant proceeds received in 2007. The change in net cash used for
investing activities in 2007 compared to 2006 of $107.0 million was primarily due to a $117.8
million reduction in the sources of funds related to Hurricane Katrina capital related grant
proceeds received in 2006 and bond proceeds. The change in net cash provided from investing
activities in 2006 compared to 2005 of $176.9 million was primarily due to a $152.8 million receipt
of capital related grant and bond proceeds related to Hurricane Katrina.

Net cash provided from financing activities totaled $78.9 million in 2008 compared to $105.5
million that was used in financing activities for the corresponding period in 2007. The $184.5
million increase in net cash provided from financing activities was primarily due to the $80
million long-term bank loan issued to the Company in March 2008, the $50 million senior notes
issued in November 2008 and the $36 million redemption of the long-term debt to an affiliated trust
in the first nine months of 2007. Notes payable increased by $57.8 million primarily due to
additional borrowings from commercial paper. Net cash used for financing activities totaled $105.5
million in 2007 compared to $211.5 million in 2006. This decrease in net cash used for financing
activities is primarily due to a decrease in the use of funds related to notes payable of $109.3
million. Net cash used for financing activities totaled $211.5 million in 2006 compared to net
cash provided from financing activities of $135.9 million in 2005. This increase in net cash used
for financing activities is primarily due to an increase in the use of funds related to notes
payable of $352.9 million.

Significant changes in the balance sheet as of December 31, 2008, compared to 2007 include an
increase in fossil fuel inventory of $38.1 million primarily due to increases in coal and coal
in-transit of $22.0 million and $15.6 million, respectively. Other regulatory assets increased
$135.9 million primarily due to mark to market losses on forward gas contracts and the change in
the market value of pension plan assets. Prepaid pension cost decreased $66.1 million due to the
decline in the market value of pension plan assets. Securities due within one year increased by
$40.1 million due to senior notes maturing in 2009. Long-term debt increased by $88.5 million
primarily due to an $80 million long-term bank loan issued to the Company in March 2008 and $50
million in senior notes issued in November 2008, partially offset by the $36 million redemption of
the long-term debt to an affiliated trust in 2007. The increase in employee benefit obligations of
$53.9 million and the decrease in other regulatory liabilities of $68.1 million were primarily due
to the decline in the market value of pension assets. See Note 2 to the financial statements under
“Pension Plans” for additional information.

The Company’s ratio of common equity to total capitalization, excluding long-term debt due within
one year, decreased from 66.1% in 2007 to 61.2% at December 31, 2008. The Company has received
investment grade credit ratings from the major rating agencies with respect to debt, preferred
securities, and preferred stock. See SELECTED FINANCIAL AND OPERATING DATA for additional
information regarding the Company’s security ratings.

Sources of Capital

The Company plans to obtain the funds required for construction, and other purposes from sources
such as operating cash flows, security issuances, term loans, short-term borrowings and capital
contributions from Southern Company. See “Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations” herein
and Note 3 to the financial statements under “Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle” for

Mississippi Power Company 2008 Annual Report

additional information. The amount, type, and timing of any financings, if needed, will depend
upon regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions, and other factors.

The issuance of securities by the Company is subject to regulatory approval by the FERC.
Additionally, with respect to the public offering of securities, the Company files registration
statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (1933 Act). The amounts of securities authorized by the FERC, as well as the amounts
registered under the 1933 Act, are continuously monitored and appropriate filings are made to
ensure flexibility in the capital markets.

The Company obtains financing separately without credit support from any affiliate. The Southern
Company system does not maintain a centralized cash or money pool. Therefore, funds of the Company
are not commingled with funds of any other company.

To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, the Company has various sources of liquidity. At
December 31, 2008, the Company had approximately $22.4 million of cash and cash equivalents and
$98.5 million of unused credit arrangements with banks. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, the
Company increased an existing credit agreement by $10 million. The facility matures in the third
quarter of 2009 and allows for the execution of a two year term loan. See Note 6 to the financial
statements under “Bank Credit Arrangements” for additional information.

The Company may also meet short-term cash needs through a Southern Company subsidiary organized to
issue and sell commercial paper at the request and for the benefit of the Company and the other
traditional operating companies. Proceeds from such issuances for the benefit of the Company are
loaned directly to the Company and are not commingled with proceeds from such issuances for the
benefit of any other operating company. The obligations of each company under these arrangements
are several; there is no cross affiliate credit support. At December 31, 2008, the Company had
$26.3 million of commercial paper outstanding.

Financing Activities

During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company issued senior notes totaling $50 million. Proceeds
were used to repay a portion of the Company’s short-term indebtedness.

In September 2008, the Company was required to purchase a total of approximately $7.9 million of
variable rate pollution control revenue bonds that were tendered by investors. In December 2008,
the bonds were successfully remarketed.

Also during 2008, the Company entered into a three-year term loan agreement of $80 million.
Proceeds were used to repay a portion of the Company’s short-term indebtedness and for other
corporate purposes, including the Company’s continuous construction program.

In addition to any financings that may be necessary to meet capital requirements and contractual
obligations, the Company plans to continue, when economically feasible, a program to retire
higher-cost securities and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital if market conditions
permit.

Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements

In 2001, the Company began an initial 10-year term of a lease agreement for a combined cycle
generating facility built at Plant Daniel. In June 2003, the Company entered into a restructured
lease agreement for the Facility with Juniper, as discussed in Note 7 to the financial statements
under “Operating Leases — Plant Daniel Combined Cycle Generating Units.” Juniper has also entered
into leases with other parties unrelated to the Company. The assets leased by the Company comprise
less than 50% of Juniper’s assets. The Company does not consolidate the leased assets and related
liabilities, and the lease with Juniper is considered an operating lease. Accordingly, the lease
is not reflected in the balance sheets.

The initial lease term ends in 2011, and the lease includes a renewal and a purchase option based
on the cost of the Facility at the inception of the lease, which was approximately $370 million.
The Company is required to amortize approximately 4% of the initial acquisition cost over the
initial lease term. Eighteen months prior to the end of the initial lease, the Company may elect
to renew for 10 years. If the lease is renewed, the agreement calls for the Company to amortize an
additional 17% of the initial completion cost over the renewal period. Upon termination of the
lease, at the Company’s option, it may either exercise its purchase option or the Facility can be
sold to a third party.

II-322


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2008 Annual Report

The lease also provides for a residual value guarantee, approximately 73% of the acquisition cost,
by the Company that is due upon termination of the lease in the event that the Company does not
renew the lease or purchase the Facility and that the fair market value is less than the
unamortized cost of the Facility.

Credit Rating Risk

The Company does not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in payment
schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade. There are certain contracts
that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of a credit rating change
to BBB- and/or Baa3 or below. These contracts are for physical electricity purchases and sales,
fuel purchases, fuel transportation and storage, emissions allowances and energy price risk
management. At December 31, 2008, the maximum potential collateral requirements under these
contracts at BBB- and/or Baa3 rating were approximately $6 million. At December 31, 2008, the
maximum potential collateral requirements under these contracts at a rating below BBB- and/or Baa3
were approximately $149 million. Included in these amounts are certain agreements that could
require collateral in the event that one or more power pool participants has a credit rating change
to below investment grade. Generally, collateral may be provided by a Southern Company guaranty,
letter of credit, or cash. Additionally, any credit rating downgrade could impact the Company’s
ability to access capital markets, particularly the short-term debt market.

Market Price Risk

Due to cost-based rate regulation, the Company has limited exposure to market volatility in
interest rates, commodity fuel prices, and prices of electricity. To manage the volatility
attributable to these exposures, the Company nets the exposures, where possible, to take advantage
of natural offsets and enters into various derivative transactions for the remaining exposures
pursuant to the Company’s policies in areas such as counterparty exposure and hedging practices.
The Company’s policy is that derivatives are to be used primarily for hedging purposes and mandates
strict adherence to all applicable risk management policies. Derivative positions are monitored
using techniques that include, but are not limited to, market valuation, value at risk, stress
testing, and sensitivity analysis.

The Company does not currently hedge interest rate risk. The weighted average interest rate on
$160 million of variable rate long-term debt at December 31, 2008 was 1.79%. If the Company
sustained a 100 basis point change in interest rates for all unhedged variable rate long-term debt,
the change would affect annualized interest expense by approximately $1.6 million at December 31,
2008. See Notes 1 and 6 to the financial statements under “Financial Instruments” for additional
information.

To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity prices, the Company enters into
fixed-price contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity through the wholesale electricity
market. At December 31, 2008, exposure from these activities was not material to the Company’s
financial statements.

In addition, per the guidelines of the Mississippi PSC, the Company has implemented a fuel-hedging
program. At December 31, 2008, exposure from these activities was not material to the Company’s
financial statements.

The changes in fair value of energy-related derivative contracts were as follows at December 31:

Current period changes also include the changes in fair value of new contracts entered into

The decrease in the fair value positions of the energy-related derivative contracts for the year
ended December 31, 2008 was $54.0 million, substantially, all of which is due to natural gas
positions. This change is attributable to both the volume and prices of natural gas. At December
31, 2008, the Company had a net hedge volume of 28.9 billion cubic feet (Bcf) with a weighted
average contract cost approximately $1.89 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) above market
prices, and 15.6 Bcf at December 31, 2007 with a

weighted average contract cost approximately $0.09 per mmBtu below market prices. The majority of
the natural gas hedges are recovered through the Company’s fuel cost recovery clauses.

At December 31, 2008, the net fair value of energy-related derivative contracts by hedge
designation was reflected in the financial statements as assets/(liabilities) as follows:

Energy-related derivative contracts which are designated as regulatory hedges significantly relate
to the Company’s fuel hedging programs, where gains and losses are initially recorded as regulatory
liabilities and assets, respectively, and then are included in fuel expense as they are recovered
through the energy cost management clause. Gains and losses on energy-related derivatives
designated as cash flow hedges are used to hedge anticipated purchases and sales and are initially
deferred in other comprehensive income before being recognized in income in the same period as the
hedged transaction. Gains and losses on energy-related derivative contracts that are not
designated or fail to qualify as hedges are recognized in the statements of income as incurred.
The pre-tax gains/(losses) reclassified from other comprehensive income to revenue and fuel expense
were not material for any period presented and are not expected to be material for 2009.
Additionally, there was no material ineffectiveness recorded in earnings for any period presented.
The Company has energy-related hedges in place up to and including 2012.

Unrealized pre-tax gains and losses from energy-related derivative contracts recognized in income
were not material for any year presented.

The maturities of the energy-related derivative contracts and the level of the fair value hierarchy
in which they fall at December 31, 2008 are as follows:

As part of the adoption of FASB Statement No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (SFAS No. 157) to
increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, the
table above now uses the three-tier fair value hierarchy, as discussed in Note 9 to the financial
statements, as opposed to the previously used descriptions “actively quoted,” “external sources,”
and “models and other methods.” The three-tier fair value hierarchy focuses on the fair value of
the contract itself, whereas the previous descriptions focused on the source of the inputs.
Because the Company uses over-the-counter contracts that are not exchange traded but are fair
valued using prices which are actively quoted, the valuations of those contracts now appear in
Level 2; previously they were shown as “actively quoted.”

The Company is exposed to market price risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to the
energy-related derivative contracts. The Company’s practice is to enter into agreements with
counterparties that have investment grade credit ratings by Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s or with
counterparties who have posted collateral to cover potential credit exposure. Therefore, the
Company does not anticipate market risk exposure from nonperformance by the counterparties. For
additional information, see Notes 1 and 6 to the financial statements under “Financial
Instruments.”

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2008 Annual Report

Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations

The construction program of the Company is currently estimated to be $163 million for 2009,
$467 million for 2010, and $1,004 million for 2011. These estimates include costs for new
generation construction. Environmental expenditures included in these estimated amounts are
$28 million, $61 million, and $111 million for 2009, 2010, and 2011, respectively. The
construction program is subject to periodic review and revision, and actual construction costs may
vary from these estimates because of numerous factors. These factors include: changes in business
conditions; revised load growth estimates; storm impacts; changes in environmental statutes and
regulations; changes in FERC rules and regulations; Mississippi PSC approvals; the cost and
efficiency of construction labor, equipment, and materials; and the cost of capital. In addition,
there can be no assurance that costs related to capital expenditures will be fully recovered.

In addition, as discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company provides
postretirement benefits to substantially all employees and funds trusts to the extent required by
the FERC.

Other funding requirements related to obligations associated with scheduled maturities of long-term
debt, as well as the related interest, derivative obligations, preferred stock dividends, leases,
and other purchase commitments, are as follows. See Notes 1, 6, and 7 to the financial statements
for additional information.

All amounts are reflected based on final maturity dates. The Company plans to continue to retire higher-cost securities and replace these
obligations with lower-cost capital if market conditions permit. Variable rate interest obligations are estimated based on rates as of
January 1, 2008, as reflected in the statements of capitalization.

The decrease from 2010-2011 to 2012-2013 is primarily a result of the Daniel Operating lease contract that is scheduled to end during 2011.

(e)

The Company generally does not enter into non-cancelable commitments for other operations and maintenance expenditures. Total other
operations and maintenance expenses for 2008, 2007, and 2006 were $260 million, $255 million, and $237 million, respectively.

(f)

The Company forecasts capital expenditures over a three-year period. Amounts represent current estimates of total expenditures. At
December 31, 2008, significant purchase commitments were outstanding in connection with the construction program.

(g)

Natural gas purchase commitments are based on various indices at the time of delivery. Amounts reflected have been estimated based on the
New York Mercantile Exchange future prices at December 31, 2008.

(h)

Long-term service agreements include price escalation based on inflation indices.

(i)

The Company forecasts postretirement trust contributions over a three-year period. The Company expects that the earliest that cash may
have to be contributed to the pension trust fund is 2011 and such contribution could be significant; however, projections of the amount
vary significantly depending on interpretations of and decisions related to federal legislation passed during 2008 as well as other key
variables including future trust fund performance and cannot be determined at this time. Therefore, no amounts related to the pension
trust fund are included in the table. See Note 2 to the financial statements for additional information related to the pension and
postretirement plans, including estimated benefit payments. Certain benefit payments will be made through the related trusts. Other
benefit payments will be made from the Company’s corporate assets.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Mississippi Power Company 2008 Annual Report

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

General

Mississippi Power Company (the Company) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Southern Company, which is
the parent company of four traditional operating companies, Southern Power Company (Southern
Power), Southern Company Services, Inc. (SCS), Southern Communications Services, Inc. (SouthernLINC
Wireless), Southern Company Holdings, Inc. (Southern Holdings), Southern Nuclear Operating Company,
Inc. (Southern Nuclear), and other direct and indirect subsidiaries. The traditional operating
companies, Alabama Power Company (Alabama Power), Georgia Power Company (Georgia Power), Gulf Power
Company (Gulf Power), and Mississippi Power Company (Mississippi Power), are vertically integrated
utilities providing electric service in four Southeastern states. The Company operates as a
vertically integrated utility providing service to retail customers in southeast Mississippi and to
wholesale customers in the Southeast. Southern Power constructs, acquires, owns, and manages
generation assets and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market. SCS, the
system service company, provides, at cost, specialized services to Southern Company and its
subsidiary companies. SouthernLINC Wireless provides digital wireless communications for use by
Southern Company and its subsidiary companies and also markets these services to the public and
provides fiber cable services within the Southeast. Southern Holdings is an intermediate holding
company subsidiary for Southern Company’s investments in leveraged leases and various other
energy-related businesses. Southern Nuclear operates and provides services to Southern Company’s
nuclear power plants.

The equity method is used for entities in which the Company has significant influence but does not
control and for variable interest entities where the Company is not the primary beneficiary.

The Company is subject to regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the
Mississippi Public Service Commission (PSC). The Company follows accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States and complies with the accounting policies and practices prescribed by
its regulatory commissions. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires the use of estimates, and the actual
results may differ from those estimates.

Reclassifications

Certain prior years’ data presented in the financial statements have been reclassified to conform
to the current year presentation. The statements of income for the prior periods presented have
been modified within the operating expenses section to combine the line items “Other operations”
and “Maintenance” into a single line item entitled “Other operations and maintenance.” The balance
sheet at December 31, 2007 was modified to present a separate line for “Liabilities for risk
management activities” previously included in “Other.” These reclassifications had no effect on
total assets, net income, or cash flows.

Affiliate Transactions

The Company has an agreement with SCS under which the following services are rendered to the
Company at direct or allocated cost: general and design engineering, purchasing, accounting and
statistical analysis, finance and treasury, tax, information resources, marketing, auditing,
insurance and pension administration, human resources, systems and procedures, digital wireless
communications, and other services with respect to business and operations and power pool
transactions. Costs for these services amounted to $87 million, $71.8 million, and $55.2 million
during 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. Cost allocation methodologies used by SCS were approved
by the Securities and Exchange Commission prior to the repeal of the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935, as amended, and management believes they are reasonable. The FERC permits services to
be rendered at cost by system service companies.

The Company provides incidental services to and receives such services from other Southern Company
subsidiaries which are generally minor in duration and amount. The Company provided no significant
service to an affiliate in 2008, 2007, and 2006. The Company received storm restoration assistance
from other Southern Company subsidiaries totaling $3.2 million and $1.5 million in 2008 and 2006,
respectively. There was no storm assistance received in 2007.

The Company has an agreement with Alabama Power under which the Company owns a portion of Greene
County Steam Plant. Alabama Power operates Greene County Steam Plant, and the Company reimburses
Alabama Power for its proportionate share of all associated expenditures and costs. The Company
reimbursed Alabama Power for the Company’s proportionate share of related expenses which totaled
$11.1 million, $9.8 million, and $8.6 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. The Company
also has

II-334


NOTES (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2008 Annual Report

an agreement with Gulf Power under which Gulf Power owns a portion of Plant Daniel. The Company
operates Plant Daniel, and Gulf Power reimburses the Company for its proportionate share of all
associated expenditures and costs. Gulf Power reimbursed the Company for Gulf Power’s
proportionate share of related expenses which totaled $22.8 million, $23.1 million, and
$19.7 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. See Note 4 for additional information.

The traditional operating companies, including the Company, and Southern Power may jointly enter
into various types of wholesale energy, natural gas, and certain other contracts, either directly
or through SCS, as agent. Each participating company may be jointly and severally liable for the
obligations incurred under these agreements. See Note 7 under “Fuel Commitments” for additional
information.

Regulatory Assets and Liabilities

The Company is subject to the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement
No. 71, “Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation” (SFAS No. 71). Regulatory
assets represent probable future revenues associated with certain costs that are expected to be
recovered from customers through the ratemaking process. Regulatory liabilities represent probable
future reductions in revenues associated with amounts that are expected to be credited to customers
through the ratemaking process.

Regulatory assets and (liabilities) reflected in the balance sheets at December 31 relate to:

NOTES (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2008 Annual Report

In the event that a portion of the Company’s operations is no longer subject to the provisions of
SFAS No. 71, the Company would be required to write off or reclassify to accumulated other
comprehensive income related regulatory assets and liabilities that are not specifically
recoverable through regulated rates. In addition, the Company would be required to determine if
any impairment to other assets, including plant, exists and write down the assets, if impaired, to
their fair values. All regulatory assets and liabilities are to be reflected in rates.

Government Grants

The Company received a grant in October 2006 from the Mississippi Development Authority (MDA) for
$276.4 million, primarily for storm damage cost recovery. On June 1, 2007, the Company received a
grant payment of $85.2 million from the State of Mississippi related to storm restoration costs
incurred and to increase the property damage reserve. In the fourth quarter 2007, the Company
received additional grant payments totaling $24.1 million for expenditures incurred to date for
construction of a new storm operations center. On May 23, 2008, the Company received grant
payments in the amount of $7.3 million and anticipates the receipt of approximately $3.2 million in
2009. The grant proceeds do not represent a future obligation of the Company. The portion of any
grants received related to retail storm recovery was applied to the retail regulatory asset that
was established as restoration costs were incurred. The portion related to wholesale storm
recovery was recorded either as a reduction to operations and maintenance expense or as a reduction
to total property, plant, and equipment depending on the restoration work performed and the
appropriate allocations of cost of service.

Revenues

Energy and other revenues are recognized as services are rendered. Wholesale capacity revenues
from long-term contracts are recognized at the lesser of the levelized amount or the amount
billable under the contract over the respective contract period. Unbilled revenues related to
retail sales are accrued at the end of each fiscal period. The Company’s retail and wholesale
rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, fuel hedging, the
energy component of purchased power costs, and certain other costs. Retail rates also include
provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in costs for ad valorem taxes and certain qualifying
environmental costs. Revenues are adjusted for differences between these actual costs and amounts
billed in current regulated rates. Under or over recovered regulatory clause revenues are recorded
in the balance sheets and are recovered or returned to customers through adjustments to the billing
factors. The Company is required to file with the Mississippi PSC for an adjustment to the fuel
cost recovery factor annually.

The Company has a diversified base of customers.  For years ended December 31, 2008, and
December 31, 2007, no single customer or industry comprises 10% or more of revenues. For all
periods presented, uncollectible accounts averaged less than 1% of revenues.

Fuel Costs

Fuel costs are expensed as the fuel is used. Fuel expense generally includes the cost of purchased
emission allowances as they are used. Fuel costs also included gains and/or losses from fuel
hedging programs as approved by the Mississippi PSC.

Income and Other Taxes

The Company uses the liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes and provides deferred
income taxes for all significant income tax temporary differences. Investment tax credits utilized
are deferred and amortized to income over the average life of the related property. Taxes that are
collected from customers on behalf of governmental agencies to be remitted to these agencies are
presented net on the statements of income.

In accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes” (FIN
48), the Company recognizes tax positions that are “more likely than not” of being sustained upon
examination by the appropriate taxing authorities. See Note 5 under “Unrecognized Tax Benefits”
for additional information.

Property, Plant, and Equipment

Property, plant, and equipment is stated at original cost less regulatory disallowances and
impairments. Original cost includes: materials; labor; minor items of property; appropriate
administrative and general costs; payroll-related costs such as taxes, pensions, and other
benefits; and the interest capitalized and/or cost of funds used during construction for projects
over $10 million.

The cost of replacements of property, exclusive of minor items of property, is capitalized. The
cost of maintenance, repairs, and replacement of minor items of property is charged to maintenance
expense except for the cost of maintenance of coal cars and a portion of the railway track
maintenance costs, which are charged to fuel stock and recovered through the Company’s fuel clause.

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation of the original cost of plant in service is provided primarily by using composite
straight-line rates, which approximated 3.3%, in 2008 and 2007, and 3.2% in 2006. Depreciation
studies are conducted periodically to update the composite rates. In March 2006, the Mississippi
PSC approved the study filed by the Company in 2005, with new rates effective January 1, 2006. The
new depreciation rates did not result in a material change to annual depreciation expense. When
property subject to depreciation is retired or otherwise disposed of in the normal course of
business, its cost, together with the cost of removal, less salvage, is charged to the accumulated
depreciation provision. Minor items of property included in the original cost of the plant are
retired when the related property unit is retired. Depreciation expense includes an amount for the
expected cost of removal of facilities.

In April 2007, the Mississippi PSC issued an order allowing the Company to defer certain
reliability related maintenance costs beginning January 1, 2007, and recover them evenly over a
four-year period beginning January 1, 2008. These costs related to maintenance that was needed as
follow-up to emergency repairs that were made subsequent to Hurricane Katrina. At December 31,
2007, the Company had incurred and deferred the retail portion of $9.5 million of such costs. At
December 31, 2008, the Company had a balance of the deferred retail portion of $7.1 million with
$2.4 million included in current assets as other regulatory assets and $4.7 million included in
long-term other regulatory assets.

In January 2006, the Mississippi PSC issued an accounting order directing the Company to exclude
from its calculation of depreciation expense approximately $1.2 million related to capitalized
Hurricane Katrina costs since these costs were recovered separately.

In December 2003, the Mississippi PSC issued an interim accounting order directing the Company to
expense and record a regulatory liability of $60.3 million while it considered the Company’s
request to include 266 megawatts of Plant Daniel Units 3 and 4 generating capacity in
jurisdictional cost of service. In May 2004, the Mississippi PSC approved the Company’s request
effective January 1, 2004, and ordered the Company to amortize the regulatory liability previously
established to reduce depreciation and amortization expenses over a four year period. The amounts
amortized were $5.7 million and $13.0 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Asset Retirement Obligations and Other Costs of Removal

Asset retirement obligations are computed as the present value of the ultimate costs for an asset’s
future retirement and are recorded in the period in which the liability is incurred. The costs are
capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset’s useful life.
The Company has received accounting guidance from the Mississippi PSC allowing the continued
accrual of other future retirement costs for long-lived assets that the Company does not have a
legal obligation to retire. Accordingly, the accumulated removal costs for these obligations will
continue to be reflected in the balance sheets as a regulatory liability.

The Company has retirement obligations related to various landfill sites, underground storage
tanks, and asbestos removal. In connection with the adoption of FASB Interpretation No. 47,
“Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations” (FIN 47) the Company also recorded
additional asset retirement obligations (and assets) of $9.5 million, primarily related to
asbestos. The Company also has identified retirement obligations related to certain transmission
and distribution facilities, co-generation facilities, certain wireless communication towers, and
certain structures authorized by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. However, liabilities
for the removal of these assets have not been recorded because the range of time over which the
Company may settle these

II-337


NOTES (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2008 Annual Report

obligations is unknown and cannot be reasonably estimated. The Company will continue to recognize
in the statements of income allowed removal costs in accordance with its regulatory treatment. Any
differences between costs recognized under FASB Statement No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations” (SFAS No. 143) and FIN 47 and those reflected in rates are recognized as either a
regulatory asset or liability, as ordered by the Mississippi PSC, and are reflected in the balance
sheets.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles

The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. The determination of
whether an impairment has occurred is based on either a specific regulatory disallowance or an
estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets, as compared with the
carrying value of the assets. If an impairment has occurred, the amount of the impairment
recognized is determined by either the amount of regulatory disallowance or by estimating the fair
value of the asset and recording a loss for the amount if the carrying value is greater than the
fair value. For assets identified as held for sale, the carrying value is compared to the
estimated fair value less the cost to sell in order to determine if an impairment loss is required.
Until the assets are disposed of, their estimated fair value is re-evaluated when circumstances or
events change.

Provision for Property Damage

The Company carries insurance for the cost of certain types of damage to generation plants and
general property. However, the Company is self-insured for the cost of storm, fire, and other
uninsured casualty damage to its property, including transmission and distribution facilities. As
permitted by the Mississippi PSC and the FERC, the Company accrues for the cost of such damage
through an annual expense accrual credited to a regulatory liability account. The cost of
repairing actual damage resulting from such events that individually exceed $50,000 is charged to
the reserve. A 1999 Mississippi PSC order allowed the Company to accrue $1.5 million to
$4.6 million to the reserve annually, with a maximum reserve totaling $23 million. In
October 2006, in conjunction with the Mississippi PSC Hurricane Katrina-related financing order,
the Mississippi PSC ordered the Company to cease all accruals to the retail property damage reserve
until a new reserve cap is established. However, in the same financing order, the Mississippi PSC
approved the replenishment of the retail property damage reserve with $60 million to be funded with
a portion of the proceeds of bonds to be issued by the Mississippi Development Bank on behalf of
the State of Mississippi and reported as liabilities by the State of Mississippi. The Company
received the $60 million bond proceeds in June 2007. The Company accrued $0.2 million annually in
2008, 2007, and 2006 for the wholesale jurisdiction. The Company made no discretionary retail
accruals in 2008 and 2007 as a result of the order. In 2006, the Company accrued $1.0 million for
the retail jurisdiction. On January 9, 2009, the Mississippi PSC approved the System Restoration
Rider (SRR) stipulation between the Company and the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff. In
accordance with the stipulation, every three years the Mississippi PSC, Mississippi Public
Utilities Staff and the Company will agree on SRR revenue level(s) for the ensuing period, based on
historical data, expected exposure, type and amount of insurance coverage, excluding insurance cost
and any other relevant information. The accrual amount and the reserve balance are determined
based on the SRR revenue level(s). If a significant change in circumstances occurs then the SRR
revenue level can be adjusted more frequently if the Company and the Mississippi Public Utilities
Staff or the Mississippi PSC deem the change appropriate. Each year the Company will set rates to
collect the approved SRR revenues. The property damage reserve accrual will be the difference
between the approved SRR revenues and the SRR revenue requirement, excluding any accrued to the
reserve. In addition, SRR allows the Company to set up a regulatory asset, pending review, if the
allowable actual retail property damage costs exceed the amount in the retail property damage
reserve. See Note 3 under “Retail Regulatory Matters — Storm Damage Cost Recovery” and “Retail

Mississippi Power Company 2008 Annual Report

Cash and Cash Equivalents

For purposes of the financial statements, temporary cash investments are considered cash
equivalents. Temporary cash investments are securities with original maturities of 90 days or
less.

Materials and Supplies

Generally, materials and supplies include the average cost of transmission, distribution, and
generating plant materials. Materials are charged to inventory when purchased and then expensed or
capitalized to plant, as appropriate, at weighted average cost when installed.

Fuel Inventory

Fuel inventory includes the average costs of oil, coal, natural gas, and emission allowances. Fuel
is charged to inventory when purchased and then expensed as used and recovered by the Company
through fuel cost recovery rates approved by the Mississippi PSC. Emission allowances granted by
the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are included in inventory at zero cost.

Financial Instruments

The Company uses derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to fluctuations in the prices
of certain fuel purchases and electricity purchases and sales. All derivative financial
instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities (categorized in “Other” or shown
separately as “Risk Management Activities”) and are measured at fair value. See Note 9 for
additional information. Substantially all of the Company’s bulk energy purchases and sales
contracts that meet the definition of a derivative are exempt from fair value accounting
requirements and are accounted for under the accrual method. Other derivative contracts qualify as
cash flow hedges of anticipated transactions or are recoverable through the Mississippi PSC
approved fuel hedging program as discussed below. This results in the deferral of related gains
and losses in other comprehensive income or regulatory assets and liabilities, respectively, as
appropriate until the hedged transactions occur. Any ineffectiveness arising from cash flow hedges
is recognized currently in net income. Other derivative contracts are marked to market through
current period income and are recorded on a net basis in the statements of income. See Note 6
under “Financial Instruments” for additional information.

The Company does not offset fair value amounts recognized for multiple derivative instruments
executed with the same counterparty under a master netting arrangement. Additionally, the Company
has no outstanding collateral repayment obligations or rights to reclaim collateral arising from
derivative instruments recognized at December 31, 2008.

The Mississippi PSC has approved the Company’s request to implement an Energy Cost Management
clause (ECM) which, among other things, allows the Company to utilize financial instruments to
hedge its fuel commitments. Changes in the fair value of these financial instruments are recorded
as regulatory assets or liabilities. Amounts paid or received as a result of financial settlement
of these instruments are classified as fuel expense and are included in the ECM factor applied to
customer billings. The Company’s jurisdictional wholesale customers have a similar ECM mechanism,
which has been approved by the FERC.

The Company is exposed to losses related to financial instruments in the event of counterparties’
nonperformance. The Company has established controls to determine and monitor the creditworthiness
of counterparties in order to mitigate the Company’s exposure to counterparty credit risk.

The fair values were based on either closing market prices (Level 1) or closing prices of
comparable instruments (Level 2). See Note 9 for all other items recognized at fair value in the
financial statements.

Comprehensive Income

The objective of comprehensive income is to report a measure of all changes in common stock equity
of an enterprise that result from transactions and other economic events of the period other than
transactions with owners. Comprehensive income consists of net income, changes in the fair value
of qualifying cash flow hedges, and prior to the adoption of SFAS No.158, “Employers’ Accounting
for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans” (SFAS No. 158) the minimum pension
liability, less income taxes and reclassifications for amounts included in net income.

Variable Interest Entities

The primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity must consolidate the related assets and
liabilities. The Company has established a wholly-owned trust to issue preferred securities. See
Note 6 under “Long-Term Debt Payable to Affiliated Trust” for additional information. However, the
Company is not considered the primary beneficiary of the trust. Therefore, the investments in this
trust are reflected as Other Investments and the related loan from the trust is included in
Long-term Debt in the balance sheets. During 2007 the Company redeemed its last remaining series
of preferred securities, which totaled $36 million.

2. RETIREMENT BENEFITS

The Company has a defined benefit, trusteed, pension plan covering substantially all employees. The
plan is funded in accordance with requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as amended (ERISA). No contributions to the plan are expected for the year ending December
31, 2009. The Company also provides certain defined benefit pension plans for a selected group of
management and highly compensated employees. Benefits under these non-qualified pension plans are
funded on a cash basis. In addition, the Company provides certain medical care and life insurance
benefits for retired employees through other postretirement benefit plans. The Company funds trusts
to the extent required by the FERC. For the year ending December 31, 2009, postretirement trust
contributions are expected to total approximately $0.1 million.

The measurement date for plan assets and obligations for 2008 was December 31 while the measurement
date for prior years was September 30. Pursuant to SFAS No. 158, the Company was required to change
the measurement date for its defined benefit postretirement plans from September 30 to December 31
beginning with the year ended December 31, 2008. As permitted, the Company adopted the measurement
date provisions of SFAS No. 158 effective January 1, 2008 resulting in an increase in long-term
liabilities of approximately $1.6 million and a decrease in prepaid pension costs of approximately
$0.1 million.

At December 31, 2008, the projected benefit obligations for the qualified and non-qualified pension
plans were $244.9 million and $22.0 million, respectively. All pension plan assets are related to
the qualified pension plan.

Pension plan assets are managed and invested in accordance with all applicable requirements,
including ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Internal Revenue Code). The
Company’s investment policy covers a diversified mix of assets, including equity and fixed income
securities, real estate, and private equity. Derivative instruments are used primarily as hedging
tools but may also be used to gain efficient exposure to the various asset classes. The Company
primarily minimizes the risk of large losses through diversification but also monitors and manages
other aspects of risk. The actual composition of the Company’s pension plan assets as of the end of
year, along with the targeted mix of assets, is presented below:

Net periodic pension cost (income) is the sum of service cost, interest cost, and other costs
netted against the expected return on plan assets. The expected return on plan assets is determined
by multiplying the expected rate of return on plan assets and the market-related value of plan
assets. In determining the market-related value of plan assets, the Company has elected to amortize
changes in the market value of all plan assets over five years rather than recognize the changes
immediately. As a result, the accounting value of plan assets that is used to calculate the
expected return on plan assets differs from the current fair value of the plan assets.

Future benefit payments reflect expected future service and are estimated based on assumptions used
to measure the projected benefit obligation for the pension plans. At December 31, 2008, estimated

Actuarial Assumptions

The weighted average rates assumed in the actuarial calculations used to determine both the benefit
obligations as of the measurement date and the net periodic costs for the pension and other
postretirement benefit plans for the following year are presented below. Net periodic benefit costs
were calculated in 2005 for the 2006 plan year using a discount rate of 5.50%.

The Company determined the long-term rate of return based on historical asset class returns and

multiple asset classes.

An additional assumption used in measuring the APBO was a weighted average medical care cost trend
rate of 9.15% for 2009, decreasing gradually to 5.50% through the year 2015 and remaining at that
level thereafter. An annual increase or decrease in the assumed medical care cost trend rate of 1%
would affect the APBO and the service and interest cost components at December 31, 2008 as follows:

Employee Savings Plan

The Company also sponsors a 401(k) defined contribution plan covering substantially all employees.
The Company provides an 85 percent matching contribution up to 6 percent of an employee’s base
salary. Prior to November 2006, the Company matched employee contributions at a rate of 75 percent
up to 6 percent of the employee’s base salary. Total matching contributions made to the plan for
2008, 2007, and 2006 were $3.7 million, $3.5 million, and $3.0 million, respectively.

3. CONTINGENCIES AND REGULATORY MATTERS

General Litigation Matters

The Company is subject to certain claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of
business. In addition, the Company’s business activities are subject to extensive governmental
regulation related to public health and the environment. Litigation over environmental issues and
claims of various types, including property damage, personal injury, common law nuisance, and
citizen enforcement of environmental requirements such as opacity and air and water quality
standards, has increased generally throughout the United States. In particular, personal injury
claims for damages caused by alleged exposure to hazardous materials have become more frequent.
The ultimate outcome of such pending or potential litigation against the Company cannot be
predicted at this time; however, for current proceedings not specifically reported herein,
management does not anticipate that the liabilities, if any, arising from such current proceedings
would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial statements.

Environmental Matters

New Source Review Actions

In November 1999, the EPA brought a civil action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of Georgia against certain Southern Company subsidiaries, including Alabama Power and
Georgia Power, alleging that these subsidiaries had violated the New Source Review (NSR) provisions
of the Clean Air Act and related state laws at certain coal-fired generating facilities. After
Alabama Power was dismissed from the original action for jurisdictional reasons, the EPA filed a
separate action in January 2001 against Alabama Power in the U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of Alabama. In these lawsuits, the EPA alleged that NSR violations occurred at eight
coal-fired generating facilities operated by Alabama Power and Georgia Power, including one
co-owned by the Company. The civil actions request penalties and injunctive relief, including an
order requiring installation of the best available

II-346


NOTES (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2008 Annual Report

control technology at the affected units. The action against Georgia Power has been
administratively closed since the spring of 2001, and the case has not been reopened.

In June 2006, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama entered a consent decree
between Alabama Power and the EPA, resolving a portion of the Alabama Power lawsuit relating to the
alleged NSR violations at Plant Miller. The consent decree required Alabama Power to pay $100,000
to resolve the government’s claim for a civil penalty and to donate $4.9 million of sulfur dioxide
emission allowances to a nonprofit charitable organization. It also formalized specific emissions
reductions to be accomplished by Alabama Power, consistent with other Clean Air Act programs that
require emissions reductions. In August 2006, the district court in Alabama granted Alabama
Power’s motion for summary judgment and entered final judgment in favor of Alabama Power on the
EPA’s claims related to all of the remaining plants: Plants Barry, Gaston, Gorgas, and Greene
County.

The plaintiffs appealed the district court’s decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh
Circuit, where the appeal was stayed, pending the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in a similar case
against Duke Energy. The Supreme Court issued its decision in the Duke Energy case in April 2007,
and in December 2007, the Eleventh Circuit vacated the district court’s decision in the Alabama
Power case and remanded the case back to the district court for consideration of the legal issues
in light of the Supreme Court’s decision in the Duke Energy case. On July 24, 2008, the U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of Alabama granted partial summary judgment in favor of
Alabama Power regarding the proper legal test for determining whether projects are routine
maintenance, repair, and replacement and therefore are excluded from NSR permitting. The decision
did not resolve the case, and the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this
time.

The Company believes that it complied with applicable laws and the EPA regulations and
interpretations in effect at the time the work in question took place. The Clean Air Act
authorizes maximum civil penalties of $25,000 to $37,500 per day, per violation at each generating
unit, depending on the date of the alleged violation. An adverse outcome in either of these cases
could require substantial capital expenditures or affect the timing of currently budgeted capital
expenditures that cannot be determined at this time and could possibly require payment of
substantial penalties. Such expenditures could affect future results of operations, cash flows,
and financial condition if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates.

Carbon Dioxide Litigation

New York Case

In July 2004, three environmental groups and attorneys general from eight states, each outside of
Southern Company’s service territory, and the corporation counsel for New York City filed
complaints in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against Southern
Company and four other electric power companies. The complaints allege that the companies’
emissions of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, contribute to global warming, which the plaintiffs
assert is a public nuisance. Under common law public and private nuisance theories, the plaintiffs
seek a judicial order (1) holding each defendant jointly and severally liable for creating,
contributing to, and/or maintaining global warming and (2) requiring each of the defendants to cap
its emissions of carbon dioxide and then reduce those emissions by a specified percentage each year
for at least a decade. The plaintiffs have not, however, requested that damages be awarded in
connection with their claims. Southern Company believes these claims are without merit and notes
that the complaint cites no statutory or regulatory basis for the claims. In September 2005, the
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York granted Southern Company’s and the other
defendants’ motions to dismiss these cases. The plaintiffs filed an appeal to the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit in October 2005, but no decision has been issued. The ultimate
outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Kivalina Case

On February 26, 2008, the Native Village of Kivalina and the City of Kivalina filed a suit in the
U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against several electric utilities
(including Southern Company), several oil companies, and a coal company. The plaintiffs are the
governing bodies of an Inupiat village in Alaska. The plaintiffs contend that the village is being
destroyed by erosion allegedly caused by global warming that the plaintiffs attribute to emissions
of greenhouse gases by the defendants. The plaintiffs assert claims for public and private
nuisance and contend that the defendants have acted in concert and are therefore jointly and
severally liable for the plaintiffs’ damages. The suit seeks damages for lost property values and
for the cost of relocating the village, which is alleged to be $95 million to $400 million. On
June 30, 2008, all defendants filed motions to dismiss this case. Southern Company believes that
these claims are without merit and notes that the complaint cites no statutory or regulatory basis
for the claims. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Environmental Remediation

The Company must comply with other environmental laws and regulations that cover the handling and
disposal of waste and releases of hazardous substances. Under these various laws and regulations,
the Company may also incur substantial costs to clean up properties. The Company has authority
from the Mississippi PSC to recover approved environmental compliance costs through regulatory
mechanisms.

In 2003, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) designated the Company as a
potentially responsible party at a site in Texas. The site was owned by an electric transformer
company that handled the Company’s transformers as well as those of many other entities. The site
owner is now in bankruptcy and the State of Texas has entered into an agreement with the Company
and several other utilities to investigate and remediate the site. Amounts expensed during 2006,
2007, and 2008 related to this work were not material. Hundreds of entities have received notices
from the TCEQ requesting their participation in the anticipated site remediation. The final impact
of this matter on the Company will depend upon further environmental assessment and the ultimate
number of potentially responsible parties. The remediation expenses incurred by the Company are
expected to be recovered through the ECO Plan.

The final outcome of these matters cannot now be determined. However, based on the currently known
conditions at these sites and the nature and extent of activities relating to these sites, the
Company does not believe that additional liabilities, if any, at these sites would be material to
the financial statements.

FERC Matters

Market-Based Rate Authority

The Company has authorization from the FERC to sell power to non-affiliates, including short-term
opportunity sales, at market-based prices. Specific FERC approval must be obtained with respect to
a market-based contract with an affiliate.

In December 2004, the FERC initiated a proceeding to assess Southern Company’s generation dominance
within its retail service territory. The ability to charge market-based rates in other markets is
not an issue in the proceeding. Any new market-based rate sales by the Company in Southern
Company’s retail service territory entered into during a 15-month refund period that ended in May
2006 could be subject to refund to a cost-based rate level.

In November 2007, the presiding administrative law judge issued an initial decision regarding the
methodology to be used in the generation dominance tests. The proceedings are ongoing. The
ultimate outcome of this generation dominance proceeding cannot now be determined, but an adverse
decision by the FERC in a final order could require the Company to charge cost-based rates for
certain wholesale sales in the Southern Company retail service territory, which may be lower than
negotiated market-based rates, and could also result in total refunds of up to $8.4 million, plus
interest. The Company believes that there is no meritorious basis for an adverse decision in this
proceeding and is vigorously defending itself in this matter.

In June 2007, the FERC issued its final rule in Order No. 697 regarding market-based rate
authority. The FERC generally retained its current market-based rate standards. Responding to a
number of requests for rehearing, the FERC issued Order No. 697-A on April 21, 2008 and Order No.
697-B on December 12, 2008. These orders largely affirmed the FERC’s prior revision and
codification of the regulations governing market-based rates for public utilities. In accordance
with the orders, Southern Company submitted to the FERC an updated market power analysis on
September 2, 2008 related to its continued market-based rate authority. The ultimate outcome of
this matter cannot now be determined.

On October 17, 2008, Southern Company filed with the FERC a revised market-based rate (MBR) tariff
and a new cost-based rate (CBR) tariff.   The revised MBR tariff provides for a “must offer” energy
auction whereby Southern Company offers all of its available energy for sale in a day-ahead auction
and an hour-ahead auction with reserve prices not to exceed the CBR tariff price, after considering
Southern Company’s native load requirements, reliability obligations, and sales commitments to
third parties. All sales under the energy auction would be at market clearing prices established
under the auction rules. The new CBR tariff provides for a cost-based price for wholesale sales of
less than a year. On December 18, 2008, the FERC issued an order conditionally accepting the MBR
tariff subject to certain revisions to the auction proposal. On January 21, 2009, Southern Company
made a compliance filing that accepted all the conditions of the MBR tariff order. When this order
becomes final, Southern Company will have 30 days to implement the wholesale auction. On December
31, 2008, the FERC issued an order conditionally accepting the CBR tariff subject to providing
additional information concerning one aspect of the tariff. On January 30, 2009, Southern Company
filed a response

II-348


NOTES (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2008 Annual Report

addressing the FERC inquiry to the CBR tariff order. Implementation of the energy auction in
accordance with the MBR tariff order is expected to adequately mitigate going forward any
presumption of market power that Southern Company may have in the Southern Company retail service
territory. The timing of when the FERC may issue the final orders on the MBR and CBR tariffs and
the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Intercompany Interchange Contract

The Company’s generation fleet is operated under the Intercompany Interchange Contract (IIC), as
approved by the FERC. In May 2005, the FERC initiated a new proceeding to examine (1) the
provisions of the IIC among the traditional operating companies (including the Company), Southern
Power, and Southern Company Services, Inc., as agent, under the terms of which the power pool of
Southern Company is operated, (2) whether any parties to the IIC have violated the FERC’s standards
of conduct applicable to utility companies that are transmission providers, and (3) whether
Southern Company’s code of conduct defining Southern Power as a “system company” rather than a
“marketing affiliate” is just and reasonable. In connection with the formation of Southern Power,
the FERC authorized Southern Power’s inclusion in the IIC in 2000. The FERC also previously
approved Southern Company’s code of conduct.

In October 2006, the FERC issued an order accepting a settlement resolving the proceeding subject
to Southern Company’s agreement to accept certain modifications to the settlement’s terms and
Southern Company notified the FERC that it accepted the modifications. The modifications largely
involve functional separation and information restrictions related to marketing activities
conducted on behalf of Southern Power. In November 2006, Southern Company filed with the FERC a
compliance plan in connection with the order. In April 2007, the FERC approved, with certain
modifications, the plan submitted by Southern Company. Implementation of the plan did not have a
material impact on the Company’s financial statements. In November 2007, Southern Company notified
the FERC that the plan had been implemented. On December 12, 2008, the FERC division of audits
issued for public comment its final audit report pertaining to compliance implementation and
related matters. No comments challenging the audit report’s findings were submitted. A decision
is now pending from the FERC.

Wholesale Rate Filing

On August 29, 2008, Mississippi Power filed with the FERC a request for revised wholesale electric
tariff and rates. Prior to making this filing, Mississippi Power reached a settlement with all of
its customers who take service under the tariff. This settlement agreement was filed with the FERC
as part of the request. The settlement agreement provided for an increase in annual base wholesale
revenues in the amount of $5.8 million, effective January 1, 2009. In addition, the settlement
allows Mississippi Power to increase its annual accrual for the wholesale portion of property
damage to $303,000 per year, to defer any property damage costs prudently incurred in excess of the
wholesale property damage reserve balance, and to defer the wholesale portion of the generation
screening and evaluation costs associated with the integrated coal gasification combined cycle
(IGCC) project to be located in Kemper County Mississippi. The settlement agreement also provided
that Mississippi Power will not seek a change in wholesale full-requirements rates before November
1, 2010, except for changes associated with the fuel adjustment clause and the energy cost
management clause, changes associated with property damages that exceed the amount in the wholesale
property damage reserve, and changes associated with costs and expenses associated with
environmental requirements affecting fossil fuel generating facilities. On October 24, 2008,
Mississippi Power received notice that the FERC had accepted the filing effective November 1, 2008,
and the revised monthly charges were applied beginning January 1, 2009. As result of the order,
the Company reclassified $9.3 million of previously expensed generation screening and evaluation
costs to a regulatory asset. See “Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle” herein for
additional information.

Right of Way Litigation

Southern Company and certain of its subsidiaries, including the Company, Gulf Power, and Southern
Telecom, Inc., (a subsidiary of SouthernLINC Wireless), have been named as defendants in numerous
lawsuits brought by landowners since 2001. The plaintiffs’ lawsuits claim that defendants may not
use, or sublease to third parties, some or all of the fiber optic communications lines on the
rights of way that cross the plaintiffs’ properties and that such actions exceed the easements or
other property rights held by defendants. The plaintiffs assert claims for, among other things,
trespass and unjust enrichment and seek compensatory and punitive damages and injunctive relief.
Management of the Company believes that it has complied with applicable laws and that the
plaintiffs’ claims are without merit.

II-349


NOTES (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2008 Annual Report

To date, the Company has entered into agreements with plaintiffs in approximately 95% of the
actions pending against the Company to clarify the Company’s easement rights in the State of
Mississippi. These agreements have been approved by the Circuit Courts of Harrison County and
Jasper County, Mississippi (First Judicial Circuit), and dismissals of the related cases are in
progress. These agreements have not had any material impact on the Company’s financial statements.

In addition, in late 2001, certain subsidiaries of Southern Company, including Alabama Power,
Georgia Power, Gulf Power, the Company, and Southern Telecom, Inc., (a subsidiary of SouthernLINC
Wireless), were named as defendants in a lawsuit brought in Troup County, Georgia, Superior Court
by Interstate Fiber Network, a subsidiary of telecommunications company ITC DeltaCom, Inc. that
uses certain of the defendants’ rights of way. This lawsuit alleges, among other things, that the
defendants are contractually obligated to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the
telecommunications company from any liability that may be assessed against it in pending and future
right of way litigation. The Company believes that the plaintiff’s claims are without merit. In
the fall of 2004, the trial court stayed the case until resolution of the underlying landowner
litigation discussed above. In January 2005, the Georgia Court of Appeals dismissed the
telecommunications company’s appeal of the trial court’s order for lack of jurisdiction. An
adverse outcome in this matter, combined with an adverse outcome against the telecommunications
company in one or more of the right of way lawsuits, could result in substantial judgments;
however, the final outcome of these matters cannot now be determined.

Retail Regulatory Matters

Performance Evaluation Plan

The Company’s retail base rates are set under Performance Evaluation Plan (PEP), a rate plan
approved by the Mississippi PSC. PEP was designed with the objective that PEP would reduce the
impact of rate changes on the customer and provide incentives for the Company to keep customer
prices low and customer satisfaction and reliability high. PEP is a mechanism for rate adjustments
based on three indicators: price, customer satisfaction, and service reliability.

In May 2004, the Mississippi PSC approved the Company’s request to modify certain portions of its
PEP and to reclassify, to jurisdictional cost of service the 266 megawatts of Plant Daniel Units 3
and 4 capacity, effective January 1, 2004. The Mississippi PSC authorized the Company to include
the related costs and revenue credits in jurisdictional rate base, cost of service, and revenue
requirement calculations for purposes of retail rate recovery. The Company amortized the
regulatory liability pursuant to the Mississippi PSC’s order, over a four-year period, resulting in
increases to earnings in each of those years. The amounts amortized were $5.7 million and $13.0
million in 2007 and 2006, respectively.

In addition, in May 2004, the Mississippi PSC approved the Company’s requested changes to PEP,
including the use of a forward-looking test year, with appropriate oversight; annual, rather than
semi-annual, filings; and certain changes to the performance indicator mechanisms. Rate changes
will be limited to four percent of retail revenues annually under the revised PEP. PEP will remain
in effect until the Mississippi PSC modifies, suspends, or terminates the plan. In the May 2004
order, the Mississippi PSC ordered that the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff and the Company
review the operations of the PEP in 2007. By mutual agreement, this review was deferred until 2008
and is currently ongoing. The outcome of this review is cannot now be determined.

In April 2007, the Mississippi PSC issued an order allowing the Company to defer certain
reliability related maintenance costs beginning January 1, 2007, and recover them evenly over a
four-year period beginning January 1, 2008. These costs related to maintenance that was needed as
follow-up to emergency repairs that were made subsequent to Hurricane Katrina. At December 31,
2007, the Company had incurred and deferred the retail portion of $9.5 million of such costs. At
December 31, 2008, the Company had a balance of the deferred retail portion of $7.1 million with
$2.4 million included in current assets as other regulatory assets and $4.7 million included in
long-term other regulatory assets.

In September 2007, the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff and the Company entered into a
stipulation that included adjustments to expenses which resulted in a one-time credit to retail
customers of approximately $1.1 million. In November 2007, the Mississippi PSC issued an order
requiring the Company to refund this amount to its retail customers no later than December 2007.
This amount was totally refunded as a credit to customer bills by December 31, 2007.

In December 2007, the Company submitted its annual PEP filing for 2008, which resulted in a rate
increase of 1.983% or $15.5 million annually, effective January 2008. In December 2006, the
Company submitted its annual PEP filing for 2007, which resulted in no rate change.

II-350


NOTES (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2008 Annual Report

In December 2007, the Company received an order from the Mississippi PSC requiring it to defer $1.4
million associated with the retail portion of certain tax credits and adjustments related to
permanent differences pertaining to its 2006 income tax returns filed in September 2007. These tax
differences were recorded in a regulatory liability included in the current portion of other
regulatory liabilities and were amortized ratably over the twelve month period beginning January
2008. The amortization of $1.4 million is included in Income Taxes on the Statement of Income.

On March 14, 2008, the Company submitted its annual PEP lookback filing for 2007, which recommended
no surcharge or refund. At the conclusion of the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff’s review of the
PEP lookback filing for 2007, the Company and Mississippi Public Utilities Staff jointly submitted
a stipulation to the Commission which recommended no surcharge or refund.

The Mississippi Public Utilities Staff, pursuant to the Mississippi PSC’s 2004 order approving the
current PEP plan, is reviewing PEP to determine if any modifications should be made to the plan.
Concurrent with this review, the annual PEP evaluation filing for 2009 was delayed by order of the
Mississippi PSC and was scheduled to be filed on or before March 9, 2009. On February 23, 2009,
however, the Company requested that the Mississippi PSC issue an order suspending the 2009 PEP
evaluation filing to continue the scheduled review of the plan. The Company does not anticipate
that suspending the PEP filing for 2009 will have a material impact on 2009 earnings. The Company
anticipates that, as a result of the required review, changes to the plan will be made. Annual
evaluations would resume for 2010 under a revised PEP plan. The final outcome cannot be determined
at this time.

System Restoration Rider

In September 2006, the Company filed with the Mississippi PSC a request to implement a System
Restoration Rider (SRR), to increase the Company’s cap on the property damage reserve and to
authorize the calculation of an annual property damage accrual based on a formula. The purpose of
the SRR is to provide for recovery of costs associated with property damage (including certain
property insurance and the costs of self insurance) and to facilitate the Mississippi PSC’s review
of these costs. The Company would be required to make annual SRR filings to determine the revenue
requirement associated with the property damage. The Company recorded a regulatory liability in
the amount of approximately $2.4 million in 2006 and $0.6 million in 2007 for the estimated amount
due to retail customers that would be passed through SRR. In November 2007, the Company along with
the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff has agreed and stipulated to a revised SRR calculation
method that would no longer require the Mississippi PSC to set a cap on the property damage reserve
or to authorize the calculation of an annual property damage accrual. Under the revised SRR
calculation method, the Mississippi PSC would periodically agree on SRR revenue levels that would
be developed based on historical data, expected exposure, type and amount of insurance coverage
excluding insurance costs, and other relevant information.

On January 9, 2009, the Mississippi PSC issued an order accepting the stipulation and the revised
SRR calculation method.  The applicable SRR rate level will be adjusted every three years, unless a
significant change in circumstances occurs such that the Company and the Staff or the Mississippi
PSC deems that a more frequent change would be appropriate.  The Company will submit annual filings
setting forth SRR-related revenues, expenses and investment for the projected filing period, as
well as the true-up for the prior period. As a result the December 2008 retail regulatory
liability of $6.8 million was reclassified to the Property Damage Reserve.   On February 2, 2009,
the Company submitted its 2009 SRR rate filing with the Mississippi PSC, which proposed that the
2009 SRR rate level remain at zero and the Company be allowed to accrue approximately $4.0 million
to the property damage reserve in 2009. The final outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.

Environmental Compliance Overview Plan

On February 3, 2009, the Company submitted its 2009 ECO Plan Notice which proposes an increase of
19 cents per 1,000 KWH for residential customers. The final outcome of this matter cannot now be
determined. On February 1, 2008, the Company filed with the Mississippi PSC its annual ECO Plan
evaluation for 2008. After the filing of the ECO Plan evaluation on February 1, 2008, the
regulations addressing mercury emissions were altered by a decision issued by the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on February 8, 2008. On April 7, 2008, Mississippi
Power filed with the Mississippi PSC a supplemental ECO Plan evaluation in which the projects
included in the ECO Plan evaluation on February 1, 2008 being undertaken primarily for mercury
control were removed. In this supplemental ECO Plan filing, Mississippi Power requested a 15 cent
per 1,000 KWH decrease for retail residential customers. The Mississippi PSC approved the
supplemental ECO Plan evaluation on June 11, 2008, with the new rates effective in June 2008. In
April 2007, the Mississippi PSC approved the Company’s 2007 ECO Plan, which included an 86 cents
per 1,000 KWH increase for retail residential customers. This increase represented an addition of
approximately $7.5 million in annual revenues for the Company. The new rates were effective in
April 2007.

Mississippi Power Company 2008 Annual Report

Fuel Cost Recovery

The Company establishes, annually, a retail fuel cost recovery factor that is approved by the
Mississippi PSC. Over the past several years, the Company has continued to experience higher than
expected fuel costs for coal and natural gas. The Company is required to file for an adjustment to
the retail fuel cost recovery factor annually; such filing occurred in November 2008. On December
29, 2008, the Mississippi PSC held a hearing on the Company’s proposed increase in its fuel cost
recovery factor. On February 11, 2009, the hearing examiner submitted a formal recommendation to
the Mississippi PSC for approval of the factor as filed, with recovery proposed for the remaining
calendar months of 2009. Any over or under recovery of fuel costs for 2009 would be addressed in
the Company’s 2010 fuel cost recovery filing. The recommendation is under review by the
Mississippi PSC at this time; therefore, the final outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.
The proposed retail fuel cost recovery factor will result in an annual increase in an amount equal
to 12.2% of total 2008 retail revenue. At December 31, 2008, the amount of under recovered retail
fuel costs included in the balance sheet was $36.0 million compared to $24.5 million at December
31, 2007. The Company also has a wholesale Municipal and Rural Associations (MRA) and Market Base
(MB) fuel cost recovery factor. Effective January 1, 2009, the wholesale MRA fuel rate increased
resulting in an annual increase in an amount equal to 13.9% of total 2008 MRA revenue. Effective
February 1, 2009, the wholesale MB fuel rate increased resulting in an annual increase in an amount
equal to 16.7% of total 2008 MB revenue. At December 31, 2008, the amount of under recovered
wholesale MRA and MB fuel costs included in the balance sheets was $15.4 million and $3.7 million
compared to $13.7 million and $2.3 million, respectively, at December 31, 2007. The Company’s
operating revenues are adjusted for differences in actual recoverable fuel cost and amounts billed
in accordance with the currently approved cost recovery rate. Accordingly, this increase to the
billing factor will have no significant effect on the Company’s revenues or net income, but will
increase annual cash flow.

On October 7, 2008, the Mississippi PSC opened a docket to investigate and review interest and
carrying charges under the fuel adjustment clause for utilities within the State of Mississippi
including Mississippi Power. A hearing was held November 6, 2008, to hear testimony regarding the
method of calculating carrying charges on over and under recoveries of fuel-related costs. The
ultimate outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.

Storm Damage Cost Recovery

In August 2005, Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast of the United States and caused significant
damage within the Company’s service area. The estimated total storm restoration costs relating to
Hurricane Katrina through December 31, 2007 of $302.4 million, which was net of expected insurance
proceeds of approximately $77 million, without offset for the property damage reserve of
$3.0 million, was affirmed by the Mississippi PSC in June 2006, and the Company was ordered to
establish a regulatory asset for the retail portion. The Mississippi PSC issued an order directing
the Company to file an application with the MDA for a CDBG. In October 2006, the Company received
from the MDA a CDBG in the amount of $276.4 million, which was allocated to both the retail and
wholesale jurisdictions. In the same month, the Mississippi PSC issued a financing order that
authorized the issuance of system restoration bonds for the remaining $25.2 million of the retail
portion of storm recovery costs not covered by the CDBG. These funds were received in June 2007.
The Company affirmed the $302.4 million total storm costs incurred as of December 31, 2007. The
Company plans to file with the Mississippi PSC its final accounting of the restoration cost
relating to Hurricane Katrina and the storm operations center by the end of the first quarter 2009,
at which time the final net retail receivable of approximately $3.2 million is expected to be
recovered.

Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle

On January 16, 2009, the Company filed for a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity with
the Mississippi PSC to allow construction of a new electric generating plant located in Kemper
County, Mississippi. The plant would utilize an advanced coal IGCC with an output capacity of 582
megawatts. The Kemper IGCC will use locally mined lignite (an abundant, lower heating value coal)
from a proposed mine adjacent to the plant as fuel. This certificate, if approved by the
Mississippi PSC, would authorize the Company to acquire, construct and operate the Kemper IGCC and
related facilities. The Kemper IGCC, subject to federal and state environmental reviews and
certain regulatory approvals, is expected to begin commercial operation in November 2013. As part
of its filing, the Company has requested certain rate recovery treatment in accordance with the
base load construction legislation.

The Company filed an application in June 2006 with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for certain
tax credits available to projects using clean coal technologies under the Energy Policy Act of
2005. The DOE subsequently certified the Kemper IGCC, and in November 2006 the IRS allocated
Internal Revenue Code Section 48A tax credits of $133 million to the Company. The utilization of
these credits is dependent upon meeting the certification requirements for the Kemper IGCC,
including an in-service date no later than November 2013. The Company has secured all
environmental reviews and permits necessary to commence construction of the

II-352


NOTES (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2008 Annual Report

Kemper IGCC and has entered into a binding contract for the steam turbine generator, completing two
milestone requirements for the Section 48A credits.

On February 14, 2008, the Company also requested that the DOE transfer the remaining funds
previously granted to a cancelled Southern Company project that would have been located in Orlando,
Florida. On December 12, 2008, an agreement was reached to assign the remaining funds to the
Kemper IGCC. The estimated construction cost of the Kemper IGCC is approximately $2.2 billion,
which is net of $220 million related to funding to be received from the DOE related to project
construction. The remaining DOE funding of $50 million is projected to be used for demonstration
over the first few years of operation.

Beginning in December 2006, the Mississippi PSC has approved the Company’s requested accounting
treatment to defer the costs associated with the Company’s generation resource planning,
evaluation, and screening activities as a regulatory asset. On December 22, 2008, the Company
requested an amendment to its original order that would allow these costs to continue to be charged
to and remain in a regulatory asset until January 1, 2010. In its application, the Company
reported that it anticipated spending approximately $61 million by or before May 31, 2009. At
December 31, 2008, the Company had spent $42.3 million of the $61 million, of which $3.7 million
related to land purchases capitalized. Of the remaining amount, $0.8 million was expensed and
$37.8 million was deferred in other regulatory assets.

The final outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.

4. JOINT OWNERSHIP AGREEMENTS

The Company and Alabama Power own, as tenants in common, Units 1 and 2, (total capacity of
500 megawatts) at Greene County Steam Plant, which is located in Alabama and operated by Alabama

Mississippi Power Company 2008 Annual Report

At December 31, 2008, the tax-related regulatory assets and liabilities were $8.9 million and
$15.0 million, respectively. These assets are attributable to tax benefits flowed through to
customers in prior years and to taxes applicable to capitalized interest. These liabilities are
attributable to deferred taxes previously recognized at rates higher than the current enacted tax
law and to unamortized investment tax credits.

In accordance with regulatory requirements, deferred investment tax credits are amortized over the
lives of the related property with such amortization normally applied as a credit to reduce
depreciation in the statements of income. Credits amortized in this manner amounted to $1.2
million, $1.1 million, and $1.1 million for 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. At December 31,
2008, all investment tax credits available to reduce federal income taxes payable had been
utilized.

Effective Tax Rate

The provision for income taxes differs from the amount of income taxes determined by applying the

The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 created a tax deduction for a portion of income attributable
to U.S. production activities as defined in the IRC Section 199 (production activities deduction).
The deduction is equal to a stated percentage of qualified production activities net income. The
percentage is phased in over the years 2005 through 2010 with a 3% rate applicable to the years
2005 and 2006, a 6% rate applicable for years 2007 through 2009, and a 9% rate thereafter. This
increase from 3% in 2006 to 6% in 2007 was one of several factors that increased the Company’s 2007
deduction by $0.3 million over the 2006 deduction. The resulting additional tax benefit was over
$0.1 million. The IRS has not clearly defined a methodology for calculating this deduction.
However, Southern Company has agreed with the IRS on a calculation methodology and signed a closing
agreement on December 11, 2008. Therefore, the Company reversed the unrecognized tax benefit and
adjusted the deduction for all previous years to conform to the agreement which resulted in a
decrease in the 2008 deduction when compared to the 2007 deduction. The net impact of the reversal
of the unrecognized tax benefits combined with the application of the new methodology had no
material effect on the Company’s financial statements.

Unrecognized Tax Benefits

FIN 48 requires companies to determine whether it is “more likely than not” that a tax position
will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities before any part of the
benefit can be recorded in the financial statements. It also provides guidance on the recognition,
measurement, and classification of income tax uncertainties, along with any related interest and
penalties. For 2008, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits increased $0.8 million,
resulting in a balance of $1.8 million as of December 31, 2008. Changes during the year in
unrecognized tax benefits were as follows:

The Company classifies interest on tax uncertainties as interest expense. The Company did not
accrue any penalties on uncertain tax positions.

It is reasonably possible that the amount of the unrecognized benefit with respect to a majority of
the Company’s unrecognized tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12
months. The possible conclusion or settlement of federal or state audits could impact the balances
significantly. At this time an estimate of the range of reasonably possible outcomes cannot be
determined.

The IRS has audited and closed all tax returns prior to 2004. The audits for the state returns
have either been concluded, or the statute of limitations has expired, for years prior to 2002.

6. FINANCING

Long-Term Debt Payable to Affiliated Trust

The Company formed a wholly-owned trust subsidiary for the purpose of issuing preferred securities.
At December 31, 2008 there were no outstanding trust preferred securities.

Bank Term Loans

In 2008, the Company borrowed $80 million under a three-year term loan agreement. The proceeds
were used for general corporate purposes.

Senior Notes

The Company issued $50 million of Series 2008A 6.00% Senior Notes due November 15, 2013 during the
fourth quarter of 2008. Proceeds were used to repay a portion of its short-term indebtedness and
for general corporate purposes, including the Company’s continuous construction program. At
December 31, 2008 and 2007, Mississippi Power had a total of $245 million and $195 million of
senior notes outstanding, respectively.

Securities Due Within One Year

At December 31, 2008, the Company has scheduled maturities of capital leases and senior notes due
within one year totaling $1.2 million and $40.0 million respectively. There were $1.1 million of
capital leases due within one year at December 31, 2007.

II-356


NOTES (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2008 Annual Report

Debt maturities through 2013 applicable to total long-term debt are as follows: $41.2 million in
2009; $1.3 million in 2010; $81.4 million in 2011; $0.6 million in 2012, and $50 million in 2013.

Pollution Control Revenue Bonds

Pollution control obligations represent loans to the Company from public authorities of funds
derived from sales by such authorities of revenue bonds issued to finance pollution control
facilities. The Company is required to make payments sufficient for authorities to meet principal
and interest requirements of such bonds. The amount of tax-exempt pollution control revenue bonds
outstanding at December 31, 2008, was $82.7 million. In September 2008, the Company was required
to purchase a total of approximately $7.9 million of variable rate pollution control revenue bonds
that were tendered by investors. In December 2008, the bonds were successfully remarketed. On the
statement of cash flow for 2008, the $7.9 million is presented as proceeds and redemptions.

Outstanding Classes of Capital Stock

The Company currently has preferred stock, depositary preferred stock (each share of depositary
preferred stock representing one-fourth of a share of preferred stock), and common stock authorized
and outstanding. The Company’s preferred stock and depositary preferred stock, without preference
between classes, rank senior to the Company’s common stock with respect to payment of dividends and
voluntary or involuntary dissolution. Certain series of the preferred stock and depositary
preferred stock are subject to redemption at the option of the Company on or after a specified date
(typically 5 or 10 years after the date of issuance) at a redemption price equal to 100% of the
liquidation amount of the stock.

Dividend Restrictions

The Company can only pay dividends to Southern Company out of retained earnings or paid-in-capital.

Bank Credit Arrangements

At the beginning of 2009, the Company had total unused committed credit agreements with banks of
$98.5 million, all of which expire in 2009. Approximately $44 million of the facilities contain
2-year term loan options and $15 million contain 1-year term loan options. The Company expects to
renew its credit facilities, as needed, prior to expiration.

Subsequent to December 31, 2008, the Company increased an existing credit agreement by $10 million.
The facility matures in the third quarter of 2009 and allows for the execution of a two year term
loan.

In connection with these credit arrangements, the Company agrees to pay commitment fees based on
the unused portions of the commitments or to maintain compensating balances with the banks.
Commitment fees average less than 1/8 of 1% for the Company. Compensating balances are not legally
restricted from withdrawal.

This $98.5 million in unused credit arrangements provides required liquidity support to the
Company’s borrowings through a commercial paper program. At December 31, 2008, the Company had
$26.3 million outstanding in commercial paper. The credit arrangements also provide support to the
Company’s variable rate tax-exempt pollution control bonds totaling $40.1 million.

During 2008, the peak amount outstanding for short-term debt was $86.6 million and the average
amount outstanding was $28.1 million. The average annual interest rate on short-term debt was 2.6%
for 2008 and 5.3% for 2007.

Financial Instruments

The Company enters into energy-related derivatives to hedge exposures to electricity, gas, and
other fuel price changes. However, due to cost-based rate regulations, the Company has limited
exposure to market volatility in commodity fuel prices and prices of electricity. The Company
manages retail fuel-hedging programs implemented per the guidelines of the Mississippi PSC and
wholesale fuel-hedging programs under agreements with wholesale customers. The Company also enters
into hedges of forward electricity sales.

Energy-related derivative contracts which are designated as regulatory hedges relate primarily to
the Company’s fuel hedging programs, where gains and losses are initially recorded as regulatory
liabilities and assets, respectively, and then are included in fuel expense as they are recovered
through the energy cost management clause. Gains and losses on energy-related derivatives
designated as cash flow hedges are used to hedge anticipated purchases and sales and are initially
deferred in other comprehensive income before being recognized in income in the same period as the
hedged transaction. Gains and losses on energy-related derivative contracts that are not
designated or fail to qualify as hedges are recognized in the statements of income as incurred.
The pre-tax gains (losses) reclassified from other comprehensive income to revenue and fuel expense
were not material for any period presented and are not expected to be material for 2009.
Additionally, there was no material ineffectiveness recorded in earnings for any period presented.
The Company has energy-related hedges in place up to and including 2012.

All derivative financial instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are
measured at fair value. See Note 9 for additional information.

7. COMMITMENTS

Construction Program

The Company is engaged in continuous construction programs, currently estimated to total
$163 million in 2009, $467 million in 2010, and $1.0 billion in 2011. The construction program is
subject to periodic review and revision, and actual construction costs may vary from these
estimates because of numerous factors. These factors include: changes in business conditions;
revised load growth estimates; storm impacts; changes in environmental statutes and regulations;
changes in FERC rules and regulations; Mississippi PSC approvals; the cost and efficiency of
construction labor, equipment, and materials; and the cost of capital. In addition, there can be
no assurance that costs related to capital expenditures will be fully recovered. At December 31,
2008, significant purchase commitments were outstanding in connection with the construction
program. Capital improvements to generating, transmission, and distribution facilities, including
those to meet environmental standards, will continue.

Long-Term Service Agreements

The Company has entered into a Long-Term Service Agreement (LTSA) with General Electric (GE) for
the purpose of securing maintenance support for the leased combined cycle units at Plant Daniel.
The LTSA provides that GE will cover all planned inspections on the covered equipment, which
generally includes the cost of all labor and materials. GE is also obligated to cover the costs of
unplanned maintenance on the covered equipment subject to limits and scope specified in the
contract.

In general, the LTSA is in effect through two major inspection cycles of the units. Scheduled
payments to GE under the LTSA, which are subject to price escalation, are made monthly based on
estimated operating hours of the units and are recognized as expense based on actual hours of
operation. The Company has recognized $9.4 million, $9.7 million, and $8.4 million for 2008, 2007,
and 2006, respectively, which is included in maintenance expense in the statements of income.
Remaining payments to GE under this agreement are currently estimated to total $137 million over
the next 13 years. However, the LTSA contains various cancellation provisions at the option of the
Company.

The Company also has entered into a LTSA with Alstom Power, Inc. for the purpose of securing
maintenance support for its Chevron Unit 5 combustion turbine plant. In summary, the LTSA
stipulates that Alstom Power, Inc. will perform all planned maintenance on the covered equipment,
which includes the cost of all labor and materials. Alstom Power, Inc is also obligated to cover
the costs of unplanned maintenance on the covered equipment subject to a limit specified in the
contract.

II-358


NOTES (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2008 Annual Report

In general, this LTSA is in effect through two major inspection cycles. Scheduled payments to
Alstom Power, Inc., which are subject to price escalation, are made at various intervals based on
actual operating hours of the unit. Payments to Alstom Power, Inc. under this agreement are
currently estimated to total $24.1 million over the remaining term of the agreement, which is
approximately 9 years. However, the LTSA contains various cancellation provisions at the option of
the Company. Payments made to Alstom Power, Inc. under the LTSA prior to the performance of any
planned maintenance are recorded as a prepayment in the balance sheets. Inspection costs are
capitalized or charged to expense based on the nature of the work performed. After this contract
expires, the Company expects to replace it with a new contract with similar terms.

Fuel Commitments

To supply a portion of the fuel requirements of the generating plants, the Company has entered into
various long-term commitments for the procurement of fossil fuel. In most cases, these contracts
contain provisions for price escalations, minimum purchase levels, and other financial commitments.
Coal commitments include forward contract purchases for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emission
allowances. Natural gas purchase commitments contain fixed volumes with prices based on various
indices at the time of delivery; amounts included in the chart below represent estimates based on
New York Mercantile Exchange future prices at December 31, 2008.

Total estimated minimum long-term obligations at December 31, 2008, were as follows:

SCS may enter into various types of wholesale energy and natural gas contracts acting as an agent
for the Company and the other traditional operating companies and Southern Power. Under these
agreements, each of the traditional operating companies and Southern Power may be jointly and
severally liable. The creditworthiness of Southern Power is currently inferior to the
creditworthiness of the traditional operating companies. Accordingly, Southern Company has entered
into keep-well agreements with the Company and each of the other traditional operating companies to
ensure the Company will not subsidize or be responsible for any costs, losses, liabilities, or
damages resulting from the inclusion of Southern Power as a contracting party under these
agreements.

Operating Leases

Railcar Leases

The Company and Gulf Power have jointly entered into operating lease agreements for the use of 745
aluminum railcars. The Company has the option to purchase the railcars at the greater of lease
termination value or fair market value, or to renew the leases at the end of the lease term. The
Company also has multiple operating lease agreements for the use of additional railcars that do not
contain a purchase option. All of these leases are for the transport of coal to Plant Daniel.

The Company’s share (50%) of the leases, charged to fuel stock and recovered through the fuel cost
recovery clause, was $4.0 million in 2008, $4.4 million in 2007, and $4.6 million in 2006. The
Company’s annual railcar lease payments for 2009 through 2013 will average approximately
$2.2 million and after 2013, lease payments total in aggregate approximately $2.2 million.

In addition to railcar leases, the Company has other operating leases for fuel handling equipment
at Plants Daniel and Watson and operating leases for barges and tow/shift boats for the transport
of coal at Plant Watson. The Company’s share (50% at Plant Daniel and 100% at Plant Watson) of the
leases for fuel handling was charged to fuel handling expense in the amount of $0.6 million in 2008
and $0.9 million in 2007. The Company’s annual lease payments for 2009 through 2011 will average
approximately $0.3 million.

II-359


NOTES (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2008 Annual Report

The Company charged to fuel stock and recovered through fuel cost recovery the barge transportation
leases in the amount of $9.8 million in 2008 and $6.2 million in 2007 related to barges and
tow/shift boats. The Company’s annual lease payments for 2009, with regards to these barge
transportation leases, will be approximately $7.6 million.

Plant Daniel Combined Cycle Generating Units

In May 2001, the Company began the initial 10-year term of the lease agreement for a 1,064 megawatt
natural gas combined cycle generating facility built at Plant Daniel (Facility). The lease
arrangement provided a lower cost alternative to its cost based rate regulated customers than a
traditional rate base asset. See Note 3 under “Retail Regulatory Matters – Performance Evaluation
Plan” for a description of the Company’s formulary rate plan.

In 2003, the Facility was acquired by Juniper Capital L.P. (Juniper), whose partners are
unaffiliated with the Company. Simultaneously, Juniper entered into a restructured lease agreement
with the Company. Juniper has also entered into leases with other parties unrelated to the
Company. The assets leased by the Company comprise less than 50% of Juniper’s assets. The Company
is not required to consolidate the leased assets and related liabilities, and the lease with
Juniper is considered an operating lease. The lease agreement is treated as an operating lease for
accounting purposes, as well as for both retail and wholesale rate recovery purposes. For income
tax purposes, the Company retains tax ownership. The initial lease term ends in 2011 and the lease
includes a purchase and renewal option based on the cost of the Facility at the inception of the
lease, which was $370 million. The Company is required to amortize approximately 4% of the initial
acquisition cost over the initial lease term. Eighteen months prior to the end of the initial
lease, the Company may elect to renew for 10 years. If the lease is renewed, the agreement calls
for the Company to amortize an additional 17% of the initial completion cost over the renewal
period. Upon termination of the lease, at the Company’s option, it may either exercise its
purchase option or the Facility can be sold to a third party.

The lease provides for a residual value guarantee, approximately 73% of the acquisition cost, by
the Company that is due upon termination of the lease in the event that the Company does not renew
the lease or purchase the Facility and that the fair market value is less than the unamortized cost
of the Facility. A liability of approximately $5 million, $7 million, and $9 million for the fair
market value of this residual value guarantee is included in the balance sheets at December 31,
2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. Lease expenses were $26 million, $27 million, and $27 million
in 2008, 2007, and 2006 respectively.

The Company estimates that its annual amount of future minimum operating lease payments under this
arrangement, exclusive of any payment related to the residual value guarantee, as of December 31,
2008, are as follows:

8. STOCK OPTION PLAN

Southern Company provides non-qualified stock options to a large segment of the Company’s employees
ranging from line management to executives. As of December 31, 2008, there were 273 current and
former employees of the Company participating in the stock option plan and there were 33.2 million
shares of common stock remaining available for awards under this plan. The prices of options
granted to date have been at the fair market value of the shares on the dates of grant. Options
granted to date become exercisable pro rata over a maximum period of three years from the date of
grant. The Company generally recognizes stock option expense on a straight-line basis over the
vesting period which equates to the requisite service period; however for employees who are
eligible for retirement the total cost is expensed at the grant date. Options outstanding will
expire no later than 10 years after the date of grant, unless terminated earlier by the Southern
Company Board of Directors in accordance with the stock option plan. For certain stock option
awards, a change in control will provide accelerated vesting.

II-360


NOTES (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2008 Annual Report

The estimated fair values of stock options granted in 2008, 2007, and 2006 were derived using the
Black-Scholes stock option pricing model. Expected volatility was based on historical volatility
of Southern Company’s stock over a period equal to the expected term. The Company used historical
exercise data to estimate the expected term that represents the period of time that options granted
to employees are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rate was based on the U.S. Treasury
yield curve in effect at the time of grant that covers the expected term of the stock options. The
following table shows the assumptions used in the pricing model and the weighted average grant-date
fair value of stock options granted:

The number of stock options vested and expected to vest in the future, as of December 31, 2008, was
not significantly different from the number of stock options outstanding at December 31, 2008 as
stated above. As of December 31, 2008, the weighted average remaining contractual terms for the
options outstanding and options exercisable was 6.2 years and 5.1 years, respectively, and the
aggregate intrinsic values for the options outstanding and options exercisable was $7.6 million and
$6.9 million, respectively.

As of December 31, 2008, there was $0.2 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to
stock option awards not yet vested. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average
period of approximately 8 months.

For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, total compensation cost for stock option
awards recognized in income was $0.7 million, $1.0 million and $1.1 million, respectively, with the
related tax benefit also recognized in income of $0.3 million, $0.4 million and $0.4 million,
respectively.

The compensation cost and tax benefits related to the grant and exercise of Southern Company stock
options to the Company’s employees are recognized in the Company’s financial statements with a
corresponding credit to equity, representing a capital contribution from Southern Company.

The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and
2006, was $3.7 million, $2.2 million, and $2.4 million, respectively. The actual tax benefit
realized by the Company for the tax deductions from stock option exercises totaled $1.4 million,
$0.9 million, and $0.9 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and
2006.

9. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

On January 1, 2008, the Company adopted FASB Statement No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (SFAS
No. 157) which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and
requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements. The criterion that is set forth
in SFAS No. 157 is applicable to fair value measurement where it is permitted or required under
other accounting pronouncements.

SFAS No. 157 defines fair value as the exit price, which is the price that would be received to
sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on inputs of
observable and unobservable market data that a market participant would use in pricing the asset
or liability. The use of

II-361


NOTES (continued)

Mississippi Power Company 2008 Annual Report

observable inputs is maximized where available and the use of unobservable inputs is minimized
for fair value measurement. As a means to illustrate the inputs used, SFAS No. 157 establishes
a three-tier fair value hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used for fair
value measurement.

•

Level 1 consists of observable market data in an active market for identical assets or
liabilities.

•

Level 2 consists of observable market data, other than that included in Level 1, that is
either directly or indirectly observable.

•

Level 3 consists of unobservable market data. The input may reflect the assumptions of
the Company of what a market participant would use in pricing an asset or liability. If
there is little available market data, then the Company’s own assumptions are the best
available information.

In the case of multiple inputs being used in a fair value measurement, the lowest level input
that is significant to the fair value measurement represents the level in the fair value
hierarchy in which the fair value measurement is reported.

The adoption of SFAS No. 157 has not resulted in any significant changes to the methodologies
used for fair value measurement. Primarily all the changes in the fair value of assets and
liabilities are recorded in other comprehensive income or regulatory assets and liabilities, and
thus the impact on earnings is limited to derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting.

The fair value measurements performed on a recurring basis and the level of the fair value
hierarchy in which they fall at December 31, 2008 are as follows:

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

The management of Southern Power Company (the “Company”) is responsible for establishing and
maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting as required by the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). A control system can
provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.

Under management’s supervision, an evaluation of the design and effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting was conducted based on the framework in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2008.

This Annual Report does not include an attestation report of the Company’s independent registered
public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management’s report
was not subject to attestation by the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm
pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to
provide only management’s report in this Annual Report.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Southern Power Company

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Southern Power Company and
Subsidiary Companies (the “Company”) (a wholly owned subsidiary of Southern Company) as of December
31, 2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, common
stockholder’s equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2008. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The
Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control
over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial
reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but
not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements (pages II-387 to II-405) present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies at
December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

OVERVIEW

Business Activities

Southern Power Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (the Company) construct, acquire, own, and
manage generation assets and sell electricity at market-based prices in the wholesale market. The
Company continues to execute its strategy through a combination of acquiring and constructing new
power plants and by entering into power purchase agreements (PPAs) with investor owned utilities,
independent power producers, municipalities, and electric cooperatives.

In June 2008, the Company completed construction of Plant Franklin Unit 3, a combined cycle unit
located in Smiths, Alabama with a nameplate capacity of 659 megawatts (MW). The Company has a PPA
covering the entire output of this unit from January 2009 through December 2015.

In December 2008, the Company announced that it will build an electric generating plant in
Cleveland County, North Carolina. This plant will consist of four combustion turbine natural gas
generating units with a total expected generating capacity of 720 MW. The units are expected to go
into commercial operation in 2012. The Company also entered into long-term PPAs for 540 MW of the
generating capacity of the plant.

As of December 31, 2008, the Company had units totaling 7,555 MW nameplate capacity in commercial
operation. The weighted average duration of the Company’s wholesale contracts exceeds 13.3 years,
which reduces remarketing risk. The Company’s future earnings will depend on the parameters of the
wholesale market, federal regulation, and the efficient operation of its wholesale generating
assets. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL — “FERC Matters” herein for additional information.

Key Performance Indicators

To evaluate operating results and to ensure the Company’s ability to meet its contractual
commitments to customers, the Company focuses on several key performance indicators. These
indicators include plant availability, peak season equivalent forced outage rate (EFOR), and net
income. Plant availability measures the percentage of time during the year that the Company’s
generating units are available to be called upon to generate (the higher the better), whereas the
EFOR more narrowly defines the hours during peak demand times when the Company’s generating units
are not available due to forced outages (the lower the better). Net income is the primary
component of the Company’s contribution to Southern Company’s earnings per share goal. The
Company’s actual performance in 2008 met or surpassed targets in these key performance areas. See
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS herein for additional information on the Company’s financial performance.

Earnings

The Company’s 2008 earnings were $144.4 million, a $12.7 million increase over 2007. This increase
was primarily the result of increased capacity sales to requirements service customers, market
sales of uncontracted generating capacity, a gain on the sale of an undeveloped tract of land in
2008, a loss on the gasifier portion of the Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC)
project in 2007, and the receipt of a fee for participating in an asset auction in 2008. The
Company was not the successful bidder in the asset auction. These increases were partially offset
by transmission service expenses and tariff penalties incurred in 2008, timing of plant maintenance
activities, increased general and administrative expenses associated with the implementation of the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) separation order, and increased depreciation associated
with Plant Oleander Unit 5 and Plant Franklin Unit 3 being placed into commercial operation in
December 2007 and June 2008, respectively.

The Company’s 2007 earnings were $131.6 million, a $7.2 million increase over 2006. This increase
was primarily the result of increased energy sales due to more favorable weather in 2007. Also
contributing to the increase were additional sales from the acquisition of Plant Rowan in September
2006. These increases were partially offset by the $10.7 million after tax loss as a result of the
termination of the construction of the gasifier portion of the IGCC project.

The Company’s 2006 earnings were $124.4 million, a $9.7 million increase over 2005. This increase
was primarily the result of new PPAs started or acquired in the period, including contracts with
Piedmont Municipal Power Authority (PMPA) and EnergyUnited Electric Membership Corporation
(EnergyUnited) and the PPAs related to the acquisition of Plants DeSoto and Rowan in June 2006 and
September 2006, respectively. Short-term energy sales and increased sales from existing resources
also contributed to this increase.

Operating Revenues

Operating revenues in 2008 were $1.31 billion, a $341.5 million (35.1%) increase from 2007. This
increase was primarily due to increased short-term energy revenues from uncontracted generating
units, increased energy revenues due to higher natural gas prices, and increased revenues from a
full year of operations at Plant Oleander Unit 5. These increases were partially offset by
decreased demand under existing PPAs due to less favorable weather in 2008 compared to 2007. The
increase in fuel revenues was accompanied by an increase in related fuel costs and did not have a
significant impact on net income.

Operating revenues in 2007 were $972 million, a $195.0 million (25.1%) increase from 2006. This
increase was primarily due to increased short-term energy sales, a full year of operations at Plant
Rowan acquired in September 2006, new sales with EnergyUnited, increased demand under existing PPAs
with affiliates as a result of favorable weather within the Southern Company service territory, and
higher fuel revenues due to an increase in natural gas prices in 2007. The increase in fuel
revenues was accompanied by an increase in related fuel costs and did not have a significant impact
on net income.

Operating revenues in 2006 were $777.0 million, a $4.0 million (0.5%) decrease from 2005. This
decrease was primarily due to reduced energy revenues as a result of lower natural gas prices.
This reduction was accompanied by a reduction in related fuel costs and did not have a significant
net income impact. Offsetting this energy-related reduction were increased sales from a full year
of operations at Plant Oleander and new sales under PPAs with PMPA and EnergyUnited and those PPAs
acquired in the DeSoto and Rowan acquisitions. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL — “Power Sales
Agreements” herein and Note 2 to the financial statements under “DeSoto and Rowan Acquisitions” for
additional information.

Capacity revenues are an integral component of the Company’s PPAs with both affiliate and
non-affiliate customers and represent the greatest contribution to net income. Energy under PPAs
is generally sold at variable cost or is indexed to published gas indices. Energy revenues also
include fees for support services, fuel storage, and unit start charges. Details of these PPA
capacity and energy revenues are as follows:

Wholesale revenues that were not covered by PPAs totaled $349.2 million in 2008, which included
$95.5 million of revenues from affiliated companies. These wholesale sales were made in accordance
with the Intercompany Interchange Contract (IIC), as approved by the FERC. These non-PPA wholesale
revenues will vary from year to year depending on demand and the availability and cost of
generating resources at each company that participates in the centralized operation and dispatch of
the Southern Company fleet of generating plants (Southern Pool).

Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses

Fuel costs constitute the single largest expense for the Company. Additionally, the Company
purchases a portion of its electricity needs from the wholesale market.

In 2008, fuel expense increased by $186.1 million (78.0%) compared to 2007. This increase was
driven by a 58.9% increase in generation primarily due to operations at Plant Franklin Unit 3 and a
11.9% increase in the average cost of natural gas.

In 2007, fuel expense increased by $93.4 million (64.3%) compared to 2006. This increase was
driven by a 43.7% increase in generation at Plants Wansley and Dahlberg and a 5.2% increase in the
average cost of natural gas.

In 2006, fuel expense decreased by $63.8 million (30.5%) compared to 2005. This decrease was
driven by a 25.4% reduction in the average cost of natural gas. Gas prices in 2006 were lower and
had less weather-driven volatility than the previous year. The fuel price decrease was partially
offset by volume increases primarily from increased generation at Plants Wansley and Dahlberg.

Demand for natural gas in the United States increased in 2007 and the first half of 2008. However,
natural gas supplies have increased in the last half of 2008 as a result of increased production
and higher storage levels due to weak industrial demand. Natural gas prices moderated in the
second half of 2008 as the result of a recessionary economy. The Company’s PPAs generally provide
that the purchasers are responsible for substantially all of the cost of fuel. Consequently, any
increase or decrease in fuel costs is accompanied by an increase or decrease in related fuel
revenues and does not have a significant impact on net income.

Purchased power expense increased $128.1 million (64.1%) in 2008 when compared to 2007, primarily
due to a 107.9% increase in the average cost of purchased power. Purchased power volume in 2008
decreased 21.0% compared to 2007. Purchased power expense increased $29.3 million (17.1%) in 2007
when compared to 2006, primarily due to increased purchases of lower cost energy resources from the
Southern Pool and non-affiliates and contracts with Georgia Electric Membership Corporation and
Dalton Utilities. Purchased power expense increased $10.7 million (6.6%) in 2006 when compared to
2005, due to purchases from the Southern Pool and contracts with PMPA and Dalton Utilities.

II-370


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

Purchased power expenses will vary depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating
resources available throughout the Southern Company system and other contract resources. Load
requirements are submitted to the Southern Pool on an hourly basis and are fulfilled with the
lowest cost alternative, whether that is generation owned by the Company, affiliate-owned
generation, or external purchases.

Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses

In 2008, other operations and maintenance expenses increased $12.7 million (9.4%) compared to 2007.
This increase was due primarily to the timing of plant maintenance activities and additional
administrative and general expenses as a result of costs incurred to implement the FERC compliance
plan. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL — “FERC Matters — Intercompany Interchange Contract” herein
and Note 3 to the financial statements under “FERC Matters — Intercompany Interchange Contract”
for additional information.

In 2007, other operations and maintenance expenses increased $39.7 million (41.7%) compared to
2006. This increase was due primarily to a full year of operations at Plant DeSoto and Plant Rowan
acquired in June 2006 and September 2006, respectively, and additional administrative and general
expenses as a result of costs incurred to implement the FERC compliance plan. See FUTURE EARNINGS
POTENTIAL — “FERC Matters — Intercompany Interchange Contract” herein, Note 2 to the financial
statements under “DeSoto and Rowan Acquisitions,” and Note 3 to the financial statements under
“FERC Matters — Intercompany Interchange Contract” for additional information.

In 2006, other operations and maintenance expenses increased $14.5 million (17.9%) compared to
2005. This increase was primarily the result of the operation of new generating units from
acquisitions of Plant Oleander in June 2005, Plant DeSoto in June 2006, and Plant Rowan in
September 2006. See Note 2 to the financial statements under “DeSoto and Rowan Acquisitions” and
“Oleander Acquisition” for additional information.

Loss on IGCC Project

In November 2007, the Company and the Orlando Utilities Commission (OUC) mutually agreed to
terminate the construction of the gasifier portion of the IGCC project. The Company has continued
construction of the gas-fired combined cycle generating facility, owned by OUC. The Company
recorded a loss in the fourth quarter 2007 of approximately $17.6 million related to the
cancellation of the gasifier portion of the IGCC project. This loss consists of the write-off of
construction costs of $14.0 million and an accrual for termination payments of $3.6 million. All
termination payments were completed in 2008. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL — “Construction
Projects — IGCC” herein and Note 4 to the financial statements under “Integrated Coal Gasification
Combined Cycle (IGCC)” for additional information.

In January 2008, the Company recorded a gain of $6.0 million on the sale of an undeveloped tract of
land.

Depreciation and Amortization

In 2008, depreciation and amortization increased $14.5 million (19.7%) compared to 2007. This
increase was primarily due to the completion of Plant Oleander Unit 5 in December 2007 and Plant
Franklin Unit 3 in June 2008 and higher depreciation rates implemented in January 2008. See FUTURE
EARNINGS POTENTIAL — “Other Matters” herein for additional information regarding the Company’s
ongoing review of depreciation estimates.

Depreciation and amortization increased $8.0 million (12.2%) and $11.7 million (21.6%) in 2007 and
2006, respectively. These increases were primarily the result of additional depreciation related
to Plants DeSoto and Rowan acquired in June 2006 and September 2006, respectively, Plant Oleander
acquired in June 2005, and higher depreciation rates from a depreciation study adopted in March
2006. See Note 1 to the financial statements under “Depreciation” and Note 2 to the financial
statements under “DeSoto and Rowan Acquisitions” and “Oleander Acquisition” for additional
information.

Taxes Other Than Income Taxes

In 2008, taxes other than income taxes increased $2.0 million (12.4%) compared to 2007. This
increase was primarily due to property taxes related to the completion of Plant Oleander Unit 5 and
Plant Franklin Unit 3 in December 2007 and June 2008, respectively.

II-371


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

The 2007 increase in taxes other than income taxes was not material.

In 2006, taxes other than income taxes increased $2.3 million (17.4%) compared to 2005. This
increase was primarily due to incremental ad valorem taxes on new assets: Plants DeSoto and Rowan
acquired in June 2006 and September 2006, respectively, and Plant Oleander acquired in June 2005.
See Note 2 to the financial statements under “DeSoto and Rowan Acquisitions” and “Oleander
Acquisition” for additional information.

Other Income (Expense), Net

Other income (expense), net increased $4.3 million (131.1%) in 2008. This increase was primarily
due to a $6.4 million fee received in 2008 for participating in an asset auction. The Company was
not the successful bidder in the asset auction.

Changes in other income, net in 2007 and 2006 were primarily the result of unrealized gains and
losses on derivative energy contracts. See FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY — “Market Price
Risk” herein and Notes 1 and 6 to the financial statements under “Financial Instruments” for
additional information.

Interest Expense, Net of Amounts Capitalized

In 2008, interest expense increased $4.0 million (5.1%) compared to 2007. This increase was
primarily the result of a decrease in capitalized interest as a result of the completion of Plant
Oleander Unit 5 in December 2007 and Plant Franklin Unit 3 in June 2008, partially offset by a
decrease in short-term borrowing levels in 2008.

In 2007, interest expense decreased $1.0 million (1.2%) compared to 2006. This decrease was
primarily due to additional capitalized interest of $10.9 million on active construction projects
and reduced interest on commercial paper of $2.0 million due to lower borrowing levels. This
decrease was partially offset by $11.9 million increase in interest on $200 million of senior notes
that were issued in November 2006.

In 2006, interest expense increased $0.8 million (1.0%) compared to 2005. This increase was
primarily the result of additional debt incurred for acquisitions. This increase was offset by
$5.6 million of interest capitalized on active construction projects. For additional information,
see FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL — “Construction Projects” herein, Note 4 to the financial statements
under “Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC),” and Note 7 to the financial statements
under “Expansion Program.”

Income Taxes

Income taxes increased $9.3 million (11.2%) in 2008, $1.7 million (2.1%) in 2007, and $9.9 million
(13.9%) in 2006 primarily due to higher pre-tax earnings from 2006 through 2008 and changes in the
production activities deduction.

Effects of Inflation

When inflation exceeds projections used in market, term, and cost evaluations performed at contract
initiation, the effects of inflation can create an economic loss. In addition, the income tax laws
are based on historical costs. Therefore inflation creates an economic loss as the Company is
recovering its costs of investments in dollars that could have less purchasing power. While the
inflation rate has been relatively low in recent years, it continues to have an adverse effect on
the Company due to large investment in utility plant with long economic lives. Conventional
accounting for historical costs does not recognize this economic loss or the partially offsetting
gain that arises through financing facilities with fixed money obligations such as long-term debt.

FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL

General

The results of operations for the past three years are not necessarily indicative of future
earnings potential. The level of the Company’s future earnings depends on numerous factors that
affect the opportunities, challenges, and risks of the Company’s competitive wholesale business.
These factors include the Company’s ability to achieve sales growth while containing costs. Another
major factor is federal regulatory policy, which may impact the Company’s level of participation in
the market. The level of future earnings also depends on numerous factors including regulatory
matters (such as those related to affiliate contracts), creditworthiness

II-372


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

of customers, total generating capacity available in the Southeast, the successful remarketing of
capacity as current contracts expire, and the Company’s ability to execute its acquisition
strategy. Recent recessionary conditions may negatively impact capacity revenues. The timing and
extent of the economic recovery will impact future earnings.

The Company’s system generating capacity increased 659 MW due to the completion of Franklin Unit 3
in June 2008. In general, the Company has constructed or acquired new generating capacity only
after entering into long-term capacity contracts for the new facilities which are optimized by
limited energy trading activities. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL — “Construction Projects” herein
for additional information.

Power Sales Agreements

The Company’s sales are primarily through long-term PPAs. The Company is working to maintain
and expand its share of the wholesale markets. Recent oversupply of generating capacity in
the market is being reduced and the Company expects that many areas of the market will need
capacity beyond 2014.

The Company’s PPAs consist of two types of agreements. The first type, referred to as a unit
or block sale, is a customer purchase from a dedicated plant unit where all or a portion of
the generation from that unit is reserved for that customer. The Company typically has the
ability to serve the unit or block sale customer from an alternate resource. The second type,
referred to as requirements service, provides that the Company serve the customer’s capacity
and energy requirements from a combination of the customer’s own generating units and from
Company resources not dedicated to serve unit or block sales. The Company has rights to
purchase power provided by the requirements customers’ resources when economically viable.

The Company has entered into the following PPAs over the past 3 years:

The Company has PPAs with some of Southern Company’s traditional operating companies and with
other investor owned utilities, independent power producers, municipalities, and electric
cooperatives. Although some of the Company’s PPAs are with the traditional operating
companies, the Company’s generating facilities are not in the traditional operating
companies’ regulated rate bases, and the Company is not able to seek recovery from the
traditional operating companies’ ratepayers for construction, repair, environmental, or
maintenance costs. The Company expects that the capacity payments in the PPAs will produce
sufficient cash flow to cover costs, pay debt service, and provide an equity return.
However, the Company’s overall profit will depend on numerous factors, including efficient
operation of its generating facilities.

As a general matter, existing PPAs provide that the purchasers are responsible for either
procuring the fuel or reimbursing the Company for the cost of fuel relating to the energy
delivered under such PPAs. To the extent a particular generating facility does not meet the
operational requirements contemplated in the PPAs, the Company may be responsible for excess
fuel costs. With respect to fuel transportation risk, most of the Company’s PPAs provide
that the counterparties are responsible for transporting the fuel to the particular
generating facility.

Fixed and variable operation and maintenance costs will be recovered through capacity charges
based on dollars-per-kilowatt year or energy charges based on dollars-per-MW hour. In
general, the Company has long-term service contracts with General Electric and Siemens AG to
reduce its exposure to certain operation and maintenance costs relating to such vendors’
applicable equipment. See Note 7 to the financial statements under “Long-Term Service
Agreements” for additional information.

Many of the Company’s PPAs have provisions that require the posting of collateral or an
acceptable substitute guarantee in the event that Standard & Poor’s or Moody’s downgrades the
credit ratings of the counterparty to an unacceptable credit rating or the counterparty is
not rated or fails to maintain a minimum coverage ratio. The PPAs are expected to provide
the Company with a stable source of revenue during their respective terms.

The Company has entered into long-term power sales agreements for an average of 83% of its
available capacity for the next 10 years as follows:

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

Environmental Matters

The Company’s operations are subject to extensive regulation by state and federal environmental
agencies under a variety of statutes and regulations governing environmental media, including air,
water, and land resources. Applicable statutes include the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act; the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act; the Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act; the Toxic Substances Control Act; the Emergency Planning & Community
Right-to-Know Act; the Endangered Species Act; and related federal and state regulations.
Compliance with possible additional federal or state legislation or regulations related to global
climate change, air quality, or other environmental and health concerns can also significantly
affect the Company.

New environmental legislation or regulations, such as requirements related to greenhouse gases, or
changes to existing statutes or regulations, could affect many areas of the Company’s operations.
While the Company’s PPAs generally contain provisions that permit charging the counterparty with
some of the new costs incurred as a result of changes in environmental laws and regulations, the
full impact of any such regulatory or legislative changes cannot be determined at this time.

Because the Company’s units are newer gas-fired generating facilities, costs associated with
environmental compliance for these facilities have been less significant than for similarly
situated coal-fired generating facilities or older gas-fired generating facilities. Environmental,
natural resource, and land use concerns, including the applicability of air quality limitations,
the availability of water withdrawal rights, uncertainties regarding aesthetic impacts such as
increased light or noise, and concerns about potential adverse health impacts, can, however,
increase the cost of siting and operating any type of future electric generating facility. The
impact of such statutes and regulations on the Company cannot be determined at this time.

Litigation over environmental issues and claims of various types, including property damage,
personal injury, common law nuisance, and citizen enforcement of environmental requirements such as
air and water quality standards, has increased generally throughout the United States. In
particular, personal injury claims for damages caused by alleged exposure to hazardous materials
have become more frequent. The ultimate outcome of such potential litigation against the Company
cannot be determined at this time.

Global Climate Issues

Federal legislative proposals that would impose mandatory requirements related to greenhouse gas
emissions and renewable energy standards continue to be strongly considered in Congress, and the
reduction of greenhouse gas emissions has been identified as a high priority by the current
Administration. The ultimate outcome of these proposals cannot be determined at this time;
however, mandatory restrictions on the Company’s greenhouse gas emissions could result in
significant additional compliance costs that could affect future unit retirement and replacement
decisions and results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.

In April 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has
authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles.
The EPA is currently developing its response to this decision. Regulatory decisions that will
follow from this response may have implications for both new and existing stationary sources, such
as power plants. The ultimate outcome of these rulemaking activities cannot be determined at this
time; however, as with the current legislative proposals, mandatory restrictions on the Company’s
greenhouse gas emissions could result in significant additional compliance costs that could affect
future unit retirement and replacement decisions and results of operations, cash flows, and
financial condition.

In addition, some states are considering or have undertaken actions to regulate and reduce
greenhouse gas emissions. For example, on June 25, 2008, Florida’s Governor signed comprehensive
energy-related legislation that includes authorization for the Florida Department of Environmental
Protection to adopt rules for a cap-and-trade regulatory program to address greenhouse gas
emissions from electric utilities, conditioned upon their ratification by the legislature no sooner
than the 2010 legislative session. This legislation also authorizes the Florida Public Service
Commission to adopt a renewable portfolio standard for public utilities, subject to legislative
ratification. The impact of this and any similar legislation on the Company will depend on the
future development, adoption, legislative ratification, implementation, and potential legal
challenges to rules governing greenhouse gas emissions and mandates regarding the use of renewable
energy, and the ultimate outcome cannot be determined at this time.

International climate change negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change also continue. Current efforts focus on a potential successor to the Kyoto Protocol for the
post 2012 timeframe, with a conclusion to this round of negotiations targeted for the end of 2009.
The outcome and impact of the international negotiations cannot be determined at this time.

The Company continues to evaluate its future energy and emission profiles and is participating in
voluntary programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to help develop and advance technology to
reduce emissions.

II-375


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

Carbon Dioxide Litigation

On February 26, 2008, the Native Village of Kivalina and the City of Kivalina filed a suit in the
U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against several electric utilities
(including Southern Company), several oil companies, and a coal company. The plaintiffs are the
governing bodies of an Inupiat village in Alaska. The plaintiffs contend that the village is being
destroyed by erosion allegedly caused by global warming that the plaintiffs attribute to emissions
of greenhouse gases by the defendants. The plaintiffs assert claims for public and private nuisance
and contend that the defendants have acted in concert and are therefore jointly and severally
liable for the plaintiffs’ damages. The suit seeks damages for lost property values and for the
cost of relocating the village, which is alleged to be $95 million to $400 million. On June 30,
2008, all defendants filed motions to dismiss this case. Southern Company believes that these
claims are without merit and notes that the complaint cites no statutory or regulatory basis for
the claims. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

FERC Matters

Market-Based Rate Authority

The Company has authorization from the FERC to sell power to non-affiliates, including short-term
opportunity sales, at market-based prices. Specific FERC approval must be obtained with respect to
a market-based contract with an affiliate.

In December 2004, the FERC initiated a proceeding to assess Southern Company’s generation dominance
within its retail service territory. The ability to charge market-based rates in other markets is
not an issue in the proceeding. Any new market-based rate sales by the Company in Southern
Company’s retail service territory entered into during a 15-month refund period that ended in May
2006 could be subject to refund to a cost-based rate level.

In November 2007, the presiding administrative law judge issued an initial decision regarding the
methodology to be used in the generation dominance tests. The proceedings are ongoing. The
ultimate outcome of this generation dominance proceeding cannot now be determined, but an adverse
decision by the FERC in a final order could require the Company to charge cost-based rates for
certain wholesale sales in the Southern Company retail service territory, which may be lower than
negotiated market-based rates, and could also result in total refunds of up to $0.7 million, plus
interest. The Company believes that there is no meritorious basis for an adverse decision in this
proceeding and is vigorously defending itself in this matter.

In June 2007, the FERC issued its final rule in Order No. 697 regarding market-based rate
authority. The FERC generally retained its current market-based rate standards. Responding to a
number of requests for rehearing, the FERC issued Order No. 697-A on April 21, 2008 and Order No.
697-B on December 12, 2008. These orders largely affirmed its prior revision and codification of
the regulations governing market-based rates for public utilities. In accordance with the orders,
Southern Company submitted to the FERC an updated market power analysis on September 2, 2008
related to its continued market-based rate authority. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot
now be determined.

On October 17, 2008, Southern Company filed with the FERC a revised market-based rate (MBR) tariff
and a new cost-based rate (CBR) tariff. The revised MBR tariff provides for a “must offer” energy
auction whereby Southern Company offers all of its available energy for sale in a day-ahead auction
and an hour-ahead auction with reserve prices not to exceed the CBR tariff price, after considering
Southern Company’s native load requirements, reliability obligations, and sales commitments to
third parties. All sales under the energy auction would be at market clearing prices established
under the auction rules. The new CBR tariff provides for a cost-based price for wholesale sales of
less than a year. On December 18, 2008, the FERC issued an order conditionally accepting the MBR
tariff subject to certain revisions to the auction proposal. On January 21, 2009, Southern Company
made a compliance filing that accepted all the conditions of the MBR tariff order. When this order
becomes final, Southern Company will have 30 days to implement the wholesale auction. On December
31, 2008, the FERC issued an order conditionally accepting the CBR tariff subject to providing
additional information concerning one aspect of the tariff. On January 30, 2009, Southern Company
filed a response addressing the FERC inquiry to the CBR tariff order. Implementation of the energy
auction in accordance with the MBR tariff order is expected to adequately mitigate going forward
any presumption of market power that Southern Company may have in the Southern Company retail
service territory. The timing of when the FERC may issue the final orders on the MBR and CBR
tariffs and the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

II-376


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

Intercompany Interchange Contract

The majority of the Company’s generation fleet is operated under the IIC, as approved by the FERC.
In May 2005, the FERC initiated a new proceeding to examine (1) the provisions of the IIC among the
traditional operating companies, the Company, and Southern Company Services, Inc., as agent, under
the terms of which the Southern Pool is operated, (2) whether any parties to the IIC have violated
the FERC’s standards of conduct applicable to utility companies that are transmission providers,
and (3) whether Southern Company’s code of conduct defining the Company as a “system company”
rather than a “marketing affiliate” is just and reasonable. In connection with the formation of
the Company, the FERC authorized the Company’s inclusion in the IIC in 2000. The FERC also
previously approved Southern Company’s code of conduct.

In October 2006, the FERC issued an order accepting a settlement resolving the proceeding subject
to Southern Company’s agreement to accept certain modifications to the settlement’s terms and
Southern Company notified the FERC that it accepted the modifications. The modifications largely
involve functional separation and information restrictions related to marketing activities
conducted on behalf of Southern Power. In November 2006, Southern Company filed with the FERC a compliance plan in connection with the order. In April 2007, the FERC approved, with certain
modifications, the plan submitted by Southern Company. In November 2007, Southern Company notified
the FERC that the plan had been implemented. On December 12, 2008, the FERC division of audits
issued for public comment its final audit report pertaining to compliance implementation and
related matters. No comments challenging the audit report’s findings were submitted. A decision is
now pending from the FERC. The annual cost of implementing the order is approximately $7.0 million.
The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

Income Tax Matters

Legislation

On February 17, 2009, President Obama signed into law the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of
2009 (ARRA). Major tax incentives in the ARRA include an extension of bonus depreciation and
multiple renewable energy incentives. These incentives could have a significant impact on the
Company’s future cash flow and net income. Additionally, the ARRA includes programs for renewable
energy, transmission and smart grid enhancement, fossil energy and research, and energy efficiency
and conservation. The ultimate impact cannot be determined at this time.

Internal Revenue Code Section 199 Domestic Production Deduction

The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 created a tax deduction for a portion of income attributable
to U.S. production activities as defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, Section
199 (production activities deduction). The deduction is equal to a stated percentage of qualified
production activities net income. The percentage is phased in over the years 2005 through 2010
with a 3% rate applicable to the years 2005 and 2006, a 6% rate applicable for years 2007 through
2009, and a 9% rate thereafter. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has not clearly defined a
methodology for calculating this deduction. However, Southern Company has agreed with the IRS on a
calculation methodology and signed a closing agreement on December 11, 2008. Therefore, the
Company reversed the unrecognized tax benefit and adjusted the deduction to conform to the
agreement. The net impact of the reversal of the unrecognized tax benefits combined with the
application of the new methodology had no material effect on the Company’s financial statements.
See Note 5 to the financial statements under “Effective Tax Rate” for additional information.

Construction Projects

Cleveland County Units 1-4

On December 5, 2008, the Company announced that it will build an electric generating plant in
Cleveland County, North Carolina. The plant will consist of four combustion turbine natural gas
generating units with a total generating capacity of 720 MW. The units are expected to go into
commercial operation in 2012. Costs incurred through December 31, 2008 were $5.2 million. The
total estimated construction cost is expected to be between $350 million and $400 million, which is
included in the capital program estimates described under FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY —
“Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations” herein.

The Company has also entered into PPAs with NCEMC and NCMPA1 for a portion of the generating
capacity from the plant that will begin in 2012 and expire in 2036 and 2031, respectively. NCEMC
will purchase 180 MW of capacity that will be supported by one unit at the plant and will purchase
capacity from a second unit at the plant that will increase to 180 MW over a seven year phase-in
period. NCMPA1 will purchase 180 MW from a third unit at the plant. The NCEMC PPAs are subject to
approval by the Rural Utilities Service. The final outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.

II-377


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

Plant Franklin Unit 3

The Company completed construction of Plant Franklin Unit 3 in June 2008. Total costs incurred
were $309.9 million. The unit is a natural gas-fueled combined cycle located in Smiths, Alabama
with a nameplate capacity of 659 MW. The unit will be used to provide annual capacity for a PPA
with Constellation from 2009 through 2015.

Plant Oleander Unit 5

The Company completed construction of Plant Oleander Unit 5 in December 2007. Total costs incurred
were $58.0 million. This unit is a combustion turbine with a nameplate capacity of 163 MW located
in Brevard County, Florida. This unit is contracted to provide annual capacity for a PPA with FMPA
from 2007 through 2027.

IGCC

In December 2005, the Company and OUC executed definitive agreements for development of a 285-MW
IGCC project in Orlando, Florida. The definitive agreements provided that the Company would own at
least 65% of the gasifier portion of the IGCC project. OUC would own the remainder of the gasifier
portion and 100% of the combined cycle portion of the IGCC project. The Company signed cooperative
agreements with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) that provided up to $293.75 million in grant
funding for the gasification portion of this project. The IGCC project was expected to begin
commercial operation in 2010. Due to uncertainty surrounding potential state regulations relating
to greenhouse gas emissions, the Company and OUC mutually agreed to terminate the construction of
the gasifier portion of the IGCC project in November 2007. The Company has continued construction
of the gas-fired combined cycle generating facility for OUC under a fixed-price, long-term contract
for engineering, procurement, and construction services. The Company expects the construction to
be completed substantially at the contractual fixed price and no profit or loss is anticipated at
this time. The Company recorded a loss in the fourth quarter 2007 of approximately $17.6 million
related to cancellation of the gasifier portion of the IGCC project. This amount is net of
reimbursements from OUC and the DOE. This loss consists of the write-off of construction costs of
$14.0 million and an accrual for termination costs of $3.6 million. All termination costs were
paid in 2008. As part of the termination agreement with OUC, the Company sold a tract of land in
Orange County, Florida to OUC. The Company recorded a gain of approximately $6 million on this
sale in the first quarter 2008.

Other Matters

The Company completed depreciation studies in 2006 and 2008. The composite depreciation rates for
its property, plant, and equipment were updated in these studies. These changes in estimates arise
from changes in useful life assumptions for certain components of plant in service. These changes
increased depreciation expense prospectively beginning March 1, 2006 and January 1, 2008 and
reduced net income. The net income impacts of these changes were $3.8 million and $2.8 million,
respectively. See Note 1 to the financial statements under “Depreciation” for additional
information. The Company reviews its estimated useful lives and salvage values on an ongoing
basis. The results of these reviews could have a material impact on net income in the near term.
See ACCOUNTING POLICIES — “Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” herein for
additional information.

From time to time, the Company is involved in various matters being litigated and regulatory
matters that could affect future earnings. In addition, the Company is subject to certain claims
and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company’s business activities
are subject to extensive governmental regulation related to public health and the environment.
Litigation over environmental issues and claims of various types, including property damage,
personal injury, common law nuisance, and citizen enforcement of environmental requirements such as
air and water quality standards, has increased generally throughout the United States. In
particular, personal injury claims for damages caused by alleged exposure to hazardous materials
have become more frequent. The ultimate outcome of such pending or potential litigation against
the Company cannot be predicted at this time; however, for current proceedings not specifically
reported herein, management does not anticipate that the liabilities, if any arising from such
current proceedings would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial statements.
See Note 3 to the financial statements for information regarding material issues.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The Company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States. Significant accounting policies are described in Note 1
to the financial statements. In the application of these policies, certain

II-378


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

estimates are made that may have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations and
related disclosures. Different assumptions and measurements could produce estimates that are
significantly different from those recorded in the financial statements. Senior management has
reviewed and discussed the critical accounting policies and estimates described below with the
Audit Committee of Southern Company’s Board of Directors.

Revenue Recognition

The Company’s revenue recognition depends on appropriate classification and documentation of
transactions in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 133,
“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended and interpreted (SFAS
No. 133). In general, the Company’s power sale transactions can be classified in one of four
categories: non-derivatives, normal sales, cash flow hedges, and mark to market. For more
information on derivative transactions, see FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY — “Market Price
Risk” herein and Notes 1 and 6 to the financial statements under “Financial Instruments.” The
Company’s revenues are dependent upon significant judgments used to determine the appropriate
transaction classification, which must be documented upon the inception of each contract. Factors
that must be considered in making these determinations include:

Normal Sale and Non-Derivative Transactions

The Company has entered into capacity contracts that provide for the sale of electricity and that
involve physical delivery in quantities within the Company’s available generating capacity. These
contracts either do not meet the definition of a derivative or are designated as normal sales, thus
exempting them from fair value accounting under SFAS No. 133. As a result, such transactions are
accounted for as executory contracts; additionally, the related revenue is recognized in accordance
with Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) No. 91-6, “Revenue Recognition of Long-Term Power Sales
Contracts” on an accrual basis in amounts equal to the lesser of the levelized amount or the amount
billable under the contract, over the respective contract periods. Revenues are recorded on a
gross or net basis in accordance with EITF No. 99-19, “Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal
versus Net as an Agent.” Revenues from transactions that do not meet the definition of a derivative
are also recorded in this manner. Contracts recorded on the accrual basis represented the majority
of the Company’s operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008.

Cash Flow Hedge Transactions

The Company designates other derivative contracts for the sale of electricity as cash flow hedges
of anticipated sale transactions. These contracts are marked to market through other comprehensive
income over the life of the contract. Realized gains and losses are then recognized in revenues as
incurred.

Mark to Market Transactions

Contracts for sales of electricity that are not normal sales and are not designated as cash flow
hedges are marked to market and recorded directly through net income. Net unrealized gains on such
contracts were not material for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, or 2006.

II-379


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

Percentage of Completion

The Company is currently engaged in a long-term contract for engineering, procurement, and
construction services to build a combined cycle unit for OUC. Construction activities commenced in
2006 and are expected to be complete by the end of 2009. Revenues and costs are recognized using
the percentage-of-completion method. The Company utilizes the cost-to-cost approach as this method
is less subjective than relying on assessments of physical progress. The percentage of completion
represents the percentage of the total costs incurred to the estimated total cost of the contract.
Revenues and costs are recognized by applying this percentage to the total revenues and estimated
costs of the contract.

Asset Impairments

The Company’s investments in long-lived assets are primarily generation assets, whether in service
or under construction. The Company evaluates the carrying value of these assets under FASB
Statement No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets,” whenever
indicators of potential impairment exist. Examples of impairment indicators could include
significant changes in construction schedules, current period losses combined with a history of
losses or a projection of continuing losses, a significant decrease in market prices, and the
inability to remarket generating capacity for an extended period. If an indicator exists, the
asset is tested for recoverability by comparing the asset carrying value to the sum of the
undiscounted expected future cash flows directly attributable to the asset. A high degree of
judgment is required in developing estimates related to these evaluations, which are based on
projections of various factors, including the following:

•

Future demand for electricity based on projections of economic growth and estimates of
available generating capacity;

•

Future power and natural gas prices, which have been quite volatile in recent years; and

•

Future operating costs.

Acquisition Accounting

The Company has been engaged in a strategy of acquiring assets. The Company has accounted for
these acquisitions under the purchase method in accordance with FASB Statement No. 141, “Business
Combinations.” Accordingly, the Company has included these operations in the consolidated financial
statements from the respective date of acquisition. The purchase price of each acquisition was
allocated to the identifiable assets and liabilities based on a valuation prepared by a third
party. The Company adopted FASB Statement No. 141 (revised 2007), “Business Combinations” (SFAS
No. 141R) effective January 1, 2009. Any costs incurred by the Company in assessing potential
acquisitions that will close after December 31, 2008 have been expensed as incurred.

Contingent Obligations

The Company is subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, as well as other
factors and conditions that potentially subject it to environmental, litigation, income tax, and
other risks. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL herein and Note 3 to the financial statements for more
information regarding certain of these contingencies. The Company periodically evaluates its
exposure to such risks and, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, records
reserves for those matters where a non-tax-related loss is considered probable and reasonably
estimable and records a tax asset or liability if it is more likely than not that a tax position
will be sustained. The adequacy of reserves can be significantly affected by external events or
conditions that can be unpredictable; thus, the ultimate outcome of such matters could materially
affect the Company’s financial statements. These events or conditions include the following:

II-380


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

Depreciation

Depreciation of the original cost of assets is computed under the straight-line method and applies
a composite depreciation rate based on the assets’ estimated useful lives determined by management.
The primary assets in property, plant, and equipment are power plants, all of which have an
estimated composite life ranging from 29 to 37 years. These lives reflect a weighted average of
the significant components (retirement units) that make up the plants. The Company reviews its
estimated useful lives and salvage values on an ongoing basis. The results of these reviews could
result in changes which could have a material impact on net income in the near term. See Note 1 to
the financial statements under “Depreciation” for a discussion of changes in depreciation
assumptions made by the Company effective January 1, 2008.

When property subject to composite depreciation is retired or otherwise disposed of in the normal
course of business, its cost is charged to accumulated depreciation. For other property
dispositions, the applicable cost and accumulated depreciation is removed from the accounts and a
gain or loss is recognized.

New Accounting Standards

Business Combinations

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R. The Company adopted SFAS No. 141R on January 1,
2009. The adoption of SFAS No. 141R could have an impact on the accounting for any business
combinations completed by the Company after January 1, 2009. Any costs incurred by the Company in
assessing potential acquisitions that will close after December 31, 2008 have been expensed as
incurred.

In December 2007, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 160, “Non-controlling Interests in
Consolidated Financial Statements” (SFAS No. 160). SFAS No. 160 amends Accounting Research
Bulletin No. 51, “Consolidated Financial Statements” to establish accounting and reporting
standards for the non-controlling (minority) interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation
of a subsidiary. It clarifies that a non-controlling interest in a subsidiary should be reported as
equity in the consolidated financial statements and establishes a single method of accounting for
changes in a parent’s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation.
The Company adopted SFAS No. 160 on January 1, 2009 with no material impact to the financial
statements.

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY

Overview

The Company’s financial condition remained stable at December 31, 2008. Throughout the recent
turmoil in the financial markets, the Company has maintained cash balances to cover the majority of
its capital needs and has had limited need to issue commercial paper or draw on committed credit
arrangements. There was no commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2008. Subsequent to
December 31, 2008, the Company issued a small amount of overnight commercial paper. Southern Power
intends to continue to monitor its access to short-term and long-term capital markets as well as
its bank credit arrangements as needed to meet its future capital and liquidity needs. No changes
in bank credit arrangements were experienced during 2008 although market rates for committed credit
have increased and the Company may be subject to higher costs as its existing facilities are
replaced or renewed. The Company experienced no material counterparty credit losses as a result of
the turmoil in the financial markets. The ultimate impact on future financing costs as a result of
the financial turmoil cannot be determined at this time. See “Sources of Capital” herein for
additional information on lines of credit.

Net cash provided from operating activities totaled $264.3 million in 2008, decreasing 19.4% from
2007. This decrease is primarily due to cash outflows for engineering, procurement, and
construction services to build a combined cycle unit for OUC. The OUC contract is not expected to
have any positive or negative cash impacts to the Company over the term of the contract as the
Company is not anticipating a profit or loss from this transaction at this time. Net cash used for
investing activities totaled $85.8 million in 2008, decreasing 53.4% from 2007. This decrease was
primarily due to the completion of Plant Oleander Unit 5 in 2007 and the completion of Plant
Franklin Unit 3 in 2008. Gross property additions to utility plant of $50.0 million in 2008 were
primarily related to the completion of Plant Franklin Unit 3. Net cash used for financing
activities was $140.6 million in 2008, decreasing 14.9% from 2007. This decrease was primarily due
to reduced levels of short-term debt in 2008.

II-381


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

Net cash provided from operating activities totaled $315.4 million in 2007, increasing 29.8% from
2006. This increase was primarily due to the increase in sales due to favorable weather and cash
received under billings for the engineering, procurement, and construction services to build a
combined cycle unit for OUC. Net cash used for investing activities totaled $183.9 million in
2007, decreasing 61% from 2006. This decrease was primarily due to the acquisition of Plants
DeSoto and Rowan in June 2006 and September 2006, respectively. Gross property additions to
utility plant of $139.2 million in 2007 were primarily related to the on-going construction
activity at Plant Franklin Unit 3 and the completion of construction at Plant Oleander Unit 5. Net
cash used for financing activities was $161.5 million in 2007 compared to $233.4 million provided
to the Company in 2006. This change was primarily due to the cash proceeds of $200 million from
the issuance of 30-year senior notes in 2006 and borrowings and equity contributions to finance the
acquisitions of Plants DeSoto and Rowan.

Net cash provided from operating activities totaled $243.0 million in 2006, increasing 20.6% from
2005. This increase was primarily due to the increase in sales due to PPAs started or acquired
during the period and a reduction of energy revenues due to lower natural gas prices resulting in
reduced working capital levels. Net cash used for investing activities totaled $474.1 million in
2006, increasing 96.6% from 2005. This increase was due primarily to the acquisition of Plants
DeSoto and Rowan in June 2006 and September 2006, respectively. Net cash provided by financing
activities in 2006 totaled $233.4 million, increasing 453.1% from 2005. This increase was
primarily due to the cash proceeds of $200 million from the issuance of 30-year senior notes in
2006 and borrowings and equity contributions to finance the acquisitions of Plants DeSoto and
Rowan.

Significant asset changes in the balance sheet during 2008 include increases in accounts receivable
related to higher energy revenues due to an increase in natural gas prices, increases in long-term
service agreements prepayments due to the timing of outage activities, and an increase in cash due
to a reduction of investing activities of the Company in 2008 due to the completion of construction
projects at Plant Oleander Unit 5 in December 2007 and Plant Franklin Unit 3 in June 2008.

Significant asset changes in the balance sheet during 2007 include lower cash balances as available
amounts were used to reduce short-term debt and an increase in assets from risk management
activities primarily due to mark to market changes on energy derivative contracts.

Significant liability and stockholder’s equity changes in the balance sheet during 2008 include the
payment of short-term debt obligations, increases in affiliate payables due to increases in natural
gas and purchased power prices, a reduction of other current liabilities due to payment of IGCC
termination costs, and a decrease in the net billings in excess of cost on the OUC construction
contract due to on-going construction activities. In 2008, the Company also paid $94.5 million in
dividends to Southern Company.

Significant liability and stockholder’s equity changes in the balance sheet during 2007 include a
reduction of short-term debt, an increase in billings received in excess of costs on the OUC
construction contract, and payment of $89.8 million in dividends to Southern Company.

Sources of Capital

The Company may use operating cash flows, external funds, or equity capital or loans from Southern
Company to finance any new projects, acquisitions, and ongoing capital requirements. The Company
expects to generate external funds from the issuance of unsecured senior debt and commercial paper
or utilization of credit arrangements from banks. However, the amount, type, and timing of any
financings, if needed, will depend upon regulatory approval, prevailing market conditions, and
other factors.

The Company’s current liabilities frequently exceed current assets due to the use of short-term
indebtedness as a funding source, as well as cash needs which can fluctuate significantly due to
the seasonality of the business. To meet liquidity and capital resource requirements, at December
31, 2008, the Company had $400 million of committed credit arrangements with banks that expire in
2012. There were no borrowings under this facility outstanding at December 31, 2008. Proceeds
from these credit arrangements may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes as
well as liquidity support for the Company’s commercial paper program. See Note 6 to the financial
statements under “Bank Credit Arrangements” for additional information.

The Company’s commercial paper program is used to finance acquisition and construction costs
related to electric generating facilities and for general corporate purposes. At December 31,
2008, there was no commercial paper outstanding. See Note 6 to the financial statements under
“Bank Credit Arrangements” for additional information.

Management believes that the need for working capital can be adequately met by utilizing cash
balances, commercial paper programs, and lines of credit.

II-382


MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

Financing Activities

During 2008 and 2007, the Company did not issue any new long-term securities.

The issuance of all securities by the Company is generally subject to regulatory approval by the
FERC. Additionally, with respect to the public offering of securities, the Company files
registration statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended (1933 Act). The amounts of securities authorized by the FERC, as well as the
amounts registered under the 1933 Act, are continuously monitored and appropriate filings are made
to ensure flexibility in the capital markets.

Credit Rating Risk

The Company does not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in payment
schedules or terminations as a result of a credit rating downgrade. There are certain contracts
that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of a credit rating change
to BBB and Baa2, or BBB- and/or Baa3 or below. These contracts are for physical electricity
purchases and sales, fuel purchases, fuel transportation and storage, and energy price risk
management. At December 31, 2008, the maximum potential collateral requirements under these
contracts at a BBB and Baa2 rating were approximately $9 million and at a BBB- and/or Baa3 rating
were approximately $334 million. At December 31, 2008, the maximum potential collateral
requirements under these contracts at a rating below BBB- and/or Baa3 were approximately $723
million. Included in these amounts are certain agreements that could require collateral in the
event that one or more Power Pool participants has a credit rating change to below investment
grade. Generally, collateral may be provided by a Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit, or
cash. Additionally, any credit rating downgrade could impact the Company’s ability to access
capital markets, particularly the short-term debt market.

In addition, through the acquisition of Plant Rowan, the Company assumed a PPA with Duke Energy
that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of a downgrade to the
Company’s credit rating to below BBB- or Baa3. The amount of collateral required would depend upon
actual losses, if any, resulting from a credit downgrade.

Market Price Risk

The Company is exposed to market risks, including changes in interest rates, certain energy-related
commodity prices, and, occasionally, currency exchange rates. To manage the volatility
attributable to these exposures, the Company takes advantage of natural offsets and enters into
various derivative transactions for the remaining exposures pursuant to the Company’s policies in
areas such as counterparty exposure and hedging practices. Company policy is that derivatives are
to be used primarily for hedging purposes. Derivative positions are monitored using techniques
that include market valuation and sensitivity analysis.

At December 31, 2008, the Company had no variable long-term debt outstanding. Therefore, there
would be no effect on annualized interest expense related to long-term debt if the Company
sustained a 100 basis point change in interest rates. Since a significant portion of outstanding
indebtedness bears interest at fixed rates, the Company is not aware of any facts or circumstances
that would significantly affect such exposures in the near term. However, the impact on future
financing costs cannot be determined at this time.

Because energy from the Company’s facilities is primarily sold under long-term PPAs with tolling
agreements and provisions shifting substantially all of the responsibility for fuel cost to the
counterparties, the Company’s exposure to market volatility in commodity fuel prices and prices of
electricity is limited. However, the Company has been and may continue to be exposed to market
volatility in energy-related commodity prices as a result of sales of uncontracted generating
capacity.

The changes in fair value of energy-related derivative contracts were as follows at December 31:

As part of the adoption of FASB Statement No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” to increase
consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, the table above
now uses the three-tier fair value hierarchy, as discussed in Note 8 to the financial statements,
as opposed to the previously used descriptions “actively quoted,” “external sources,” and “models
and other methods.” The three-tier fair value hierarchy focuses on the fair value of the contract
itself, whereas the previous descriptions focused on the source of the inputs. Because the Company
uses over-the-counter contracts that are not exchange traded but are fair valued using prices which
are actively quoted, the valuations of those contracts now appear in Level 2; previously they were
shown as “actively quoted.”

The Company is exposed to market-price risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to
energy-related derivative contracts. The Company’s practice is to enter into agreements with
counterparties that have investment grade credit ratings by Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s or with
counterparties who have posted collateral to cover potential credit exposure. Therefore, the
Company does not anticipate market risk exposure from nonperformance by the counterparties. For
additional information, see Notes 1 and 6 to the financial statements under “Financial
Instruments.”

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)

Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations

The capital program of the Company is currently estimated to be $748.9 million for 2009, $658.9
million for 2010, and $768.6 million for 2011. These amounts include estimates for potential plant
acquisitions and new construction as well as ongoing capital improvements. Planned expenditures
for plant acquisitions may vary due to market opportunities and the Company’s ability to execute
its growth strategy. Actual construction costs may vary from these estimates because of changes in
factors such as: business conditions; environmental statutes and regulations; FERC rules and
regulations; load projections; the cost and efficiency of construction labor, equipment, and
materials; and the cost of capital. On December 5, 2008, the Company announced plans to construct
four combustion turbine units in North Carolina. See FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL — “Construction
Projects” herein for additional information.

Other funding requirements related to obligations associated with scheduled maturities of long-term
debt, as well as the related interest, leases, derivative obligations, and other purchase
commitments are as follows. See Notes 1, 6, and 7 to the financial statements for additional

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

General

Southern Power Company (the Company) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Southern Company, which is
also the parent company of four traditional operating companies, Southern Company Services, Inc.
(SCS), Southern Communications Services, Inc. (SouthernLINC Wireless), Southern Company Holdings,
Inc. (Southern Holdings), Southern Nuclear Operating Company, Inc. (Southern Nuclear), and other
direct and indirect subsidiaries. The traditional operating companies, Alabama Power Company
(APC), Georgia Power Company (GPC), Gulf Power Company (Gulf Power), and Mississippi Power Company,
are vertically integrated utilities providing electric service in four Southeastern states. The
Company constructs, acquires, owns, and manages generation assets and sells electricity at
market-based rates in the wholesale market. SCS, the system service company, provides, at cost,
specialized services to Southern Company and its subsidiary companies. SouthernLINC Wireless
provides digital wireless communications for use by Southern Company and its subsidiary companies
and also markets these services to the public and provides fiber cable services within the
Southeast. Southern Holdings is an intermediate holding company subsidiary for Southern Company’s
investments in leveraged leases and various other energy-related businesses. Southern Nuclear
operates and provides services to Southern Company’s nuclear power plants.

The Company is subject to regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). The
Company follows accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States requires the use of estimates, and the actual results may differ from those estimates.

The financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries,
Southern Company — Florida LLC, Oleander Power Project, LP (Oleander), DeSoto County Generating
Company, LLC (DeSoto), and Southern Power Company — Orlando Gasification LLC (SPC-OG), which own,
operate, and maintain the Company’s ownership interests in Plant Stanton Unit A, Plant Oleander,
Plant DeSoto, and construct the combined cycle for the Orlando Utilities Commission (OUC),
respectively. See Note 2 under “DeSoto and Rowan Acquisitions” and “Oleander Acquisition.” All
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Reclassifications

Certain prior years’ data presented in the financial statements have been reclassified to conform
to the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on total assets, net
income, or cash flows. The consolidated statements of income for the periods presented have been
modified within the operating expenses section to combine the line items “Other operations” and
“Maintenance” into a single line item entitled “Other operations and maintenance.” The consolidated
statements of cash flows were modified to present a separate line item within the investing section
for “Payments pursuant to long-term service agreements” previously included in “Property
additions.” The balance sheet at December 31, 2007 was modified to reflect the amount of “Prepaid
income taxes” previously included in “Other prepaid expenses.”

Affiliate Transactions

The Company has an agreement with SCS under which the following services are rendered to the
Company at amounts in compliance with FERC regulation: general and design engineering, purchasing,
accounting and statistical analysis, finance and treasury, tax, information resources, marketing,
auditing, insurance and pension administration, human resources, systems and procedures, digital
wireless communications, labor, and other services with respect to business and operations and
power pool transactions. Because the Company has no employees, all employee-related charges are
rendered at amounts in compliance with FERC regulation under agreements with SCS. Costs for these
services from SCS amounted to approximately $207.4 million in 2008, $125.4 million in 2007, and
$77.8 million in 2006. Approximately $87.9 million in 2008, $74.1 million in 2007, and $59.7
million in 2006 were operations and maintenance expenses; the remainder was recorded to
construction work in progress, other assets, and billings in excess of cost on construction
contract. Cost allocation methodologies used by SCS were approved by the Securities and Exchange
Commission prior to the repeal of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended, and
management believes they are reasonable. The FERC permits services to be rendered at cost by
system service companies.

In 2003, the Company entered into agreements with APC and GPC under which APC and GPC operated and
maintained Plants Dahlberg, Wansley, Franklin, and Harris. GPC also supplied various services for
other plants. In August 2007, those agreements were terminated and replaced with service
agreements under which APC and GPC provide specifically requested services to the Company. These
services are billed at amounts in compliance with FERC regulation on a monthly basis and are
recorded as

II-392


NOTES (continued)

Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

operations and maintenance expenses in the consolidated statements of income. For the periods
ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, billings under these agreements totaled approximately $2.9
million, $9.2 million, and $7.6 million, respectively.

Total billings for all purchased power agreements (PPAs) in effect with affiliates totaled $539.6
million, $505.2 million, and $467.9 million in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. Included in
these billings were $32.2 million, $34.8 million, and $36.3 million of “Deferred capacity revenues
— affiliated” recorded on the balance sheets at December 31, 2008, December 31, 2007, and December
31, 2006, respectively. The Company and the traditional operating companies may jointly enter into
various types of wholesale energy, natural gas, and certain other contracts, either directly or
through SCS as agent. Each participating company may be jointly and severally liable for the
obligations incurred under these agreements.

The Company and the traditional operating companies generally settle amounts related to the above
transactions on a monthly basis in the month following the performance of such services or the
purchase or sale of electricity.

In 2008, Gulf Power and APC sold turbine rotor assemblies to the Company for $9.4 million and $6.3
million, respectively. Additionally, the Company sold a turbine rotor assembly to APC for $8.2
million and sold a compressor assembly to GPC for $3.9 million. No gain or loss was recognized in
the Company’s consolidated statements of income. These affiliate transactions were made in
accordance with FERC and state Public Service Commission (PSC) rules and guidelines.

In 2007, the Company sold plots of land in Prattville, Alabama and Chilton County, Alabama to APC.
The total sales price was $4.3 million and is recorded in “Sale of property to affiliates” on the
statements of cash flows. In addition, the Company sold a turbine rotor to Gulf Power for $7.9
million. No gain or loss was recognized in the Company’s consolidated statements of income. These
affiliate transactions were made in accordance with FERC and state PSC rules and guidelines.

In 2006, the Company sold its membership interests in Cherokee Falls Development of South Carolina
LLC to Southern Company’s nuclear development affiliate. The sales price was $15.7 million and is
recorded in “Sale of property to affiliates” on the statement of cash flows. No gain or loss was
recognized in the Company’s consolidated statements of income.

Revenues

Capacity is sold at rates specified under contractual terms and is recognized at the lesser of the
levelized amount or the amount billable under the contract over the respective contract periods.
Energy is generally sold at market-based rates and the associated revenue is recognized as the
energy is delivered. Transmission revenues and other fees are recognized as incurred as other
operating revenue. Revenues are recorded on a gross basis for all full requirements PPAs. See
“Financial Instruments” for additional information.

Significant portions of the Company’s revenues have been derived from certain customers pursuant to
PPAs. For the year ended December 31, 2008, GPC accounted for 36.5% of total revenues, Sawnee
Electric Membership Corporation accounted for 6.1% of total revenues, and Flint Electric Membership
Corporation accounted for 5.3% of total revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2007, GPC
accounted for 45.6% of total revenues, APC accounted for 6.9% of total revenues, and Sawnee
Electric Membership Corporation accounted for 5.5% of total revenues. For the year ended December
31, 2006, GPC accounted for 52.7% of total revenues, APC accounted for 8.2% of total revenues, and
Flint Electric Membership Corporation accounted for 4.6% of total revenues.

The Company has a long-term contract for engineering, procurement, and construction services to
build a combined cycle unit for OUC. Construction activities commenced in 2006 and are expected to
be complete by the end of 2009. Revenue and costs are recognized using the
percentage-of-completion method. The Company utilizes the cost-to-cost approach as this method is
less subjective than relying on assessments of physical progress. The percentage of completion
represents the percentage of the total costs incurred to the estimated total cost of the contract.
Revenues and costs are recognized by applying this percentage to the total revenues and estimated
costs of the contract.

II-393


NOTES (continued)

Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

Fuel Costs

Fuel costs are expensed as the fuel is consumed.

Income and Other Taxes

The Company uses the liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes and provides deferred
income taxes for all significant income tax temporary differences. In accordance with Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes” (FIN 48), the Company recognizes tax positions that are “more likely than not” of being
sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities. See Note 5 under “Unrecognized
Tax Benefits” for additional information.

Property, Plant, and Equipment

The Company’s depreciable property, plant, and equipment consist entirely of generation assets.

Property, plant, and equipment is stated at original cost. Original cost includes materials,
direct labor incurred by contractors and affiliated companies, minor items of property, and
interest capitalized. Interest is capitalized on qualifying projects during the development and
construction period. The cost to replace significant items of property defined as retirement units
is capitalized. The cost of maintenance, repairs, and replacement of minor items of property is
charged to maintenance expense as incurred.

Depreciation

Depreciation of the original cost of assets is computed under the straight-line method and applies
a composite depreciation rate based on the assets’ estimated useful lives determined by the
Company. The primary assets in property, plant, and equipment are power plants, all of which have
an estimated composite depreciable life ranging from 29-37 years. These lives reflect a composite
of the significant components (retirement units) that make up the plants. The Company reviews its
estimated useful lives and salvage values on an ongoing basis. The results of these reviews could
result in changes which could have a material impact on net income in the near term.

A depreciation study was completed and the applicable remaining plant lives and associated
depreciation rates were revised in January 2008. This change in estimate was due to revised useful
life assumptions for certain components of plant in service. Depreciation rates by generating
facility changed from a range of 2.8% to 3.8% to an adjusted range of 1.8% to 4.1%. These changes
increased depreciation and reduced income from continuing operations and net income by $4.6 million
and $2.8 million, respectively, for 2008.

When property subject to composite depreciation is retired or otherwise disposed of in the normal
course of business, its cost is charged to accumulated depreciation. For other property
dispositions, the applicable cost and accumulated depreciation is removed from the accounts and a
gain or loss is recognized.

Asset Retirement Obligations and Other Costs of Removal

The present value of the ultimate costs for an asset’s future retirement is recorded in the period
in which the liability is incurred. The costs are capitalized as part of the related long-lived
asset and depreciated over the asset’s useful life.

At December 31, 2008, the Company had no material liability for asset retirement obligations.

Interest Capitalized

Interest related to the construction of new facilities is capitalized in accordance with standard
interest capitalization requirements per FASB Statement No. 34, “Capitalization of Interest Cost.”

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles

The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. The determination of
whether impairment has occurred is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows
attributable to the assets, as compared with the carrying value of the assets. If an impairment
has occurred, the

II-394


NOTES (continued)

Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

amount of the impairment recognized is determined by estimating the fair value of the assets and
recording a loss if the carrying value is greater than the fair value. For assets identified as
held for sale, the carrying value is compared to the estimated fair value less the cost to sell in
order to determine if an impairment loss is required. Until the assets are disposed of, their
estimated fair value is re-evaluated when circumstances or events change.

Deferred Project Development Costs

The Company capitalizes project development costs once it is determined that it is probable that a
specific site will be acquired and a power plant constructed. These costs include professional
services, permits, and other costs directly related to the construction of a new project. These
costs are generally transferred to construction work in progress upon commencement of construction.
The total deferred project development costs were $8.9 million at December 31, 2008, $8.4 million
at December 31, 2007, and $1.3 million at December 31, 2006.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

For purposes of the financial statements, temporary cash investments are considered cash
equivalents. Temporary cash investments are securities with original maturities of 90 days or
less.

Materials and Supplies

Generally, materials and supplies include the average costs of generating plant materials.
Materials are charged to inventory when purchased and then expensed or capitalized to plant, as
appropriate, at weighted average cost when installed.

Fuel Inventory

Fuel inventory includes the cost of oil and emission allowances. The Company maintains minimal oil
levels for use at Plant Dahlberg, Plant Oleander, Plant DeSoto, and Plant Rowan. Inventory is
maintained using the weighted average cost method. Fuel inventory and emissions allowances are
recorded at actual cost when purchased and then expensed at weighted average cost as used.

Financial Instruments

The Company uses derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to fluctuations in interest
rates, the prices of certain fuel purchases, and electricity purchases and sales. All derivative
financial instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities (categorized in “Other” or
shown separately as “Risk Management Activities”) and are measured at fair value. See Note 8 for
additional information. Substantially all of the Company’s bulk energy purchases and sales
contracts that meet the definition of a derivative are exempt from fair value accounting
requirements and are accounted for under the accrual method. Other derivative contracts qualify as
cash flow hedges of anticipated transactions. This results in the deferral of related gains and
losses in other comprehensive income until the hedged transactions occur. Any ineffectiveness is
recognized currently in net income. Other derivative contracts are marked to market through
current period income and are recorded in the financial statement line item where they will
eventually settle. See Note 6 under “Financial Instruments” for additional information.

The Company does not offset fair value amounts recognized for multiple derivative instruments
executed with the same counterparty under a master netting arrangement. Additionally, the Company
had no outstanding collateral repayment obligations or rights to reclaim collateral arising from
derivative instruments recognized at December 31, 2008.

The Company is exposed to losses related to financial instruments in the event of counterparties’
nonperformance. The Company has established controls to determine and monitor the creditworthiness
of counterparties in order to mitigate the Company’s exposure to counterparty credit risk.

The Company’s financial instruments for which the carrying amounts did not equal fair value at
December 31 were as follows:

The fair values were based on either closing market prices (Level 1) or closing prices of
comparable instruments (Level 2). See Note 8 for all other items recognized at fair value in the
financial statements.

Comprehensive Income

The objective of comprehensive income is to report a measure of all changes in common stock equity
of an enterprise that result from transactions and other economic events of the period other than
transactions with owners. Comprehensive income consists of net income and changes in the fair
value of qualifying cash flow hedges, less income taxes and reclassifications of amounts included
in net income.

Other Income (Expense)

Other income (expense) includes non-operating revenues and expenses which are recognized when
earned. In 2008, the Company received a fee of $6.4 million for participating in an asset auction.
The Company was not the successful bidder in the asset auction.

2. ACQUISITIONS

Oleander Acquisition

In June 2005, the Company acquired all of the outstanding general and limited partnership interests
of Oleander from subsidiaries of Constellation Energy Group, Inc. The results of Oleander’s
operations have been included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements since that date.
The Company’s acquisition of the general and limited partnership interests in Oleander was pursuant
to a Purchase and Sale Agreement dated April 8, 2005, for an aggregate total cost of approximately
$218.1 million, including approximately $11.9 million of working capital and other adjustments. At
the time of acquisition, Plant Oleander, a dual-fueled generating plant in Brevard County, Florida,
had a nameplate capacity of 628 megawatts (MW). The Oleander acquisition was in accordance with
the Company’s overall growth strategy.

Subsequent to the acquisition, the Company completed construction of Plant Oleander Unit 5 in
December 2007. This unit is a combustion turbine with a nameplate capacity of 163 MW and is
contracted to provide annual capacity for a PPA with the Florida Municipal Power Agency from 2007
through 2027.

Desoto and Rowan Acquisitions

Effective June 1, 2006, the Company acquired all of the outstanding membership interests of DeSoto
County Generating Company, LLC (DeSoto) from a subsidiary of Progress Energy, Inc. The results of
DeSoto’s operations have been included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements since
that date. The Company’s acquisition of the membership interest in DeSoto was pursuant to an
agreement dated May 8, 2006, for an aggregate total cost of $79.7 million. DeSoto owns a
dual-fired generating plant near Arcadia, Florida with a nameplate capacity of 344 MW. The DeSoto
acquisition was in accordance with the Company’s overall growth strategy.

Effective September 1, 2006, the Company acquired all of the outstanding membership interests of
Rowan County Power, LLC (Rowan) from a subsidiary of Progress Energy, Inc. Rowan was merged into
the Company, and the results of Rowan’s operations have been included in the Company’s consolidated
financial statements since that date. The Company’s acquisition of the membership interests in
Rowan was pursuant to an agreement dated May 8, 2006 for an aggregate total cost of $329.5 million.
Through the Rowan acquisition, the Company owns a dual-fired generating plant near Salisbury,
North Carolina with a nameplate capacity of 986 MW. The Rowan acquisition was in accordance with
the Company’s overall growth strategy.

The pro forma data of the Company below is unaudited and gives effect to the DeSoto and Rowan plant
acquisitions as if they had occurred at January 1, 2006. The unaudited pro forma financial
information is not intended to represent or be indicative of the consolidated results of operations
or financial condition of the Company that would have been reported had the acquisitions been

3. CONTINGENCIES AND REGULATORY MATTERS

General Litigation Matters

The Company is subject to certain claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of
business. In addition, the Company’s business activities are subject to extensive governmental
regulation related to public health and the environment. Litigation over environmental issues and
claims of various types, including property damage, personal injury, common law nuisance, and
citizen enforcement of environmental requirements such as opacity and air and water quality
standards, has increased generally throughout the United States. In particular, personal injury
claims for damages caused by alleged exposure to hazardous materials have become more frequent.
The ultimate outcome of such pending or potential litigation against the Company and its
subsidiaries cannot be predicted at this time; however, for current proceedings not specifically
reported herein, management does not anticipate that the liabilities, if any, arising from such
current proceedings would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial statements.

FERC Matters

Market-Based Rate Authority

The Company has authorization from the FERC to sell power to non-affiliates, including short-term
opportunity sales, at market-based prices. Specific FERC approval must be obtained with respect to
a market-based contract with an affiliate.

In December 2004, the FERC initiated a proceeding to assess Southern Company’s generation dominance
within its retail service territory. The ability to charge market-based rates in other markets is
not an issue in the proceeding. Any new market-based rate sales by the Company in Southern
Company’s retail service territory entered into during a 15-month refund period that ended in May
2006 could be subject to refund to a cost-based rate level.

In November 2007, the presiding administrative law judge issued an initial decision regarding the
methodology to be used in the generation dominance tests. The proceedings are ongoing. The
ultimate outcome of this generation dominance proceeding cannot now be determined, but an adverse
decision by the FERC in a final order could require the Company to charge cost-based rates for
certain wholesale sales in the Southern Company retail service territory, which may be lower than
negotiated market-based rates, and could also result in total refunds of up to $0.7 million, plus
interest. The Company believes that there is no meritorious basis for an adverse decision in this
proceeding and is vigorously defending itself in this matter.

In June 2007, the FERC issued its final rule in Order No. 697 regarding market-based rate
authority. The FERC generally retained its current market-based rate standards. Responding to a
number of requests for rehearing, the FERC issued Order No. 697-A on April 21, 2008 and Order No.
697-B on December 12, 2008. These orders largely affirmed its prior revision and codification of
the regulations governing market-based rates for public utilities. In accordance with the orders,
Southern Company submitted to the FERC an updated market power analysis on September 2, 2008
related to its continued market-based rate authority. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot
now be determined.

On October 17, 2008, Southern Company filed with the FERC a revised market-based rate (MBR) tariff
and a new cost-based rate (CBR) tariff.   The revised MBR tariff provides for a “must offer” energy
auction whereby Southern Company offers all of its available energy for sale in a day-ahead auction
and an hour-ahead auction with reserve prices not to exceed the CBR tariff price, after considering
Southern Company’s native load requirements, reliability obligations, and sales commitments to
third parties. All sales under the energy auction would be at market clearing prices established
under the auction rules. The new CBR tariff provides for a cost-based price for wholesale sales of
less than a year. On December 18, 2008, the FERC issued an order conditionally accepting the MBR
tariff subject to certain revisions to the auction proposal. On January 21, 2009, Southern Company
made a compliance filing that accepted all the conditions of the MBR tariff order. When this order
becomes final, Southern Company will have 30 days to implement the wholesale auction. On December
31, 2008, the FERC issued an order conditionally accepting the CBR tariff subject to providing
additional information concerning one aspect of the tariff. On January 30, 2009, Southern Company
filed a response addressing the FERC inquiry to the CBR tariff order. Implementation of the energy
auction in accordance with the MBR tariff order is expected to adequately mitigate going forward
any presumption of market power that Southern Company may have in the Southern Company retail
service territory. The timing of when the FERC may issue the final orders on the MBR and CBR
tariffs and the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.

Intercompany Interchange Contract

The majority of the Company’s generation fleet is operated under the Intercompany Interchange
Contract (IIC), as approved by the FERC. In May 2005, the FERC initiated a new proceeding to
examine (1) the provisions of the IIC among the traditional operating companies, the Company, and
SCS, as agent, under the terms of which the Southern Pool is operated, (2) whether any parties to
the IIC have violated the FERC’s standards of conduct applicable to utility companies that are
transmission providers, and (3) whether Southern Company’s code of conduct defining the Company as
a “system company” rather than a “marketing affiliate” is just and reasonable. In connection with
the formation of the Company, the FERC authorized the Company’s inclusion in the IIC in 2000. The
FERC also previously approved Southern Company’s code of conduct.

In October 2006, the FERC issued an order accepting a settlement resolving the proceeding subject
to Southern Company’s agreement to accept certain modifications to the settlement’s terms and
Southern Company notified the FERC that it accepted the modifications. The modifications largely
involve functional separation and information restrictions related to marketing activities
conducted on behalf of the Company. In November 2006, Southern Company filed with the FERC a
compliance plan in connection with the order. In April 2007, the FERC approved, with certain
modifications, the plan submitted by Southern Company. In November 2007, Southern
Company notified the FERC that the plan had been implemented. On December 12, 2008 the FERC
division of audits issued its final audit report pertaining to compliance implementation and
related matters. No comments challenging the audit report’s findings were submitted. A decision is
now pending from the FERC. The Company’s cost of implementing the plan, including the
modifications, is approximately $7.0 million annually. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot
be determined at this time.

Carbon Dioxide Litigation

On February 26, 2008, the Native Village of Kivalina and the City of Kivalina filed a suit in the
U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against several electric utilities
(including Southern Company), several oil companies, and a coal company. The plaintiffs are the
governing bodies of an Inupiat village in Alaska. The plaintiffs contend that the village is being
destroyed by erosion allegedly caused by global warming that the plaintiffs attribute to emissions
of greenhouse gases by the defendants. The plaintiffs assert claims for public and private nuisance
and contend that the defendants have acted in concert and are therefore jointly and severally
liable for the plaintiffs’ damages. The suit seeks damages for lost property values and for the
cost of relocating the village, which is alleged to be $95 million to $400 million. On June 30,
2008, all defendants filed motions to dismiss this case. Southern Company believes that these
claims are without merit and notes that the complaint cites no statutory or regulatory basis for
the claims. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

4. JOINT OWNERSHIP AGREEMENTS

Plant Stanton A

The Company is a 65% owner of Plant Stanton A, a combined-cycle project with a nameplate capacity
of 630 MW. The unit is co-owned by OUC (28%), Florida Municipal Power Agency (3.5%), and Kissimmee
Utility Authority (3.5%). The Company has a service agreement with SCS whereby SCS is responsible
for the operation and maintenance of Plant Stanton A. As of December 31, 2008, $150.9 million was
recorded in plant in service with associated accumulated depreciation of $14.1 million. These
amounts represent the Company’s share of the total plant assets and each owner must provide its own
financing. The Company’s proportionate share of Plant Stanton A’s operating expense is included in
the corresponding operating expenses in the statements of income.

Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC)

In December 2005, the Company and OUC executed definitive agreements for development of a 285-MW
IGCC project in Orlando, Florida. The definitive agreements provided that the Company would own at
least 65% of the gasifier portion of the IGCC project. OUC would own the remainder of the gasifier
portion and 100% of the combined cycle portion of the IGCC project. The Company signed cooperative
agreements with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) that provided up to $293.75 million in grant
funding for the gasification portion of this project. The IGCC project was expected to begin
commercial operation in 2010. Due to continuing uncertainty surrounding potential state
regulations relating to greenhouse gas emissions, the Company and OUC mutually agreed to terminate
the construction of the gasifier portion of the IGCC project in November 2007. The Company has
continued construction of the gas-fired combined cycle generating facility for OUC. The Company
recorded a loss in the fourth quarter 2007 of approximately $17.6 million related to cancellation
of the gasifier portion of the IGCC project. This amount is net of reimbursements from OUC and the
DOE. This loss consists of the write-off of construction costs of $14.0 million and an accrual for
termination costs of $3.6 million.

II-398


NOTES (continued)

Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

All termination costs were paid in 2008. As part of the termination agreement with OUC, the
Company agreed to sell a tract of land in Orange County, Florida to OUC. The Company recorded a
gain of $6 million on this sale in 2008.

5. INCOME TAXES

Southern Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and combined tax returns for the
State of Georgia, the State of Alabama, and the State of Mississippi. Under a joint consolidated
income tax allocation agreement, each subsidiary’s current and deferred tax expense is computed on
a stand-alone basis, and no subsidiary is allocated more expense than would be paid if it filed a
separate income tax return. In accordance with Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regulations, each
company is jointly and severally liable for the tax liability.

Deferred tax liabilities are the result of property related timing differences. The transfer of
the Plant McIntosh construction project to GPC in 2004 resulted in a deferred gain for federal
income tax purposes. GPC is reimbursing the Company for the related tax liability balance of
$4.3 million. Of this total, $0.5 million is included in the balance sheets in “Receivables –
Affiliated companies” and the remainder is included in “Deferred Charges and Other Assets: Other –
Affiliated.”

Deferred tax assets consist primarily of timing differences related to the recognition of capacity
revenues, and the deferred loss on interest rate swaps reflected in other comprehensive income.
The transfer of Plants Dahlberg, Wansley, and Franklin to the Company from GPC in 2001 also
resulted in a deferred gain for federal income tax purposes. The Company will reimburse GPC for
the related

The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 created a tax deduction for a portion of income attributable
to U.S. production activities as defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, Section
199 (production activities deduction). The deduction is equal to a stated percentage of qualified
production activities net income. The percentage is phased in over the years 2005 through 2010
with a 3% rate applicable to the years 2005 and 2006, a 6% rate applicable for years 2007 through
2009, and a 9% rate thereafter. This increase from 3% in 2006 to 6% in 2007 was one of several
factors that increased the Company’s 2007 deduction by $1.2 million over the 2006 deduction. The
resulting additional tax benefit was $0.4 million. The IRS has not clearly defined a methodology
for calculating this deduction. However, Southern Company has agreed with the IRS on a calculation
methodology and signed a closing agreement on December 11, 2008. Therefore, the Company reversed
the unrecognized tax benefit and adjusted the deduction for all previous years to conform to the
agreement which resulted in a decrease in the 2008 deduction when compared to the 2007 deduction.
The net impact of the reversal of the unrecognized tax benefits combined with the application of
the new methodology had no material effect on the Company’s financial statements.

Unrecognized Tax Benefits

FIN 48 requires companies to determine whether it is “more likely than not” that a tax position
will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities before any part of the
benefit can be recorded in the financial statements. It also provides guidance on the recognition,
measurement, and classification of income tax uncertainties, along with any related interest and
penalties. For 2008, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits decreased $0.9 million,
resulting in a balance of $0.5 million as of December 31, 2008.

The Company classifies interest on tax uncertainties as interest expense. The Company did not

The IRS has audited and closed all tax returns prior to 2004. The audits for the state returns
have either been concluded, or the statute of limitations has expired, for years prior to 2002.

It is reasonably possible that the amount of the unrecognized benefit with respect to a majority of
the Company’s unrecognized tax positions will increase or decrease within the next 12 months. At
this time, an estimate of the range of reasonably possible outcomes cannot be determined.

6. FINANCING

Senior Notes

In 2008 and 2007, the Company did not issue any long-term debt securities. Long-term debt
outstanding was $1.3 billion at December 31, 2008 and 2007. The Company issued $200 million
aggregate principal amount of unsecured 30-year senior notes in 2006. The proceeds of the issuance
were used to repay a portion of the Company’s short-term indebtedness and for other general
corporate purposes, including the Company’s construction program.

Bank Credit Arrangements

The Company has a $400 million unsecured syndicated revolving credit facility (Facility) expiring
in July 2012. The purpose of the Facility is to provide liquidity support to the Company’s
commercial paper program and for other general corporate purposes. There were no borrowings
outstanding under the Facility at December 31, 2008. Outstanding borrowings under the Facility at
December 31, 2007 were $13.0 million.

The Company is required to pay a commitment fee on the unused balance of the Facility. This fee is
less than


/


of 1%. In 2008 and 2007, the Company incurred approximately
$0.4 million and $0.4 million, respectively, in expenses from commitment fees under the Facility.

During 2008, the Company borrowed under the Facility and also borrowed under uncommitted
facilities. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the peak balance outstanding was $95 million.
The average amount outstanding was $13.3 million in 2008. The average annual interest rate was
3.2%. At December 31, 2008, there were no outstanding balances.

The Facility contains a covenant that limits the ratio of debt to capitalization (each as defined
in the Facility) to a maximum of 65%. The Facility also contains a cross default provision that
would be triggered if the Company defaulted on other indebtedness above a specified threshold. As
of December 31, 2008, the Company was in compliance with all such covenants.

The Company has established a commercial paper program. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the
peak commercial paper balance outstanding was $103.2 million. The average amount outstanding was
$38.2 million in 2008. The average annual interest rate was 3.5%. At December 31, 2008, the
commercial paper program had no outstanding balances. The outstanding balance at December 31, 2007
was $36.7 million at a weighted average interest rate of 5.7%.

II-401


NOTES (continued)

Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

Dividend Restrictions

The Company can only pay dividends to Southern Company out of retained earnings or paid-in-capital.

The Facility and the indenture related to certain series of the Company’s senior notes also contain
certain limitations on the payment of common stock dividends. No dividends may be paid unless, as
of the end of any calendar quarter, the Company’s projected cash flows from fixed priced capacity
PPAs are at least 80% of total projected cash flows for the next 12 months or the Company’s debt to
capitalization ratio is no greater than 60%. At December 31, 2008, the Company was in compliance
with these ratios and had no other restrictions on its ability to pay dividends.

Financial Instruments

The Company enters into energy-related derivatives to hedge exposures to electricity, gas, and
other fuel price changes. The Company’s exposure to market volatility in commodity fuel prices and
prices of electricity is limited because its long-term sales contracts shift substantially all fuel
cost responsibility to the purchaser. However, the Company has been exposed to market volatility
in energy-related commodity prices as a result of sales of uncontracted generating capacity. At
December 31, 2008 and 2007, the net fair value of energy-related derivative contracts by hedge
designation was reflected in the financial statements as assets/(liabilities) as follows:

Gains and losses on energy-related derivative contracts that are not designated or fail to qualify
as hedges are recognized in the statements of income as incurred. Gains and losses on
energy-related derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are mainly used to hedge anticipated
purchases and sales and are initially deferred in other comprehensive income before being
recognized in income in the same period as the hedged transaction. The pre-tax gains/(losses)
reclassified from other comprehensive income to revenue and fuel expense were not material for any
period presented and are not expected to be material for 2009. Additionally, no material
ineffectiveness was recorded in earnings for any period presented. The Company has energy-related
hedges in place through 2010. At December 31, 2008, there were approximately $10.9 million of
deferred pre-tax realized net hedging gains relating to capitalized costs and revenues during the
construction of specific plants. This will be reclassified from other comprehensive income to
depreciation and amortization over the remaining life of the respective plants, which ranges from
approximately 25 to 31 years. For any year presented, the pre-tax gains reclassified from other
comprehensive income to depreciation and amortization have been immaterial.

At December 31, 2008, the Company had no interest derivatives outstanding. The Company has
deferred pre-tax realized losses totaling $53.1 million in other comprehensive income that will be
amortized to interest expense through 2016. For the years 2008, 2007, and 2006, approximately
$12.0 million, $13.3 million, and $12.0 million, respectively, of pre-tax losses were reclassified
from other comprehensive income to interest expense. During 2009, approximately $10.1 million of
pre-tax losses are expected to be reclassified from other comprehensive income to interest expense.

All derivative financial instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are
measured at fair value. See Note 8 for additional information.

7. COMMITMENTS

Expansion Program

The capital program of the Company is currently estimated to be $748.9 million for 2009, $658.9
million for 2010, and $768.6 million for 2011. These amounts include estimates for potential plant
acquisitions and new construction as well as ongoing capital improvements. Planned expenditures
for plant acquisitions may vary due to market opportunities and the Company’s ability to execute
its growth strategy. Actual construction costs may vary from these estimates because of changes in
factors such as: business conditions; environmental statutes and regulations; FERC rules and
regulations; load projections; the cost and efficiency of construction labor, equipment, and
materials; and the cost of capital.

Long-Term Service Agreements

The Company has entered into Long-Term Service Agreements (LTSAs) with General Electric and Siemens
AG for the purpose of securing maintenance support for its combined cycle and combustion turbine
generating facilities. In summary, the LTSAs provide that the vendors will perform all planned
inspections and certain unplanned maintenance on the covered equipment, which includes the cost of
all labor and materials.

Scheduled payments to the vendors, which are subject to price escalation, are made at various
intervals based on actual operating hours or number of gas turbine starts of the respective units.
Total remaining payments to the vendors under these agreements are currently estimated at $1.2
billion over the remaining term of the agreements, which may range up to 28 years. However, the
LTSAs contain various cancellation provisions at the Company’s and the applicable vendor’s option.
In the event of cancellation prior to scheduled work being performed, the Company is entitled to a
refund of amounts paid as calculated in accordance with termination provisions of the agreements.

Payments made to the vendors prior to the performance of any planned inspections or unplanned
maintenance are recorded as a prepayment in current assets or deferred charges and other assets on
the balance sheets and are recorded as payments pursuant to long-term service agreements in the
statement of cash flows. Inspection and maintenance costs are capitalized or charged to expense
based on the nature of the work when performed. These transactions are non-cash and are not
reflected in the statements of cash flows.

Fuel and Purchased Power Commitments

SCS, as agent for the traditional operating companies and the Company, has entered into various
fuel transportation and procurement agreements to supply a portion of the fuel (primarily natural
gas) requirements for the operating facilities. In most cases, these contracts contain provisions
for firm transportation costs, storage costs, minimum purchase levels, and other financial
commitments.

Natural gas purchase commitments contain given volumes with prices based on various indices at the
actual time of delivery; amounts included in the chart below represent estimates based on the New
York Mercantile Exchange future prices at December 31, 2008. Also, the Company has entered into
various long-term commitments for the purchase of electricity.

Total estimated minimum long-term obligations at December 31, 2008 were as follows:

During 2008, the Company entered into agreements to purchase 452 MW of power from three
counterparties. Approximately 352 MW of these commitment obligations will be used to serve the
Company’s requirements service customers. Another power purchase agreement for 100 MW will be
resold to EnergyUnited Electric Membership Corporation (EnergyUnited) at cost for the period 2012
through 2021. The purchase power commitments for the EnergyUnited agreement are $35.4 million in
2012, $36.1 million in 2013 and $316.1 million in 2014 and beyond.

In addition, the Company has entered into an agreement to purchase power of up to 200 MW at the
discretion of the counterparty for the period 2011 through 2018. There is no contractual capacity
payment required under this agreement. Additionally, for all amounts purchased under this
arrangement, the Company will pay the counterparty an amount per MW which approximates the
Company’s cost.

NOTES (continued)

Southern Power Company and Subsidiary Companies 2008 Annual Report

Acting as an agent for all of Southern Company’s traditional operating companies and the Company,
SCS may enter into various types of wholesale energy and natural gas contracts. Under these
agreements, each of the traditional operating companies and the Company may be jointly and
severally liable. The creditworthiness of the Company is currently inferior to the
creditworthiness of the traditional operating companies; therefore, Southern Company has entered
into keep-well agreements with each of the traditional operating companies to ensure they will not
subsidize nor be responsible for any costs, losses, liabilities, or damages resulting from the
inclusion of the Company as a contracting party under these agreements.

Operating Leases

The Company has operating lease agreements with various terms and expiration dates. Total
operating lease expenses were $0.5 million, $0.5 million, and $0.6 million for 2008, 2007, and
2006, respectively. The majority of the lease expense amounts and committed future expenditures are
with a joint owner of Plant Stanton Unit A.

At December 31, 2008, estimated minimum rental commitments for noncancelable operating leases were

8. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

On January 1, 2008, the Company adopted FASB Statement No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (SFAS
No. 157) which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and
requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements. The criterion that is set forth
in SFAS No. 157 is applicable to fair value measurement where it is permitted or required under
other accounting pronouncements.

SFAS No. 157 defines fair value as the exit price, which is the price that would be received to
sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on inputs of
observable and unobservable market data that a market participant would use in pricing the asset
or liability. The use of observable inputs is maximized where available and the use of
unobservable inputs is minimized for fair value measurement. As a means to illustrate the
inputs used, SFAS No. 157 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy that prioritizes inputs
to valuation techniques used for fair value measurement.

•

Level 1 consists of observable market data in an active market for identical assets
or liabilities.

•

Level 2 consists of observable market data, other than that included in Level 1, that
is either directly or indirectly observable.

•

Level 3 consists of unobservable market data. The input may reflect the assumptions
of the Company of what a market participant would use in pricing an asset or liability.
If there is little available market data, then the Company’s own assumptions are the
best available information. The need to use unobservable inputs would typically apply to
long-term energy-related derivative contracts and generally results from the nature of
the energy industry, as each participant forecasts its own power supply and demand and
those of other participants, which directly impact the valuation of each unique
contract.

In the case of multiple inputs being used in a fair value measurement, the lowest level input
that is significant to the fair value measurement represents the level in the fair value
hierarchy in which the fair value measurement is reported.

The adoption of SFAS No. 157 has not resulted in any significant changes to the methodologies
used for fair value measurement.

ITEM 11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

In this Compensation Discussion and Analysis (CD&A) and this Form 10-K, references to the
“Compensation Committee” are to the Compensation and Management Succession Committee of the Board
of Directors of Southern Company.

GUIDING PRINCIPLES AND POLICIES

Southern Company, through a single executive compensation program for all officers of its
subsidiaries, drives and rewards both Southern Company financial performance and individual
business unit performance.

This executive compensation program is based on a philosophy that total executive compensation must
be competitive with the companies in our industry, must be tied to and motivate our executives to
meet our short- and long-term performance goals, and must foster and encourage alignment of
executive interests with the interests of our stockholders and our customers. The program
generally is designed to motivate all employees, including executives, to achieve operational
excellence and financial goals while maintaining a safe work environment.

The executive compensation program places significant focus on rewarding performance. The program
is performance-based in several respects:

•

Southern Company’s actual earnings per share (EPS) and Gulf Power’s
business unit performance, which includes return on equity (ROE),
compared to target performance levels established early in the year,
determine the ultimate annual incentive payouts.

•

Southern Company common stock (Common Stock) price changes result in
higher or lower ultimate values of stock options.

•

Southern Company’s dividend payout and total shareholder return
compared to those of its industry peers lead to higher or lower
payouts under the Performance Dividend Program (performance
dividends).

In support of the performance-based pay philosophy, we have no general employment contracts with
our named executive officers or guaranteed severance, except upon a change-in-control, and no pay
is conditioned solely upon continued employment with any of the named executive officers, other
than base salary.

The pay-for-performance principles apply not only to the named executive officers, but to hundreds
of Gulf Power employees. The annual incentive program covers almost all of the approximately
1,300 Gulf Power employees and our change-in-control protection program covers all Gulf Power employees not part of a
collective bargaining unit. Stock options and performance dividends cover approximately 250 Gulf
Power employees. These programs engage our people in our business, which ultimately is good not
only for them, but for Gulf Power’s customers and Southern Company’s stockholders.

OVERVIEW OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION COMPONENTS

The executive compensation program is composed of several components, each of which plays a
different role. The table below discusses the intended role of each material pay component, what
it rewards, and why we use it. Following the table is additional information that describes how we
made 2008 pay decisions.

III-4


Intended Role and What the Element

Pay Element

Rewards

Why We Use the Element

Base Salary

Base salary is pay for competence
in the executive role, with a
focus on scope of
responsibilities.

Market practice.

Provides a threshold level of
cash compensation for job
performance.

Annual Incentive

Gulf Power’s annual incentive
program rewards achievement of
operational, EPS, and business
unit financial goals.

Market practice.

Focuses attention on
achievement of short-term goals that
ultimately work to fulfill our
mission to customers and lead to
increased stockholder value in the
long-term.

Long-Term
Incentive: Stock Options

Stock options reward price
increases in Common Stock over
the market price on the date of
grant, over a 10-year term.

Performance-based compensation.

Aligns executives’ interests
with those of Southern Company’s
stockholders.

Market practice.

Long-Term
Incentive:
Performance
Dividends

Performance dividends provide
cash compensation dependent on
the number of stock options held
at year end, Southern Company’s
declared dividends on the Common
Stock during the year, and
Southern Company’s four-year
total shareholder return versus
industry peers.

Performance-based compensation.

Enhances the value of stock
options and focuses executives on
maintaining a significant dividend
yield for Southern Company’s
stockholders.

Aligns executives’ interests
with Southern Company’s
stockholders’ interests since
payouts are dependent on
performance, defined as Common Stock
performance vs. industry peers.

Market practice.

Southern Excellence
Awards

An employee may receive
discretionary cash or non-cash
awards based on extraordinary
performance.

Awards are not tied to
pre-established goals.

Provides a means of rewarding, on a
current basis, extraordinary
performance.

Relocation Incentive

Lump sum payment of 10% of base
salary provides incentive to
geographically relocate.

Enhances the value of the relocation
program perquisite.

III-5


Intended Role and What the Element

Pay Element

Rewards

Why We Use the Element

Retirement Benefits

The Southern Company
Deferred Compensation Plan
(Deferred Compensation Plan)
provides the opportunity to defer
to future years all or part of
base salary and annual incentive
in either a prime interest rate
account or Common Stock account.

Executives participate in
employee benefit plans available
to all employees of Gulf Power,
including a 401(k) savings plan
and the funded Southern Company
Pension Plan (Pension Plan).

The Supplemental Benefit
Plan counts pay, including
deferred salary, ineligible to be
counted under the Pension Plan
and the 401(k) plan due to
Internal Revenue Service rules.

The Supplemental Executive
Retirement Plan counts short-term
incentive pay above 15% of base
salary for pension purposes.

Permitting compensation
deferral is a cost-effective method
of providing additional cash flow to
Gulf Power while enhancing the
retirement savings of executives.

The purpose of these
supplemental plans is to eliminate
the effect of tax limitations on the
payment of retirement benefits.

Represents an important
component of competitive
market-based compensation in
Southern Company’s peer group and
generally.

Perquisites and
Other Personal
Benefits

Personal financial planning
maximizes the perceived value of
our executive compensation
program to executives and allows
executives to focus on Gulf
Power’s operations.

Home security systems lower
the risk of harm to executives.

Club memberships are
provided primarily for business
use.

Relocation benefits cover the
costs associated with geographic
relocation at the request of the
employer.

Perquisites benefit both Gulf Power
and executives, at low cost to Gulf
Power.

Post-Termination Pay

Change-in-control plans provide
severance pay, accelerated
vesting, and payment of short-
and long-term incentive awards
upon a change-in-control of Gulf
Power or Southern Company coupled
with involuntary termination not
for “Cause” or a voluntary
termination for “Good Reason.”

Providing protections to
senior executives upon a
change-in-control minimizes
disruption during a pending or
anticipated change-in-control.

Payment and vesting occur only
in the event of both an
actual change-in-control and loss of
the executive’s position.

III-6


MARKET DATA

For the named executive officers, we review compensation data from large, publicly-owned electric
and gas utilities. The data was developed and analyzed by Towers Perrin, the compensation
consultant retained by the Compensation Committee. The companies included each year in the primary
peer group are those whose data is available through the consultant’s database. Those companies
are drawn from this list of regulated utilities of $2 billion in revenues and up. Proxy data for
the entire list of companies below also is used. No other companies’ data are used in our
market-pay benchmarking.

Southern Company is one of the largest U.S. utility companies in revenues and market
capitalization, and its largest business units are some of the largest in the industry as well.
For that reason, the consultant size-adjusts the market data in order to fit it to the scope of our
business.

In using this market data, market is defined as the size-adjusted 50th percentile of the data, with
a focus on pay opportunities at target performance (rather than actual plan payouts). Gulf Power
specifically looks at the market data for chief executive officer positions and other positions in
terms of scope of responsibilities that most closely resemble the positions held by the named
executive officers. Based on that data, Gulf Power establishes a total target compensation
opportunity for each named executive officer. Total target compensation opportunity is the sum of
base salary, annual incentive at the target performance level and stock option awards with
associated performance dividends at a target value. Actual compensation paid may be more or less
than the total target compensation opportunity based on actual performance above or below target
performance levels. As a result, the compensation program is designed to result in payouts that
are market-appropriate given Gulf Power’s performance for the year or period.

We did not target a specified weight for base salary or annual or long-term incentives as a
percentage of total target compensation opportunities, nor did amounts realized or realizable from
prior compensation serve to increase or decrease 2008 compensation amounts. Total target
compensation opportunities for senior management as a group are managed to be at the median of the
market for companies of our size and in our industry. The total target compensation opportunity
established in 2008 for each named executive officer is shown below.

As is our long-standing practice, the salary levels shown above were not effective before March
2008. For Mr. Raymond, the salary level shown was not effective until April 2008 when he assumed
his new position. Therefore, the amounts reported in the Summary Compensation Table are lower
because that table reports actual amounts paid in 2008. For purposes of comparing the value of our
compensation program to the market data, stock options were valued at 12%, and performance dividend
targets at 10%, of the average daily Common Stock price for the year preceding the grant, both of
which represented risk-adjusted present values on the date of grant and were consistent with the
methodologies used to develop the market data. For the 2008 grant of stock options and the
performance dividend targets established for the 2008 — 2011 performance period, this value was
$8.03 per stock option granted. In the long-term incentive column, approximately 55% of the value
shown is attributable to stock options and approximately 45% attributable to performance dividends.
The stock option value used for market data comparisons exceeds the value reported in the Grants
of Plan-Based Awards Table because the value above is calculated assuming that the options are held
for their full 10-year terms. The calculation of the Black-Scholes value reported in the Grants of
Plan-Based Awards Table uses historical holding period averages of approximately five years. The
value of stock options, with the associated performance dividends, declined from 2007. In 2007,
the value of the dividend equivalents was 10% of the value of the average daily Common Stock price
for the year preceding the grant as in 2009, but the value of the stock options was 15% rather than
12%. In 2007, the performance dividends represented 40% of the long-term incentive value and stock
options represented 60% of that value.

As discussed above, the Compensation Committee targets total target compensation opportunities for
executives as a group at market. Therefore, some executives may be paid somewhat above and others
somewhat below market. This practice allows for minor differentiation based on time in the
position, scope of responsibilities, and individual performance. The differences in the total pay
opportunities for each named executive officer are based almost exclusively on the differences
indicated by the market data for persons holding similar positions. Mr. Raymond’s total
compensation opportunity was lower than it would have been had he been in his current position for
the entire year. Because of the use of market data from a large number of peer companies for
positions that are not identical in terms of scope of responsibility from company to company, we
consider the total target opportunity to be at market if it is within a range of 90% to 110% of the
median of the market data. The average total target compensation opportunities for the named
executive officers for 2008 were within this range and therefore we continue to believe that our
compensation program is market-appropriate.

In 2008, the Compensation Committee received a detailed comparison of our executive benefits
program to the benefits of a group of other large utilities and general industry companies. The
results indicated that our overall executive benefits program was at market.

DESCRIPTION OF KEY COMPENSATION COMPONENTS

2008 Base Salary

The named executive officers are each within a position level with a base salary range that is
established under the direction of the Compensation Committee using the market data described
above. Also considered in recommending the specific base salary level for each named executive
officer is the need to retain an experienced team, internal equity, time in position, and
individual performance. This analysis of individual performance

III-8


included the degree of competence and initiative exhibited and the individual’s relative
contribution to the results of operations in prior years.

Base salaries for Ms. Terry and Messrs. Jacob and Raymond were recommended by Ms. Story, the Gulf
Power President and Chief Executive Officer, to Mr. David M. Ratcliffe, the Southern Company
President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. McCullough currently serves as an executive officer of
Gulf Power and of Southern Company’s generation business unit (Southern Company Generation). His
base salary was recommended by an Executive Vice President of Southern Company Generation, with
input from Ms. Story, to Mr. Thomas A. Fanning, the Southern Company Chief Operating Officer. Ms.
Story’s base salary was approved by Mr. Ratcliffe. Mr. Labrato’s base salary also was approved by
Mr. Ratcliffe following his transfer to SCS to lead Southern Company’s Internal Audit function
which reports to Mr. Ratcliffe.

The actual base salary levels set for each of the named executive officers were set within the
pre-established salary ranges.

2008 Incentive Compensation

Achieving Operational and Financial Goals — Our Guiding Principle for Incentive
Compensation

Our number one priority is to provide our customers outstanding reliability and superior service at
low prices while achieving a level of financial performance that benefits Southern Company’s
stockholders in the short and long term.

In 2008, we strove for and rewarded:

•

Continued industry-leading reliability and customer satisfaction,
while maintaining our low retail prices relative to the national
average; and

•

Meeting energy demand with the best economic and environmental choices.

In 2008, we also focused on and rewarded:

•

Southern Company EPS Growth;

•

Gulf Power ROE in the top quartile of comparable electric utilities;

III-9


•

Common Stock dividend growth;

•

Long-term, risk-adjusted Southern Company total shareholder return; and

•

Financial Integrity — an attractive risk-adjusted return, sound
financial policy, and a stable “A” credit rating.

The incentive compensation program is designed to encourage Gulf Power to achieve these goals.

The Southern Company Chief Executive Officer, with the assistance of Southern Company’s Human
Resources staff, recommends to the Compensation Committee program design and award amounts for
senior executives.

2008 Annual Incentive Program

Program Design

The Performance Pay Program is Southern Company’s annual incentive plan. Almost all employees of
Gulf Power are participants, including the named executive officers, for a total of over 1,300 Gulf
Power participants.

The performance measured by the program uses goals set at the beginning of each year by the
Compensation Committee.

An illustration of the annual incentive goal structure for 2008 is provided below.

•

Operational goals for 2008 were safety, customer service, plant
availability, transmission and distribution system reliability,
inclusion, and, for Southern Company Generation, net income. Each of
these operational goals is explained in more detail under “Goal
Details” below. The result of all operational goals is averaged and
multiplied by the bonus impact of the EPS and business unit financial
goals. The amount for each goal can range from 0.90 to 1.10 or can be
0.00 if a threshold performance level is not achieved as more fully
described below. The level of achievement for each operational goal
is determined and the results are averaged.

•

Southern Company EPS is weighted at 50% of the financial goals. EPS
is defined as earnings from continuing operations divided by average
shares outstanding during the year. The EPS performance measure is
applicable to all participants in the Performance Pay Program,
including the named executive officers.

III-10


•

Business unit financial performance is weighted at 50% of the
financial goals. Gulf Power’s financial performance goal is ROE,
which is defined as Gulf Power’s net income divided by average equity
for the year. For Southern Company Generation, it is calculated using
a corporate-wide weighted average of all the business unit financial
performance goals, including primarily the ROE of Gulf Power and
affiliated companies, Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi
Power. For Mr. McCullough, the business unit financial goal was
weighted 30% Gulf Power ROE and 20% Southern Company Generation
financial goal. The business unit financial goal for corporate-level
employees of SCS was
the Southern Company corporate-wide weighted average of all the
business unit financial goals. Because Messrs. Labrato and
Raymond were employed during 2008, by Gulf Power and SCS, and Alabama
Power and Gulf Power, respectively, the business unit financial goals
were pro-rated based upon the period of time spent with each
employing company.

The Compensation Committee may make adjustments, both positive and negative, to goal achievement
for purposes of determining payouts. Such adjustments include the impact of items considered one
time, outside of normal operations, or not anticipated in the business plan when the earnings goal
was established, and of sufficient magnitude to warrant recognition. The Compensation Committee
made an adjustment in 2008 to eliminate the effect of $83 million in after-tax charges to Southern
Company earnings taken in 2008. The charges related to a position Southern Company took concerning
the timing of tax deductions associated with sale-in-lease-out (SILO) transactions that were
challenged by the Internal Revenue Service. In making this decision, the Compensation Committee
considered that the charges only affected the timing of deductions taken by Southern Company
related to the SILO transactions, that the future tax benefits due to the timing change likely will
be minimal in future years and will likely have no impact on future Performance Pay Program award
sizes, and that the impact of the tax benefits in earlier years was minimal — an average of just
over two percent in 2002 through 2007. This adjustment increased the average payout for 2008
performance by approximately 30%.

Under the terms of the program, no payout can be made if Southern Company’s current earnings are
not sufficient to fund its Common Stock dividend at the same level or higher than the prior year.

Goal Details

Operational Goals:

Customer Service — Gulf Power uses customer satisfaction surveys to evaluate its performance. The
survey results provide an overall ranking for Gulf Power, as well as a ranking for each customer
segment: residential, commercial, and industrial.

Reliability — Transmission and distribution system reliability performance is measured by the
frequency and duration of outages. Performance targets for reliability are set internally based on
historical performance, expected weather conditions, and expected capital expenditures.

Availability — Peak season equivalent forced outage rate is an indicator of availability and
efficient generation fleet operations during the months when generation needs are greatest. The
rate is calculated by dividing the number of hours of forced outages by total generation hours.

Safety — Southern Company’s Target Zero program is focused on continuous improvement in having a
safe work environment. The performance is measured by the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration recordable incident rate.

Inclusion/Diversity — The inclusion program seeks to improve our inclusive workplace. This goal
includes measures for work environment (employee satisfaction survey), representation of minorities
and females in leadership roles, and supplier diversity.

Southern Company capital expenditures “gate” or threshold goal — Southern Company strived to manage
total capital expenditures, excluding nuclear fuel, for the participating business units at or
below $4.135 billion for 2008. If the capital expenditure target is exceeded, total operational
goal performance is capped at 0.90 for all business units, regardless of the actual operational
goal results. Adjustments to the goal may occur due to significant events not anticipated in
Southern Company’s business plan established early in 2008, such as acquisitions or disposition of
assets, new capital projects, and other events.

III-11


For Mr. McCullough, the operational goals were weighted 60% based on Gulf Power’s operational goals
and 40% based on Southern Company Generation’s operational goals. During 2008, Mr. Labrato was
employed by Gulf Power for a period of time and SCS for the remainder of the year. Mr. Raymond was
employed by Alabama Power for a period of time and Gulf Power for the remainder of the year. The
operational goals for Messrs. Labrato and Raymond were pro-rated based on the period of time spent
with each employing company.

The range of performance levels established for the operational goals are detailed below.

2008 Achievement

Each named executive officer had a target annual incentive opportunity, based on his or her
position, set by the Compensation Committee at the beginning of 2008. Targets are set as a
percentage of base salary. Ms. Story’s target was set at 60%. For Ms. Terry and Messrs. Jacob
and Labrato, it was set at 45%. For Mr. Raymond, it was initially set at 40% based on his former
position level and increased to 45% in April 2008 when he assumed his current position. For Mr.
McCullough, it was set at 40%. Actual payouts were determined by adding the payouts derived from
EPS and business unit financial performance goal achievement for 2008 and multiplying that sum by
the result of the operational goal achievement. The gate goal target was not exceeded and
therefore did not affect payouts. Actual 2008 goal achievement is shown in the following table.
The EPS result shown in the table is adjusted for the after-tax charges taken in 2008 as described
above. Therefore, payouts were determined using EPS performance results that differed from the
results reported in the financial statements of Southern Company in Item

III-12


8 herein. EPS, as determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and as
reported in the financial statements of Southern Company in Item 8 herein was $2.26 per share.

Note that the Total Payout Factor may vary from the Total Weighted Performance multiplied by the
operational goal multiplier due to rounding. To calculate the annual incentive payout amount, the
target opportunity (annual incentive target times base salary) is multiplied by the Total Payout
Factor.

Actual performance exceeded the target performance levels established by the Compensation Committee
in early 2008; therefore, the payout levels also exceeded the target pay opportunities that were
established. More information on how target pay opportunities are established is provided under
the section entitled Market Data in this CD&A.

Stock Options

Options to purchase Common Stock are granted annually and were granted in 2008 to the named
executive officers and about 250 other employees of Gulf Power. Options have a 10-year term, vest
over a three-year period, fully vest upon retirement or termination of employment following a
change-in-control, and expire at the earlier of five years from the date of retirement or the end
of the 10-year term.

Stock option award sizes for 2008 were calculated using guidelines set by the Compensation
Committee as a percentage of base salary as shown in the table below. The number of options
granted is the guideline amount divided by Southern Company’s average daily Common Stock price for
the 12 months preceding the grant. The guideline percentage was set by the Compensation Committee
to deliver target long-term incentive compensation assuming a stock option value, with associated
performance dividends, of approximately 25% of the Common Stock price. As discussed in the Market
Data section in this CD&A, in 2008 the target value of the stock options, with the

III-13


associated performance dividends, was only 22% of the Common Stock price. Therefore, while the
guideline as a percentage of salary was not increased for 2008 stock option awards, the target
value of long-term incentive compensation was less in 2008 than in 2007. ($8.03 per share in 2008
and $8.515 per share in 2007.)

More information about the option program is contained in the Grant of Plan Based Awards Table and
the information accompanying it.

Performance Dividends

All option holders, including the named executive officers, can receive performance-based dividend
equivalents on stock options held at the end of the year. Performance dividends can range from 0%
to 100% of the Common Stock dividend paid during the year per option held at the end of the year.
Actual payout will depend on Southern Company’s total shareholder return over a four-year
performance measurement period compared to a group of other electric and gas utility companies.
The peer group is determined at the beginning of each four-year performance-measurement period.
The peer group varies from the Market Data peer group due to the timing and criteria of the peer
selection process. The peer group for performance dividends is set by the Compensation Committee
at the beginning of the four-year performance-measurement period. However, despite these timing
differences, there is substantial overlap in the companies included.

Total shareholder return is calculated by measuring the ending value of a hypothetical $100
invested in each company’s common stock at the beginning of each of 16 quarters. In the final year
of the performance-measurement period, Southern Company’s ranking in the peer group is determined
at the end of each quarter and the percentile ranking is multiplied by the actual Common Stock
dividend paid in that quarter. To determine the total payout per stock option held at the end of
the performance-measurement period, the four quarterly amounts earned are added together.

No performance dividends are paid if Southern Company’s earnings are not sufficient to fund a
Common Stock dividend at least equal to that paid in the prior year.

2008 Payout

The peer group used to determine the 2008 payout for the 2005-2008 performance-measurement period
was made up of utilities with revenues of $2 billion or more with regulated revenues of 70% or
more. Those companies are listed below.

payout under the program. The amount paid is included in the Non-Equity Incentive Plan
Compensation column in the Summary Compensation Table.

2011 Opportunity

The peer group for the 2008-2011 performance-measurement period (which will be used to determine
the 2011 payout) is made up of utility companies with revenues of $1.2 billion or more with
regulated revenues of approximately 60% or more. Those companies are listed below.

The guideline used to establish the peer group for the 2005-2008 performance-measurement period was
somewhat different from that used in 2008 to establish the peer group for the 2008-2011
performance-measurement period. The guideline for inclusion in the peer group is reevaluated
annually as needed to assist in identifying an appropriate number of companies similar to Southern
Company. While the guideline does vary somewhat, 20 of the 24 companies in the peer group for the
2005-2008 performance-measurement period also are in the peer group established for the 2008-2011
performance-measurement period.

Southern Excellence Awards

The President and CEO of Gulf Power approved discretionary cash awards to Ms. Terry and Mr. Raymond
for their leadership of a special project during 2008.

Timing of Incentive Compensation

As discussed above, Southern Company EPS and Gulf Power’s financial performance goal for the 2008
annual incentive program were established at the February 2008 Compensation Committee meeting.
Annual stock option grants also were made at that meeting. The establishment of incentive
compensation goals and the granting of stock options were not timed with the release of non-public
material information. This procedure was consistent with prior practices. Stock option grants are
made to new hires or newly-eligible participants on preset, regular quarterly dates that were
approved by the Compensation Committee. The exercise price of options granted to employees in 2008
was the closing price of the Common Stock on the date of grant.

III-16


Post-Employment Compensation

As mentioned above, we provide certain post-employment compensation to employees, including the
named executive officers:

Retirement Benefits

Generally, all full-time employees of Gulf Power, including the named executive officers,
participate in our funded Pension Plan after completing one year of service. Normal retirement
benefits become payable when participants both attain age 65 and complete five years of
participation. We also provide unfunded benefits that count salary and annual incentive pay that
is ineligible to be counted under the Pension Plan. (These plans are the Supplemental Benefit Plan
and the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan that are mentioned in the chart on page III-29 of
this CD&A.) See the Pension Benefits Table and the information accompanying it for more
information about pension-related benefits.

Gulf Power also provides the Deferred Compensation Plan which is an unfunded plan that permits
participants to defer income as well as certain federal, state, and local taxes until a specified
date or their retirement, disability, death, or other separation from service. Up to 50% of base
salary and up to 100% of the annual incentive and performance dividends may be deferred, at the
election of eligible employees. All of the named executive officers are eligible to participate in
the Deferred Compensation Plan. See the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Table and the
information accompanying it for more information about the Deferred Compensation Plan.

Change-in-Control Protections

The Compensation Committee approved the change-in-control protection program in 1998. The program
provides some level of severance benefits to all employees who are not part of a collective
bargaining unit, if the conditions of the program are met, as described below. The Compensation
Committee established this program and the levels of severance amount in order to provide certain
compensatory protections to executives upon a change-in-control and thereby allow them to negotiate
aggressively with a prospective purchaser. Providing such protections to our employees in general
minimizes disruption during a pending or anticipated change-in-control. For all participants,
payment and vesting occur only upon the occurrence of both an actual change-in-control and loss of
the individual’s position.

Change-in-control protections, including severance pay and, in some situations, vesting or payment
of long-term incentive awards, are provided upon a change-in-control of Southern Company or Gulf
Power coupled with an involuntary termination not for “Cause” or a voluntary termination for “Good
Reason.” This means there is a “double trigger” before severance benefits are paid;

i.e.,

there
must be both a change-in-control and a termination of employment.

If the conditions described above are met, the named executive officers are entitled to severance
payments equal to two or three times their base salary plus the annual incentive amount assuming
target-level performance. Most officers, including Gulf Power’s named executive officers, are
entitled to severance payments equal to two times their base salary plus the annual incentive
amount assuming target-level performance. Ms. Story is entitled to the larger amount. These
amounts are consistent with that provided by other companies of our size and in our industry and
were established based on market-data provided to the Compensation Committee from its compensation
consultant.

More information about post-employment compensation, including severance arrangements under our
change-in-control program, is included in the section entitled Potential Payments upon Termination
or Change-in-Control.

Executive Stock Ownership Requirements

Effective January 1, 2006, the Compensation Committee adopted Common Stock ownership requirements
for officers of Southern Company and its subsidiaries that are in a position of Vice President or
above. All of the named executive officers are covered by the requirements. The guidelines were
implemented to further align the interest of officers and Southern Company’s stockholders by
promoting a long-term focus and long-term share ownership.

The types
of ownership arrangements counted toward the requirements are shares owned outright,
those held in Southern Company-sponsored plans, and Common Stock
accounts in the Deferred Compensation Plan and the Supplemental Benefit Plan. One-third of
vested Southern Company stock options may be counted, but if so, the ownership requirement is doubled.

The requirements are expressed as a multiple of base salary as per the table below.

Impact of Accounting and Tax Treatments on Compensation

None of the compensation paid to the Gulf Power’s employees, including the named executive
officers, is subject to the restrictions under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (Code).

Policy on Recovery of Awards

Southern Company’s 2006 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan provides that if Southern Company or
Gulf Power is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to material noncompliance as a
result of misconduct, and if an executive knowingly or grossly negligently engaged in or failed to
prevent the misconduct or is subject to automatic forfeiture under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002,
the executive will reimburse Gulf Power the amount of any payment in settlement of awards earned or
accrued during the 12-month period following the first public issuance or filing that was restated.

Southern Company Policy Regarding Hedging the Economic Risk of Stock Ownership

Southern Company’s policy is that insiders, including outside directors, will not trade in Southern
Company options on the options market and will not engage in short sales.

III-18


COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT

The Compensation Committee met with management to review and discuss the CD&A. Based on such
review and discussion, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Southern Company Board of
Directors that the CD&A be included in Gulf Power’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2008. The Southern Company Board of Directors approved that recommendation.

Mr. Raymond transferred from Alabama Power to become Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
of Gulf Power effective April 1, 2008.

***

Ms. Terry and Mr. McCullough became executive officers of Gulf Power in March 2007 and August
2007, respectively.

Column (d)

The amounts reported in this column are Southern Excellence Awards in the case of Ms. Terry and
Messrs. Labrato and Raymond in 2008. Also, included in 2008 and 2007 are relocation incentives
that are paid to employees who are promoted and relocate geographically, at the request of the
employer which is a lump sum payment equal to 10% of base salary. Mr. Raymond relocated in 2008
and both Ms. Terry and Mr. McCullough relocated in 2007.

Column (e)

No equity-based compensation has been awarded to the named executive officers, or any other
employees of Gulf Power, other than Stock Option Awards which are reported in column (f).

Column (f)

This column reports the dollar amounts recognized for financial statement reporting purposes with
respect to 2008 in accordance with FASB Statement No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment”
(SFAS No. 123R) disregarding any estimates of forfeitures relating to service-based vesting
conditions. See Note 8 to the financial statements of Gulf Power in Item 8 herein for a discussion
of the assumptions used in calculating these amounts.

For Messrs. Labrato and Jacob, the amounts shown equal the grant date fair value for the 2008
options granted in 2008, as reported in the Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table, because these named
executive officers have been retirement eligible for several years and therefore their options will
vest in full upon termination. Accordingly, under SFAS No. 123R, the full grant fair value of their
option awards is expensed in the year of grant. However, for Mss. Story and Terry and Messrs.
Raymond and McCullough, the amounts reported reflect the amounts expensed in 2008 attributable to
the following stock option grants made in 2008 and in prior years because each of these named
executive officers was not retirement eligible on the grant dates. Therefore, the grant date fair
value for options granted to Mss. Story and Terry and Messrs. Raymond and McCullough is recognized
over the shorter period of a) the vesting period of each option or b) the period to the date they
become retirement eligible. The grant date fair value for the grant made in 2008 is reported in
the Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table.

§

Column (h)

This column reports the aggregate change in the actuarial present value of each named executive
officer’s accumulated benefit under the Pension Plan and the supplemental pension plans
(collectively, Pension Benefits) during 2006, 2007 and 2008. The amount included for 2006 is the
difference between the actuarial present values of the Pension Benefits measured as of September
30, 2005 and September 30, 2006 and the 2007 amount is the difference in the actuarial present
values of the Pension Benefits measured as of September 30, 2006 and September 30, 2007. However,
the amount for 2008 is the difference between the actuarial values of the Pension Benefits measured
as of September 30, 2007 and December 31, 2008 — 15 months rather than one year. September 30 was
used as the measurement date prior to 2008, because it was the date as of which Southern Company
measured its retirement benefit obligations for accounting purposes. Starting in 2008, Southern
Company changed its measurement date to December 31 to comply with FASB Statement No. 158,
“Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
Other Postretirement Plans.” The Pension
Benefits as of each measurement date are based on the named executive officer’s age, pay, and
service accruals and the plan provisions applicable as of the measurement date. The actuarial
present values as of each measurement date reflect the assumptions Gulf Power selected for FASB
Statement No. 87, “Employers’ Accounting for Pensions” cost purposes as of that measurement date;
however, the named executive officers were assumed to remain employed
at Gulf Power or other Southern Company subsidiary until their
benefits commence at the pension plans’ stated normal retirement date, generally age 65. As a
result, the amounts in column (h) related to Pension Benefits represent the combined impact of
several factors—growth in the named executive officer’s Pension Benefits over the measurement year;
impact on the total present values of one year shorter discounting period due to the named
executive officer being one year closer to normal retirement; impact on the total present values
attributable to changes in assumptions from measurement date to measurement date; and impact on the
total present values attributable to plan changes between measurement dates.

The Pension Plans’ provisions were substantively the same as of September 30, 2005 and September
30, 2006. However, the present values of accumulated Pension Benefits as of September 30, 2007
reflect new provisions regarding the form and timing of payments from the supplemental pension
plans. These changes bring those plans into compliance with Section 409A of the Code. The key
change was to the form of payment. Instead of providing monthly payments for the lifetime of each
named executive officer and his/her spouse, these plans will pay the single sum value of those
benefits for an average lifetime in 10 annual installments. Calculations of the present value of
accumulated benefits calculations shown prior to September 30, 2007 reflect supplemental pension
benefits being paid monthly for the lifetimes of named executive officers and their spouses. The
2007 change in pension value reported in column (h) for each named executive officer is greater
than what it otherwise would have been due to the change in the form of payment.

For more information about the Pension Benefits and the assumptions used to calculate the actuarial
present value of accumulated benefits as of December 31, 2008, see the information following the
Pension Benefits Table. The key differences between assumptions used for the actuarial present
values of accumulated benefits calculations as of September 30, 2007 and December 31, 2008 follow:

§

Discount rate was increased to 6.75% as of December 31, 2008 from 6.3% as of September 30,
2007.

This column also reports above-market earnings on deferred compensation under the Deferred
Compensation Plan (DCP). There were no above-market earnings on deferred compensation in 2008.

Description of Perquisites

Personal Financial Planning

is provided for most officers of Gulf Power, including all of the named
executive officers. Gulf Power pays for the services of the financial planner on behalf of the
officers, up to a maximum amount of $8,700 per year, after the initial year that the benefit is
provided. In the initial year, the allowed amount is $15,000. The
employing company also provides a
five-year allowance of $6,000 for estate planning and tax return preparation fees.

Personal
Use of Company-Provided Club Memberships.

The employing company provides club memberships to certain
officers, including all of the named executive officers. The memberships are provided for business
use; however, personal use is permitted. The amount included reflects the pro-rata portion of the
membership fees paid by the employing company that are attributable to the named executive officers’ personal
use. Direct costs associated with any personal use, such as meals, are paid for or reimbursed by
the employee and therefore are not included.

III-22


Relocation Benefits.

These benefits are provided to cover the costs associated with geographic
relocation. In 2008, Messrs. Labrato, McCullough, and Raymond received relocation benefits in the
amounts of $113,373, $23,344 and $25,650, respectively.

Personal Use of Corporate-Owned Aircraft.

Southern Company owns aircraft that are used to
facilitate business travel. All flights on these aircraft must have a business purpose. Also, if
seating is available, Southern Company permits a spouse or other family member to accompany an
employee on a flight. However, because in such cases the aircraft is being used for a business
purpose, there is no incremental cost associated with the spousal travel and no amounts are
included for such travel. Any additional expenses incurred that are related to spousal travel are
included.

For Mr. McCullough, $31,708 of the $62,074 in 2008 represents the incremental cost of use of
corporate-owned aircraft for relocation purposes. Mr. McCullough relocated from Athens, Georgia to
Pensacola, Florida and was permitted to travel to and from his home in Athens for a period of time
in late 2007 through early 2008. For Mr. Raymond, $1,232 of $30,014 in 2008 represents the
incremental cost of use of corporate-owned aircraft for relocation
purposes. Mr. Raymond is relocating from
Birmingham, Alabama to Pensacola, Florida. The incremental costs reported are the fuel costs for
relocation flights plus any incidental costs incurred, such as associated hotel and meal expenses
for pilots.

Home Security Systems.

Gulf Power pays for the services of third-party providers for the
installation, maintenance, and monitoring of Ms. Story’s home security system.

Other Miscellaneous Perquisites.

The amount included reflects the full cost to Gulf Power of
providing the following items: personal use of company provided tickets for sporting and other
entertainment events, and gifts distributed to and activities
provided to attendees at company-sponsored events.

GRANTS OF PLAN-BASED AWARDS MADE IN 2008

The Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table provides information on stock option grants made and goals
established for future payouts under Gulf Power’s incentive compensation programs during 2008 by
the Compensation Committee. In this table, the annual incentive and the performance dividend
payouts are referred to as PPP and PDP, respectively.

Columns (c), (d), and (e)

The amounts reported as PPP reflect the amounts established by the Compensation Committee in early
2008 to be paid for certain levels of performance as of December 31, 2008 under the annual
incentive program. The Compensation Committee assigns
each named executive officer a target incentive opportunity, expressed as a percentage of base
salary, that is paid for target-level performance under the annual incentive program. The target
incentive opportunities established for the named executive officers for 2008 performance were 60%
for Ms. Story, 45% for Ms. Terry and Messrs. Labrato, Jacob, and Raymond, and 40% for Mr.
McCullough. Due to a change in job assignment in 2008, the target incentive opportunity for Mr.
Raymond was 40% for a portion of 2008. The payout for threshold performance was set at 0.45 times
the target incentive opportunity and the maximum amount payable was set at 2.20 times the target.
The amount paid to each named executive officer under the annual incentive program for actual 2008
performance is included in the Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation column in the Summary
Compensation Table and is itemized in the notes following that table. More information about the
annual incentive program, including the applicable performance criteria established by the
Compensation Committee, is provided in the CD&A.

Southern
Company also has a long-term incentive program, the performance dividend program, that
has been adopted by Gulf Power and SCS. It pays
performance-based dividend equivalents based on Southern Company’s total shareholder return (TSR)
compared with the TSR of its peer companies over a four-year performance-measurement period. The
Compensation Committee establishes the level of payout for prescribed levels of performance over
the performance-measurement period.

In February 2008, the Compensation Committee established the performance dividend program goal for
the four-year performance-measurement period beginning on January 1, 2008 and ending on December
31, 2011. The amount earned in 2011 based on the performance for 2008-2011 will be paid following
the end of the period. However, no amount is earned and paid unless the Compensation Committee
approves the payment at the beginning of the final year of the performance-measurement period.
Also, nothing is earned unless Southern Company’s earnings are sufficient to fund a Common Stock
dividend at least equal to that paid in the prior year.

The performance dividend program pays to all option holders a percentage of the Common Stock
dividend paid to Southern Company’s stockholders in the last year of the performance-measurement
period. It can range from approximately five percent for performance above the 10th percentile
compared with the performance of the peer companies to 100% of the dividend if Southern Company’s
TSR is at or above the 90th percentile. That amount is then paid per option held at the end of the
four-year period. The amount, if any, ultimately paid to the option holders, including the named
executive officers, at the end of the last year of the 2008-2011 performance-measurement period
will be based on (1) Southern Company’s TSR compared to that of its peer companies as of December
31, 2011, (2) the actual dividend paid in 2011 to Southern Company’s stockholders, if any, and (3)
the number of options held by the named executive officers on December 31, 2011.

The number of options held on December 31, 2011 will be affected by the number of additional
options granted to the named executive officers prior to December 31, 2011, if any, and the number
of options exercised by the named executive officers prior to December 31, 2011, if any. None of
these components necessary to calculate the range of payout under the performance dividend program
for the 2008-2011 performance-measurement period is known at the time the goal is established.

The amounts reported as PDP in columns (c), (d), and (e) were calculated based on the number of
options held by the named executive officers on December 31, 2008, as reported in columns (b) and
(c) of the Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End Table and the Common Stock dividend of
$1.6625 per share paid to Southern Company’s stockholders in 2008. These factors are itemized
below.

The named executive officers earn employer-paid pension benefits from three integrated retirement
plans. More information about pension benefits is provided in the CD&A.

The Pension Plan

The Pension Plan is a tax-qualified, funded plan. It is Southern Company’s primary retirement
plan. Generally, all full-time employees participate in this plan after one year of service.
Normal retirement benefits become payable when participants both attain age 65 and complete five
years of participation. The plan benefit equals the greater of amounts computed using a “1.7%
offset formula” and a “1.25% formula,” as described below. Benefits are limited to a statutory
maximum.

The 1.7% offset formula amount equals 1.7% of final average pay times years of participation less
an offset related to Social Security benefits. The offset equals a service ratio times 50% of the
anticipated Social Security benefits in excess of $4,200. The service ratio adjusts the offset for
the portion of a full career that a participant has worked. The highest three rates of pay out of a
participant’s last 10 calendar years of service are averaged to derive final average pay. The pay
considered for this formula is the base rate of pay reduced for any voluntary deferrals. A
statutory limit restricts the amount considered each year; the limit for 2008 was $230,000.

The 1.25% formula amount equals 1.25% of final average pay times years of participation. For this
formula, the final average pay computation is the same as above, but annual cash incentives paid
during each year are added to the base rates of pay.

Early retirement benefits become payable once plan participants have during employment both
attained age 50 and completed 10 years of participation. Participants who retire early from active
service receive benefits equal to the amounts computed using the same formulas employed at normal
retirement. However, a 0.3% reduction applies for each month (3.6% for each year) prior to normal
retirement that participants elect to have their benefit payments commence. For example, 64% of
the formula benefits are payable starting at age 55. As of December 31, 2008, only Messrs. Labrato
and Jacob were eligible to retire immediately.

The Pension Plan’s benefit formulas produce amounts payable monthly over a participant’s
post-retirement lifetime. At retirement, plan participants can choose to receive their benefits in
one of seven alternative forms of payment. All forms pay benefits monthly over the lifetime of the
retiree or the joint lifetimes of the retiree and a spouse. A reduction applies if a retiring
participant chooses a payment form other than a single life annuity. The reduction makes the value
of the benefits paid in the form chosen comparable to what it would have been if benefits were paid
as a single life annuity over the retiree’s life.

Participants vest in the Pension Plan after completing five years of service. All the named
executive officers are vested in their Pension Plan benefits. Participants who terminate
employment after vesting can elect to have their pension benefits commencing at age 50 if they
participated in the Pension Plan for 10 years. If such an election is made, the early retirement
reductions that apply are actuarially determined factors and are larger than 0.3% per month.

If a participant dies while actively employed, benefits will be paid to a surviving spouse. A
survivor’s benefit equals 45% of the monthly benefit that the participant had earned before his or
her death. Payments to a surviving spouse of a participant who could have retired will begin
immediately. Payments to a survivor of a participant who was not retirement eligible will begin
when the deceased participant would have attained age 50. After commencing, survivor benefits are
payable monthly for the remainder of a survivor’s life. Participants who are eligible for early
retirement may opt to have an 80% survivor benefit paid if they die; however, there is a charge
associated with this election.

If participants become totally disabled, periods that Social Security or employer provided
disability income benefits are paid will count as service for benefit calculation purposes. The
crediting of this additional service ceases at the point a disabled participant elects to commence
retirement payments. Outside of the extra service crediting, the normal plan provisions apply to
disabled participants.

III-28


The Southern Company Supplemental Benefit Plan (Pension-Related) (SBP-P)

The SBP-P is an unfunded retirement plan that is not tax qualified. This plan provides to
high-paid employees any benefits that the Pension Plan cannot pay due to statutory pay/benefit
limits and voluntary pay deferrals. The SBP-P’s vesting, early retirement, and disability
provisions mirror those of the Pension Plan.

The amounts paid by the SBP-P are based on the additional monthly benefit that the Pension Plan
would pay if the statutory limits and pay deferrals were ignored. When an SBP-P participant
separates from service, vested monthly benefits provided by the benefit formulas are converted into
a single sum value. It equals the present value of what would have been paid monthly for an
actuarially determined average post-retirement lifetime. The discount rate used in the calculation
is based on the 30-year Treasury yields for the September preceding the calendar year of
separation, but not more than six percent. Vested participants terminating prior to becoming
eligible to retire will be paid their single sum value as of September 1 following the calendar
year of separation. If the terminating participant is retirement eligible, the single sum value
will be paid in 10 annual installments starting shortly after separation. The unpaid balance of a
retiree’s single sum will be credited with interest at the prime rate published in The Wall Street
Journal. If the separating participant is a “key man” under Section 409A of the Code, the first
installment will be delayed for six months after the date of separation.

If an SBP-P participant dies after becoming vested in the Pension Plan, the spouse of the deceased
participant will receive the installments the participant would have been paid upon retirement. If
a vested participant’s death occurs prior to age 50, the installments will be paid to a survivor as
if the participant had survived to age 50.

The Southern Company Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP)

The SERP also is an unfunded retirement plan that is not tax qualified. This plan provides to high
paid employees additional benefits that the Pension Plan and the SBP-P would pay if the 1.7% offset
formula calculations reflected a portion of annual cash incentives. To derive the SERP benefits, a
final average pay is determined reflecting participants’ base rates of pay and their incentives to
the extent they exceed 15% of those base rates (ignoring statutory limits and pay deferrals). This
final average pay is used in the 1.7% offset formula to derive a gross benefit. The Pension Plan
and the SBP-P benefits are subtracted from the gross benefit to calculate the SERP benefit. The
SERP’s early retirement, survivor benefit, and disability provisions mirror the SBP-P’s provisions.
However, except upon a change-in-control, SERP benefits do not vest until participants retire, so
no benefits are paid if a participant terminates prior to becoming eligible to retire. More
information about vesting and payment of SERP benefits following a change-in-control is included in
the section entitled Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change-in-Control.

The following assumptions were used in the present value calculations:

o

Unmarried retirees: 100% elect a single life annuity

o

Married retirees: 20% elect a single life annuity; 40% elect a joint and 50%
survivor annuity; and 40% elect a joint and 100% survivor annuity

•

Percent married at retirement — 80% of males and 70% of females

•

Spouse ages — Wives two years younger than their husbands

•

Incentives earned but unpaid as of the measurement date — 135% of target percentages times
base rate of pay for year incentive is earned.

•

Installment determination—4.75% discount rate for single sum calculation and 6.75% prime
rate during installment payment period

III-29


For all of the named executive officers, the number of years of credited service is one year less
than the number of years of employment.

Southern Company provides the DCP which is designed to permit participants to defer income as well
as certain federal, state, and local taxes until a specified date or their retirement, or other
separation from service. Up to 50% of base salary and up to 100% of the annual incentive and
performance dividends may be deferred, at the election of eligible employees. All of the named
executive officers are eligible to participate in the DCP.

Participants have two options for the deemed investments of the amounts deferred — the Stock
Equivalent Account and the Prime Equivalent Account. Under the terms of the DCP, participants are
permitted to transfer between investments at any time.

The amounts deferred in the Stock Equivalent Account are treated as if invested at an equivalent
rate of return to that of an actual investment in Common Stock, including the crediting of dividend
equivalents as such are paid by Southern Company from time to time. It provides participants with
an equivalent opportunity for the capital appreciation (or loss) and income held by a Southern
Company stockholder. During 2008, the rate of return in the Stock Equivalent Account was 0.03%,
which was Southern Company’s TSR for 2008.

Alternatively, participants may elect to have their deferred compensation deemed invested in the
Prime Equivalent Account which is treated as if invested at a prime interest rate compounded
monthly, as published in the

Wall Street Journal

as the base rate on corporate loans posted as of
the last business day of each month by at least 75% of the United States’ largest banks. The range
of interest rates earned on amounts deferred during 2008 in the Prime Equivalent Account was 3.25%
to 6.0%.

Column (b)

This column reports the actual amounts of compensation deferred under the DCP by each named
executive officer in 2008. The amount of salary deferred by the named executive officers, if any,
is included in the Salary column in the Summary Compensation Table. The amount of incentive
compensation deferred in 2008 was the amount paid for performance under the annual incentive
program and the performance dividend program that were earned as of December 31, 2007 but not
payable until the first quarter of 2008. This amount is not reflected in the Summary Compensation
Table because that table reports incentive compensation that was earned in 2008, but not payable
until early 2009. These deferred amounts may be distributed in a lump sum or in up to 10 annual
installments at termination of employment or in a lump sum at a specified date, at the election of
the participant.

III-30


Column (c)

This column reflects contributions under the SBP. Under the Code, employer matching contributions
are prohibited under the ESP on employee contributions above stated limits in the ESP, and, if
applicable, above legal limits set forth in the Code. The SBP is a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan under which contributions are made that are prohibited from being made in the
ESP. The contributions are treated as if invested in Common Stock and are payable in cash upon
termination of employment in a lump sum or in up to 20 annual installments, at the election of the
participant. The amounts reported in this column were also reported in the All Other Compensation
column in the Summary Compensation Table.

Column (d)

This column reports earnings on both compensation the named executive officers elected to defer and
earnings on employer contributions under the SBP. See the notes to column (h) of the Summary
Compensation Table for a discussion of amounts of nonqualified deferred compensation earnings
included in the Summary Compensation Table.

Column (f)

This column includes amounts that were deferred under the DCP and contributions under the SBP in
prior years and reported in Gulf Power’s prior years’ Information Statements or Annual Reports on

POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE-IN-CONTROL

This section describes and estimates payments that could be made to the named executive officers
under different termination and change-in-control events. The estimated payments would be made
under the terms of Southern Company’s compensation and benefits programs or the change-in-control
severance program. All of the named executive officers are participants in Southern Company’s
change-in-control severance plan for officers. (As described in the CD&A, all employees not part of
a collective bargaining unit are participants in a change-in-control severance plan.) The amount
of potential payments is calculated as if the triggering events occurred as of December 31, 2008
and assumes that the price of Common Stock is the closing market price on December 31, 2008.

Description of Termination and Change-in-Control Events

The following charts list different types of termination and change-in-control events that can
affect the treatment of payments under the compensation and benefit programs. These events also
affect payments to the named executive officers under their change-in-control severance agreements.
No payments are made under the severance

III-31


agreements unless, within two years of the change-in-control, the named executive officer is
involuntarily terminated or he or she voluntarily terminates for Good Reason. (See the description
of Good Reason below.)

Traditional Termination Events

Change-in-Control-Related Events

At the Southern Company or Gulf Power level:

•

Southern Company Change-in-Control I – Acquisition by another entity of 20% or more of
Common Stock, or following a merger with another entity Southern Company’s stockholders own
65% or less of the entity surviving the merger.

•

Southern Company Change-in-Control II – Acquisition by another entity of 35% or more of
Common Stock, or following a merger with another entity Gulf Power’s stockholders own less
than 50% of Gulf Power surviving the merger.

•

Southern Company Termination – A merger or other event and Southern Company is not the
surviving company or the Common Stock is no longer publicly traded.

•

Gulf Power Change-in-Control – Acquisition by another entity, other than another subsidiary
of Southern Company, of 50% or more of the stock of Gulf Power, a merger with another entity
and Gulf Power is not the surviving company, or the sale of substantially all the assets of
Gulf Power.

At the employee level:

•

Involuntary Change-in-Control Termination or Voluntary Change-in-Control Termination for
Good Reason – Employment is terminated within two years of a change-in-control, other than for
cause, or the employee voluntarily terminates for Good Reason. Good Reason for voluntary
termination within two years of a change-in-control is generally satisfied when there is a
material reduction in salary, incentive compensation opportunity or benefits, relocation of
over 50 miles, or a diminution in duties and responsibilities.

Potential Payments

This section describes and estimates payments that would become payable to the named executive
officers upon a termination or change-in-control as of December 31, 2008.

Pension Benefits

The amounts that would have become payable to the named executive officers if the Traditional
Termination Events occurred as of December 31, 2008 under the Pension Plan, the SBP-P, and the SERP
are itemized in the chart below. The amounts shown under the column Retirement are amounts that
would have become payable to the named executive officers that were retirement eligible on December
31, 2008 and are the monthly Pension Plan benefits and the first of 10 annual installments from the
SBP-P and the SERP. The amounts shown under the column Resignation or Involuntary Termination are
the amounts that would have become payable to the named executive officers who were not retirement
eligible on December 31, 2008 and are the monthly Pension Plan benefits that would become payable
as of the earliest possible date under the Pension Plan and the single sum value of benefits earned
up to the termination date under the SBP-P, paid as a single payment rather than in 10 annual
installments. Benefits under the SERP would be forfeited. The amounts shown that are payable to a
spouse in the event of the death of the named executive officer are the monthly amounts payable to
a spouse under the Pension Plan and the first of 10 annual installments from the SBP-P and the
SERP. The amounts in this chart are very different from the pension values shown in the Summary
Compensation Table and the Pension Benefits Table. Those tables show the present values of all the
benefits amounts anticipated to be paid over the lifetimes of the named executive officers and
their spouses. Those plans are described in the notes following the Pension Benefits Table. Of the
named executive officers, only Messrs. Labrato and Jacob were retirement eligible on December 31,
2008.

As described in the Change-in-Control Chart, the only change in the form of payment, acceleration,
or enhancement of the pension benefits is that the single sum value of benefits earned up to the
change-in-control date under the SBP-P and the SERP could be paid as a single payment rather than
in 10 annual installments. Also, the SERP benefits vest for participants who are not retirement
eligible upon a change-in-control. Estimates of the single sum payment that would have been made
to the named executive officers, assuming termination as of December 31, 2008 following a
change-in-control event, other than a Southern Company Change-in-Control I (which does not impact
how pension benefits are paid), are itemized below. These amounts would be paid instead of the
benefits shown in the Traditional Termination Events chart above; they are not paid in addition to
those amounts.

The pension benefit amounts in the tables above were calculated as of December 31, 2008 assuming
payments would begin as soon as possible under the terms of the plans. Accordingly, appropriate
early retirement reductions were applied. Any unpaid incentives were assumed to be paid at 1.35
times the target level. Pension Plan benefits were calculated assuming each named executive
officer chose a single life annuity form of payment, because that results in the greatest monthly
benefit. The single sum values of the SBP-P and the SERP benefits were based on a 4.75% discount
rate as prescribed by the terms of the plan.

III-36


Annual Incentive

Because this section assumes that a termination or change-in-control event occurred on December 31,
2008, there is no amount that would be payable other than what was reported and described in the
Summary Compensation Table because actual performance in 2008 exceeded target performance.

Performance Dividends

Because the assumed termination date is December 31, 2008, there is no additional amount that would
be payable other than what was reported in the Summary Compensation Table. As described in the
Traditional Termination Events chart, there is some continuation of benefits under the performance
dividend program for retirees.

However, under the Change-in-Control-Related Events, performance dividends are payable at the
greater of target performance or actual performance. For the 2005-2008 performance-measurement
period, actual performance was better than target performance.

Stock Options

Stock Options would be treated as described in the Termination and Change-in-Control charts above.
Under a Southern Company Termination, all stock options vest. In addition, if there is an
Involuntary Change-in-Control Termination or Voluntary Change-in-Control Termination for Good
Reason, stock options vest. There is no payment associated with stock options unless there is a
Southern Company Termination and the participants’ stock options cannot be converted into surviving
company stock options. In that event, the excess of the exercise price and the closing price of
the Common Stock on December 31, 2008 would be paid in cash for all stock options held by the named
executive officers. The chart below shows the number of stock options for which vesting would be
accelerated under a Southern Company Termination and the amount that would be payable under a
Southern Company Termination if there were no conversion to the surviving company’s stock options.

DCP and SBP

The aggregate balances reported in the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Table would be payable to
the named executive officers as described in the Traditional Termination and
Change-in-Control-Related Events charts above. There is no enhancement or acceleration of payments
under these plans associated with termination or change-in-control events, other than the lump-sum
payment opportunity described in the above charts. The lump sums that would be payable are those
that are reported in the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Table.

Health Benefits

Messrs. Labrato and Jacob are retirement eligible and health care benefits are provided to
retirees, and there is no incremental payment associated with the termination or change-in-control
events. At the end of 2008, Mss. Story and Terry and Messrs. McCullough and Raymond were not
retirement eligible and thus health care benefits would not become available until each reaches age
50, except in the case of a change-in-control-related termination, as described in the
Change-in-Control-Related Events chart. The estimated cost of providing three years of group
health insurance premiums for Ms. Story is $13,998 and two years for Ms. Terry is $8,925 and
$20,227 each for Messrs. McCullough and Raymond.

Financial Planning Perquisite

Since Messrs. Labrato and Jacob are retirement eligible, an additional year of the Financial
Planning perquisite, which is set at a maximum of $8,700 per year, will be provided after
retirement. Mss. Story and Terry and Messrs. McCullough and Raymond are not retirement eligible.

There are no other perquisites provided to the named executive officers under any of the
traditional termination or change-in-control-related events.

Severance Benefits

The named executive officers are participants in a change-in-control severance plan. In addition
to the treatment of health benefits, the annual incentive program, and the performance dividend
program described above, the named executive officers are entitled to a severance benefit,
including outplacement services, if within two years of a change-in-control, they an involuntarily
terminated, not for Cause, or they voluntarily terminate for Good Reason. The severance benefits
are not paid unless the named executive officer releases the
employing company from any claims he or she may
have against the employing company.

The estimated cost of providing the six months of outplacement services is $6,000 per named
executive officer. The severance payment is three times the base salary and target payout under
the annual incentive program for Ms. Story and two times the base salary and target payout under
the annual incentive program for the other named executive officers. If any portion of the
severance payment is an “excess parachute payment” as
defined under Section 280G of the Code, the employing company will pay the named executive officer an additional amount to cover the taxes that would be
due on the excess parachute payment — a “tax gross-up.” However, that additional amount will not
be paid unless the severance amount plus all other amounts that are considered parachute payments
under the Code exceed 110% of the severance payment.

III-38


The table below estimates the severance payments that would be made to the named executive officers
if they were terminated as of December 31, 2008 in connection with a change-in-control. There is
no estimated tax gross-up included for any of the named executive officers because their respective
estimated severance amounts payable are below the amounts considered excess parachute payments
under the Code.

ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE.

Transactions with Related Persons.

In 2008, Gulf Power paid $120,042 to Baskerville-Donovan, Inc. for architectural and
design services. Mr. Donovan, a director of Gulf Power, is the chairman and chief executive officer of Baskerville-Donovan, Inc.

Review, Approval or Ratification of Transactions with Related Persons.

Gulf Power does not have a written policy pertaining solely to the approval or ratification of
“related party transactions.” Southern Company has a Code of Ethics as well as a Contract Guidance
Manual and other formal written procurement policies and procedures that guide the purchase of
goods and services, including requiring competitive bids for most transactions above $10,000 or
approval based on documented business needs for sole sourcing arrangements.

III-42


Promoters and Certain Control Persons.

None.

Director Independence.

The board of directors of Gulf Power consists of five non-employee directors (Messrs.
C. LeDon Anchors, William C. Cramer, Jr., Fred C. Donovan, Sr., William A. Pullum, and Winston E.
Scott) and Ms. Story, the president and chief executive officer of Gulf Power.

Southern Company owns all of Gulf Power’s outstanding common stock, which represents a substantial
majority of the overall voting power of Gulf Power’s equity securities, and Gulf Power has listed
only debt securities on the NYSE. Accordingly, under the rules of the NYSE, Gulf Power is exempt
from most of the NYSE’s listing standards relating to corporate governance, including requirements
relating to certain board committees. Gulf Power has voluntarily complied with certain of the
NYSE’s listing standards relating to corporate governance where such compliance was deemed to be in
the best interests of Gulf Power’s shareholders.
