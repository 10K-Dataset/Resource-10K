                                     PART I


Item 1.  BUSINESS

    SOUTHERN  was  incorporated  under the laws of Delaware on November 9, 1945.
SOUTHERN  is  domesticated  under the laws of  Georgia  and is  qualified  to do
business as a foreign  corporation under the laws of Alabama.  SOUTHERN owns all
the  outstanding  common  stock  of  ALABAMA,  GEORGIA,  GULF,  MISSISSIPPI  and
SAVANNAH,  each of which is an operating public utility company.  The integrated
Southeast  utilities supply electric service in the states of Alabama,  Georgia,
Florida,  Mississippi and Georgia,  respectively.  More  particular  information
relating to each of the integrated Southeast utilities is as follows:

      ALABAMA is a corporation  organized under the laws of the State of Alabama
      on November 10, 1927, by the consolidation of a predecessor  Alabama Power
      Company,  Gulf Electric Company and Houston Power Company. The predecessor
      Alabama   Power  Company  had  had  a  continuous   existence   since  its
      incorporation in 1906.

      GEORGIA  was  incorporated  under the laws of the State of Georgia on June
      26, 1930, and admitted to do business in Alabama on September 15, 1948.

      GULF is a corporation  which was organized  under the laws of the State of
      Maine on  November  2, 1925,  and  admitted  to do  business in Florida on
      January 15, 1926, in  Mississippi  on October 25, 1976,  and in Georgia on
      November 20, 1984.

      MISSISSIPPI was incorporated under the laws of the State of Mississippi on
      July 12,  1972,  was  admitted to do  business in Alabama on November  28,
      1972,  and  effective  December  21,  1972,  by the merger  into it of the
      predecessor  Mississippi  Power  Company,  succeeded  to the  business and
      properties  of the  latter  company.  The  predecessor  Mississippi  Power
      Company was incorporated  under the laws of the State of Maine on November
      24, 1924,  and was admitted to do business in  Mississippi on December 23,
      1924, and in Alabama on December 7, 1962.

      SAVANNAH is a corporation existing under the laws of the State of Georgia;
      its charter was granted by the Secretary of State on August 5, 1921.

    SOUTHERN  also  owns all the  outstanding  common  stock of  Southern  LINC,
Southern Nuclear, SCS, Energy Solutions,  Southern Telecom, SPC and other direct
and   indirect   subsidiaries.   Southern   LINC   provides   digital   wireless
communications  services to SOUTHERN's  integrated  Southeast utilities and also
markets these  services to the public  within the  Southeast.  Southern  Nuclear
provides  services to ALABAMA's and GEORGIA's  nuclear plants.  Energy Solutions
develops new business  opportunities  related to energy  products and  services.
Southern Telecom provides  wholesale fiber optic solutions to  telecommunication
providers in the Southeastern  United States.  SPC, formed in January 2001, will
be the primary growth engine for SOUTHERN's market-based energy business.

    ALABAMA and GEORGIA each own 50% of the  outstanding  common stock of SEGCO.
SEGCO owns  electric  generating  units with an aggregate  capacity of 1,019,680
kilowatts  at Plant  Gaston on the Coosa River near  Wilsonville,  Alabama,  and
ALABAMA  and GEORGIA are each  entitled  to  one-half  of SEGCO's  capacity  and
energy.  ALABAMA acts as SEGCO's  agent in the  operation  of SEGCO's  units and
furnishes  coal to SEGCO as fuel for its units.  SEGCO  also owns three  230,000
volt transmission lines extending from Plant Gaston to the Georgia state line at
which point connection is made with the GEORGIA transmission line system.

    Reference is also made to Note 12 to the financial statements of SOUTHERN in
Item 8 herein  for  additional  information  regarding  SOUTHERN's  segment  and
related information.

Mirant Corporation

Previously,  SOUTHERN owned all the outstanding common stock of Mirant. In April
2000,  SOUTHERN  announced an initial  public  offering of up to 19.9 percent of
Mirant  and its  intentions  to spin off the  remaining  ownership  of Mirant to
SOUTHERN's common  stockholders  within 12 months of the initial stock offering.
On October 2, 2000,  Mirant completed an initial public offering of 66.7 million
shares.  On February 19, 2001,  SOUTHERN's board of directors  approved the spin
off of the remaining ownership of 272 million Mirant shares to be completed in a
tax free distribution on April 2, 2001. As a result of the spin off,  SOUTHERN's
financial  statements and related information in Item 8 herein reflect Mirant as
discontinued operations.
                                      I-1



The SOUTHERN System

Integrated Southeast Utilities


The transmission  facilities of each of the integrated  Southeast  utilities are
connected to the respective company's own generating plants and other sources of
power  and are  interconnected  with the  transmission  facilities  of the other
integrated  Southeast  utilities and SEGCO by means of  heavy-duty  high voltage
lines. (In the case of GEORGIA's  integrated  transmission  system, see Item 1 -
BUSINESS - "Territory Served by the Integrated Southeast Utilities" herein.)

    Operating   contracts   covering   arrangements  in  effect  with  principal
neighboring utility systems provide for capacity  exchanges,  capacity purchases
and  sales,   transfers  of  economy  energy  and  other  similar  transactions.
Additionally,  the  integrated  Southeast  utilities have entered into voluntary
reliability  agreements with the  subsidiaries of Entergy  Corporation,  Florida
Electric  Power  Coordinating  Group  and TVA and  with  Carolina  Power & Light
Company,  Duke Energy  Corporation,  South  Carolina  Electric & Gas Company and
Virginia   Electric  and  Power   Company,   each  of  which  provides  for  the
establishment  and periodic review of principles and procedures for planning and
operation of generation and transmission facilities, maintenance schedules, load
retention  programs,  emergency  operations,  and other  matters  affecting  the
reliability of bulk power supply. The integrated Southeast utilities have joined
with other  utilities in the Southeast  (including  those  referred to above) to
form the SERC to augment  further  the  reliability  and  adequacy of bulk power
supply.  Through the SERC, the integrated Southeast utilities are represented on
the National Electric Reliability Council.


    An intra-system  interchange agreement provides for coordinating  operations
of the power producing  facilities of the integrated Southeast utilities and the
capacities  available to such companies from non-affiliated  sources and for the
pooling of surplus energy  available for interchange.  Coordinated  operation of
the entire  interconnected  system is conducted  through a central  power supply
coordination  office  maintained  by SCS.  The  available  sources of energy are
allocated to the integrated  Southeast  utilities to provide the most economical
sources of power  consistent  with good  operation.  The resulting  benefits and
savings are apportioned among the integrated Southeast utilities.

    On December 20, 1999, the FERC issued its final rule on RTOs ("Order 2000").
The order  encouraged  utilities owning  transmission  systems to form RTOs on a
voluntary  basis.  Utilities  were  required  to make a filing  with the FERC by
October 16, 2000 explaining how they would respond to Order 2000 consistent with
this  requirement.  On October 16, 2000,  SOUTHERN  filed its RTO proposal.  The
proposal is for the formation of a for-profit company that would have control of
the bulk power transmission system of SOUTHERN and other participating utilities
in the  region.  Participants  would  have the option to either  maintain  their
ownership,  divest, sell or lease their transmission assets to the proposed RTO.
On March 14, 2001, the FERC rejected SOUTHERN's proposal on the grounds that the
limitation  of the  scope of  services  to new  wholesale  transmission  and the
provision of incentives  to passive  owners were  inconsistent  with Order 2000.
This order  requires a status report from SOUTHERN by May 14, 2001, but does not
establish a deadline for SOUTHERN to file a revised petition.  Reference is made
to each  registrant's  "Management's  Discussion and Analysis - Future  Earnings
Potential" in Item 7 for additional information.


    SCS has contracted with SOUTHERN, each integrated Southeast utility, Mirant,
various of the other  subsidiaries,  Southern  Nuclear and SEGCO to furnish,  at
cost and upon request,  the following  services:  general executive and advisory
services,  power  pool  operations,  general  engineering,  design  engineering,
purchasing,  accounting,  finance and treasury,  taxes,  insurance and pensions,
corporate, rates, budgeting, public relations,  employee relations,  systems and
procedures  and other services with respect to business and  operations.  Energy
Solutions  and Southern  LINC have also secured  from the  integrated  Southeast
utilities certain services which are furnished at cost.

    Southern  Nuclear has contracts  with ALABAMA to operate the Farley  Nuclear
Plant,  and with  GEORGIA  to  operate  Plants  Hatch and  Vogtle.  See Item 1 -
BUSINESS - "Regulation - Atomic Energy Act of 1954" herein.

                                      I-2





Other Business

Energy  Solutions  focuses on new and  existing  programs  to  enhance  customer
satisfaction,  efficiency and  stockholder  value.  Examples are: Good Cents, an
energy efficiency  program for electric utility customers;  Energy Services,  an
energy  solutions  consultant and contractor for industrial and large commercial
customers;  and Bill Payment  Protection,  an insurance  product that protects a
residential  customer  by paying  the  electric  bill in the event the  customer
becomes involuntarily unemployed, disabled, or goes on unpaid leave.

     In 1996,  Southern  LINC  began  serving  SOUTHERN's  integrated  Southeast
utilities and marketing its services to non-affiliates within the Southeast. Its
system covers  approximately  127,000 square miles and combines the functions of
two-way radio  dispatch,  cellular phone,  short text and numeric  messaging and
wireless data transfer.

    These continuing efforts to invest in and develop new business opportunities
offer the potential of earning returns which may exceed those of  rate-regulated
operations.  However,  these  activities  also involve a higher  degree of risk.
SOUTHERN  expects to make  substantial  investments over the period 2001-2003 in
these and other new businesses.

     In 1999,  MESH, a subsidiary  of SOUTHERN,  filed a petition for Chapter 11
bankruptcy relief in the U.S.  Bankruptcy Court. On August 4, 2000, MESH filed a
proposed plan of  reorganization  with the bankruptcy  court that was amended on
September  15, 2000.  The proposed plan of  reorganization  was again amended on
February 21, 2001.  Reference is made to Note 3 to the  financial  statements of
SOUTHERN in Item 8 herein for additional information relating to this matter.

Certain Factors Affecting the Industry


Various  factors  are  currently  affecting  the  electric  utility  industry in
general,  including  increasing  competition and the regulatory  changes related
thereto,  costs  required  to comply  with  environmental  regulations,  and the
potential for new business  opportunities  (with their associated risks) outside
of traditional rate-regulated operations. The effects of these and other factors
on the SOUTHERN  system are described  herein.  Particular  reference is made to
Item  1  -  BUSINESS  -  "Other  Business",   "Competition"  and  "Environmental
Regulation."   See  also   "Cautionary   Statement   Regarding   Forward-Looking
Information."


Construction Programs


The  subsidiary  companies  of SOUTHERN are engaged in  continuous  construction
programs to accommodate  existing and estimated future loads on their respective
systems.  Construction additions or acquisitions of property during 2001 through
2003 by the integrated Southeast utilities,  SEGCO, SCS, Southern LINC and other
subsidiaries are estimated as follows: (in millions)

Included  in  these  estimated  totals  are  expenditures  for  construction  of
wholesale  generation  assets  that may be  transferred  to SPC.  Assuming  such
transfers  are made,  SPC's  projected  construction  program  expenditures  are
approximately  $1.2 billion in 2001,  $725 million in 2002,  and $452 million in
2003.

                                      I-3




   *Southern LINC, SCS, and other businesses plan capital  additions to general
plant in 2001 of $26 million, $29 million, and $111 million, respectively, while
SEGCO plans capital additions of $16 million to generating facilities. (See Item
1 - BUSINESS - "Other Business" herein.)

    The construction  programs are subject to periodic review and revision,  and
actual  construction costs may vary from the above estimates because of numerous
factors. These factors include: changes in business conditions;  acquisitions of
additional  generating  assets;  revised  load  growth  estimates;   changes  in
environmental  regulations;  changes  in  existing  nuclear  plants  to meet new
regulatory requirements; increasing costs of labor, equipment and materials; and
cost of capital.  In addition,  there can be no assurance  that costs related to
capital expenditures will be fully recovered.


    SOUTHERN  has  approximately  6,600  megawatts  of new  generating  capacity
scheduled  to be placed in service by 2003.  Approximately  4,400  megawatts  of
additional  new capacity will be dedicated to the wholesale  market and owned by
SPC.

    In 1991, the Georgia  legislature  passed legislation which requires GEORGIA
and  SAVANNAH  each to file an  Integrated  Resource  Plan for  approval  by the
Georgia  PSC.  Under  the plan  rules,  the  Georgia  PSC must  pre-certify  the
construction of new power plants and new purchase power contracts. (See Item 1 -

Financing Programs


The amount and timing of additional equity capital to be raised in 2001, as well
as subsequent years, will be contingent on SOUTHERN's investment  opportunities.
Equity capital can be provided from any combination of public offerings, private
placements, or SOUTHERN's stock plans.

    The  integrated  Southeast  utilities  plan to obtain the funds required for
construction  and other purposes from sources similar to those used in the past,
which were primarily from internal sources.  However, the type and timing of any
financings  -- if needed -- will  depend on  market  conditions  and  regulatory
approval.  Recently,  the  integrated  Southeast  utilities  have  relied on the
issuance  of  unsecured  debt and trust  preferred  securities,  in  addition to
unsecured  pollution control bonds issued for its benefit by public  authorities
to meet its  long-term  external  financing  requirements.  In years  past,  the
integrated  Southeast  utilities  issued first mortgage  bonds,  mortgage backed
pollution  control bonds and preferred stock to fund its external  requirements.
The amount  outstanding  of the latter  securities  has been declining in recent
years.


    If the  integrated  Southeast  utilities  were to  choose to issue new first
mortgage  bonds or  preferred  stock once again,  they would be required to meet
certain coverage requirements.

    Short-term  debt is  often  utilized  as  appropriate  at  SOUTHERN  and the
integrated Southeast utilities.

    The maximum amounts of short-term and term-loan  indebtedness  authorized by
the appropriate regulatory authorities are shown on the following table:

    As of February 9, 2001, the integrated Southeast utilities had stockpiles of
coal on  hand  at  their  respective  coal-fired  plants  which  represented  an
estimated  23 days of  recoverable  supply for  bituminous  coal and 31 days for
sub-bituminous  coal. It is estimated that approximately 68 million tons of coal
will be consumed in 2001 by the integrated  Southeast utilities (including those
units  GEORGIA owns jointly with OPC,  MEAG and Dalton and operates for FP&L and
JEA and the units  ALABAMA  owns  jointly with AEC).  The  integrated  Southeast
utilities  currently have 60 coal  contracts.  These  contracts  cover remaining
terms of up to 12 years.  Approximately  15% of 2001 estimated coal requirements
will be purchased in the spot market. Additionally,  it has been determined that
approximately 34 normal full load days of recoverable supply is desirable at the
beginning  of the heavy burn  season  between  June 1 and  September  30 with 31
normal full load days being the average annual target.

    In 2000,  the weighted  average  sulfur content of all coal purchased by the
integrated  Southeast  utilities for use in the coal-fired  facilities was 0.77%
sulfur. This sulfur level, along with banked sulfur dioxide allowances,  allowed
the  integrated  Southeast  utilities  and SEGCO to remain  within limits as set
forth by Phase II of the Clean Air Act.  As more and more  strict  environmental
regulations  are proposed that impact the utilization of coal, the fuel mix will
be monitored to insure that sufficient  quantities of the proper type of coal or
natural  gas are in place to  remain  in  compliance  with  applicable  laws and
regulations.  See Item 1 - BUSINESS -  "Regulation -  Environmental  Regulation"
herein.


    Changes in fuel prices are generally  reflected in fuel  adjustment  clauses
contained  in rate  schedules.  See Item 1 -  BUSINESS  - "Rate  Matters  - Rate
Structure" herein.

    ALABAMA  and GEORGIA  have  numerous  contracts  covering a portion of their
nuclear fuel needs for uranium,  conversion  services,  enrichment  services and
fuel  fabrication.  These contracts have varying  expiration  dates and most are
short to medium term (less than 10 years).  Management  believes that sufficient
capacity  for nuclear  fuel  supplies  and  processing  exists to  preclude  the
impairment of normal  operations  of the SOUTHERN  system's  nuclear  generating
units.


    ALABAMA  and  GEORGIA  have  contracts  with  the DOE that  provide  for the
permanent  disposal of spent nuclear fuel. The DOE failed to begin  disposing of
spent fuel in January 1998, as required by the contracts,  and the companies are
pursuing legal remedies against the government for breach of contract. Effective
June 2000, an on-site dry storage  facility for Plant Hatch became  operational.
Sufficient  capacity  is  believed  to be  available  to  continue  dry  storage
operations at Plant Hatch through the life of the plant. Sufficient fuel storage
capacity currently is available at Plant Vogtle to maintain full-core  discharge
capability for both units into the year 2014.  Sufficient fuel storage  capacity
is available at Plant Farley to maintain  full-core  discharge  capability until
the  refueling  outage  scheduled  in 2006 for Farley  unit 1 and the  refueling
outage  scheduled  in 2008 for Farley unit 2.  Procurement  of on-site dry spent
fuel storage  capacity at Plant Farley is in progress,  with the intent to place
the capacity in operation as early as 2005.


    The Energy Act imposed upon utilities with nuclear plants, including ALABAMA
and GEORGIA,  obligations for the decontamination and decommissioning of federal
nuclear fuel  enrichment  facilities.  See Note 1 to  SOUTHERN's,  ALABAMA's and
GEORGIA's financial statements in Item 8 herein.

Territory Served by the Integrated Southeast Utilities


The  territory in which the  integrated  Southeast  utilities  provide  electric
service  comprises  most of the states of Alabama and Georgia  together with the
northwestern portion of Florida and southeastern Mississippi.  In this territory
there are non-affiliated  electric distribution systems which obtain some or all
of their power  requirements  either  directly or indirectly from the integrated
Southeast utilities.  The territory has an area of approximately  120,000 square
miles and an estimated population of approximately 11 million.

    ALABAMA is  engaged,  within the State of  Alabama,  in the  generation  and
purchase of electricity  and the  distribution  and sale of such  electricity at
retail in over  1,000  communities  (including  Anniston,  Birmingham,  Gadsden,
Mobile,  Montgomery  and  Tuscaloosa)  and at wholesale to 15  municipally-owned
electric  distribution  systems, 11 of which are served indirectly through sales
to AMEA,  and two rural  distributing  cooperative  associations.  ALABAMA  also
supplies  steam  service  in  downtown  Birmingham.   ALABAMA  also  sells,  and
cooperates with dealers in promoting the sale of, electric appliances.


    GEORGIA is engaged in the  generation  and purchase of  electricity  and the
distribution and sale of such electricity  within the State of Georgia at retail
in over 600 communities,  as well as in rural areas, and at wholesale  currently
to OPC, MEAG, the City of Dalton and the City of Hampton.


    GULF  is  engaged,  within  the  northwestern  portion  of  Florida,  in the
generation and purchase of  electricity  and the  distribution  and sale of such
electricity at retail in 71 communities  (including  Pensacola,  Panama City and
Fort  Walton  Beach),  as  well  as  in  rural  areas,  and  at  wholesale  to a
non-affiliated utility and a municipality.

    MISSISSIPPI is engaged in the generation and purchase of electricity and the
distribution  and sale of such energy  within the 23  counties  of  southeastern
Mississippi,   at  retail  in  123  communities  (including  Biloxi,   Gulfport,
Hattiesburg, Laurel, Meridian and Pascagoula), as well as in rural areas, and at
wholesale  to one  municipality,  six rural  electric  distribution  cooperative
associations and one generating and transmitting cooperative.

    SAVANNAH is engaged,  within a five-county area in eastern  Georgia,  in the
generation and purchase of  electricity  and the  distribution  and sale of such
electricity  at retail and, as a member of the SOUTHERN  system power pool,  the
transmission and sale of wholesale energy.


    For information  relating to kilowatt-hour  sales by classification for each
registrant,  reference is made to "Management's  Discussion and Analysis-Results
of Operations" in Item 7 herein.  Also, for information  relating to the sources
of  revenues  for the  SOUTHERN  system  and  each of the  integrated  Southeast
utilities, reference is made to Item 6 herein.


    A portion of the area served by the integrated  Southeast  utilities adjoins
the area served by TVA and its municipal and cooperative distributors. An Act of
Congress limits the distribution of TVA power,  unless  otherwise  authorized by
Congress,  to specified  areas or customers which generally were those served on
July 1, 1957.

    The  RUS  has  authority  to  make  loans  to  cooperative  associations  or
corporations  to enable them to provide  electric  service to customers in rural
sections  of the  country.  There  are  71  electric  cooperative  organizations
operating in the territory in which the integrated  Southeast  utilities provide
electric service at retail or wholesale.

    One of these,  AEC, is a generating  and  transmitting  cooperative  selling
power  to  several  distributing  cooperatives,   municipal  systems  and  other
customers in south Alabama and northwest Florida. AEC owns generating units with
approximately  840  megawatts  of  nameplate  capacity,  including  an undivided
ownership  interest in ALABAMA's  Plant  Miller Units 1 and 2. AEC's  facilities
were  financed  with  RUS  loans  secured  by  long-term   contracts   requiring
distributing cooperatives to take their requirements from AEC to the extent such
energy  is  available.  Two of the 14  distributing  cooperatives  operating  in
ALABAMA's  service  territory  obtain  a  portion  of their  power  requirements
directly from ALABAMA.
                                      I-8



    Four electric cooperative associations,  financed by the RUS, operate within
GULF's service area. These  cooperatives  purchase their full  requirements from
AEC and SEPA (a federal power marketing agency).  A non-affiliated  utility also
operates  within GULF's  service area and purchases its full  requirements  from
GULF.


    ALABAMA and GULF have entered into  separate  agreements  with AEC involving
interconnection  between the  respective  systems.  The delivery of capacity and
energy from AEC to certain  distributing  cooperatives  in the service  areas of
ALABAMA and GULF is governed by the SOUTHERN/AEC  Network  Transmission  Service
Agreement.  The  rates  for this  service  to AEC are  based  on the  negotiated
agreement  on file  with the  FERC.  See Item 2 -  PROPERTIES  -  "Jointly-Owned
Facilities"  herein  for  details  of  ALABAMA's  joint-ownership  with AEC of a
portion of Plant Miller.

    MISSISSIPPI  has an  interchange  agreement  with SMEPA,  a  generating  and
transmitting  cooperative,  pursuant to which  various  services  are  provided,
including the furnishing of protective  capacity by MISSISSIPPI to SMEPA.  SMEPA
has a generating  capacity of 821 megawatts and a transmission  system estimated
to be 1,480 miles in length.

    There are 43 electric  cooperative  organizations  operating in, or in areas
adjoining,  territory in the State of Georgia in which GEORGIA provides electric
service at retail or wholesale.  Three of these organizations obtain their power
from TVA and one from other  sources.  Since July 1, 1975,  OPC has supplied the
requirements  of  the  remaining  39 of  these  cooperative  organizations  from
self-owned  generation  acquired from GEORGIA and, until September 1991, through
partial  requirements  purchases  from  GEORGIA.  GEORGIA  entered  into a power
coordination  agreement with OPC pursuant to which, effective in September 1991,
OPC ceased to be partial  requirements  wholesale customer of GEORGIA.  Instead,
OPC began the purchase of 1,250 megawatts of capacity from GEORGIA through 1999,
subject to  reduction  or  extension  by OPC, and may satisfy the balance of its
needs through purchases from others.  OPC decreased its purchases of capacity by
250  megawatts  each in September  1997,  1998 and 1999.  Under the amended 1995
Integrated  Resource  Plan  approved  by the  Georgia  PSC in  March  1997,  the
resources  associated with the decreased purchases by OPC in 1997, 1998 and 1999
will be used to meet the needs of GEORGIA's retail customers through 2004.
In April 1999, a new power supply agreement was implemented  between GEORGIA and
OPC.  Pursuant to this  agreement,  OPC will  purchase  250  megawatts  of steam
capacity  through March 2006, 250 megawatts of peaking  capacity  through August
2000,  and 125 megawatts of peaking  capacity from September 2000 through August
2001.

    There are 65  municipally-owned  electric  distribution systems operating in
the  territory in which the  integrated  Southeast  utilities  provide  electric
service at retail or wholesale.

    AMEA was organized under an act of the Alabama  legislature and is comprised
of 11  municipalities.  In 1986,  ALABAMA  entered  into a firm  power  purchase
contract with AMEA entitling AMEA to scheduled amounts of capacity (to a maximum
of 100  megawatts)  for a period of 15 years  commencing  September 1, 1986.  In
October 1991,  ALABAMA  entered into a second firm power purchase  contract with
AMEA entitling AMEA to scheduled amounts of additional capacity (to a maximum 80
megawatts)  for a  period  of 15  years  commencing  October  1,  1991.  In both
contracts,  the power is being sold to AMEA for its member  municipalities  that
previously  were served  directly by ALABAMA as wholesale  customers.  Under the
terms of the contracts, ALABAMA received payments from AMEA representing the net
present  value  of  the  revenues   associated  with  the  respective   capacity
entitlements.  See Note 6 to ALABAMA's financial statements in Item 8 herein for
further information on these contracts.


    Forty-eight   municipally-owned   electric   distribution  systems  and  one
county-owned   system  receive  their  requirements   through  MEAG,  which  was
established  by a state  statute in 1975.  MEAG serves these  requirements  from
self-owned  generation  facilities  acquired  from  GEORGIA and  purchases  from
others. In August 1997, a power coordination  agreement was implemented  between
GEORGIA and MEAG that replaced the partial requirements tariff pursuant to which
GEORGIA  previously sold wholesale energy to MEAG. Since 1977, Dalton has filled
its requirements  from generation  facilities  acquired from GEORGIA and through
partial requirements  purchases.  One  municipally-owned  electric  distribution
system's full requirements are served under a market-based  contract by GEORGIA.
(See Item 2 - PROPERTIES - "Jointly-Owned Facilities" herein.)

                                      I-9


     GULF and  MISSISSIPPI  provide  wholesale  requirements  for one  municipal
system each.


     GEORGIA has entered  into  substantially  similar  agreements  with Georgia
Transmission Corporation (formerly OPC's transmission division), MEAG and Dalton
providing for the  establishment of an integrated  transmission  system to carry
the power and energy of each. The agreements require an investment by each party
in the integrated  transmission  system in proportion to its respective share of
the aggregate system load. (See Item 2 - PROPERTIES - "Jointly-Owned Facilities"
herein.)

     SCS, acting on behalf of ALABAMA,  GEORGIA, GULF, MISSISSIPPI and SAVANNAH,
also  has a  contract  with  SEPA  providing  for  the use of  those  companies'
facilities  at  government  expense  to  deliver  to  certain  cooperatives  and
municipalities,  entitled by federal  statute to  preference  in the purchase of
power  from  SEPA,  quantities  of  power  equivalent  to the  amounts  of power
allocated to them by SEPA from certain  United States  government  hydroelectric
projects.


    The retail service rights of all electric  suppliers in the State of Georgia
are regulated by the 1973 State  Territorial  Electric Service Act.  Pursuant to
the  provisions  of this Act, all areas within  existing  municipal  limits were
assigned  to the  primary  electric  supplier  therein  on March  29,  1973 (451
municipalities,  including Atlanta,  Columbus,  Macon, Augusta, Athens, Rome and
Valdosta,  to GEORGIA;  115 to electric  cooperatives;  and 50 to publicly-owned
systems).  Areas outside of such municipal  limits were either to be assigned or
to be declared open for customer choice of supplier by action of the Georgia PSC
pursuant to standards set forth in the Act. Consistent with such standards,  the
Georgia PSC has  assigned  substantially  all of the land area in the state to a
supplier.  Notwithstanding  such  assignments,  the Act  provides  that  any new
customer  locating  outside of 1973 municipal limits and having a connected load
of at least 900 kilowatts may receive  electric service from the supplier of its
choice. (See also Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition" herein.)

     Under and subject to the provisions of its franchises and  concessions  and
the 1973 State  Territorial  Electric  Service  Act,  SAVANNAH  has the full but
nonexclusive  right to serve the City of  Savannah,  the Towns of  Bloomingdale,
Pooler, Garden City, Guyton,  Newington,  Oliver, Port Wentworth,  Rincon, Tybee
Island,  Springfield,   Thunderbolt,  Vernonburg,  and  in  conjunction  with  a
secondary  supplier,  the Town of Richmond Hill. In addition,  SAVANNAH has been
assigned certain unincorporated areas in Chatham,  Effingham, Bryan, Bulloch and
Screven Counties by the Georgia PSC. (See also Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Competition"
herein.)


     Pursuant to the 1956 Utility Act, the Mississippi  PSC issued  "Grandfather
Certificates"  of public  convenience  and necessity to  MISSISSIPPI  and to six
distribution  rural  cooperatives  operating in southeastern  Mississippi,  then
served  in  whole  or in part by  MISSISSIPPI,  authorizing  them to  distribute
electricity in certain  specified  geographically  described areas of the state.
The  six  cooperatives  serve  approximately   300,000  retail  customers  in  a
certificated  area of approximately  10,300 square miles. In areas included in a
"Grandfather  Certificate,"  the utility holding such  certificate  may, without
further  certification,  extend  its lines up to five  miles;  other  extensions
within that area by such utility, or by other utilities,  may not be made except
upon a showing  of, and a grant of a  certificate  of,  public  convenience  and
necessity.  Areas included in such a certificate which are subsequently  annexed
to  municipalities  may continue to be served by the holder of the  certificate,
irrespective of whether it has a franchise in the annexing municipality.  On the
other hand,  the holder of the municipal  franchise may not extend  service into
such newly annexed area without authorization by the Mississippi PSC.

customers.

                                      I-10



Competition


     The electric utility industry in the United States is currently  undergoing
a period of dramatic change as a result of regulatory and  competitive  factors.
Among the  primary  agents of change  has been the  Energy  Act.  The Energy Act
allows  IPPs to  access  a  utility's  transmission  network  in  order  to sell
electricity  to other  utilities.  This enhances the incentive for IPPs to build
cogeneration  plants for a utility's large industrial and commercial  customers,
and sell energy  generation  to other  utilities.  Also,  electricity  sales for
resale rates are being driven down by wholesale transmission access and numerous
potential new energy  suppliers,  including  power  marketers  and brokers.  The
integrated  Southeast utilities are aggressively  working to maintain and expand
their share of wholesale sales in the Southeastern power markets.

     Although the Energy Act does not permit retail  customer  access,  it was a
major  catalyst for the current  restructuring  and  consolidation  taking place
within the  utility  industry.  Numerous  federal and state  initiatives  are in
varying stages to promote wholesale and retail competition.  Among other things,
these initiatives allow customers to choose their electricity provider.
Some  states  have  approved  initiatives  that  result in a  separation  of the
ownership  and/or  operation of generating  facilities from the ownership and/or
operation  of   transmission   and   distribution   facilities.   While  various
restructuring  and  competition  initiatives  have been  discussed  in  Alabama,
Florida,  Georgia,  and  Mississippi,  none have been enacted.  Enactment  would
require numerous issues to be resolved,  including  significant ones relating to
recovery of any stranded investments, full cost recovery of energy produced, and
other issues related to the current energy crisis in California.  As a result of
this crisis, many states have either  discontinued or delayed  implementation of
initiatives involving retail deregulation. The inability of a company to recover
its  investments,  including the regulatory  assets  described in Note 1 to each
registrant's  respective  financial  statements,  could have a material  adverse
effect on such  company's  financial  condition and results of  operations.  The
integrated  Southeast  utilities are attempting to minimize or reduce their cost
exposure.  Reference is made to Note 3 to the financial  statements for SOUTHERN
under "Alabama Power Rate Adjustment  Procedures" and "Georgia Power 1998 Retail
Rate Order" for information regarding these efforts.


     Reference is made to Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Integrated  Southeast  Utilities"
herein for information relating to an RTO filing with FERC.


     Continuing  to  be a  low-cost  producer  could  provide  opportunities  to
increase  market share and  profitability  in markets that evolve with  changing
regulation.  Conversely,  if the  integrated  Southeast  utilities do not remain
low-cost  producers and provide quality service,  then energy sales growth could
be limited,  and this could significantly  erode earnings.  Reference is made to
ALABAMA, GULF, MISSISSIPPI and SAVANNAH, "Management's Discussion and Analysis -
Future  Earnings   Potential"  in  Item  7  herein  for  further  discussion  of
competition.

     To  adapt  to a less  regulated,  more  competitive  environment,  SOUTHERN
continues  to  evaluate  and  consider  a  wide  array  of  potential   business
strategies.  These  strategies may include business  combinations,  acquisitions
involving  other  utility or  non-utility  businesses  or  properties,  internal
restructuring,  disposition  of certain  assets,  or some  combination  thereof.
Furthermore,  SOUTHERN may engage in other new business ventures that arise from
competitive and regulatory  changes in the utility  industry.  Pursuit of any of
the above strategies,  or any combination  thereof, may significantly affect the
business operations and financial condition of SOUTHERN.  (See Item 1 - BUSINESS
- - "Other Business" herein.)


     As a result of the foregoing factors,  SOUTHERN has experienced  increasing
competition  for  available   off-system  sales  of  capacity  and  energy  from
neighboring  utilities  and  alternative  sources of energy.  Additionally,  the
future  effect of  cogeneration  and  small-power  production  facilities on the
SOUTHERN system cannot currently be determined but may be adverse.

                                      I-11




     ALABAMA  currently  has  cogeneration   contracts  in  effect  with  twelve
industrial  customers.  Under the terms of these  contracts,  ALABAMA  purchases
excess   generation  of  such   companies.   During  2000,   ALABAMA   purchased
approximately 104.9 million kilowatt-hours from such companies at a cost of $3.1
million.

     GEORGIA  currently has contracts in effect with eight small power producers
whereby  GEORGIA  purchases  their  excess  generation.   During  2000,  GEORGIA
purchased 11.6 million kilowatt-hours from such companies at a cost of $482,000.
GEORGIA has purchased  power  agreements for electricity  with two  cogeneration
facilities.  Payments  are subject to  reductions  for  failure to meet  minimum
capacity output. During 2000, GEORGIA purchased 698.3 million  kilowatt-hours at
a cost of $70.4  million from these  facilities.  Reference is made to Note 4 to
the financial statements for GEORGIA in Item 8 herein for information  regarding
purchased power commitments.

     GULF  currently  has  agreements in effect with four  industrial  customers
pursuant to which GULF  purchases  "as  available"  energy  from  customer-owned
generation.  During 2000,  GULF purchased 127 million  kilowatt-hours  from such
companies for $5.2 million.

     SAVANNAH  currently  has  cogeneration  contracts in effect with five large
customers.  Under  the  terms  of these  contracts,  SAVANNAH  purchases  excess
generation  of such  companies.  During 2000,  SAVANNAH  purchased  43.9 million
kilowatt-hours from such companies at a cost of $2.7 million.


     The competition for retail energy sales among competing suppliers of energy
is influenced by various factors, including price,  availability,  technological
advancements  and  reliability.  These factors are, in turn,  affected by, among
other  influences,   regulatory,  political  and  environmental  considerations,
taxation and supply.


     The integrated Southeast utilities have experienced, and expect to continue
to experience,  competition in their  respective  retail service  territories in
varying degrees as the result of  self-generation  (as described above) and fuel
switching  by  customers  and  other  factors.  (See also  Item 1 -  BUSINESS  -
"Territory Served by the Integrated  Southeast Utilities" herein for information
concerning suppliers of electricity operating within or near the areas served at
retail by the integrated Southeast utilities.)


Regulation

State Commissions


The  integrated  Southeast  utilities are subject to the  jurisdiction  of their
respective state regulatory commissions,  which have broad powers of supervision
and  regulation  over  public  utilities  operating  in the  respective  states,
including their rates, service regulations,  sales of securities (except for the
Mississippi  PSC) and, in the cases of the Georgia PSC and  Mississippi  PSC, in
part,  retail service  territories.  (See Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Rate Matters" and
"Territory Served by the Integrated Southeast Utilities" herein.)


Holding Company Act

SOUTHERN is registered as a holding  company under the Holding  Company Act, and
it and its subsidiary companies are subject to the regulatory provisions of said
Act,  including  provisions  relating to the issuance of  securities,  sales and
acquisitions  of securities and utility  assets,  services  performed by SCS and
Southern  Nuclear,  and the activities of certain of SOUTHERN's  special purpose
subsidiaries.


     While various  proposals  have been  introduced  in Congress  regarding the
Holding  Company  Act,  the  prospects  for  legislative  reform or  repeal  are
uncertain at this time.


Federal Power Act

The Federal Power Act subjects the integrated  Southeast  utilities and SEGCO to
regulation  by the FERC as  companies  engaged  in the  transmission  or sale at
wholesale of electric  energy in interstate  commerce,  including  regulation of
accounting policies and practices.

     ALABAMA and GEORGIA are also subject to the provisions of the Federal Power
Act or the earlier  Federal Water Power Act applicable to licensees with respect
to their hydroelectric developments. Among the hydroelectric projects subject to
licensing  by the FERC are 14 existing  ALABAMA  generating  stations  having an
aggregate  installed  capacity of 1,593,600  kilowatts  and 18 existing  GEORGIA
generating   stations  having  an  aggregate  installed  capacity  of  1,074,696
kilowatts.

                                      I-12


     GEORGIA has started the  relicensing  process for the Middle  Chattahoochee
Project.  This project  consists of the Goat Rock,  Oliver,  and North Highlands
facilities.


     GEORGIA  and OPC also  have a  license,  expiring  in 2027,  for the  Rocky
Mountain  Plant, a pure pumped  storage  facility of 847,800  kilowatt  capacity
which  began  commercial   operation  in  1995.  (See  Item  2  -  PROPERTIES  -
"Jointly-Owned  Facilities"  herein  and  Note  3 to  SOUTHERN's  and  GEORGIA's
financial statements in Item 8 herein for additional information.)

     Licenses for all projects,  excluding those discussed above,  expire in the
period  2007-2033 in the case of ALABAMA's  projects and in the period 2005-2036
in the case of GEORGIA's projects.

     Upon or after the expiration of each license, the United States Government,
by act of Congress,  may take over the project,  or the FERC may  relicense  the
project  either to the original  licensee or to a new licensee.  In the event of
takeover or relicensing to another,  the original  licensee is to be compensated
in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Power Act, such compensation to
reflect the net investment of the licensee in the project,  not in excess of the
fair value of the property taken,  plus reasonable  damages to other property of
the licensee resulting from the severance therefrom of the property taken.

Atomic Energy Act of 1954

ALABAMA,  GEORGIA and  Southern  Nuclear are  subject to the  provisions  of the
Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended,  which vests jurisdiction in the NRC over
the construction and operation of nuclear reactors,  particularly with regard to
certain   public  health  and  safety  and  antitrust   matters.   The  National
Environmental  Policy Act has been construed to expand the  jurisdiction  of the
NRC to consider the environmental impact of a facility licensed under the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended.


     NRC  operating  licenses  currently  expire in June 2017 and March 2021 for
Plant Farley units 1 and 2, respectively, in August 2014 and June 2018 for Plant
Hatch units 1 and 2,  respectively,  and in January 2027 and  February  2029 for
Plant  Vogtle  units 1 and 2,  respectively.  On  February  29,  2000,  Southern
Nuclear, on behalf of GEORGIA,  filed a license renewal application with the NRC
for Plant  Hatch  units 1 and 2. If  approved,  the  operating  license  will be
extended to 2034.

     Reference is made to Notes 1 and 10 to SOUTHERN's, Notes 1 and 11 to
ALABAMA's and Notes 1 and 5 to GEORGIA's financial statements in Item 8 herein
for information on nuclear decommissioning costs and nuclear  insurance.
Additionally,  Note  3 to  GEORGIA's  financial  statements
contains  information  regarding  nuclear  performance  standards imposed by the
Georgia PSC that may impact retail rates.

Environmental Regulation

The  integrated  Southeast  utilities'  and  SEGCO's  operations  are subject to
federal,  state and local environmental  requirements which, among other things,
control  emissions of particulates,  sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides into the
air; the use, transportation, storage and disposal of hazardous and toxic waste;
and discharges of pollutants,  including thermal discharges,  into waters of the
United  States.  The integrated  Southeast  utilities and SEGCO expect to comply
with such  requirements,  which generally are becoming  increasingly  stringent,
through  technical  improvements,   the  use  of  appropriate   combinations  of
low-sulfur fuel and chemicals,  addition of  environmental  control  facilities,
changes  in  control  techniques  and  reduction  of  the  operating  levels  of
generating facilities.  Failure to comply with such requirements could result in
the complete shutdown of individual  facilities not in compliance as well as the
imposition of civil and criminal penalties.

     Reference  is  made  to  each  registrant's  "Management's  Discussion  and
Analysis"  in Item 7 herein  for a  discussion  of the  Clean  Air Act and other
environmental  legislation and proceedings,  including a pending lawsuit brought
on behalf of the EPA.

                                      I-13




     The  integrated   Southeast   utilities'  and  SEGCO's   estimated  capital

 ===================== === ========== ========== ===========
     The foregoing estimates are included in the current construction  programs.
(See Item 1 - BUSINESS - "Construction Programs" herein.)

     Additionally,  each  integrated  Southeast  utility and SEGCO has  incurred
costs for environmental  remediation of various sites. Reference is made to each
registrant's  "Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis"  in  Item 7  herein  for
information regarding the registrants'  environmental remediation efforts. Also,
see Note 3 to SOUTHERN's and GEORGIA's financial statements in Item 8 herein for
information regarding the identification of sites that may require environmental
remediation by GEORGIA.

     The integrated  Southeast utilities and SEGCO are unable to predict at this
time  what  additional  steps  they may be  required  to take as a result of the
implementation of existing or future quality control requirements for air, water
and hazardous or toxic  materials,  but such steps could adversely affect system
operations and result in substantial additional costs.

     The outcome of the matters mentioned above under "Regulation" cannot now be
determined,  except that these  developments  may result in delays in  obtaining
appropriate  licenses for  generating  facilities,  increased  construction  and
operating costs, or reduced  generation,  the nature and extent of which,  while
not determinable at this time, could be substantial.

Rate Matters

Rate Structure

The rates and service  regulations  of the  integrated  Southeast  utilities are
uniform for each class of service  throughout  their  respective  service areas.
Rates for  residential  electric  service are  generally of the block type based
upon kilowatt-hours used and include minimum charges.

     Residential and other rates contain separate  customer  charges.  Rates for
commercial service are presently of the block type and, for large customers, the
billing demand is generally used to determine capacity and minimum bill charges.
These large  customers'  rates are  generally  based upon usage by the  customer
including those with special features to encourage off-peak usage. Additionally,
the  integrated  Southeast  utilities  are allowed by their  respective  PSCs to
negotiate the terms and compensation of service to large  customers.  Such terms
and  compensation  of  service,  however,  are  subject  to final PSC  approval.
ALABAMA,  GEORGIA and  SAVANNAH are allowed by state law to recover fuel and net
purchased energy costs through fuel cost recovery  provisions which are adjusted
to reflect  increases  or  decreases in such costs.  GULF  recovers  from retail
customers  costs  of  fuel,  net  purchased  power,   energy   conservation  and
environmental  compliance  through  provisions  which are  adjusted  to  reflect
increases or decreases  in such costs.  GULF's  recovery of these costs is based
upon an annual  projection  - any  over/under  recovery  during  such  period is
reflected  in  a  subsequent  annual  period  with  interest.  With  respect  to
MISSISSIPPI's  retail rates,  fuel and purchased  power costs are billed to such
customers under the fuel and energy adjustment  clause.  The adjustment  factors
for  MISSISSIPPI's  retail and wholesale rates are generally  levelized based on
the  estimated  energy  cost for the year,  adjusted  for any actual  over/under
collection from the previous year. Revenues are adjusted for differences between
recoverable fuel costs and amounts actually recovered in current rates.

Rate Proceedings

Reference is made to Note 3 to each registrant's  financial statements in Item 8
herein  for a  discussion  of rate  matters.  Reference  is also  made to GULF's
"Management's  Discussion  and Analysis - Future  Earnings  Potential" in Item 7
herein for a discussion of recent Florida PSC matters.

                                      I-14


Integrated Resource Planning

GEORGIA and SAVANNAH filed a new  Integrated  Resource Plan with the Georgia PSC
on January 31, 2001.  The plans specify how GEORGIA and SAVANNAH each intends to
meet the future  electrical  needs of their  customers  through a combination of
demand-side and supply-side  resources.  The Georgia PSC must pre-certify  these
new resources.  Once certified,  all prudently  incurred  construction costs and
purchased power costs will be recoverable through rates.


      In July 1998,  the Georgia PSC  approved  GEORGIA's  and  SAVANNAH's  1998
Integrated Resource Plans as filed, with minor modifications. The approved plans
identify  resource  needs of  approximately  800  megawatts  to 1,200  megawatts
starting in the summer of 2002. As a result, GEORGIA and SAVANNAH issued a joint
request for  proposals  for their  collective  needs of 800  megawatts  to 1,200
megawatts for 2002 and 2003. The bids were evaluated against self-build options,
and a  certification  filing for the  selected  resources  was  approved  by the
Georgia PSC in March 2000.  The selected  resources  for retail needs in Georgia
are: (1) a 7-year  purchased  power  agreement with the West Georgia  Generating
Company for 310 megawatts starting in 2002, increasing to 465 megawatts in 2005,
and  terminating  at the end of  2009;  and  (2) a 7  1/2-year  purchased  power
agreement  for two 568  megawatt  combined  cycle  units to be  located at Plant
Wansley  starting in 2002 and  terminating  at the end of 2009.  SAVANNAH  has a
7-year  purchased  power  agreement  with GEORGIA for 200 megawatts of the 1,136
megawatt  addition at Plant Wansley  starting in 2002 and  terminating  in 2009.
After 2009, this capacity will be available to the wholesale market.


     On December 15, 2000,  GEORGIA filed a  certification  request for a 7-year
purchased power  agreement for 571 megawatts  starting in 2003 and 610 megawatts
starting in 2004 to be served from two combined  cycle units at Plant Goat Rock;
and 615  megawatts  in 2004 to be served  from a  combined  cycle  unit at Plant
Autaugaville.  In addition, GEORGIA is seeking certification for upgrades from 3
megawatts to 9 megawatts at Plant Goat Rock Hydro units 1 and 2.

    GEORGIA expects the Georgia PSC to approve the 2001 Integrated Resource Plan
and grant certification of the purchased power agreements in July 2001.

Environmental Cost Recovery Plans

GULF and MISSISSIPPI  both have retail rate mechanisms that provide for recovery
of environmental  compliance costs. For a description of these plans, see Note 3
to each of GULF's and MISSISSIPPI's financial statements in Item 8 herein.

Employee Relations

The  companies of the SOUTHERN  system had a total of 26,021  employees on their

     Except as discussed below under "Titles to Property," the principal  plants
and other  important units of the integrated  Southeast  utilities and SEGCO are
owned in fee by the  respective  companies.  It is the opinion of  management of
each such company that its operating  properties are  adequately  maintained and
are substantially in good operating condition.

     MISSISSIPPI owns a 79-mile length of 500-kilovolt  transmission  line which
is leased to Entergy Gulf  States.  The line,  completed  in 1984,  extends from
Plant Daniel to the  Louisiana  state line.  Entergy Gulf States is paying a use
fee over a forty-year  period covering all expenses and the  amortization of the
original $57 million cost of the line.  At December  31, 2000,  the  unamortized
portion of this cost was $34.8 million.

     The all-time maximum demand on the integrated Southeast utilities and SEGCO
was  31,359,000  kilowatts  and  occurred in August 2000.  This amount  excludes
demand  served by  capacity  retained  by MEAG and  Dalton and  excludes  demand
associated with power  purchased from OPC and SEPA by its preference  customers.
The reserve margin for the integrated Southeast utilities and SEGCO at that time
was 8.1%. For additional information on peak demands,  reference is made to Item
6 - SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA herein.

     ALABAMA and GEORGIA will incur significant costs in  decommissioning  their
nuclear  units  at the end of their  useful  lives.  (See  Item 1 -  BUSINESS  -
"Regulation - Atomic Energy Act of 1954" and Note 1 to SOUTHERN's, ALABAMA's and
GEORGIA's financial statements in Item 8 herein.)



Jointly-Owned Facilities

ALABAMA and GEORGIA have sold and GEORGIA has purchased  undivided  interests in
certain generating plants and other related facilities to or from non-affiliated
parties.  The percentages of ownership  resulting from these transactions are as
follows:





     ALABAMA and GEORGIA have  contracted to operate and maintain the respective
units in which each has an interest (other than Rocky Mountain and  Intercession
City, as described below) as agent for the joint owners.

     In  addition,  GEORGIA has  commitments  regarding a portion of a 5 percent
interest  in Plant  Vogtle  owned by MEAG that are in effect  until the later of
retirement of the plant or the latest stated maturity  date of MEAG's bonds
issued to finance such  ownership  interest.  The payments for capacity are
required whether any capacity is available. The energy cost is a function  of
each  unit's  variable  operating  costs.  Except for the
portion of the  capacity  payments  related to the 1987 and 1990  write-offs  of
Plant  Vogtle  costs,  the cost of such  capacity  and  energy  is  included  in
purchased power from non-affiliates in GEORGIA's  Statements of Income in Item 8
herein.


                                      I-19


Titles to Property

The  integrated  Southeast  utilities'  and SEGCO's  interests in the  principal
plants (other than certain pollution control facilities, one small hydroelectric
generating  station  leased by  GEORGIA  and the land on which  five  combustion
turbine  generators of MISSISSIPPI  are located,  which is held by easement) and
other  important  units of the  respective  companies  are  owned in fee by such
companies,  subject only to the liens of applicable  mortgage indentures (except
for SEGCO) and to  excepted  encumbrances  as defined  therein.  The  integrated
Southeast  utilities own the fee interests in certain of their principal  plants
as tenants in common.  (See Item 2 -  PROPERTIES  -  "Jointly-Owned  Facilities"
herein.)  Properties such as electric  transmission and  distribution  lines and
steam heating  mains are  constructed  principally  on  rights-of-way  which are
maintained  under franchise or are held by easement only. A substantial  portion
of lands  submerged  by  reservoirs  is held under  flood  right  easements.  In
substantially  all of its coal  reserve  lands,  SEGCO owns or will own the coal
only, with adequate rights for the mining and removal thereof.

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2000 Annual Report


The management of Southern Company has prepared -- and is responsible for -- the
consolidated financial statements and related information included in this
report. These statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States and necessarily include amounts that are
based on the best estimates and judgments of management. Financial information
throughout this annual report is consistent with the financial statements.

   The company maintains a system of internal accounting controls to provide
reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and that the accounting records
reflect only authorized transactions of the company. Limitations exist in any
system of internal controls, however, based on a recognition that the cost of
the system should not exceed its benefits. The company believes its system of
internal accounting controls maintains an appropriate cost/benefit relationship.

   The company's system of internal accounting controls is evaluated on an
ongoing basis by the company's internal audit staff. The company's independent
public accountants also consider certain elements of the internal control system
in order to determine their auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the financial statements.

   The audit committee of the board of directors, composed of five independent
directors provides a broad overview of management's financial reporting and
control functions. Periodically, this committee meets with management, the
internal auditors, and the independent public accountants to ensure that these
groups are fulfilling their obligations and to discuss auditing, internal
controls, and financial reporting matters. The internal auditors and independent
public accountants have access to the members of the audit committee at any
time.

   Management believes that its policies and procedures provide reasonable
assurance that the company's operations are conducted according to a high
standard of business ethics.

   In management's opinion, the consolidated financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position, results of operations,
and cash flows of Southern Company and its subsidiary companies in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS


To Southern Company:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and consolidated
statements of capitalization of Southern Company (a Delaware corporation) and
subsidiary companies as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the related
consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, common stockholders'
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 2000. These financial statements are the responsibility of the company's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

   We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

   In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements (pages II-18 through
II-40)referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Southern Company and subsidiary companies as of December 31, 2000
and 1999, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2000, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL
CONDITION
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2000 Annual Report


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
- ---------------------

OVERVIEW OF CONSOLIDATED EARNINGS

Southern Company's solid financial performance resulted in record earnings for
2000. Higher earnings were driven by both strong growth of selling electricity
in the Southeast and by the global subsidiary's competitive energy supply
business outside the Southeast. Reported earnings in both 2000 and 1999
reflected significant items not related to the normal day-to-day business
activities. After adjusting for these items, earnings per share for 2000 was
$2.13 compared with $1.90 in 1999. Earnings as reported and the details of
earnings as adjusted are shown in the following table.

   In April 2000, Southern Company announced an initial public offering of up to
19.9 percent of Mirant Corporation -- formerly Southern Energy, Inc. -- and its
intentions to spin off the remaining ownership of Mirant to Southern Company
stockholders within 12 months of the initial stock offering. On October 2, 2000,
Mirant completed an initial public offering of 66.7 million shares of common
stock.

   On February 19, 2001, Southern Company's board of directors approved the spin
off of the remaining ownership of 272 million Mirant shares to be completed in a
tax free distribution on April 2, 2001. As a result of the spin off, Southern
Company financial statements and related information reflect Mirant as
discontinued operations.

   A reconciliation of reported consolidated earnings, including discontinued
operations, to earnings as adjusted -- which exclude non-day to day business
items -- and the related explanations are as follows:

                             Consolidated         Earnings

===============================================================

   Mirant's transition costs shown in the table include charges related to
becoming a public company and changes in their tax strategy in Asia.

   In 2000 and 1999, Southern Company recorded asset impairment charges related
to Mobile Energy Services -- see Note 3 to the financial statements. In 1999,
Mirant sold a portion of its business in the United Kingdom. Work force
reduction programs began in late 1999 for a German utility in which Mirant has
an ownership interest.

SOUTHERN COMPANY BUSINESS ACTIVITIES

Discussion of the results of operations is focused on the traditional business
of the integrated Southeast utilities. The remaining portion of Southern
Company's other business activities include telecommunications, energy products
and services, leveraged leasing activities, as well as the parent holding
company. The impact of these other business activities on the consolidated
results of operations is not significant. For more information, see Note 12.

Integrated Southeast Utilities

The five integrated Southeast utilities provide electric service in four states.
These utilities are Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Gulf Power, Mississippi Power,
and Savannah Electric. A condensed income statement for these companies is as

Revenues

Operating revenues for the integrated Southeast utilities in 2000 and the amount
of change from the prior year are as follows:

- ---------------------------------------------------------------

   Base revenues increased $174 million in 2000 as a result of continued
customer growth in the traditional service area and the positive impact of
weather on energy sales. However, total base revenues of $5.8 billion in 1999
declined as a result of a Georgia Power rate reduction and recorded revenue
sharing in 1999. For additional information, see Note 3 to the financial
statements under "Georgia Power 1998 Retail Rate Order." Customer growth in the
Southeast somewhat offset the rate decrease.

   Electric rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel
costs, the energy component of purchased power costs, and certain other costs.
Under these fuel cost recovery provisions, fuel revenues generally equal fuel
expenses -- including the fuel component of purchased energy -- and do not
affect net income. However, cash flow is affected by the economic loss from
untimely recovery of these receivables. Each company has filed or will be filing
for approval of new fuel rates to be more reflective of escalating fuel costs.

   Revenues from sales for resale within the service area were up as a result of
additional demand during the hot summer of 2000. Sales for resale revenues
within the service area were $350 million in 1999, down 6.5 percent from the
prior year. This sharp decline resulted primarily from supplying less
electricity under contractual agreements with certain wholesale customers in
1999.

   Energy sales for resale outside the service area are principally unit power
sales under long-term contracts to Florida utilities. Economy energy and energy
under short-term contracts are also sold for resale outside the service area.
Revenues from long-term unit power contracts have both a capacity and energy
component. Capacity revenues reflect the recovery of fixed costs and a return on
investment under the contracts. Energy is generally sold at variable cost. The
capacity and energy components of the unit power contracts were as follows:

                                    2000       1999       1998

Total                               $355       $331       $348
===============================================================

   Capacity revenues in 2000 and 1999 varied slightly compared with the prior
year as a result of adjustments and true-ups related to contractual pricing. No
significant declines in the amount of capacity are scheduled until the
termination of the contracts in 2010.

Energy Sales

The changes in revenues for the traditional business in the Southeast are
influenced heavily by the amount of energy sold each year. Kilowatt-hour sales
for 2000 and the percent change by year were as follows:

                         Amount            Percent Change
   (billions of          ------     ---------------------------

===============================================================

   The rate of growth in 2000 total retail energy sales was very strong.
Residential energy sales reflected a substantial increase as a result of the
hotter-than-normal summer weather and the number of residential customers served
increased by 59,000 during the year. Commercial and industrial sales, both in


                                       II-9



MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2000 Annual Report


2000 and 1999, continued to show slight gains in excess of the national
averages. This reflects the strength of business and economic conditions in
Southern Company's traditional service area in the southeastern United States.
The rate of increase in 1999 total retail energy sales was significantly lower
than in 1998. Residential energy sales experienced a decline as a result of
milder weather in 1999, which strongly affected the total retail sales increase
of 1.7 percent. Energy sales to retail customers are projected to increase at an
average annual rate of 2.1 percent during the period 2001 through 2011.

   Sales to customers outside the service area under long-term contracts for
unit power sales increased 21 percent in 2000 and increased 19 percent in 1999.
These changes in sales were influenced by weather and fluctuations in prices for
oil and natural gas, the primary fuel sources for utilities with which the
company has long-term contracts. However, these fluctuations in energy sales
under long-term contracts have minimal effects on earnings because the energy is
generally sold at variable cost.

Expenses

In 2000, operating expenses of $7.4 billion increased $645 million compared with
the prior year. The costs to produce electricity for the traditional business in
2000 increased by $498 million to meet higher energy demands. Non-production
operation and maintenance expenses increased $47 million in 2000. In 2000,
depreciation and amortization expenses increased $89 million of which $50
million resulted from the 1998 Georgia Power rate order as referred to earlier.

   In 1999, operating expenses of $6.7 billion decreased $240 million. This
decline was driven by a reduction of $277 million accelerated depreciation of
plant being recorded primarily as a result of the 1998 Georgia Power rate order.
The costs to produce electricity for the traditional business in the Southeast
for 1999 increased by $68 million to meet higher energy demands. All other
operation and maintenance expenses declined by $44 million.

   Fuel costs constitute the single largest expense for the integrated Southeast
utilities. The mix of fuel sources for generation of electricity is determined
primarily by system load, the unit cost of fuel consumed, and the availability
of hydro and nuclear generating units. The amount and sources of generation and
the average cost of fuel per net kilowatt-hour generated -- within the
traditional business service area -- were as follows:

                                    2000       1999       1998

- -------------------------------------------------------------------

   In 2000, fuel and purchased power costs increased $504 million as a result of
10.6 billion more kilowatt-hours being sold than in 1999. Demand was met with
some 2.5 billion additional kilowatt-hours being purchased and using generation
with higher unit fuel cost than last year.

   Total fuel and purchased power costs of $2.7 billion in 1999 increased only
$20 million while total energy sales increased 2.0 billion kilowatt-hours
compared with the amounts recorded in 1998. Continued efforts to control energy
costs helped lower the average cost of fuel per net kilowatt-hour generated in
1999.

   Total interest charges and other financing costs in 2000 increased $15
million reflecting new generating units being constructed requiring some
external financing. Total interest charges and other financing costs in 1999
decreased $44 million from amounts reported in the previous year. The decline
reflected additional refinancing of debt in 1999.

Discontinued Operations

Mirant is a global energy company whose businesses include competitive
electricity distribution companies, independent power projects, and energy
trading and risk management companies.


                                      II-10




MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2000 Annual Report


   On February 19, 2001, Southern Company's board of directors approved the spin
off of Mirant, to be effective on April 2, 2001. As a result of this action,
Mirant's financial and related information is shown as discontinued operations.
All historical financial statements, footnotes, and related disclosures have
been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation.

   Earnings from discontinued operations are shown net of income taxes and
minority interest. Southern Company earnings per share as adjusted was $2.13 in
2000, of which Mirant's earnings as adjusted contributed approximately $0.60 per
share. On the same basis in 1999, Southern Company earnings per share was $1.90,
of which $0.47 was attributed to Mirant.

Effects of Inflation

Southern Company's traditional business of the integrated Southeast utilities is
subject to rate regulation and income tax laws that are based on the recovery of
historical costs. Therefore, inflation creates an economic loss because the
company is recovering its costs of investments in dollars that have less
purchasing power. While the inflation rate has been relatively low in recent
years, it continues to have an adverse effect on Southern Company because of the
large investment in utility plant with long economic lives. Conventional
accounting for historical cost does not recognize this economic loss nor the
partially offsetting gain that arises through financing facilities with
fixed-money obligations such as long-term debt and preferred securities. Any
recognition of inflation by regulatory authorities is reflected in the rate of
return allowed.

Future Earnings Potential

The results of continuing operations for the past three years are not
necessarily indicative of future earnings potential. The level of Southern
Company's future earnings depends on numerous factors. The two major factors are
the ability of the regulated integrated Southeast utilities to achieve energy
sales growth while containing cost in a more competitive environment; and the
profitability of the new competitive market-based wholesale generating
facilities being added.

   The traditional business or the five Southeast utilities currently operate as
vertically integrated companies providing electricity to customers within the
traditional service area of the southeastern United States. Prices for
electricity provided to retail customers are set by state public service
commissions under cost-based regulatory principles. Retail rates and earnings
are reviewed and adjusted periodically within certain limitations based on
earned return on equity. See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional
information about these and other regulatory matters.

   Future earnings for the traditional business in the near term will depend
upon growth in energy sales, which is subject to a number of factors. These
factors include weather, competition, new short and long-term contracts with
neighboring utilities, energy conservation practiced by customers, the
elasticity of demand, and the rate of economic growth in the traditional service
area.

   The electric utility industry in the United States is continuing to evolve as
a result of regulatory and competitive factors. Among the primary agents of
change has been the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Energy Act). The Energy Act
allows independent power producers (IPPs) to access a utility's transmission
network in order to sell electricity to other utilities. This enhances the
incentive for IPPs to build cogeneration plants for a utility's large industrial
and commercial customers and sell energy generation to other utilities. Also,
electricity sales for resale rates are affected by wholesale transmission access
and numerous potential new energy suppliers, including power marketers and
brokers.

   Although the Energy Act does not permit retail customer access, it was a
major catalyst for the current restructuring and consolidation taking place
within the utility industry. Numerous federal and state initiatives are in
varying stages to promote wholesale and retail competition. Among other things,
these initiatives allow customers to choose their electricity provider. Some
states have approved initiatives that result in a separation of the ownership
and/or operation of generating facilities from the ownership and/or operation of
transmission and distribution facilities. While various restructuring and
competition initiatives have been discussed in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and
Mississippi, none have been enacted. Enactment would require numerous issues to
be resolved, including significant ones relating to recovery of any stranded
investments, full cost recovery of energy produced, and other issues related to
the current energy crisis in California. As a result of this crisis, many states

                                       II-11



MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2000 Annual Report


have either discontinued or delayed implementation of initiatives involving
retail deregulation. The inability of a company to recover its investments,
including the regulatory assets described in Note 1 to the financial statements,
could have a material adverse effect on financial condition and results of
operations.

   Continuing to be a low-cost producer could provide opportunities to increase
market share and profitability in markets that evolve with changing regulation.
Conversely, if Southern Company's integrated Southeast utilities do not remain
low-cost producers and provide quality service, then energy sales growth could
be limited, and this could significantly erode earnings.

   To adapt to a less regulated, more competitive environment, Southern Company
continues to evaluate and consider a wide array of potential business
strategies. These strategies may include business combinations, acquisitions
involving other utility or non-utility businesses or properties, internal
restructuring, disposition of certain assets, or some combination thereof.
Furthermore, Southern Company may engage in other new business ventures that
arise from competitive and regulatory changes in the utility industry. Pursuit
of any of the above strategies, or any combination thereof, may significantly
affect the business operations and financial condition of Southern Company.

   On December 20, 1999, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued
its final rule on Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs). The order
encouraged utilities owning transmission systems to form RTOs on a voluntary
basis. After participating in regional conferences with customers and other
members of the public to discuss the formation of RTOs, utilities were required
to make a filing with the FERC. Southern Company filed on October 16, 2000, a
proposal for the creation of an RTO. The proposal is for the formation of a
for-profit company that would have control of the bulk power transmission system
of Southern Company and any other participating utilities. Participants would
have the option to either maintain their ownership, divest, sell, or lease their
assets to the proposed RTO. If the FERC accepts the proposal as filed, the
creation of an RTO is not expected to have a material impact on Southern
Company's financial statements. The outcome of this matter cannot now be
determined.

   The Energy Act amended the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (PUHCA)
to allow holding companies to form exempt wholesale generators to sell power
largely free of regulation under PUHCA. These entities are able to own and
operate power generating facilities and sell power to affiliates -- under
certain restrictions.

   Southern Company is aggressively working to maintain and expand its share of
wholesale sales in the southeastern power markets. In January 2001, Southern
Company announced the formation of a new subsidiary -- Southern Power Company.
The new subsidiary will own, manage, and finance wholesale generating assets in
the Southeast. Southern Power will be the primary growth engine for Southern
Company's market-based energy business. Energy from its assets will be marketed
to wholesale customers under the Southern Company name. By 2005, plans call for
Southern Power to have developed or acquired more than 7,500 megawatts dedicated
to the competitive wholesale business. Within 10 years, the new wholesale
generating company's goal is to own more than 15,000 megawatts.

   In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No.
87, Employers' Accounting for Pensions, Southern Company recorded non-cash
income of approximately $130 million in 2000. Pension plan income in 2001 is
expected to be less as a result of plan amendments. Future pension income is
dependent on several factors including trust earnings and changes to the plan.
For more information, see Note 2.

   Southern Company is involved in various matters being litigated. See Note 3
to the financial statements for information regarding material issues that could
possibly affect future earnings.

   Compliance costs related to current and future environmental laws and
regulations could affect earnings if such costs are not fully recovered. The
Clean Air Act and other important environmental items are discussed later under
"Environmental Matters."

   The staff of the SEC has questioned certain of the current accounting
practices of the electric utility industry -- including Southern Company's --
regarding the recognition, measurement, and classification in the financial
statements of decommissioning costs for nuclear generating facilities. In
response to these questions, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) is
reviewing the accounting for liabilities related to the retirement of long-lived

                                       II-12



MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2000 Annual Report


assets, including nuclear decommissioning. If the FASB issues new accounting
rules, the estimated costs of retiring Southern Company's nuclear and other
facilities may be required to be recorded as liabilities in the Consolidated
Balance Sheets. Also, the annual provisions for such costs could change. Because
of the company's current ability to recover asset retirement costs through
rates, these changes would not have a significant adverse effect on results of
operations. See Note 1 to the financial statements under "Depreciation and
Nuclear Decommissioning" for additional information.

   The integrated Southeast utilities are subject to the provisions of FASB
Statement No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation. In
the event that a portion of a company's operations is no longer subject to these
provisions, the company would be required to write off related regulatory assets
and liabilities that are not specifically recoverable, and determine if any
other assets have been impaired. See Note 1 to the financial statements under
"Regulatory Assets and Liabilities" for additional information.

New Accounting Standard

In June 2000, FASB issued Statement No. 138, an amendment of Statement  No. 133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.  Statement No.
133, as amended, establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative
instruments and for hedging activities.  Statement No. 133 requires that
certain derivative instruments be recorded in the balance sheet as either an
asset or liability measured at fair value, and that changes in the fair value
be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria
are met.

   Southern Company utilizes financial instruments to reduce its exposure to
changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Southern Company
also enters into commodity related forward contracts to limit exposure to
changing prices on certain fuel purchases and electricity purchases and sales.

   Substantially all of these bulk energy purchases and sales meet the
definition of a derivative under Statement No. 133. In many cases, these
transactions meet the normal purchase and sale exception and the related
contracts will continue to be accounted for under the accrual method. Certain of
these instruments qualify as cash flow hedges resulting in the deferral of
related gains and losses in other comprehensive income until the hedged
transactions occur. Any ineffectiveness will be recognized currently in net
income. However, others will be required to be marked to market through current
period income.

   Southern Company adopted Statement No. 133 effective January 1, 2001. The
cumulative effect of adoption was a reduction of approximately $300 million in
comprehensive income, which was all related to discontinued operations. The
impact on net income was immaterial. The application of the new rules is still
evolving and further guidance from FASB is expected, which could additionally
impact Southern Company's financial statements. Also, as wholesale energy
markets mature, the accounting for future transactions could be significantly
impacted by Statement No. 133, resulting in more volatility in net income and
comprehensive income.

FINANCIAL CONDITION
- ------------------

Overview

Southern Company's financial condition continues to remain strong. In 2000, the
integrated Southeast utilities' earnings were at the high end of their
respective allowed range of return on equity. Also, earnings from discontinued
operations made a solid contribution. These factors drove the reported
consolidated net income to a record $1.31 billion in 2000. The quarterly
dividend declared in January 2001 was 33 1/2 cents per share, or $1.34 annually.
Southern Company is committed to a goal of maintaining its current annual
dividend of $1.34 per share and to grow the dividend over time consistent with
earnings expectations. After the Mirant spin off, Southern Company's target
will be to grow earnings per share at an average annual rate of 3 to 5 percent.

   Gross property additions to utility plant from continuing operations were
$2.2 billion in 2000. The majority of funds needed for gross property additions
since 1997 has been provided from operating activities. The Consolidated
Statements of Cash Flows provide additional details.

Market Price Risk

Southern Company is exposed to market risks, including changes in interest
rates, currency exchange rates, and certain commodity prices. To manage the

                                       II-13



MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2000 Annual Report


volatility attributable to these exposures, the company nets the exposures to
take advantage of natural offsets and enters into various derivative
transactions for the remaining exposures pursuant to the company's policies in
areas such as counterparty exposure and hedging practices. Generally, company
policy is that derivatives are to be used only for hedging purposes. Derivative
positions are monitored using techniques that include market valuation and
sensitivity analysis.

   The company's market risk exposures relative to interest rate changes have
not changed materially versus the previous reporting period. In addition, the
company is not aware of any facts or circumstances that would significantly
impact such exposures in the near-term.

   If the company sustained a 100 basis point change in interest rates for all
variable rate debt, the change would affect annualized interest expense by
approximately $23 million at December 31, 2000. Based on the company's overall
interest rate exposure at December 31, 2000, including derivative and other
interest rate sensitive instruments, a near-term 100 basis point change in
interest rates would not materially affect the consolidated financial
statements.

   Due to cost-based rate regulations, the integrated Southeast utilities have
limited exposure to market volatility in interest rates, commodity fuel prices,
and prices of electricity. To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in
electricity prices, the companies enter into fixed price contracts for the
purchase and sale of electricity through the wholesale electricity market.
Realized gains and losses are recognized in the income statement as incurred. At
December 31, 2000, exposure from these activities was not material to the
consolidated financial statements.

   For additional information, see Note 1 to the financial statements under
"Financial Instruments for Non-Trading Activities."

Capital Structure

During 2000, the integrated Southeast utilities sold, through public
authorities, $79 million of pollution control revenue bonds. In addition, senior
notes of $650 million were issued in 2000. The companies continued to reduce
financing costs by retiring higher-cost securities. Retirements of bonds and
senior notes, including maturities, totaled $298 million during 2000, $1.2
billion during 1999, and $1.7 billion during 1998. Retirements of preferred
stock totaled $86 million during 1999 and $239 million during 1998.

   In December 2000, Southern Company issued 28 million treasury shares of
common stock through a public offering. The offering raised $800 million and
was priced at $28.50 per share. The proceeds were used to reduce debt.

   In April 1999, Southern Company announced the repurchase of up to 50 million
shares of its common stock over a two-year period through open market or
privately negotiated transactions. Under this program, 50 million shares were
repurchased by February 2000 at an average price of $25.53. Funding for the
program was provided from Southern Company's commercial paper program. At the
close of 2000, the company's common stock market value was 33 1/4 per share,
compared with book value of $15.69 per share. The market-to-book value ratio was
212 percent at the end of 2000, compared with 170 percent at year-end 1999, and
207 percent at year-end 1998.

Capital Requirements for Construction

The construction program of Southern Company is budgeted at $2.9 billion for
2001, $2.6 billion for 2002, and $1.7 billion for 2003. Actual construction
costs may vary from this estimate because of changes in such factors as:
business conditions; environmental regulations; nuclear plant regulations; load
projections; the cost and efficiency of construction labor, equipment, and
materials; and the cost of capital. In addition, there can be no assurance that
costs related to capital expenditures will be fully recovered.

   Southern Company has approximately 6,300 megawatts of new generating capacity
scheduled to be placed in service by 2003. Approximately 4,100 megawatts of
additional new capacity will be dedicated to the wholesale market and owned by
Southern Power. Significant construction of transmission and distribution
facilities and upgrading of generating plants will be continuing for the
traditional business in the Southeast.

Other Capital Requirements

In addition to the funds needed for the construction program, approximately $1.4
billion will be required by the end of 2003 for present improvement fund
requirements and maturities of long-term debt. Also, the subsidiaries will
continue to retire higher-cost debt and preferred stock and replace these
obligations with lower-cost capital if market conditions permit.

Environmental Matters

On November 3, 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) brought a civil
action in the U.S. District Court against Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and the
system service company. The complaint alleges violations of the prevention of
significant deterioration and new source review provisions of the Clean Air Act
with respect to five coal-fired generating facilities in Alabama and Georgia.
The civil action requests penalties and injunctive relief, including an order
requiring the installation of the best available control technology at the
affected units. The EPA concurrently issued to the integrated Southeast
utilities a notice of violation related to 10 generating facilities, which
includes the five facilities mentioned previously. In early 2000, the EPA filed
a motion to amend its complaint to add the violations alleged in its notice of
violation, and to add Gulf Power, Mississippi Power, and Savannah Electric as
defendants. The complaint and notice of violation are similar to those brought
against and issued to several other electric utilities. These complaints and
notices of violation allege that the utilities had failed to secure necessary
permits or install additional pollution equipment when performing maintenance
and construction at coal burning plants constructed or under construction prior
to 1978. On August 1, 2000, the U.S. District Court granted Alabama Power's
motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction in Georgia and granted the system
service company's motion to dismiss on the grounds that it neither owned nor
operated the generating units involved in the proceedings. On January 12, 2001,
the EPA re-filed its claims against Alabama Power in federal district court in
Birmingham, Alabama. The EPA did not include the system service company in the
new complaint. Southern Company believes that its integrated utilities complied
with applicable laws and the EPA's regulations and interpretations in effect at
the time the work in question took place. The Clean Air Act authorizes civil
penalties of up to $27,500 per day per violation at each generating unit. Prior
to January 30, 1997, the penalty was $25,000 per day. An adverse outcome of this
matter could require substantial capital expenditures that cannot be determined
at this time and possibly require payment of substantial penalties. This could
affect future results of operations, cash flows, and possibly financial
condition if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates.

   In November 1990, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (Clean Air Act) were
signed into law. Title IV of the Clean Air Act -- the acid rain compliance
provision of the law -- significantly affected Southern Company. Specific
reductions in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from fossil-fired
generating plants were required in two phases. Phase I compliance began in 1995
and some 50 generating units were brought into compliance with Phase I
requirements.

   Southern Company achieved Phase I sulfur dioxide compliance at the affected
plants by switching to low-sulfur coal, which required some equipment upgrades.
Construction expenditures for Phase I nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide
emissions compliance totaled approximately $300 million.

   Phase II sulfur dioxide compliance was required in 2000. Southern Company
used emission allowances and fuel switching to comply with Phase II
requirements. Also, equipment to control nitrogen oxide emissions was installed
on additional system fossil-fired units as necessary to meet Phase II limits and
ozone non-attainment requirements for metropolitan Atlanta through 2000.
Compliance for Phase II and initial ozone non-attainment requirements increased
total construction expenditures through 2000 by approximately $100 million.

   The one-hour ozone non-attainment standards for the Atlanta and Birmingham
areas have been set and must be implemented in May 2003. Seven generating plants
will be affected in the Atlanta area and two plants in the Birmingham area.
Additional construction expenditures for compliance with these new rules are
currently estimated at approximately $935 million.

   A significant portion of costs related to the acid rain and ozone
non-attainment provisions of the Clean Air Act is expected to be recovered
through existing ratemaking provisions. However, there can be no assurance that
all Clean Air Act costs will be recovered.

                                       II-15



MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2000 Annual Report


     In July 1997,  the EPA revised the national ambient air quality standards
for ozone and particulate matter. This revision made the standards significantly
more stringent. In the subsequent litigation of these standards, the U.S.
Supreme Court recently dismissed certain challenges but found the EPA's
implementation program for the new ozone standard  unlawful and remanded it to
the EPA. In addition,  the Federal District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals
will address other legal challenges to these standards in mid-2001. If the
standards are eventually upheld, implementation could be required by 2007 to
2010.

   In September 1998, the EPA issued the final regional nitrogen oxide reduction
rules to the states for implementation. Compliance is required by May 31, 2004.
The final rule affects 21 states, including Alabama and Georgia. Additional
construction expenditures for compliance with these new rules are currently
estimated at approximately $195 million.

   In December 2000, the EPA completed its utility studies for mercury and other
hazardous air pollutants (HAPS) and issued a determination that an emission
control program for mercury and, perhaps, other HAPS is warranted. The program
is to be developed over the next four years under the Maximum Achievable Control
Technology (MACT) provisions of the Clean Air Act. This determination is being
challenged in the courts. In January 2001, the EPA proposed guidance for the
determination of Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) emission controls
under the Regional Haze Regulations. Installation of BART controls is expected
to take place around 2010. Litigation of the BART rules is probable in the near
future.

   Implementation of the final state rules for these initiatives could require
substantial further reductions in nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, mercury, and
other HAPS emissions from fossil-fired generating facilities and other
industries in these states. Additional compliance costs and capital expenditures
resulting from the implementation of these rules and standards cannot be
determined until the results of legal challenges are known, and the states have
adopted their final rules. Reviews by the new administration in Washington, D.C.
add to the uncertainties associated with BART guidance and the MACT
determination for mercury and other HAPS.

   The EPA and state environmental regulatory agencies are reviewing and
evaluating various other matters including: control strategies to reduce
regional haze; limits on pollutant discharges to impaired waters; water intake
restrictions; and hazardous waste disposal requirements. The impact of any new
standards will depend on the development and implementation of applicable
regulations.

   Southern Company must comply with other environmental laws and regulations
that cover the handling and disposal of hazardous waste. Under these various
laws and regulations, the subsidiaries could incur substantial costs to clean up
properties. The subsidiaries conduct studies to determine the extent of any
required cleanup costs and have recognized in their respective financial
statements costs to clean up known sites. These costs for Southern Company
amounted to $4 million in 2000, $4 million in 1999, and $6 million in 1998.
Additional sites may require environmental remediation for which the
subsidiaries may be liable for a portion or all required cleanup costs. See Note
3 to the financial statements for information regarding Georgia Power's
potentially responsible party status at a site in Brunswick, Georgia.

   Several major pieces of environmental legislation are being considered for
reauthorization or amendment by Congress. These include: the Clean Air Act; the
Clean Water Act; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and
Liability Act; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; the Toxic Substances
Control Act; and the Endangered Species Act. Changes to these laws could affect
many areas of Southern Company's operations. The full impact of any such changes
cannot be determined at this time.

   Compliance with possible additional legislation related to global climate
change, electromagnetic fields, and other environmental and health concerns
could significantly affect Southern Company. The impact of new legislation -- if
any -- will depend on the subsequent development and implementation of

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2000 Annual Report


applicable regulations. In addition, the potential exists for liability as the
result of lawsuits alleging damages caused by electromagnetic fields.

Sources of Capital

The amount and timing of additional equity capital to be raised in 2001 -- as
well as in subsequent years -- will be contingent on Southern Company's
investment opportunities. Equity capital can be provided from any combination of
public offerings, private placements, or the company's stock plans.

   The integrated Southeast utilities plan to obtain the funds required for
construction and other purposes from sources similar to those used in the past,
which were primarily from internal sources. However, the type and timing of any
financings -- if needed -- will depend on market conditions and regulatory
approval. In recent years, financings primarily have utilized unsecured debt and
trust preferred securities.

   Southern Power will use both external funds and equity capital from Southern
Company to finance its construction program.

   To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, Southern Company had at the
beginning of 2001 approximately $199 million of cash and cash equivalents and
$5.1 billion of unused credit arrangements with banks.

Cautionary Statement Regarding
Forward-Looking Information

Southern Company's 2000 Annual Report includes forward-looking statements in
addition to historical information. Forward-looking information includes, among
other things, statements concerning the strategic goals for Southern Company's
new wholesale business and also Southern Company's earnings per share and
earnings growth goals. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be
identified by terminology such as "may," "will," "should," "expects," "plans,"
"anticipates," "believes," "estimates," "predicts," "potential" or "continue" or
the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. Southern Company
cautions that there are various important factors that could cause actual
results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking
statements; accordingly, there can be no assurance that such indicated results
will be realized. These factors include the impact of recent and future federal
and state regulatory change, including legislative and regulatory initiatives
regarding deregulation and restructuring of the electric utility industry and
also changes in environmental and other laws and regulations to which Southern
Company and its subsidiaries are subject, as well as changes in application of
existing laws and regulations; current and future litigation, including the
pending EPA civil action against Georgia Power and potentially other of Southern
Company's subsidiaries and the race discrimination litigation against certain of
Southern Company's subsidiaries; the extent and timing of the entry of
additional competition in the markets of Southern Company's subsidiaries;
potential business strategies, including acquisitions or dispositions of assets
or businesses, which cannot be assured to be completed or beneficial; internal
restructuring or other restructuring options, that may be pursued by Southern
Company; state and federal rate regulation in the United States and in foreign
countries in which Southern Company's subsidiaries operate; political, legal and
economic conditions and developments in the United States and in foreign
countries in which Southern Company's subsidiaries operate; financial market
conditions and the results of financing efforts; the impact of fluctuations in
commodity prices, interest rates and customer demand; weather and other natural
phenomena; the performance of projects undertaken by the non-traditional

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2000 Annual Report


1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
   POLICIES

General

Southern Company is the parent company of five integrated Southeast utilities, a
system service company, Southern Communications Services (Southern LINC),
Southern Company Energy Solutions, Southern Nuclear Operating Company (Southern
Nuclear), Mirant Corporation -- formerly Southern Energy, Inc. -- and other
direct and indirect subsidiaries. The integrated Southeast utilities -- Alabama
Power, Georgia Power, Gulf Power, Mississippi Power, and Savannah Electric --
provide electric service in four states. Contracts among the integrated
Southeast utilities -- related to jointly owned generating facilities,
interconnecting transmission lines, and the exchange of electric power -- are
regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and/or the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The system service company provides,
at cost, specialized services to Southern Company and subsidiary companies.
Southern LINC provides digital wireless communications services to the
integrated Southeast utilities and also markets these services to the public
within the Southeast. Southern Company Energy Solutions develops new business
opportunities related to energy products and services. Southern Nuclear provides
services to Southern Company's nuclear power plants. Mirant acquires, develops,
builds, owns, and operates power production and delivery facilities and provides
a broad range of energy-related services to utilities and industrial companies
in selected countries around the world. Mirant businesses include independent
power projects, integrated utilities, a distribution company, and energy trading
and marketing businesses outside the southeastern United States. As a result of
the approved spin off of Mirant, Southern Company's financial statements and
related information, both current and historical, reflect Mirant as discontinued
operations. For additional information, see Note 11.

   The financial statements reflect Southern Company's investments in the
subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. All material intercompany items have been
eliminated in consolidation. Certain prior years' data presented in the
consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform with the
current year presentation.

   Southern Company is registered as a holding company under the Public Utility
Holding Company Act of 1935 (PUHCA). Both the company and its subsidiaries are
subject to the regulatory provisions of the PUHCA. The integrated Southeast
utilities also are subject to regulation by the FERC and their respective state
public service commissions. The companies follow accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States and comply with the accounting policies and
practices prescribed by their respective commissions. The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the U.S. requires the use of estimates, and the actual results may differ
from those estimates.

Regulatory Assets and Liabilities

The integrated Southeast utilities are subject to the provisions of Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 71, Accounting for the Effects
of Certain Types of Regulation. Regulatory assets represent probable future
revenues associated with certain costs that are expected to be recovered from
customers through the ratemaking process. Regulatory liabilities represent
probable future reductions in revenues associated with amounts that are expected
to be credited to customers through the ratemaking process. Regulatory assets
and (liabilities) reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31
relate to the following:

                                           2000           1999

===============================================================

   In the event that a portion of a company's operations is no longer subject to
the provisions of FASB Statement No. 71, the company would be required to write
off related regulatory assets and liabilities that are not specifically
recoverable through regulated rates. In addition, the company would be required
to determine if any impairment to other assets exists, including plant, and
write down the assets, if impaired, to their fair value.

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2000 Annual Report


Revenues and Fuel Costs

Revenues are recognized as services are rendered. Unbilled revenues are accrued
at the end of each fiscal period. Fuel costs are expensed as the fuel is used.
Electric rates for the integrated Southeast utilities include provisions to
adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, the energy component of
purchased power costs, and certain other costs. Revenues are adjusted for
differences between recoverable fuel costs and amounts actually recovered in
current regulated rates.

   Southern Company has a diversified base of customers. No single customer or
industry comprises 10 percent or more of revenues. For all periods presented,
uncollectible accounts continued to average less than 1 percent of revenues.

   Fuel expense includes the amortization of the cost of nuclear fuel and a
charge, based on nuclear generation, for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear
fuel. Total charges for nuclear fuel included in fuel expense amounted to $136
million in 2000, $137 million in 1999, and $133 million in 1998. Alabama Power
and Georgia Power have contracts with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) that
provide for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel. The DOE failed to
begin disposing of spent fuel in January 1998 as required by the contracts, and
the companies are pursuing legal remedies against the government for breach of
contract. Effective June 2000, an on-site dry storage facility for Plant Hatch
became operational. Sufficient capacity is believed to be available to continue
dry storage operations at Plant Hatch through the life of the plant. Sufficient
fuel storage capacity currently is available at Plant Vogtle to maintain
full-core discharge capability for both units into the year 2014. Sufficient
fuel storage capacity is available at Plant Farley to maintain full-core
discharge capability until the refueling outage scheduled in 2006 for Farley
Unit 1 and the refueling outage scheduled in 2008 for Farley Unit 2. Procurement
of on-site dry spent fuel storage capacity at Plant Farley is in progress, with
the intent to place the capacity in operation as early as 2005.

   Also, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 required the establishment of a Uranium
Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund, which is funded in part by
a special assessment on utilities with nuclear plants. This assessment is being
paid over a 15-year period, which began in 1993. This fund will be used by the
DOE for the decontamination and decommissioning of its nuclear fuel enrichment
facilities. The law provides that utilities will recover these payments in the
same manner as any other fuel expense. Alabama Power and Georgia Power -- based
on its ownership interests -- estimate their respective remaining liability at
December 31, 2000, under this law to be approximately $25 million and $19
million. These obligations are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Depreciation and Nuclear Decommissioning

Depreciation of the original cost of plant in service is provided primarily by
using composite straight-line rates, which approximated 3.4 percent in both 2000
and 1999 and 3.3 percent in 1998. When property subject to depreciation is
retired or otherwise disposed of in the normal course of business, its original
cost -- together with the cost of removal, less salvage -- is charged to
accumulated depreciation. Minor items of property included in the original cost
of the plant are retired when the related property unit is retired. Depreciation
expense includes an amount for the expected costs of decommissioning nuclear
facilities and removal of other facilities.

   Georgia Power recorded accelerated amortization and depreciation amounting to
$135 million in 2000, $85 million in 1999, and $314 million in 1998. See Note 3
under "Georgia Power 1998 Retail Rate Order" for additional information.

   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) requires all licensees operating
commercial power reactors to establish a plan for providing, with reasonable
assurance, funds for decommissioning. Alabama Power and Georgia Power have
external trust funds to comply with the NRC's regulations. Amounts previously
recorded in internal reserves are being transferred into the external trust
funds over periods approved by the respective state public service commissions.
The NRC's minimum external funding requirements are based on a generic estimate
of the cost to decommission the radioactive portions of a nuclear unit based on
the size and type of reactor. Alabama Power and Georgia Power have filed plans
with the NRC to ensure that -- over time -- the deposits and earnings of the
external trust funds will provide the minimum funding amounts prescribed by the
NRC.

   Site study cost is the estimate to decommission a specific facility as of the
site study year, and ultimate cost is the estimate to decommission a specific
facility as of its retirement date. The estimated costs of decommissioning --
both site study costs and ultimate costs -- based on the most current study as

   The decommissioning cost estimates are based on prompt dismantlement and
removal of the plant from service. The actual decommissioning costs may vary
from the above estimates because of changes in the assumed date of
decommissioning, changes in NRC requirements, or changes in the assumptions used
in making these estimates.

   Georgia Power has filed with the NRC an application requesting a 20-year
renewal of the licenses for both units at Plant Hatch, which would permit the
operation of both units until 2034.

   Annual provisions for nuclear decommissioning are based on an annuity method
as approved by the respective state public service commissions. The amount
expensed in 2000 and fund balances were as follows:

     Alabama Power's decommissioning costs for ratemaking are based on the site
study. Effective January 1, 1999, the Georgia Public Service Commission (GPSC)
increased Georgia Power's annual provision for decommissioning expenses TO $28
million. This amount is based on the NRC generic estimate to decommission  the
radioactive portion of the facilities as of 1997. The estimates are $526 million
and $438 million for plants Hatch and Vogtle, respectively.  The ultimate costs
associated with the 1997 NRC minimum funding requirements are $1.1 billion and
$1.3  billion for plants Hatch and  Vogtle,  respectively.  Alabama  Power and
Georgia Power expect their respective state public service commissions to
periodically review and adjust, if necessary, the amounts collected in rates for
the anticipated cost of decommissioning.

Income Taxes

Southern Company uses the liability method of accounting for deferred income
taxes and provides deferred income taxes for all significant income tax
temporary differences. Investment tax credits utilized are deferred and
amortized to income over the average lives of the related property.

Property, Plant, and Equipment

Property, plant, and equipment is stated at original cost less regulatory
disallowances and impairments. Original cost includes: materials; labor; minor
items of property; appropriate administrative and general costs; payroll-related
costs such as taxes, pensions, and other benefits; and the estimated cost of
funds used during construction. The cost of funds used during construction was
$71 million in 2000, $36 million in 1999, and $19 million in 1998. The cost of
maintenance, repairs, and replacement of minor items of property is charged to
maintenance expense. The cost of replacements of property -- exclusive of minor
items of property -- is capitalized.

Leveraged Leases

Southern Company has several leveraged lease agreements -- ranging up to 30
years -- that primarily relate to energy generation, distribution, and
transportation assets. The investment income earned from these leveraged leases
is immaterial for all periods presented.

Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2000 Annual Report


Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles

Southern Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment when events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not
be recoverable. The determination of whether an impairment has occurred is based
on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets, as
compared to the carrying value of the assets. If an impairment has occurred, the
amount of the impairment recognized is determined by estimating the fair value
of the assets and recording a provision for loss if the carrying value is
greater than the fair value. For assets identified as held for sale, the
carrying value is compared to the estimated fair value less the cost to sell in
order to determine if an impairment provision is required. Until the assets are
disposed of, their estimated fair value is reevaluated when circumstances or
events change.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

For purposes of the consolidated financial statements, temporary cash
investments are considered cash equivalents. Temporary cash investments are
securities with original maturities of 90 days or less.

Materials and Supplies

Generally, materials and supplies include the costs of transmission,
distribution, and generating plant materials. Materials are charged to inventory
when purchased and then expensed or capitalized to plant, as appropriate, when
installed.

Comprehensive Income

Comprehensive income -- consisting of net income and foreign currency
translation adjustments, net of taxes -- is presented in the consolidated
financial statements. The objective of the statement is to report a measure of
all changes in common stock equity of an enterprise that result from
transactions and other economic events of the period other than transactions
with owners.

Financial Instruments for Non-Trading Activities

Southern Company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to
fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and certain
commodity prices. Gains and losses on qualifying hedges are deferred and
recognized either in income or as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the
hedged item when the transaction occurs.

   Southern Company is exposed to losses related to financial instruments in the
event of counterparties' nonperformance. The company has established controls to
determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties in order to
mitigate the company's exposure to counterparty credit risk. The company is
unaware of any counterparties that will fail to meet their obligations.

   Southern Company has firm purchase commitments for equipment that require
payment in euros. As a hedge against fluctuations in the exchange rate for
euros, the company entered into forward currency swaps. The notional amount is
32 million euros maturing in 2001 through 2002. At December 31, 2000, the
unrecognized gain on these swaps was approximately $3 million.

   Other Southern Company financial instruments for which the carrying amount
did not equal fair value at December 31 were as follows:

                                       Carrying           Fair

Long-term debt:
   At December 31, 2000                  $7,815         $7,702
   At December 31, 1999                   7,483          7,046
Capital and preferred securities:
   At December 31, 2000                   2,246          2,190
   At December 31, 1999                   2,246          1,942
- ------------------------------------------------------------------

   The fair values for long-term debt and capital and preferred securities were
based on either closing market price or closing price of comparable instruments.

2. Retirement Benefits

Southern Company has defined benefit, trusteed, pension plans that cover
substantially all employees. Southern Company provides certain medical care and
life insurance benefits for retired employees. Substantially all these employees
may become eligible for such benefits when they retire. The integrated Southeast
utilities fund trusts to the extent required by their respective regulatory
commissions. In late 2000, Southern Company adopted several pension and
postretirement benefits plan changes that had the effect of increasing benefits
to both current and future retirees. The effects of these changes will be to
increase annual pension and postretirement benefits costs by approximately
$28 million and $26 million, respectively.

percent for 2000, decreasing gradually to 5.50 percent through the year 2005,
and remaining at that level  thereafter.  An annual increase or decrease in the
assumed medical care cost trend rate of 1 percent would affect the accumulated
benefit obligation and the service and interest cost components at December 31,
2000 as follows:

Employee Savings Plan

Southern Company also sponsors a 401(k) defined contribution plan covering
substantially all employees. The company provides a 75 percent matching
contribution up to 6 percent of an employee's base salary. Total matching
contributions made to the plan for the years 2000, 1999, and 1998 were
$49 million, $46 million, and $43 million, respectively.

 3. CONTINGENCIES AND REGULATORY
    MATTERS

Georgia Power Potentially Responsible Party Status

In January 1995, Georgia Power and four other unrelated entities were notified
by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that they have been designated as
potentially responsible parties under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation, and Liability Act with respect to a site in Brunswick, Georgia. As
of December 31, 2000, Georgia Power had recorded approximately $5 million in
cumulative expenses associated with Georgia Power's agreed-upon share of the
removal and remedial investigation and feasibility study costs for this site.

   The final outcome of this matter cannot now be determined. However, based on
the nature and extent of Georgia Power's activities relating to the site,
management believes that the company's portion of any remaining remediation
costs should not be material to the financial statements.

Environmental Litigation

On November 3, 1999, the EPA brought a civil action in the U.S. District Court
against Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and the system service company. The
complaint alleges violations of the prevention of significant deterioration and
new source review provisions of the Clean Air Act with respect to five
coal-fired generating facilities in Alabama and Georgia. The civil action
requests penalties and injunctive relief, including an order requiring the
installation of the best available control technology at the affected units. The
Clean Air Act authorizes civil penalties of up to $27,500 per day, per violation
at each generating unit. Prior to January 30, 1997, the penalty was $25,000 per
day.

   The EPA concurrently issued to the integrated Southeast utilities a notice of
violation related to 10 generating facilities, which includes the five
facilities mentioned previously. In early 2000, the EPA filed a motion to amend
its complaint to add the violations alleged in its notice of violation, and to
add Gulf Power, Mississippi Power, and Savannah Electric as defendants. The
complaint and notice of violation are similar to those brought against and
issued to several other electric utilities. These complaints and notices of
violation allege that the utilities had failed to secure necessary permits or
install additional pollution equipment when performing maintenance and
construction at coal burning plants constructed or under construction prior to
1978. On August 1, 2000, the U.S. District Court granted Alabama Power's motion
to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction in Georgia and granted the system service
company's motion to dismiss on the grounds that it neither owned nor operated
the generating units involved in the proceedings. On January 12, 2001, the EPA
re-filed its claims against Alabama Power in federal district court in
Birmingham, Alabama. The EPA did not include the system service company in the
new complaint. Southern Company believes that its integrated utilities complied
with applicable laws and the EPA's regulations and interpretations in effect at
the time the work in question took place.

NOTES (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2000 Annual Report


   An adverse outcome of this matter could require substantial capital
expenditures that cannot be determined at this time and possibly require payment
of substantial penalties. This could affect future results of operations, cash
flows, and possibly financial condition if such costs are not recovered through
regulated rates.

Mobile Energy Services' Petition for Bankruptcy

Mobile Energy Services Holdings (MESH), a subsidiary of Southern Company, is the
owner and operator of a facility that generates electricity, produces steam, and
processes black liquor as part of a pulp and paper complex in Mobile, Alabama.
On January 14, 1999, MESH filed a petition for Chapter 11 bankruptcy relief in
the U.S. Bankruptcy Court. This action was in response to Kimberly-Clark Tissue
Company's (Kimberly-Clark) announcement in May 1998 of plans to close its pulp
mill, effective September 1, 1999. The pulp mill had historically provided 50
percent of MESH's revenues.

   As a result of settlement discussions with Kimberly-Clark and MESH's
bondholders, Southern Company recorded in 1999 a $69 million after-tax write
down of its investment in MESH. Southern Company recorded an additional $10
million after-tax write down in 2000. At December 31, 2000, MESH had total
assets of $373 million and senior debt outstanding of $190 million of first
mortgage bonds and $72 million related to tax-exempt bonds. In connection with
the bond financings, Southern Company provided certain limited guarantees, in
lieu of funding debt service and maintenance reserve accounts with cash. As of
December 31, 2000, Southern Company had paid the full $41 million pursuant to
the guarantees. Southern Company continues to have guarantees outstanding of
certain potential environmental and other obligations of MESH that represent a
maximum contingent liability of $19 million at December 31, 2000. Mirant has
agreed to indemnify Southern Company for any future obligations incurred under
such guarantees.

   On August 4, 2000, MESH filed a proposed plan of reorganization with the
bankruptcy court. The proposed plan of reorganization was again amended on
February 21, 2001. Changes in circumstances since the filing of the amended plan
may require further modifications of the plan. Southern Company expects that
approval of a plan of reorganization would result in a termination of Southern
Company's ownership interest in MESH, but would not affect Southern Company's
continuing guarantee obligations described earlier. The final outcome of this
matter cannot now be determined.

California Electricity Markets Litigation

Five lawsuits have been filed in the superior courts of California alleging that
certain owners of electric generation facilities in California, including
Southern Company, engaged in various unlawful and anticompetitive acts that
served to manipulate wholesale power markets and inflate wholesale electricity
prices in California. Four of the suits seek class action status. One lawsuit
naming Southern Company, Mirant, and other generators as defendants alleges
that, as a result of the defendants' conduct, customers paid approximately $4
billion more for electricity than they otherwise would have and seeks an award
of treble damages, as well as other injunctive and equitable relief. The other
suits likewise seek treble damages and equitable relief. While two of the suits
name Southern Company as a defendant, it appears that the allegations, as they
may relate to Southern Company, are directed to activities of subsidiaries of
Mirant. One such suit names Mirant itself as a defendant. Southern Company has
notified Mirant of its claim for indemnification for costs associated with these
actions under the terms of the master separation agreement that governs the spin
off of Mirant. Mirant has undertaken the defense of all of the claims. The final
outcome of these lawsuits cannot now be determined.

Race Discrimination Litigation

On July 28, 2000, a lawsuit alleging race discrimination was filed by three
Georgia Power employees against Georgia Power, Southern Company, and the system
service company in the United States District Court for the Northern District of
Georgia. The lawsuit also raised claims on behalf of a purported class. The
plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages in an unspecified amount, as
well as injunctive relief. On August 14, 2000, the lawsuit was amended to add
four more plaintiffs and a new defendant, Southern Company Energy Solutions,
Inc. The lawsuit is in the discovery phase. The final outcome of this matter
cannot now be determined.

Alabama Power Rate Adjustment Procedures

In November 1982, the Alabama Public Service Commission (APSC) adopted rates
that provide for periodic adjustments based upon Alabama Power's earned return


                                     II-31




NOTES (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2000 Annual Report


on end-of-period retail common equity. The rates also provide for adjustments to
recognize the placing of new generating facilities in retail service. Both
increases and decreases have been placed into effect since the adoption of these
rates. The rate adjustment procedures allow a return on common equity range of
13 percent to 14.5 percent and limit increases or decreases in rates to 4
percent in any calendar year. There is a moratorium on any periodic retail rate
increases (but not decreases) until July 2001.

   In December 1995, the APSC issued an order authorizing Alabama Power to
reduce balance sheet items -- such as plant and deferred charges -- at any time
the company's actual base rate revenues exceed the budgeted revenues. In April
1997, the APSC issued an additional order authorizing Alabama Power to reduce
balance sheet asset items. This order authorizes the reduction of such items up
to an amount equal to five times the total estimated annual revenue reduction
resulting from future rate reductions initiated by Alabama Power. In 1998,
Alabama Power -- in accordance with the 1995 rate order -- recorded $33 million
of additional amortization of premium on reacquired debt. Alabama Power did not
record any additional amounts in 2000 or 1999.

   The ratemaking procedures will remain in effect until the APSC votes to
modify or discontinue them.

Georgia Power 1998 Retail Rate Order

As required by the GPSC, Georgia Power filed a general rate case in 1998. On
December 18, 1998, the GPSC approved a three-year rate order for Georgia Power
ending December 31, 2001. Under the terms of the order, Georgia Power's earnings
will continue to be evaluated against a retail return on common equity range of
10 percent to 12.5 percent. Georgia Power's annual retail rates were decreased
by $262 million effective January 1, 1999, and by an additional $24 million
effective January 1, 2000. In addition, the order provided for $85 million
annually to be applied to accelerated amortization or depreciation of assets,
and up to an additional $50 million annually in 2000 and 2001 of any earnings
above the 12.5 percent return. In accordance with the rate order, Georgia Power
recorded accelerated amortization of $135 million and $85 million in 2000 and
1999, respectively. In May 2000, the GPSC ordered that these funds be maintained
in a regulatory liability account and ordered that interest be accrued on this
account at the prime rate. In 2000, interest of $10 million was recorded. These
amounts are reflected on the balance sheets in deferred credits and other
liabilities, other.

   Two-thirds of any additional earnings above the 12.5 percent return in any
year will be applied to rate reductions and the remaining one-third retained by
Georgia Power. In both 2000 and 1999, Georgia Power's return was above 12.5
percent, and accordingly, it recorded in 1999 $79 million of revenues to be
refunded to customers in 2000. In 2000, Georgia Power recorded $44 million as an
estimate of revenues to be refunded in 2001. Georgia Power is required to file a
general rate case on July 1, 2001. At that time, the GPSC is expected to
determine whether the rate order should be continued, modified, or discontinued.

4. JOINT OWNERSHIP AGREEMENTS

Alabama Power owns an undivided interest in units 1 and 2 of Plant Miller and
related facilities jointly with Alabama Electric Cooperative, Inc.

   Georgia Power owns undivided interests in plants Vogtle, Hatch, Scherer, and
Wansley in varying amounts jointly with Oglethorpe Power Corporation (OPC), the
Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia, the city of Dalton, Georgia, Florida
Power & Light Company (FP&L), and Jacksonville Electric Authority (JEA). In
addition, Georgia Power has joint ownership agreements with OPC for the Rocky
Mountain facilities and with Florida Power Corporation (FPC) for a combustion
turbine unit at Intercession City, Florida.

   At December 31, 2000, Alabama Power's and Georgia Power's ownership and
investment (exclusive of nuclear fuel) in jointly owned facilities with the
above entities were as follows:

NOTES (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2000 Annual Report


   Alabama Power and Georgia Power have contracted to operate and maintain the
jointly owned facilities -- except for the Rocky Mountain project and
Intercession City -- as agents for their respective co-owners. The companies'
proportionate share of their plant operating expenses is included in the
corresponding operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

5. LONG-TERM POWER SALES AND LEASE
   AGREEMENTS

The integrated Southeast utilities have long-term contractual agreements for the
sale and lease of capacity to certain non-affiliated utilities located outside
the system's service area. These agreements are firm and are related to specific
generating units. Because the energy is generally provided at cost under these
agreements, profitability is primarily affected by capacity revenues.

   Unit power from specific generating plants is currently being sold to FP&L,
FPC, and JEA. Under these agreements, approximately 1,500 megawatts of capacity
is scheduled to be sold annually unless reduced by FP&L, FPC, and JEA for the
periods after 2000 with a minimum of three years notice -- until the expiration
of the contracts in 2010. Capacity revenues from unit power sales amounted to
$177 million in 2000, $174 million in 1999, and $196 million in 1998.

   During 2000, Georgia Power and Mississippi Power entered into certain
operating leases for portions of their generating unit capacity. Capacity
revenues from these operating leases amounted to $20 million in 2000 and are
included in the financial statements as sales for resale. Minimum future
capacity revenues from noncancelable operating leases as of December 31, 2000
are as follows:

6. Income Taxes

At December 31, 2000, the tax-related regulatory assets and liabilities were
$957 million and $551 million, respectively. These assets are attributable to
tax benefits flowed through to customers in prior years and to taxes applicable
to capitalized interest. These liabilities are attributable to deferred taxes
previously recognized at rates higher than current enacted tax law and to
unamortized investment tax credits. The following tables and disclosures exclude
discontinued operations.

   Details of income tax provisions are as follows:

   The tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of
assets and liabilities in the financial statements and their respective tax
bases, which give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities, are as follows:

in 2000, $30 million in 1999, and $38 million in 1998. At December 31, 2000, all
investment tax credits available to reduce federal income taxes payable had been
utilized.

   The provision for income taxes differs from the amount of income taxes
determined by applying the applicable U.S. Federal statutory rate to earnings
before income taxes and preferred dividends of subsidiaries, as a result of the
following:

                                       2000      1999     1998

tax expense is computed on a stand-alone basis.

7. Common Stock

Stock Issued and Repurchased

The amount and timing of additional equity capital to be raised in 2001 -- as
well as in subsequent years -- will be contingent on Southern Company's
investment opportunities. Equity capital may be provided from any combination of
public offerings, private placements, or the company's stock plans.

   In December 2000, Southern Company issued 28 million treasury shares of
common stock through a public offering. The offering, which included an
overallotment of 3 million shares, raised some $800 million and was priced at
$28.50 per share. The proceeds were used to repay short-term commercial paper.

   In April 1999, Southern Company's Board of Directors approved the repurchase
of up to 50 million shares of Southern Company's common stock over a two-year
period through open market or privately negotiated transactions. Under this
program, 50 million shares were repurchased by February 2000 at an average price
of $25.53. Funding for the program was provided from Southern Company's
commercial paper program.

Shares Reserved

At December 31, 2000, a total of 59 million shares was reserved for issuance
pursuant to the Southern Investment Plan, the Employee Savings Plan, the Outside
Directors Stock Plan, and the Performance Stock Plan.

Performance Stock Plan

The performance stock plan provides non-qualified stock options to a large
segment of Southern Company's employees ranging from line management to
executives. As of December 31, 2000, 5,744 current and former employees
participated in the plan. The maximum number of shares of common stock that may
be issued under the plan may not exceed 40 million. The prices of options
granted to date have been at the fair market value of the shares on the dates
of grant. Options granted to date become exercisable pro rata over a maximum
period of three years from the date of grant. Options outstanding will expire
no later than 10 years after the date of grant, unless terminated earlier by
the Southern Company Board of Directors in accordance with the plan. Stock
option activity in 1999 and 2000 for the plan is summarized below:

Common Stock Dividend Restrictions

The income of Southern Company is derived primarily from equity in earnings of
its subsidiaries. At December 31, 2000, consolidated retained earnings included
$3.5 billion of undistributed retained earnings of the subsidiaries. Of this
amount, $2.0 billion was restricted against the payment by the subsidiary
companies of cash dividends on common stock under terms of bond indentures.

8. FINANCING

Capital and Preferred Securities

Company or subsidiary obligated mandatorily redeemable capital and preferred
securities have been issued by special purpose financing entities of Southern
Company and its subsidiaries. Substantially all the assets of these special
financing entities are junior subordinated notes issued by the related company
seeking financing. Each of these companies considers that the mechanisms and
obligations relating to the capital or preferred securities issued for its
benefit, taken together, constitute a full and unconditional guarantee by it of
the respective special financing entities' payment obligations with respect to

January 1 of each year, other than those issued to collateralize pollution
control revenue bonds and other obligations. The requirements may be satisfied
by depositing cash or reacquiring bonds, or by pledging additional property
equal to 166 2/3 percent of such requirements.

   With respect to the collateralized pollution control revenue bonds, the
integrated Southeast utilities have authenticated and delivered to trustees a
like principal amount of first mortgage bonds as security for obligations under
installment sale or loan agreements. The principal and interest on the first
mortgage bonds will be payable only in the event of default under the
agreements.

   Improvement fund requirements and/or serial maturities through 2005
applicable to other long-term debt are as follows: $67 million in 2001; $489
million in 2002; $479 million in 2003; $323 million in 2004; and $600 million in
2005.

Assets Subject to Lien

Each of Southern Company's subsidiaries is organized as a legal entity, separate
and apart from Southern Company and its other subsidiaries. The subsidiary
companies' mortgages, which secure the first mortgage bonds issued by the
companies, constitute a direct first lien on substantially all of the companies'
respective fixed property and franchises. There are no agreements or other
arrangements among the subsidiary companies under which the assets of one
company have been pledged or otherwise made available to satisfy obligations of
Southern Company or any of its other subsidiaries.

Bank Credit Arrangements

At the beginning of 2001, unused credit arrangements with banks totaled $5.1
billion, of which $3.2 billion expires during 2001, $1.0 billion during 2002,
and $900 million during 2003 and 2004. The following table outlines the credit
arrangements by company:

==============================================================

   Approximately $2.9 billion of the credit facilities allows for term loans
ranging from one to three years. Most of the agreements include stated borrowing
rates but also allow for competitive bid loans.

   All of the credit arrangements require payment of commitment fees based on
the unused portion of the commitments or the maintenance of compensating
balances with the banks. These balances are not legally restricted from
withdrawal. Of the total $5.1 billion in unused credit, $2.1 billion, $1.65
billion, and $780 million are syndicated credit arrangements of Southern
Company, Georgia Power, and Alabama Power, respectively. These facilities also
require the payment of agent fees.

   A portion of the $5.1 billion unused credit with banks is allocated to
provide liquidity support to the companies' variable rate pollution control
bonds. The amount of variable rate pollution control bonds requiring liquidity
support as of December 31, 2000, was $1.6 billion.

   Southern Company, Alabama Power, and Georgia Power borrow through commercial
paper programs that have the liquidity support of committed bank credit
arrangements. In addition, the companies from time to time borrow under
uncommitted lines of credit with banks.

9. COMMITMENTS

Construction Program

Southern  Company is engaged in continuous construction programs, currently
estimated to total $2.9 billion in 2001, $2.6  billion in 2002,  and $1.7
billion in 2003. The construction programs are subject to periodic review
and revision, and actual construction costs may vary  from the above
estimates because of numerous factors. These factors include:  changes in
business conditions;  acquisition of additional generating assets; revised
load growth estimates;  changes in environmental regulations;  changes in
existing nuclear plants to meet new regulatory requirements;  increasing
costs of labor, equipment,  and materials; and cost of capital. At December
31, 2000, significant purchase commitments were outstanding in connection
with the construction program.  Southern Company has approximately  6,300
megawatts of additional generating capacity scheduled to be placed in
service by 2003.

Fuel and Purchased Power Commitments

To supply a portion of the fuel requirements of the generating plants, Southern
Company has entered into various long-term commitments for the procurement of
fossil and nuclear fuel. In most cases, these contracts contain provisions for
price escalations, minimum purchase levels, and other financial commitments.
Also, Southern Company has entered into various long-term commitments for the
purchase of electricity. Total estimated long-term obligations at December 31,
2000, were as follows:

Southern Company has operating lease agreements with various terms and
expiration dates. These expenses totaled $42 million, $35 million, and $26
million for 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively. At December 31, 2000, estimated
minimum rental commitments for noncancelable operating leases were as follows:

Guarantees

Southern Company has made separate guarantees to certain counterparties
regarding performance of contractual commitments by Mirant's trading and
marketing subsidiaries. At December 31, 2000, the total notional amount of
guarantees was $419 million and the estimated fair value of net contractual
commitments outstanding was approximately $259 million. Based upon a statistical
analysis of credit risk, Southern Company's potential exposure under these
contractual commitments would not materially differ from the estimated fair
value.

   At December 31, 2000, Southern Company had guaranteed $11 million related to
a Mirant purchase power agreement. The guarantee expires March 2001.
Southern Company also has guaranteed certain of Mirant's foreign currency swap
transactions. At December 31, 2000, notional amounts under these swaps were the
differences between (pound)44 million and $68 million and between DM370 million
and $206 million; however, due to favorable exchange ratesSouthern Company had
no exposure under these guarantees. The sterling and deutsche mark swaps expire
in 2002 and 2003, respectively.

   After the spin off, Mirant will pay Southern Company a monthly fee of 1
percent on the average aggregate maximum principal amount of all guarantees
outstanding until they are replaced or expire. Southern Company's guarantees
related to Mirant trading and marketing activities are limited to a maximum
of $425 million, with any guarantees since October 2, 2000 expiring no later
than October 2, 2001. Mirant must use reasonable efforts to release Southern
Company from all such support arrangements and will indemnify Southern Company
for any obligations incurred.

10. NUCLEAR INSURANCE

Under the Price-Anderson Amendments Act of 1988, Alabama Power and Georgia Power
maintain agreements of indemnity with the NRC that, together with private
insurance, cover third-party liability arising from any nuclear incident
occurring at the companies' nuclear power plants. The act provides funds up to
$9.5 billion for public liability claims that could arise from a single nuclear
incident. Each nuclear plant is insured against this liability to a maximum of
$200 million by private insurance, with the remaining coverage provided by a
mandatory program of deferred premiums that could be assessed, after a nuclear
incident, against all owners of nuclear reactors. A company could be assessed up
to $88 million per incident for each licensed reactor it operates, but not more
than an aggregate of $10 million per incident to be paid in a calendar year for
each reactor. Such maximum assessment, excluding any applicable state premium
taxes, for Alabama Power and Georgia Power -- based on its ownership and buyback
interests -- is $176 million and $178 million, respectively, per incident, but
not more than an aggregate of $20 million per company to be paid for each
incident in any one year.


                                       II-37



NOTES (continued)
Southern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2000 Annual Report


   Alabama Power and Georgia Power are members of Nuclear Electric Insurance
Limited (NEIL), a mutual insurer established to provide property damage
insurance in an amount up to $500 million for members' nuclear generating
facilities.

   Additionally, both companies have policies that currently provide
decontamination, excess property insurance, and premature decommissioning
coverage up to $2.25 billion for losses in excess of the $500 million primary
coverage. This excess insurance is also provided by NEIL.

   NEIL also covers the additional costs that would be incurred in obtaining
replacement power during a prolonged accidental outage at a member's nuclear
plant. Members can be insured against increased costs of replacement power in an
amount up to $3.5 million per week -- starting 12 weeks after the outage -- for
one year and up to $2.8 million per week for the second and third years.

   Under each of the NEIL policies, members are subject to assessments if losses
each year exceed the accumulated funds available to the insurer under that
policy. The current maximum annual assessments for Alabama Power and Georgia
Power under the three NEIL policies would be $17 million and $19 million,
respectively.

   For all on-site property damage insurance policies for commercial nuclear
power plants, the NRC requires that the proceeds of such policies shall be
dedicated first for the sole purpose of placing the reactor in a safe and stable
condition after an accident. Any remaining proceeds are to be applied next
toward the costs of decontamination and debris removal operations ordered by the
NRC, and any further remaining proceeds are to be paid either to the company or
to its bond trustees as may be appropriate under the policies and applicable
trust indentures.

   All retrospective assessments -- whether generated for liability, property,
or replacement power -- may be subject to applicable state premium taxes.

11. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

In April 2000, Southern Company announced an initial public offering of up to
19.9 percent of Mirant and its intentions to spin off the remaining ownership of
Mirant to Southern Company stockholders within 12 months of the initial stock
offering. On October 2, 2000, Mirant completed an initial public offering of
66.7 million shares of common stock priced at $22 per share. This represented
19.7 percent of the 338.7 million shares outstanding. As a result of the stock
offering, Southern Company recorded a $560 million increase in paid-in capital
with no gain or loss being recognized.

   On February 19, 2001, Southern Company's board of directors approved the
spin off of its remaining ownership of 272 million Mirant shares to be
completed in a tax free distribution on April 2, 2001. Shares from the spin off
will be distributed at a ratio of approximately 0.4 for every share of
Southern Company common stock held at record date.

   As a result of the spin off, Southern Company's December 31, 2000, financial
statements have been prepared with Mirant's results of operations and cash flows
shown as discontinued operations. All historical financial statements presented
and footnotes have been reclassified to conform to this presentation, with the
historical assets and liabilities of Mirant presented on the balance sheet as
net assets of discontinued operations.

   Summarized financial information for the discontinued operations is as

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT
Alabama Power Company 2000 Annual Report


The management of Alabama Power Company has prepared -- and is responsible for
- -- the financial statements and related information included in this report.
These statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States and necessarily include amounts that are
based on the best estimates and judgments of management. Financial information
throughout this annual report is consistent with the financial statements.

    The Company maintains a system of internal accounting controls to provide
reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and that the accounting records
reflect only authorized transactions of the Company. Limitations exist in any
system of internal controls, however, based on a recognition that the cost of
the system should not exceed its benefits. The Company believes its system of
internal accounting controls maintains an appropriate cost/benefit relationship.

    The Company's system of internal accounting controls is evaluated on an
ongoing basis by the Company's internal audit staff. The Company's independent
public accountants also consider certain elements of the internal control system
in order to determine their auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the financial statements.

    The audit committee of the board of directors, composed of independent
directors, provides a broad overview of management's financial reporting and
control functions. Periodically, this committee meets with management, the
internal auditors and the independent public accountants to ensure that these
groups are fulfilling their obligations and to discuss auditing, internal
controls, and financial reporting matters. The internal auditors and independent
public accountants have access to the members of the audit committee at any
time.

    Management believes that its policies and procedures provide reasonable
assurance that the Company's operations are conducted according to a high
standard of business ethics.

    In management's opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position, results of operations and cash flows
of Alabama Power Company in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANT


To Alabama Power Company:

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets and statements of capitalization
of Alabama Power Company (an Alabama corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary
of Southern Company) as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the related
statements of income, common stockholder's equity, and cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2000. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

    We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

    In our opinion, the financial statements (pages II-55 through II-73)
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Alabama Power Company as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2000, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL
CONDITION
Alabama Power Company 2000 Annual Report


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

Alabama Power Company's 2000 net income after dividends on preferred stock was
$420 million, representing a $20 million (5 percent) increase from the prior
year. This improvement is primarily attributable to an increase in territorial
sales partially offset by increased non-fuel operating expenses.

    In 1999, earnings were $400 million, representing a 6 percent increase from
the prior year. This increase was due to a decrease in amortization related to
premiums paid to reacquire debt pursuant to an Alabama Public Service Commission
(APSC) order. See Note 3 to the financial statements under "Retail Rate
Adjustment Procedures" for additional details.

    The return on average common equity for 2000 was 13.58 percent compared to
13.85 percent in 1999, and 13.63 percent in 1998.

Revenues

Operating revenues for 2000 were $3.7 billion, reflecting an increase from 1999.
The following table summarizes the principal factors that have affected

     Retail revenues of $3.0 billion in 2000 increased $142 million (5 percent)
from the prior year, compared with an increase of $30 million (1.1 percent) in
1999.  The primary contributors to the increase in revenues in 2000 were the
positive impact of weather on energy sales, continued economic growth in the
Company's service territory, and an increase in fuel revenues.  Fuel revenues
have no effect on net income because they represent the recording of revenues to
offset fuel expenses,  including the fuel component of purchased energy.  Fuel
rates billed to customers are designed to fully recover fluctuating fuel costs
over a period of time.  Higher natural gas prices and decreased hydro production
combined with increased costs of purchased power have resulted in a large
under-recovery of fuel costs at December 31, 2000.  Effective January 2001, the
Company's fuel rate was increased to address this under-recovery. The Company
expects to significantly reduce this balance over a three-year period.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Alabama Power Company 2000 Annual Report


    The $20 million (30.5 percent) increase in other operating revenues in 2000
as compared to 1999 was due primarily to an increase in steam sales in
conjunction with the operation of the Company's co-generation facilities.

    Retail revenues in 1999 increased $30 million (1.1 percent) over 1998. The
predominant factors causing the rise in revenues in 1999 were continued growth
in the Company's service territory, as well as an increase in fuel revenues.
These increases were offset by the effect of milder temperatures in 1999 as
compared to 1998.

    Energy sales for resale outside the service area are predominantly unit
power sales under long-term contracts to Florida utilities. Economy energy and
energy sold under short-term contracts are also sold for resale outside the
service area. Revenues from long-term power contracts have both a capacity and
energy component. Capacity revenues reflect the recovery of fixed costs and a
return on investment under the contracts. Energy is generally sold at variable
cost. These capacity and energy components of the unit power contracts were as
follows:

                           2000         1999        1998

 --------------------------------------------------------
 Total                     $255         $234        $260
 ========================================================

    Capacity revenues from non-affiliates were relatively unchanged in 2000
compared to the prior year. Capacity revenues from non-affiliates in 1999
decreased 13.9 percent compared to 1998. This decrease was attributable to the
lowering of the equity return under formula rate contracts, as well as other
adjustments and true-ups related to contractual pricing.

    Revenues from sales to affiliated companies within the Southern electric
system, as well as purchases of energy, will vary from year to year depending on
demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company.
These transactions did not have a significant impact on earnings.

    Kilowatt-hour (KWH) sales for 2000 and the percent change by year were as

- ---------------------------------------------------------------

    The increases in 2000 and 1999 retail energy sales were primarily due to the
strength of business and economic conditions in the Company's service area. In
2000, residential energy sales experienced a 6.8 percent increase over the prior
year primarily as a result of warmer summer temperatures and cold winter weather
conditions compared to 1999. Assuming normal weather, sales to retail customers
are projected to grow approximately 2.9 percent annually on average during 2001
through 2005.

Expenses

In 2000, total operating expenses of $2.7 billion were up $235 million or 9.4
percent compared with the prior year. This increase was mainly due to a $183
million increase in fuel and purchased power costs, accompanied by a $23 million
increase in maintenance expenses.

    In 1999, total operating expenses of $2.5 billion decreased $13 million or
0.5 percent compared with 1998. This decline was mainly due to a $15 million net
decrease in fuel and purchased power costs and a $23 million decrease in
maintenance expense, offset by an increase in taxes other than income taxes of
$12 million.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Alabama Power Company 2000 Annual Report


    Fuel costs constitute the single largest expense for the Company. The mix of
fuel sources for generation of electricity is determined primarily by system
load, the unit cost of fuel consumed, and the availability of hydro and nuclear
generating units. The amount and sources of generation and the average cost of
fuel per net KWH generated were as follows:

- --------------------------------------------------------------

    In 2000, total fuel and purchased power costs of $1.3 billion increased $183
million (16 percent), while total energy sales increased 4,658 million kilowatt
hours (6.9 percent) compared with the amounts recorded in 1999. Fuel and
purchased power costs in 1999 decreased $15 million (1 percent) compared to
1998.

    Purchased power consists of purchases from affiliates in the Southern
electric system and non-affiliated companies. Purchased power transactions among
the Company and its affiliates will vary from period to period depending on
demand, the availability, and the variable production cost of generating
resources at each company. During 2000, purchased power transactions among the
Company and non-affiliates increased $72 million (77 percent) due to higher
costs associated with these energy purchases and to offset decreased hydro
generation, which was down significantly compared to 1999 as a result of lower
stream flows.

    The 8.4 percent increase in maintenance expense in 2000 as compared to 1999
is primarily attributable to an increase in the maintenance of overhead
distribution lines and additional accruals to partially replenish the natural
disaster reserve. The 7.5 percent decrease in maintenance expenses in 1999 is
primarily attributable to a decrease in distribution expenses.

    Depreciation and amortization expense increased 4.9 percent in 2000 and 2.6
percent in 1999. These increases reflect additions to property, plant, and
equipment.

    Taxes other than income taxes increased $5 million (2.5 percent) in 2000 as
compared to 1999. This increase is attributable to increases in real and
personal property taxes and public utility license taxes.

    Total net interest and other charges increased $7 million (2.7 percent) in
2000. This increase results primarily from an increase in interest on long-term
debt offset by a decrease in other interest charges. Total net interest and
other charges decreased $38 million (12.3 percent) in 1999 primarily from a
decrease in the amortization of premiums on reacquired debt pursuant to an APSC
order. See Note 3 to the financial statements under "Retail Rate Adjustment
Procedures" for additional details.

Effects of Inflation

The Company is subject to rate regulation and income tax laws that are based on
the recovery of historical costs. Therefore, inflation creates an economic loss
because the Company is recovering its costs of investments in dollars that have
less purchasing power. While the inflation rate has been relatively low in
recent years, it continues to have an adverse effect on the Company because of
the large investment in utility plant with long economic lives. Conventional
accounting for historical cost does not recognize this economic loss nor the
partially offsetting gain that arises through financing facilities with
fixed-money obligations, such as long-term debt and preferred securities. Any
recognition of inflation by regulatory authorities is reflected in the rate of
return allowed.

Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations for the past three years are not necessarily
indicative of future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on
numerous factors. The major factor is the ability of the Company to achieve
energy sales growth while containing cost in a more competitive environment.

    The Company currently operates as a vertically integrated utility providing
electricity to customers within its traditional service area located in the


                                      II-48




MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Alabama Power Company 2000 Annual Report


state of Alabama. Prices for electricity provided by the Company to retail
customers are set by the APSC under cost-based regulatory principles.

    Future earnings for the traditional business in the near term will depend
upon growth in energy sales, which is subject to a number of factors. These
factors include weather, competition, new short and long-term contracts with
neighboring utilities, energy conservation practiced by customers, the
elasticity of demand, and the rate of economic growth in the Company's
traditional service area.

    The electric utility industry in the United States is continuing to evolve
as a result of regulatory and competitive factors. Among the primary agents of
change has been the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Energy Act). The Energy Act
allows independent power producers (IPPs) to access a utility's transmission
network in order to sell electricity to other utilities. This enhances the
incentive for IPPs to build cogeneration plants for a utility's large industrial
and/or commercial customers and sell excess energy generation to other
utilities. Also, electricity sales for resale rates are affected by wholesale
transmission access and numerous potential new energy suppliers, including power
marketers and brokers.

   Although the Energy Act does not permit retail customer access, it was a
major catalyst for the current restructuring and consolidation taking place
within the utility industry. Numerous federal and state initiatives are in
varying stages to promote wholesale and retail competition. Among other things,
these initiatives allow customers to choose their electricity provider. Some
states have approved initiatives that result in a separation of the ownership
and/or operation of generating facilities from the ownership and/or operation of
transmission and distribution facilities. While various restructuring and
competition initiatives have been discussed in Alabama, none have been enacted.
In October 2000, the APSC completed a two-year study of electric industry
restructuring, concluding that (i) restructuring of the electric utility
industry in Alabama was not in the public interest and (ii) the APSC itself
would not mandate retail competition or electric industry restructuring without
enabling state legislation. Electric utility restructuring would require
numerous issues to be resolved, including significant ones relating to recovery
of any stranded investments, full cost recovery of energy produced, and other
issues related to the current energy crisis in California. As a result of this
crisis, many states have either discontinued or delayed implementation of
initiatives involving retail deregulation. The inability of the Company to
recover its investments, including the regulatory assets described in Note 1 to
the financial statements, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's
financial statements.

   Continuing to be a low-cost producer could provide opportunities to increase
market share and profitability in markets that evolve with changing regulation.
Conversely, if the Company does not remain a low-cost producer and provide
quality service, then energy sales growth could be limited, and this could
significantly erode earnings.

   On December 20, 1999, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued
its final rule on Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs). The order
encouraged utilities owning transmission systems to form RTOs on a voluntary
basis. After participating in the regional conferences with customers and other
members of the public to discuss the formation of RTOs, utilities were required
to make a filing with the FERC. Southern Company and its integrated southeast
utility subsidiaries, including the Company, filed on October 16, 2000, a
proposal for the creation of an RTO. The proposal is for the formation of a
for-profit company that would have control of the bulk power transmission system
of the Company and any other participating utilities. Participants would have
the option to either maintain their ownership, divest, sell, or lease their
assets to the proposed RTO. If the FERC accepts the proposal as filed, the
creation of an RTO is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's
financial statements. The outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.

   The Energy Act amended the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (PUHCA)
to allow holding companies to form exempt wholesale generators to sell power
largely free of regulation under PUHCA. These entities are able to own and
operate power generating facilities and sell power to affiliates--under certain
restrictions.

   The Company is constructing 1,230 megawatts of wholesale generating
facilities in Autaugaville, Alabama to begin operation in 2003. Half of this
capacity has been certified by the APSC to serve the Company's retail customers

                                      II-49



MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Alabama Power Company 2000 Annual Report



for seven years. The other half of the capacity will be sold into the wholesale
market and will not affect retail rates.

   Southern Company is aggressively working to maintain and expand its share of
wholesale sales in the southeastern power markets. In January 2001, Southern
Company announced the formation of a new subsidiary--Southern Power Company
(SPC). The new subsidiary will own, manage, and finance wholesale generating
assets in the Southeast. SPC will be the primary growth engine for Southern
Company's market-based energy business. Energy from its assets will be marketed
to wholesale customers under the Southern Company name.

   Currently, the Company plans to transfer the generating facilities under
construction in Autaugaville to SPC in 2001. The Company will enter into a
purchased power agreement for half of the capacity of these generating
facilities to serve its territorial customers.

    In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No.
87, Employers' Accounting for Pensions, the Company recorded non-cash income of
approximately $54 million in 2000. Pension plan income in 2001 is expected to be
less as a result of plan amendments. Future pension income is dependent on
several factors including trust earnings and changes to the plan. For more
information, see Note 2.

    Rates to retail customers served by the Company are regulated by the APSC.
Rates for the Company can be adjusted periodically within certain limitations
based on earned retail rate of return compared with an allowed return. There is
a moratorium on any periodic retail rate increases (but not decreases) until
July 2001.

     In  December 1995,  the APSC issued an order authorizing the Company to
reduce balance sheet items -- such as plant and deferred charges -- at any time
the Company's actual base rate revenues exceed the budgeted revenues.  In April
1997,  the APSC issued an additional order authorizing the Company to reduce
balance sheet asset items.  This order authorizes the reduction of such items up
to an amount equal to five times the total estimated annual revenue reduction
resulting from future rate reductions initiated by the Company.

    In April 2000, the APSC approved an amendment to the Company's existing rate
structure to provide for the recovery of retail costs associated with certified
purchased power agreements. In November 2000, the APSC certified a seven-year
purchased power agreement pertaining to 615 megawatts of the Company's wholesale
generating facilities under construction in Autaugaville, Alabama, all of which
will be delivered in 2003. In addition, the APSC certified a seven-year
purchased power agreement with a third party for approximately 630 megawatts;
one half of the power will be delivered in 2003 while the remaining half is
scheduled for delivery in 2004.

    The Company is involved in various matters being litigated. See Note 3 to
the financial statements for information regarding material issues that could
possibly affect future earnings.

    Compliance costs related to current and future environmental laws and
regulations could affect earnings if such costs are not fully recovered. The
Clean Air Act and other important environmental items are discussed later under
"Environmental Matters."

    The staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has questioned
certain of the current accounting practices of the electric utility industry --
including the Company -- regarding the recognition, measurement, and
classification in the financial statements of decommissioning costs for nuclear
generating facilities. In response to these questions, the FASB is reviewing the
accounting for liabilities related to the retirement of long-lived assets,
including nuclear decommissioning. If the FASB issues new accounting rules, the
estimated costs of retiring the Company's nuclear and other facilities may be
required to be recorded as liabilities in the Balance Sheets. Also, the annual
provisions for such costs could change. Because of the Company's current ability
to recover asset retirement costs through rates, these changes would not have a
significant adverse effect on results of operations. See Note 1 to the financial
statements under "Depreciation and Nuclear Decommissioning" for additional
information.

    The Company is subject to the provisions of FASB Statement No. 71,
Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation. In the event that a
portion of the Company's operations is no longer subject to these provisions,
the Company would be required to write off related regulatory assets and
liabilities that are not specifically recoverable, and determine if any other
assets have been impaired. See Note 1 to the financial statements under


                                       II-50



MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Alabama Power Company 2000 Annual Report



"Regulatory Assets and Liabilities" for additional information.

New Accounting Standard

In June 2000,  FASB issued Statement No. 138, an amendment of Statement No.
133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.
Statement No. 133,  as amended, establishes accounting and reporting
standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities. Statement
No. 133 requires  that certain derivative instruments be recorded in the
balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at fair value,  and
that changes in the fair value be recognized currently in earnings  unless
specific hedge accounting criteria are met.

   The Company utilizes financial instruments to reduce its exposure to changes
in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company also enters into commodity
related forward contracts to limit exposure to changing prices on certain fuel
purchases and electricity purchases and sales.

   Substantially all of the Company's bulk energy purchases and sales meet the
definition of a derivative under Statement No. 133. In many cases, these
transactions meet the normal purchase and sale exception and the related
contracts will continue to be accounted for under the accrual method. Certain of
these instruments qualify as cash flow hedges resulting in the deferral of
related gains and losses in other comprehensive income until the hedged
transactions occur. Any ineffectiveness will be recognized currently in net
income. However, others will be required to be marked to market through current
period income.

   The Company adopted Statement No. 133 effective January 1, 2001, with no
material impact. The application of the new rules is still evolving and further
guidance from FASB is expected, which could additionally impact the Company's
financial statements.

Exposure to Market Risk

Due to cost-based rate regulation, the Company has limited exposure to market
volatility in interest rates, commodity fuel prices, and prices of electricity.
To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity prices, the
Company enters into fixed price contracts for the purchase and sale of
electricity through the wholesale electricity market. Realized gains and losses
are recognized in the income statement as incurred. At December 31, 2000,
exposure from these activities was not material to the Company's financial
position, results of operations, or cash flows. Also, based on the Company's
overall interest rate exposure at December 31, 2000, a near-term 100 basis point
change in interest rates would not materially affect the financial statements.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

The Company's financial condition remained stable in 2000. This stability is the
continuation over recent years of growth in retail energy sales and cost control
measures combined with a significant lowering of the cost of capital, achieved
through the refinancing and/or redemption of higher-cost long-term debt and
preferred stock.

    The Company had gross property additions of $871 million in 2000. The
majority of funds needed for gross property additions for the last several years
have been provided from operating activities, principally from earnings and
non-cash charges to income such as depreciation and deferred income taxes. The
Statements of Cash Flows provide additional details.

Capital Structure

The Company's ratio of common equity to total capitalization -- including
short-term debt -- was 42.2 percent in 2000 and 42.4 percent in 1999 and 1998.

    During 2000, the Company issued $250 million of senior notes, the proceeds
of which were used primarily to repay short-term indebtedness.

Capital Requirements

Capital expenditures are estimated to be $735 million for 2001, $891 million for
2002, and $625 million for 2003. See Note 4 to the financial statements for
additional details.


   Actual construction costs may vary from estimates because of changes in such
factors as: business conditions; environmental regulations; nuclear plant
regulations; load projections; the cost and efficiency of construction labor,

                                       II-51



MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Alabama Power Company 2000 Annual Report


equipment, and materials; and the cost of capital. In addition, there can be no
assurance that costs related to capital expenditures will be fully recovered.

Other Capital Requirements

The Company will continue to retire higher-cost debt and preferred stock and
replace these obligations with lower-cost capital if market conditions permit.

Environmental Matters

In November 1990, the Clean Air Act Amendments (Clean Air Act) were signed into
law. Title IV of the Clean Air Act -- the acid rain compliance provision of the
law -- significantly affected the integrated Southeast utility subsidiaries of
Southern Company, including the Company. Specific reductions in sulfur dioxide
and nitrogen oxide emissions from fossil-fired generating plants were required
in two phases. Phase I compliance began in 1995 and some 50 generating plants
within the operating companies of Southern Company were brought into compliance
with Phase I requirements.

   Southern Company achieved Phase I sulfur dioxide compliance at the affected
plants by switching to low-sulfur coal, which required some equipment upgrades.
Construction expenditures for Phase I compliance totaled approximately $25
million for the Company.

    Phase II sulfur dioxide compliance was required in 2000. The Company used
emission allowances and fuel switching to comply with Phase II requirements.
Also, equipment to control nitrogen oxide emissions was installed on additional
system fossil-fired units as necessary to meet Phase II limits. Compliance with
Phase II increased total construction expenditures through 2000 by $63 million

    The one-hour ozone non-attainment standards for the Birmingham area have
been set and must be implemented in May 2003. Two generating plants will be
affected in the Birmingham area. Additional construction expenditures for
compliance with these new rules are currently estimated at approximately $230
million.

    In July 1997, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), revised the
national ambient air quality standards for ozone and particulate matter. This
revision made the standards significantly more stringent. In the subsequent
litigation of these standards, the U. S. Supreme Court recently dismissed
certain challenges but found the EPA's implementation program for the new ozone
standard unlawful and remanded it to the EPA. In addition, the Federal District
of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals will address other legal challenges to
these standards in mid-2001. If the standards are eventually upheld,
implementation could be required by 2007 to 2010.

    In September 1998, the EPA issued the final regional nitrogen oxide
reduction rules to the states for implementation. Compliance is required by May
31, 2004. The final rule affects 21 states including Alabama. If standards and
rules for implementation are upheld, the additional construction expenditures
for compliance are estimated at approximately $189 million.

    A significant portion of costs related to the acid rain and ozone
non-attainment provisions of the Clean Air Act is expected to be recovered
through existing ratemaking provisions. However, there can be no assurance that
all Clean Air Act costs will be recovered.

    On November 3, 1999, the EPA brought a civil action against the Company in
the U. S. District Court. The complaint alleges violations of the prevention of
significant deterioration and new source review provisions of the Clean Air Act
with respect to coal-fired generating facilities at the Company's Plants Miller,
Barry, and Gorgas. The civil action requests penalties and injunctive relief,
including an order requiring the installation of the best available control
technology at the affected units. The EPA concurrently issued a notice of
violation to the Company relating to these specific facilities, as well as
Plants Greene County and Gaston. In early 2000, the EPA filed a motion to amend
its complaint to add the violations alleged in its notice of violation. The
complaint and notice of violation are similar to those brought against and
issued to several other electric utilities. The complaint and notice of
violation allege that the Company had failed to secure necessary permits or
install additional pollution control equipment when performing maintenance and
construction at coal burning plants constructed or under construction prior to
1978. On August 1, 2000, the U.S. District Court granted the Company's motion to
dismiss for lack of jurisdiction in Georgia and granted the system service

company's motion to dismiss on the grounds that it neither owned nor operated
the generating units involved in the proceedings. On January 12, 2001, the EPA
re-filed its claims against the Company in federal district court in Birmingham,
Alabama. The EPA did not include the system service company in the new
complaint. The Company believes that it complied with applicable laws and EPA
regulations and interpretations in effect at the time the work in question took
place. The Clean Air Act authorizes civil penalties of up to $27,500 per day per
violation at each generating unit. Prior to January 30, 1997, the penalty was
$25,000 per day. An adverse outcome of this matter could require substantial
capital expenditures that cannot be determined at this time and possibly require
payment of substantial penalties. This could affect future results of
operations, cash flows, and possibly financial condition if such costs are not
recovered through regulated rates.

    In December 2000, the EPA completed its utility studies for mercury and
other hazardous air pollutants (HAPS) and issued a determination that an
emission control program for mercury and perhaps, other HAPS is warranted. The
program is to be developed over the next four years under the Maximum Achievable
Control Technology (MACT) provisions of the Clean Air Act. This determination is
being challenged in the courts. In January 2001, the EPA proposed guidance for
the determination of Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) emission controls
under the Regional Haze Regulations. Installation of BART controls would likely
be required around 2010. Litigation of the BART rules is probable in the near
future.

    Implementation of the final state rules for these initiatives could require
substantial further reductions in nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, mercury, and
other HAPS emissions from fossil-fired generating facilities and other
industries in these states. Additional compliance costs and capital expenditures
resulting from the implementation of these rules and standards cannot be
determined until the results of legal challenges are known, and the states have
adopted their final rules. Reviews by the new administration in Washington, D.C.
add to the uncertainties associated with BART guidance and the MACT
determination for mercury and other HAPS.

   The EPA and state environmental regulatory agencies are reviewing and
evaluating various other matters including: control strategies to reduce
regional haze; limits on pollutant discharges to impaired waters; water intake
restrictions; and hazardous waste disposal requirements. The impact of any new
standards will depend on the development and implementation of applicable
regulations.

    The Company must comply with other environmental laws and regulations that
cover the handling and disposal of hazardous waste. Under these various laws and
regulations, the Company could incur substantial costs to clean up properties.
The Company conducts studies to determine the extent of any required cleanup
costs and will recognize in the financial statements costs to clean up known
sites. The Company has not incurred any cleanup costs to date.

   Several major pieces of environmental legislation are being considered for
reauthorization or amendment by Congress. These include: the Clean Air Act; the
Clean Water Act; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and
Liability Act; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; the Toxic Substances
Control Act; and the Endangered Species Act. Changes to these laws could affect
many areas of the Company's operations. The full impact of any such changes
cannot be determined at this time.

   Compliance with possible additional legislation related to global climate
change, electromagnetic fields, and other environmental and health concerns
could significantly affect the Company. The impact of new legislation -- if any
- -- will depend on the subsequent development and implementation of applicable
regulations. In addition, the potential exists for liability as the result of
lawsuits alleging damages caused by electromagnetic fields.

Sources of Capital

The Company plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other
purposes from sources similar to those used in the past, which were primarily
from internal sources. However, the type and timing of any financings - if
needed - will depend on market conditions and regulatory approval. In recent
years, financings primarily have utilized unsecured debt and trust preferred
securities.

    As required by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and as ordered by the APSC,
the Company has established external trust funds for nuclear decommissioning
costs. In 1994, the Company also established an external trust fund for
postretirement benefits as ordered by the APSC. The cumulative effect of funding
these items over a long period will diminish internally funded capital and may
require capital from other sources. For additional information concerning
nuclear decommissioning costs, see Note 1 to the financial statements under
"Depreciation and Nuclear Decommissioning."

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking
Information

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Alabama Power Company 2000 Annual Report

1.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
     POLICIES

General

Alabama Power Company (the Company) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Southern
Company, which is the parent company of five integrated Southeast utilities, a
system service company (SCS), Southern Communications Services (Southern LINC),
Southern Company Energy Solutions, Southern Nuclear Operating Company (Southern
Nuclear), Mirant Corporation--formerly Southern Energy, Inc.-- and other direct
and indirect subsidiaries. The integrated Southeast utilities --Alabama Power
Company, Georgia Power Company, Gulf Power Company, Mississippi Power Company,
and Savannah Electric and Power Company-- provide electric service in four
states. Contracts among the integrated Southeast utilities - related to
jointly-owned generating facilities, interconnecting transmission lines, and the
exchange of electric power -- are regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC) and/or the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). SCS
provides, at cost, specialized services to Southern Company and its subsidiary
companies. Southern LINC provides digital wireless communications services to
the integrated Southeast utilities and also markets these services to the public
within the Southeast. Southern Company Energy Solutions develops new business
opportunities related to energy products and services. Southern Nuclear provides
services to Southern Company's nuclear power plants. Mirant acquires, develops,
builds, owns, and operates power production and delivery facilities and provides
a broad range of energy-related services to utilities and industrial companies
in selected countries around the world. Mirant businesses include independent
power projects, integrated utilities, a distribution company, and energy trading
and marketing businesses outside the southeastern United States.

    Southern Company is registered as a holding company under the Public Utility
Holding Company Act of 1935 (PUHCA). Both Southern Company and its subsidiaries
are subject to the regulatory provisions of the PUHCA. The Company is also
subject to regulation by the FERC and the Alabama Public Service Commission
(APSC). The Company follows accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States and complies with the accounting policies and practices prescribed
by its respective regulatory commissions. The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States requires the use of estimates, and the actual results may differ
from those estimates.

   Certain prior years' data presented in the financial statements have been
reclassified to conform with current year presentation.

Related-Party Transactions

The Company has an agreement with SCS under which the following services are
rendered to the Company at cost: general and design engineering, purchasing,
accounting and statistical, finance and treasury, tax, information resources,
marketing, auditing, insurance and pension administration, human resources,
systems and procedures, and other services with respect to business and
operations and power pool transactions. Costs for these services amounted to
$187 million, $218 million, and $201 million during 2000, 1999, and 1998,
respectively.

   The Company also has an agreement with Southern Nuclear to operate Plant
Farley and provide the following nuclear-related services at cost: general
executive and advisory services; general operations, management and technical
services; administrative services including procurement, accounting,
statistical, and employee relations; and other services with respect to business
and operations. Costs for these services amounted to $148 million, $135 million,
and $137 million during 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively.

Regulatory Assets and Liabilities

The Company is subject to the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB) Statement No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of
Regulation. Regulatory assets represent probable future revenues associated with
certain costs that are expected to be recovered from customers through the
ratemaking process. Regulatory liabilities represent probable future reductions
in revenues associated with amounts that are expected to be credited to
customers through the ratemaking process.

   Regulatory assets and (liabilities) reflected in the Balance Sheets at
December 31 relate to the following:

Total                                         $ 269       $ 247
================================================================

    In the event that a portion of the Company's operations is no longer subject
to the provisions of FASB Statement No. 71, the Company would be required to
write off related regulatory assets and liabilities that are not specifically
recoverable through regulated rates. In addition, the Company would be required
to determine if any impairment to other assets exists, including plant, and
write down the assets, if impaired, to their fair values.

Revenues and Fuel Costs

The Company currently operates as a vertically integrated utility providing
electricity to retail customers within its traditional service area located
within the state of Alabama, and to wholesale customers in the southeast.
Revenues are recognized as services are rendered. Unbilled revenues are accrued
at the end of each fiscal period. Fuel revenues have no effect on net income
because they represent the recording of revenues to offset fuel expenses,
including the fuel component of purchased energy. Fuel rates billed to customers
are designed to fully recover fluctuating fuel costs over a period of time.
Higher natural gas prices and decreased hydro production combined with increased
costs of purchased power have resulted in a large under-recovery of fuel costs
at December 31, 2000. Effective January 2001, the Company's fuel rate was
increased to address this under-recovery. The Company expects to significantly
reduce this balance over a three-year period.

    The Company has a diversified base of customers. No single customer or
industry comprises 10 percent or more of revenues. For all periods presented,
uncollectible accounts continue to average less than 1 percent of revenues.

    Fuel expense includes the amortization of the cost of nuclear fuel and a
charge, based on nuclear generation, for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear
fuel. Total charges for nuclear fuel included in fuel expense amounted to $61
million in 2000, $63 million in 1999, and $59 million in 1998.

    The Company has a contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) that
provides for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel. The DOE failed to
begin disposing of spent fuel in January 1998 as required by the contract, and
the Company is pursuing legal remedies against the government for breach of
contract. Sufficient fuel storage capacity is available at Plant Farley to
maintain full-core discharge capability until the refueling outage scheduled in
2006 for Farley Unit 1 and the refueling outage scheduled in 2008 for Farley
Unit 2. Procurement of on-site dry spent fuel storage capacity at Plant Farley
is in progress, with the intent to place the capacity in operation as early as
2005.

    Also, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 required the establishment of a Uranium
Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund, which is funded in part by
a special assessment on utilities with nuclear plants. This assessment is being
paid over a 15-year period, which began in 1993. This fund will be used by the
DOE for the decontamination and decommissioning of its nuclear fuel enrichment
facilities. The law provides that utilities will recover these payments in the
same manner as any other fuel expense. The Company estimates its remaining
liability under this law to be approximately $25 million at December 31, 2000.
This obligation is recognized in the accompanying Balance Sheets.

Depreciation and Nuclear Decommissioning

Depreciation of the original cost of depreciable utility plant in service is
provided primarily by using composite straight-line rates, which approximated
3.2 percent in 2000, 1999 and 1998. When property subject to depreciation is
retired or otherwise disposed of in the normal course of business, its cost --
together with the cost of removal, less salvage -- is charged to accumulated
provision for depreciation. Minor items of property included in the original
cost of the plant are retired when the related property unit is retired.
Depreciation expense includes an amount for the expected cost of decommissioning
nuclear facilities and removal of other facilities.

                                       II-63


NOTES (continued)
Alabama Power Company 2000 Annual Report


    The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) requires all licensees operating
commercial nuclear power reactors to establish a plan for providing, with
reasonable assurance, funds for decommissioning. The Company has established
external trust funds to comply with the NRC's regulations. Amounts previously
recorded in internal reserves are being transferred into the external trust
funds over periods approved by the APSC. The NRC's minimum external funding
requirements are based on a generic estimate of the cost to decommission the
radioactive portions of a nuclear unit based on the size and type of reactor.
The Company has filed plans with the NRC to ensure that -- over time -- the
deposits and earnings of the external trust funds will provide the minimum
funding amounts prescribed by the NRC.

    Site study cost is the estimate to decommission the facility as of the site
study year, and ultimate cost is the estimate to decommission the facility as of
retirement date. The estimated costs of decommissioning -- both site study costs
and ultimate costs - based on the most current study for Plant Farley were as
follows:


  Site study basis (year)                           1998

  Decommissioning periods:
      Beginning year                                2017
      Completion year                               2031
  -------------------------------------------------------------
                                                (in millions)
  Site study costs:
      Radiated structures                          $  629
      Non-radiated structures                          60
  -------------------------------------------------------------
  Total                                            $  689
  =============================================================
                                                (in millions)
  Ultimate costs:
      Radiated structures                          $1,868
      Non-radiated structures                         178
  -------------------------------------------------------------
  Total                                            $2,046
  =============================================================

    The decommissioning cost estimates are based on prompt dismantlement and
removal of the plant from service. The actual decommissioning costs may vary
from the above estimates because of changes in the assumed date of
decommissioning, changes in NRC requirements, or changes in the assumptions used
in making estimates.

    Annual provisions for nuclear decommissioning are based on an annuity method
as approved by the APSC. The amount expensed in 2000 and fund balances as of
December 31, 2000 were:

                                                (in millions)
  Amount expensed in 2000                            $ 18
  ----------------------------------------------------------

  Accumulated provisions:
      External trust funds, at fair value            $314
      Internal reserves                                38
  ----------------------------------------------------------
  Total                                              $352
  ==========================================================

    All of the Company's decommissioning costs are approved for recovery by the
APSC through the ratemaking process. Significant assumptions include an
estimated inflation rate of 4.5 percent and an estimated trust earnings rate of
7.0 percent. The Company expects the APSC to periodically review and adjust, if
necessary, the amounts collected in rates for the anticipated cost of
decommissioning.

Income Taxes

The Company uses the liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes
and provides deferred income taxes for all significant income tax temporary
differences. Investment tax credits utilized are deferred and amortized to
income over the average lives of the related property.

Allowance For Funds Used During Construction
 (AFUDC)

AFUDC represents the estimated debt and equity costs of capital funds that are
necessary to finance the construction of new facilities. While cash is not
realized currently from such allowance, it increases the revenue requirement
over the service life of the plant through a higher rate base and higher
depreciation expense. The amount of AFUDC capitalized was $43 million in 2000,
$23 million in 1999, and $9 million in 1998. The composite rate used to
determine the amount of allowance was 9.6 percent in 2000, 8.8 percent in 1999,
and 9.0 percent in 1998. AFUDC, net of income tax, as a percent of net income
after dividends on preferred stock was 8.4 percent in 2000, 4.7 percent in 1999,
and 1.8 percent in 1998.

Alabama Power Company 2000 Annual Report


Property, Plant, and Equipment

Property, plant, and equipment is stated at original cost. Original cost
includes: materials; labor; minor items of property; appropriate administrative
and general costs; payroll-related costs such as taxes, pensions, and other
benefits; and the estimated cost of funds used during construction. The cost of
maintenance, repairs and replacement of minor items of property is charged to
maintenance expense. The cost of replacements of property --exclusive of minor
items of property -- is capitalized.

Financial Instruments

The Company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices.
Gains and losses on qualifying hedges are deferred and recognized either in
income or as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item when the
transaction occurs.

    The Company is exposed to losses related to financial instruments in the
event of counterparties' nonperformance. The Company has established controls to
determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties in order to
mitigate the Company's exposure to counterparty credit risk. The Company is
unaware of any counterparties that will fail to meet their obligations.

    The Company has firm purchase commitments for equipment that require payment
in euros. As a hedge against fluctuations in the exchange rate for euros, the
Company entered into forward currency swaps. The notional amount is 16 million
euros maturing in 2001 through 2002. At December 31, 2000, the unrecognized gain
on these swaps was approximately $1 million.

    Other Company financial instruments for which the carrying amount did not
equal fair value at December 31 are as follows:


                                       Carrying         Fair

   At December 31, 2000                 $3,422         $3,375
   At December 31, 1999                  3,286          3,045
 Preferred Securities:
   At December 31, 2000                    347            344
   At December 31, 1999                    347            299
 --------------------------------------------------------------

   The fair value for long-term debt and preferred securities was based on
either closing market prices or closing prices of comparable instruments.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

For purposes of the financial statements, temporary cash investments are
considered cash equivalents. Temporary cash investments are securities with
original maturities of 90 days or less.

Materials and Supplies

Generally, materials and supplies include the cost of transmission,
distribution, and generating plant materials. Materials are charged to inventory
when purchased and then expensed or capitalized to plant, as appropriate, when
installed.

Natural Disaster Reserve

In accordance with an APSC order the Company has established a Natural Disaster
Reserve. The Company is allowed to accrue $250 thousand per month, until the
maximum accumulated provision of $32 million is attained. Higher accruals to
restore the reserve to its authorized level are allowed whenever the balance in
the reserve declines below $22.4 million. At December 31, 2000, the reserve
balance was $18 million.

2.   RETIREMENT BENEFITS

The Company has defined benefit, trusteed, pension plans that cover
substantially all employees. The Company provides certain medical care and life
insurance benefits for retired employees. Substantially all employees may become
eligible for such benefits when they retire. The Company funds trusts to the

extent deductible under federal income tax regulations or to the extent required
by the APSC and FERC.

    In late 2000, the Company adopted several pension and postretirement benefit
plan changes that had the effect of increasing benefits to both current and
future retirees. The effects of these changes will be to increase annual pension

Employee Savings Plan

The Company also sponsors a 401(k) defined contribution plan covering
substantially all employees. The Company provides a 75 percent matching
contribution up to 6 percent of an employee's base salary. Total matching
contributions made to the plan for the years 2000, 1999, and 1998 were $11
million, $10 million, and $10 million, respectively.

Work Force Reduction Programs

The Company has incurred costs for work force reduction programs totaling $2.6
million, $5.6 million and $19.4 million for the years 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively. These costs were deferred and are being amortized in accordance
with regulatory treatment. The unamortized balance of these costs was $1.4
million at December 31, 2000.

3.  CONTINGENCIES AND REGULATORY
    MATTERS

Environmental Litigation

On November 3, 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), brought a civil
action against the Company in the U. S. District Court. The complaint alleges
violations of the prevention of significant deterioration and new source review
provision of the Clean Air Act with respect to coal-fired generating facilities
at the Company's Plants Miller, Barry and Gorgas. The civil action requests
penalties and injunctive relief, including an order requiring the installation
of the best available control technology at the affected units. The Clean Air
Act authorizes civil penalties of up to $27,500 per day, per violation at each
generating unit. Prior to January 30, 1997, the penalty was $25,000 per day.

   The EPA concurrently issued to the Company a notice of violation relating to
these specific facilities, as well as Plants Greene County and Gaston. In early
2000, the EPA filed a motion to amend its complaint to add the violations
alleged in its notice of violation. The complaint and the notice of violation
are similar to those brought against and issued to several other electric
utilities. The complaint and the notice of violation allege that the Company
failed to secure necessary permits or install additional pollution control
equipment when performing maintenance and construction at coal burning plants
constructed or under construction prior to 1978. On August 1, 2000, the U.S.
District Court granted the Company's motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction
in Georgia and granted SCS's motion to dismiss on the grounds that it neither
owned nor operated the generating units involved in the proceedings. On January
12, 2001, the EPA re-filed its claims against the Company in federal district
court in Birmingham, Alabama. The EPA did not include SCS in the new complaint.
The Company believes that it complied with applicable laws and the EPA's


                                       II-67


NOTES (continued)
Alabama Power Company 2000 Annual Report


regulations and interpretations in effect at the time the work in question took
place.

   An adverse outcome of this matter could require substantial capital
expenditures that cannot be determined at this time and possibly require payment
of substantial penalties. This could affect future results of operations, cash
flows, and possibly financial condition if such costs are not recovered through
regulated rates.

Retail Rate Adjustment Procedures

The APSC has adopted rates that provide for periodic adjustments based upon the
Company's earned return on end-of-period retail common equity. The rates also
provide for adjustments to recognize the placing of new generating facilities
into retail service. Both increases and decreases have been placed into effect
since the adoption of these rates. The rate adjustment procedures allow a return
on common equity range of 13.0 percent to 14.5 percent and limit increases or
decreases in rates to 4 percent in any calendar year. There is a moratorium on
any periodic retail rate increases (but not decreases) until July 2001.

    In December 1995, the APSC issued an order authorizing the Company to reduce
balance sheet items -- such as plant and deferred charges -- at any time the
Company's actual base rate revenues exceed the budgeted revenues. In April 1997,
the APSC issued an additional order authorizing the Company to reduce balance
sheet asset items. This order authorizes the reduction of such items up to an
amount equal to five times the total estimated annual revenue reduction
resulting from future rate reductions initiated by the Company. In 1998, the
Company - in accordance with the 1995 rate order - recorded $33 million of
additional amortization of premium on reacquired debt. The Company did not
record any additional amounts in 2000 or 1999.

    In April 2000, the APSC approved an amendment to the Company's existing rate
structure to provide for the recovery of retail costs associated with certified
purchased power agreements. In November 2000, the APSC certified a seven-year
purchased power agreement pertaining to 615 megawatts of the Company's wholesale
generating facilities under construction in Autaugaville, Alabama, all of which
will be delivered in 2003. In addition, the APSC certified a seven-year
purchased power agreement with a third party for approximately 630 megawatts;
one half of the power will be delivered in 2003 while the remaining half is
scheduled for delivery in 2004.

    The Company's ratemaking procedures will remain in effect until the APSC
votes to modify or discontinue them.

4.   FINANCING AND COMMITMENTS

Construction Program

To the extent possible, the Company's construction program is expected to be
financed primarily from internal sources. Short-term debt is often utilized and
the amounts available are discussed below. The Company may issue additional
long-term debt and preferred securities for debt maturities, redeeming
higher-cost securities, and meeting additional capital requirements.

    The Company currently estimates property additions to be $735 million in
2001, $891 million in 2002, and $625 million in 2003.

    The Company is constructing 1,230 megawatts of wholesale generating
facilities in Autaugaville, Alabama to begin operation in 2003. Half of this
capacity has been certified by the APSC to serve the Company's retail customers
for seven years. The other half of the capacity will be sold into the wholesale
market and will not affect retail rates. During 2001, the Company plans to
transfer these generating facilities to Southern Power Company (SPC), the new
wholesale subsidiary formed by Southern Company. If the Company transfers
wholesale generation assets to SPC as planned, construction expenditures for the
years 2001 through 2003 will be $598 million, $591 million and $583 million,
respectively.

    During 2001, the Company expects to complete the replacement of the steam
generators at Plant Farley, as well as the construction of new generating
capacity at Plant Barry. In addition, significant construction will continue
related to transmission and distribution facilities and the upgrading of
generating plants, including the expenditures necessary to comply with
environmental regulation.

    The capital budget is subject to periodic review and revision, and actual
capital costs incurred may vary from estimates because of changes in such
factors as: business conditions; environmental regulations; nuclear plant

                                     II-68



NOTES (continued)
Alabama Power Company 2000 Annual Report


regulations; load projections; the cost and efficiency of construction labor,
equipment, and materials; and the cost of capital. In addition, there can be no
assurance that costs related to capital expenditures will be fully recovered.

Financing

The ability of the Company to finance its capital budget depends on the amount
of funds generated internally and the funds it can raise by external financing.
The Company plans to obtain the funds required for construction and other
purposes from sources similar to those used in the past, which were primarily
from internal sources. However, the type and timing of any financings - if
needed - will depend on market conditions and regulatory approval. In recent
years, financings primarily have utilized unsecured debt and trust preferred
securities.

Bank Credit Arrangements

The Company maintains committed lines of credit in the amount of $925 million
(including $418 million of such lines which are dedicated to funding purchase
obligations relating to variable rate pollution control bonds). Of these lines,
$535 million expire at various times during 2001 and $390 million expire in
2004. In certain cases, such lines require payment of a commitment fee based on
the unused portion of the commitment or the maintenance of compensating balances
with the banks. Because the arrangements are based on an average balance, the
Company does not consider any of its cash balances to be restricted as of any
specific date. Moreover, the Company borrows from time to time pursuant to
arrangements with banks for uncommitted lines of credit.

    At December 31, 2000, the Company had regulatory approval to have
outstanding up to $750 million of short-term borrowings.

Assets Subject to Lien

The Company's mortgage, as amended and supplemented, securing the first mortgage
bonds issued by the Company, constitutes a direct lien on substantially all of
the Company's fixed property and franchises.

Purchased Power Commitments

The Company has entered into various long-term commitments for the purchase of
electricity. Estimated total long-term obligations at December 31, 2000 were as
follows:

Fuel Commitments

To supply a portion of the fuel requirements of its generating plants, the
Company has entered into various long-term commitments for the procurement of
fossil and nuclear fuel. In most cases, these contracts contain provisions for
price escalations, minimum purchase levels and other financial commitments.
Total estimated long-term obligations at December 31, 2000, were as follows:

5.   JOINT OWNERSHIP AGREEMENTS

The Company and Georgia Power Company own equally all of the outstanding capital
stock of Southern Electric Generating Company (SEGCO), which owns electric
generating units with a total rated capacity of 1,020 megawatts, together with
associated transmission facilities. The capacity of these units is sold equally
to the Company and Georgia Power Company under a contract which, in substance,
requires payments sufficient to provide for the operating expenses, taxes,
interest expense and a return on equity, whether or not SEGCO has any capacity
and energy available. The term of the contract extends automatically for
two-year periods, subject to either party's right to cancel upon two year's
notice. The Company's share of expenses totaled $85 million in 2000, $92 million
in 1999 and $74 million in 1998, and is included in "Purchased power from
affiliates" in the Statements of Income.

    In addition, the Company has guaranteed unconditionally the obligation of
SEGCO under an installment sale agreement for the purchase of certain pollution
control facilities at SEGCO's generating units, pursuant to which $24.5 million
principal amount of pollution control revenue bonds are outstanding. Georgia
Power Company has agreed to reimburse the Company for the pro rata portion of
such obligation corresponding to its then proportionate ownership of stock of
SEGCO if the Company is called upon to make such payment under its guaranty.

    At December 31, 2000, the capitalization of SEGCO consisted of $51 million
of equity and $78 million of long-term debt on which the annual interest
requirement is $5.3 million. SEGCO paid dividends totaling $5.1 million in 2000,
$4.3 million in 1999, and $8.7 million in 1998, of which one-half of each was
paid to the Company. SEGCO's net income was $5.9 million, $5.4 million, and $7.5
million for 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

    The Company's percentage ownership and investment in jointly-owned
generating plants at December 31, 2000, is as follows:

6.   LONG-TERM POWER SALES AGREEMENTS

General

The Company and the other integrated utility subsidiaries of Southern Company
have entered into long-term contractual agreements for the sale of capacity and
energy to certain non-affiliated utilities located outside the system's service
area. These agreements -- expiring at various dates discussed below -- are firm
and pertain to capacity related to specific generating units. Because the energy
is generally sold at cost under these agreements, profitability is primarily
affected by revenues from capacity sales. The Company's capacity revenues
amounted to $127 million in 2000, $122 million in 1999, and $142 million in
1998.

    Unit power from Plant Miller is being sold to Florida Power Corporation
(FPC), Florida Power & Light Company (FP&L), and Jacksonville Electric Authority
(JEA). Under these agreements, approximately 1,235 megawatts of capacity are
                                       II-70

scheduled to be sold through 2001. Thereafter, these sales will remain at that
approximate level -- unless reduced by FP&L, FPC, and JEA for the periods after
2001 with a minimum of three years notice -- until the expiration of the
contracts in 2010. No notices of cancellation have been received.

Alabama Municipal Electric Authority (AMEA)
Capacity Contracts

In August 1986, the Company entered into a firm power sales contract with AMEA
entitling AMEA to scheduled amounts of capacity (to a maximum 100 megawatts) for
a period of 15 years commencing September 1, 1986 (1986 Contract). In October
1991, the Company entered into a second firm power sales contract with AMEA
entitling AMEA to scheduled amounts of additional capacity (to a maximum 80
megawatts) for a period of 15 years commencing October 1, 1991 (1991 Contract).
In both contracts the power will be sold to AMEA for its member municipalities
that previously were served directly by the Company as wholesale customers.
Under the terms of the contracts, the Company received payments from AMEA
representing the net present value of the revenues associated with the
respective capacity entitlements, discounted at effective annual rates of 9.96
percent and 11.19 percent for the 1986 and 1991 contracts, respectively. These
payments are being recognized as operating revenues and the discounts are being
amortized to other interest expense as scheduled capacity is made available over
the terms of the contracts.

     In order to secure AMEA's advance payments and the Company's performance
obligation under the contracts, the Company issued and delivered to an escrow
agent first mortgage bonds representing the maximum amount of liquidated damages
payable by the Company in the event of a default under the contracts. No
principal or interest is payable on such bonds unless and until a default by the
Company occurs. As the liquidated damages decline under the contracts, a portion
of the bonds equal to the decreases is returned to the Company. At December 31,
2000, $61.3 million of such bonds were held by the escrow agent under the
contracts.

7.   INCOME TAXES

At December 31, 2000, the tax-related regulatory assets and liabilities were
$346 million and $222 million, respectively. These assets are attributable to
tax benefits flowed through to customers in prior years and to taxes applicable
to capitalized interest. These liabilities are attributable to deferred taxes
previously recognized at rates higher than current enacted tax law and to
unamortized investment tax credits.

    Details of the income tax provisions are as follows:

                                      2000       1999       1998

    The tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of
assets and liabilities in the financial statements and their respective tax
bases, which give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities, are as follows:

    Deferred investment tax credits are amortized over the lives of the related
property with such amortization normally applied as a credit to reduce
depreciation in the Statements of Income. Credits amortized in this manner
amounted to $11 million in 2000, 1999, and 1998. At December 31, 2000, all
investment tax credits available to reduce federal income taxes payable had been
utilized.

    A reconciliation of the federal statutory income tax rate to the effective
income tax rate is as follows:

8.   COMPANY OBLIGATED MANDATORILY
     REDEEMABLE PREFERRED SECURITIES

Statutory business trusts formed by the Company, of which the Company owns all
the common securities, have issued mandatorily redeemable preferred securities
as follows:

              Date of                                 Maturity
               Issue    Amount      Rate     Notes      Date
            ---------------------------------------------------
                       (millions)           (millions)
Trust I       1/1996    $ 97    7.375%      $100      3/2026
Trust II      1/1997     200    7.60         206     12/2036
Trust III     2/1999      50    Auction       52      2/2029

    Substantially all of the assets of each trust are junior subordinated notes
issued by the Company in the respective approximate principal amounts set forth
above. The distribution rate of Trust III's auction rate securities was 6.52% at
January 1, 2001.

    The Company considers that the mechanisms and obligations relating to the
preferred securities, taken together, constitute a full and unconditional
guarantee by the Company of the Trusts' payment obligations with respect to the
preferred securities.

    The Trusts are subsidiaries of the Company and, accordingly, are
consolidated in the Company's financial statements.

9.   OTHER LONG-TERM DEBT

Pollution control obligations represent installment purchases of pollution
control facilities financed by funds derived from sales by public authorities of
revenue bonds. The Company is required to make payments sufficient for the
authorities to meet principal and interest requirements of such bonds. With
respect to $114.2 million of such pollution control obligations, the Company has
authenticated and delivered to the trustees a like principal amount of first
mortgage bonds as security for its obligations under the installment purchase
agreements.  No principal or interest on these first mortgage bonds is payable
unless and until a default occurs on the installment purchase agreements.

   In May 2000, the Company issued $250 million of unsecured senior notes. The
proceeds of this issuance were used to repay short-term indebtedness. All of the
Company's senior notes are, in effect, subordinated to all secured debt of the
Company, including its first mortgage bonds.

   The estimated aggregate annual maturities of capitalized lease obligations
through 2005 are as follows: $0.8 million in 2001, $0.9 million in 2002, $0.9
million in 2003, $1.0 million in 2004 and $0.1 million in 2005.

10.   SECURITIES DUE WITHIN ONE YEAR

A summary of the improvement fund requirements and scheduled maturities and
redemptions of long-term debt due within one year at December 31 is as follows:

as a portion of that series is outstanding, and may be satisfied by the deposit
of cash and/or reacquired bonds, the certification of unfunded property
additions, or a combination thereof.

11.   NUCLEAR INSURANCE

Under the Price-Anderson Amendments Act of 1988 (the Act), the Company maintains
agreements of indemnity with the NRC that, together with private insurance,
cover third-party liability arising from any nuclear incident occurring at Plant
Farley. The Act provides funds up to $9.5 billion for public liability claims
that could arise from a single nuclear incident. Plant Farley is insured against
this liability to a maximum of $200 million by private insurance, with the
remaining coverage provided by a mandatory program of deferred premiums which
could be assessed, after a nuclear incident, against all owners of nuclear
reactors. The Company could be assessed up to $88 million per incident for each
licensed reactor it operates but not more than an aggregate of $10 million per
incident to be paid in a calendar year for each reactor. Such maximum
assessment, excluding any applicable state premium taxes, for the Company is
$176 million per incident but not more than an aggregate of $20 million to be
paid for each incident in any one year.

    The Company is a member of Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL), a
mutual insurer established to provide property damage insurance in an amount up
to $500 million for members' nuclear generating facilities.

    Additionally, the Company has policies that currently provide
decontamination, excess property insurance, and premature decommissioning
coverage up to $2.25 billion for losses in excess of the $500 million primary
coverage. This excess insurance is also provided by NEIL.

    NEIL also covers the additional cost that would be incurred in obtaining
replacement power during a prolonged accidental outage at a member's nuclear
plant. Members can be insured against increased costs of replacement power in an
amount up to $3.5 million per week (starting 12 weeks after the outage) for one
year and up to $2.8 million per week for the second and third years.

    Under each of the NEIL policies, members are subject to assessments if
losses each year exceed the accumulated funds available to the insurer under
that policy. The current maximum annual assessments for the Company under the
three NEIL policies would be $17 million.

    For all on-site property damage insurance policies for commercial nuclear
power plants, the NRC requires that the proceeds of such policies shall be
dedicated first for the sole purpose of placing the reactor in a safe and stable
condition after an accident. Any remaining proceeds are to be applied next
toward the costs of decontamination and debris removal operations ordered by the
NRC, and any further remaining proceeds are to be paid either to the Company or
to its bond trustees as may be appropriate under the policies and applicable
trust indentures.

    All retrospective assessments, whether generated for liability, property or
replacement power may be subject to applicable state premium taxes.

12.   COMMON STOCK DIVIDEND
      RESTRICTIONS

The Company's first mortgage bond indenture contains various common stock
dividend restrictions that remain in effect as long as the bonds are
outstanding. At December 31, 2000, retained earnings of $796 million were
restricted against the payment of cash dividends on common stock under terms of
the mortgage indenture.

13.   QUARTERLY FINANCIAL INFORMATION
      (Unaudited)

Summarized quarterly financial data for 2000 and 1999 are as follows:

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT
Georgia Power Company 2000 Annual Report

The management of Georgia Power Company has prepared this annual report and is
responsible for the financial statements and related information. These
statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States and necessarily include amounts that are based on
the best estimates and judgments of management. Financial information throughout
this annual report is consistent with the financial statements.

     The Company maintains a system of internal accounting controls to provide
reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and that the accounting records
reflect only authorized transactions of the Company. Limitations exist in any
system of internal controls based upon the recognition that the cost of the
system should not exceed its benefits. The Company believes that its system of
internal accounting controls maintains an appropriate cost/benefit relationship.

     The Company's system of internal accounting controls is evaluated on an
ongoing basis by the Company's internal audit staff. The Company's independent
public accountants also consider certain elements of the internal control system
in order to determine their auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the financial statements.

     The audit committee of the board of directors, which is composed of three
independent directors, provides a broad overview of management's financial
reporting and control functions. At least three times a year this committee
meets with management, the internal auditors, and the independent public
accountants to ensure that these groups are fulfilling their obligations and to
discuss auditing, internal control and financial reporting matters. The internal
auditors and the independent public accountants have access to the members of
the audit committee at any time.

     Management believes that its policies and procedures provide reasonable
assurance that the Company's operations are conducted with a high standard of
business ethics.

     In management's opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position, results of operations and cash flows
of Georgia Power Company in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL
CONDITION
Georgia Power Company 2000 Annual Report

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

Georgia Power Company's 2000 earnings totaled $559 million, representing an $18
million (3.3 percent) increase over 1999. This earnings increase is primarily
due to higher retail and wholesale sales and continued control of operating
expenses, partially offset by additional accelerated amortization of regulatory
assets allowed under the second year of a Georgia Public Service Commission
(GPSC) three-year retail rate order. Georgia Power Company's 1999 earnings
totaled $541 million, representing a $29 million (5.1 percent) decrease from
1998. This earnings decrease was primarily due to the recognition of interest
income in 1998 as a result of the resolution of tax issues with the Internal
Revenue Service (IRS). Earnings in 1999 from normal operations increased due
primarily to lower accelerated depreciation under the GPSC retail rate order,
sales growth, and decreased financing costs, partially offset by retail rate
reductions under the new order and lower wholesale revenues.

Revenues

Operating revenues in 2000 and the amount of change from the prior year are as
follows:


                                               Increase (Decrease)

Percent change                                   9.3%        (5.9)%
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

     Retail base revenues of $3.1 billion in 2000 increased
$84 million (2.8 percent) primarily due to a 4.9 percent increase in sales.
Under the GPSC retail rate order, the Company recorded $44 million of revenue
subject to refund for estimated earnings above 12.5 percent retail return on
common equity in 2000. Refunds will be made to customers in 2001. Retail base
revenues of $3.0 billion in 1999 decreased $292 million (8.8 percent) primarily
due to retail rate reductions under the GPSC retail rate order. Pursuant to the
GPSC retail rate order, in 1999 the Company also recorded $79 million of revenue
subject to refund for estimated earnings above 12.5 percent retail return on
common equity. Revenue subject to refund is reflected in "Base revenues" in the
chart above. The $79 million in refunds were made to customers in 2000. See Note
3 to the financial statements under "Retail Rate Order" for additional
information.

     Electric rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in
fuel costs, the energy component of purchased power costs, and certain other
costs. Under these fuel cost recovery provisions, fuel revenues generally equal
fuel expenses -- including the fuel component of purchased energy -- and do not
affect net income. However cash flow is affected by the untimely recovery of
these receivables. As of December 31, 2000, the Company had $132 million in
underrecovered fuel costs. The Company currently plans to make a filing with the
GPSC in early 2001 to establish a new fuel rate in order to better reflect
current fuel cost and to collect the current underrecovered balance.

     Wholesale revenues from sales to non-affiliated utilities increased in 2000
and decreased in 1999 as follows:

                                  2000       1999      1998
                                -------------------------------

   Long-term contracts           $  55      $  55     $  51
   Other sales                     162         74        93
Inside service area                 81         81       115

Total                             $298       $210      $259
===============================================================

     Revenues from long-term contracts outside the service area remained
constant in 2000 and increased slightly in 1999 due to increased energy sales.
See Note 7 to the financial statements for further information regarding these
sales. Revenues from other sales outside the service area primarily represent
wholesale sales from Plant Dahlberg which went into service during 2000 and
increases in power marketing activities. These activities include the purchase
and resale of energy. Consequently, changes in revenues are generally offset by
corresponding changes in purchased power expense from non-affiliates. Wholesale

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Georgia Power Company 2000 Annual Report

revenues from customers within the service area remained constant in 2000 but
decreased in 1999 primarily due to a decrease in revenues under a power supply
agreement with Oglethorpe Power Corporation (OPC).

     Revenues from sales to affiliated companies within the Southern electric
system, as well as purchases of energy, will vary from year to year depending on
demand and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company.
These transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings.

     Other operating revenues in 2000 increased $39 million (33 percent)
primarily due to increased revenues from the transmission of electricity and
gains on the sale of generating plant emission allowances. Under a GPSC order,
$28 million of the gains on emission allowance sales in 2000 were used to
reduce recoverable fuel costs and as such, did not affect earnings. In 1999,
other operating revenues increased $21 million or (21 percent) from the
previous year due primarily to increased revenues from the rental of electric
equipment and property.

     Kilowatt-hour (KWH) sales for 2000 and the percent change by year were as
follows:

                                         Percent Change

- ------------------------------------------------------------

     Residential and commercial sales increased 6.6 percent and 8.1 percent,
respectively, due to warmer summer temperatures and colder winter weather.
Strong regional economic growth was also a factor in the increase in commercial
sales. Industrial sales remained fairly constant. In 1999, residential sales
decreased 0.4 percent due to moderate summer temperatures, while commercial
sales increased 3.7 percent due to strong regional economic growth. Industrial
sales remained fairly constant.

Expenses

Fuel costs constitute the single largest expense for the Company. The mix of
fuel sources for generation of electricity is determined primarily by system
load, the unit cost of fuel consumed, and the availability of hydro and nuclear
generating units. The amount and sources of generation and the average cost of
fuel per net KWH generated were as follows:

                                      2000    1999       1998

     (cents) --                       1.39      1.34     1.36
- -----------------------------------------------------------------

     Fuel expense increased 10.7 percent in 2000 due to an increase in
generation to meet higher energy demands, a decrease in generation from hydro
plants, and a higher average cost of fuel. Fuel expense increased 0.3 percent in
1999 due to a slight increase in fossil and nuclear generation and a decrease in
generation from hydro plants, partially offset by a lower average cost of fuel.

     Purchased power expense in 2000 increased $206 million (53 percent) over
the prior year due to higher retail energy demands and power marketing
activities. The majority of the increase was offset by increases in retail fuel
revenues and power marketing revenues and therefore did not affect earnings. As
discussed above, the expense associated with energy purchased for power
marketing activities is generally offset by revenue when resold. Purchased power
expense decreased slightly in 1999.

     Other operation and maintenance expenses in 2000 increased slightly over
those in 1999. Increased line maintenance, customer assistance and sales expense
and additional severance costs were partially offset by decreased generating
plant maintenance and decreased employee benefit provisions. Other operation and

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Georgia Power Company 2000 Annual Report


maintenance expenses increased 1.6 percent in 1999 primarily due to increased
generating plant maintenance, partially offset by a reduction in the charges
related to the implementation of a customer service system in 1998, decreased
year 2000 readiness costs, and decreased employee benefit provisions.

     Depreciation and amortization increased $66 million in 2000 due to $50
million of additional accelerated amortization of regulatory assets required
under the second year of the GPSC retail rate order and increased plant in
service. Depreciation and amortization decreased $261 million in 1999 primarily
due to higher depreciation charges recognized in 1998 under the prior GPSC
accounting order and the completion in 1998 of the amortization of deferred
Plant Vogtle costs.

     Interest income decreased $3 million in 2000 primarily due to decreased
interest on temporary cash investments. Interest income decreased in 1999
primarily due to the 1998 recognition of $73 million in interest income
resulting from the resolution of tax issues with the IRS and the State of
Georgia. Other, net decreased in 2000 due to an increase in charitable
contributions. In 1999, other, net decreased due primarily to increased bad debt
expense related to consumer energy efficiency improvement financing.

     Interest expense, net increased in 2000 due to the issuance of an
additional $300 million in senior notes during 2000. Interest expense, net
decreased in 1999 due primarily to the refinancing or retirement of securities.
The Company refinanced or retired $179 million and $775 million of securities in
2000 and 1999, respectively. Distributions on preferred securities of subsidiary
companies decreased $7 million in 2000 due to the redemption of $100 million of
preferred securities in December 1999. Distributions on preferred securities of
subsidiary companies increased $11 million in 1999 due to the issuance of
additional mandatorily redeemable preferred securities in January 1999.

Effects of Inflation

The Company is subject to rate regulation and income tax laws that are based on
the recovery of historical costs. Therefore, inflation creates an economic loss
because the Company is recovering its costs of investments in dollars that have
less purchasing power. While the inflation rate has been relatively low in
recent years, it continues to have an adverse effect on the Company because of
the large investment in utility plants with long economic life. Conventional
accounting for historical cost does not recognize this economic loss nor the
partially offsetting gain that arises through financing facilities with
fixed-money obligations such as long-term debt and preferred securities. Any
recognition of inflation by regulatory authorities is reflected in the rate of
return allowed.

FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL

The results of operations for the past three years are not necessarily
indicative of future earnings. The level of future earnings depends on numerous
factors including regulatory matters and energy sales.

     The Company currently operates as a vertically integrated utility providing
electricity to customers within its traditional service area located in the
State of Georgia. Prices for electricity provided by the Company to retail
customers are set by the GPSC under cost-based regulatory principles.

     On January 1, 1999, the Company began operating under a new three-year
retail rate order. The Company's earnings are evaluated against a retail return
on common equity range of 10 percent to 12.5 percent, with required rate
reductions of $262 million on an annual basis effective in 1999 and an
additional $24 million effective in 2000. The order provides for $85 million in
each year, plus up to $50 million of any earnings above the 12.5 percent return
during the second and third years, to be applied to accelerated amortization or
depreciation of assets. Two-thirds of any additional earnings above the 12.5
percent return will be applied to rate reductions, with the remaining one-third
retained by the Company. Pursuant to the GPSC retail rate order, in 2000 and
1999, the Company recorded $85 million in accelerated amortization of regulatory
assets. In 2000, the Company also recorded the additional $50 million of
accelerated amortization. The accelerated amortization is recorded in a
regulatory liability account as mandated by the GPSC. In addition, the Company
recorded $44 million and $79 million of revenue subject to refund for estimated
earnings above 12.5 percent in 2000 and 1999, respectively. Refunds applicable
to 1999 were made to customers in 2000. The Company will file a general rate
case on July 2, 2001 in response to which the GPSC would be expected to

determine whether the retail rate order should be continued, modified, or
discontinued. See Note 3 to the financial statements under "Retail Rate Order"
for additional information.

     Growth in energy sales is subject to a number of factors which
traditionally have included changes in contracts with neighboring utilities,
energy conservation practiced by customers, the elasticity of demand, weather,
competition, initiatives to increase sales to existing customers, and the rate
of economic growth in the Company's service area. Assuming normal weather,
retail sales growth from 2000 is projected to be approximately 2.4 percent
annually on average during 2001 through 2003.

     The Company has entered into purchase power agreements which will result in
higher capacity and operating and maintenance payments in future years. See Note
4 to the financial statements under "Purchased Power Commitments" for additional
information.

     The Company is constructing two 566 megawatt combined cycle units at Plant
Wansley to begin operation in 2002. These units have been certified by the GPSC
to serve the Company's retail customers for approximately seven years. Savannah
Electric will have the rights to 200 megawatts of capacity from these units for
the same seven-year period.

     The Company is also constructing a 571 megawatt combined cycle unit at
Plant Goat Rock to begin operation in 2002, and a 610 megawatt combined cycle
unit at Plant Goat Rock to begin operation in 2003. The power from these units
will initially be sold into the wholesale market when they begin operation. The
Company has filed with the GPSC for certification of these units to begin
serving the Company's retail customers in 2003 and 2004, respectively, for a
term of seven years each.

     In addition to seeking certification of Plant Goat Rock, the Company is
also seeking certification of a seven year commitment to 615 megawatts beginning
in 2004 at Plant Autaugaville to serve its retail customers. Plant Autaugaville
is currently under construction by Alabama Power.

     Further, the Company is constructing Plant Dahlberg, a ten unit, 800
megawatt combustion turbine peaking power plant that will serve the wholesale
market. Units one through eight began operation in May 2000; units nine and ten
are expected to begin operation in June 2001. The Company has entered into
wholesale contracts to sell all 800 megawatts of capacity. These contracts cover
substantially all of the output of the plant for the first five years. Because
these units are dedicated to the wholesale market, retail rates will not be
affected.

     The Company is aggressively working to maintain and expand its share of
wholesale sales in the Southeastern power markets. In January 2001, Southern
Company announced the formation of a new subsidiary, Southern Power Company
(SPC). SPC will own, manage, and finance wholesale generating assets in the
Southeast. Energy from its assets will be marketed to wholesale customers under
the Southern Company name. The current plan is for Georgia Power and Alabama
Power to transfer Plant Dahlberg and the units under construction at Plants
Wansley, Goat Rock, and Autaugaville to SPC in 2001. The Company will enter into
purchased power capacity agreements with SPC for power from the units at Plants
Wansley, Goat Rock, and Autaugaville to serve the Company's retail customers.

     In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement
No. 87, Employers' Accounting for Pensions, the Company recorded non-cash income
of approximately $59 million in 2000. Pension plan income in 2001 is expected to
be less as a result of plan amendments. Future pension income is dependent on
several factors including trust earnings and changes to the plan. For additional
information see Note 2 to the financial statements.

     Compliance costs related to current and future environmental laws,
regulations, and litigation could affect earnings if such costs are not fully
recovered. See "Environmental Issues" for further discussion of these matters.

     The electric utility industry in the United States is continuing to evolve
as a result of regulatory and competitive factors. Among the primary agents of
change has been the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Energy Act). The Energy Act
allows independent power producers (IPPs) to access a utility's transmission
network in order to sell electricity to other utilities. Although the Energy Act


                                       II-82

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Georgia Power Company 2000 Annual Report


does not permit retail customer access, it was a major catalyst for the current
restructuring and consolidation taking place within the utility industry.

     On December 20, 1999, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)
issued its final rule on Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs). The order
encouraged utilities owning transmission systems to form RTOs on a voluntary
basis. After participating in regional conferences with customers and other
members of the public to discuss the formation of RTOs, utilities were required
to make a filing with the FERC. On October 16, 2000, Southern Company and its
five integrated Southeast utilities, including the Company, filed with the FERC
a proposal for the creation of an RTO. The proposal is for the formation of a
for-profit company that would have control of the bulk power transmission system
of participating utilities. Participants would have the option to either
maintain their ownership, divest, sell, or lease their assets to the proposed
RTO. If the FERC accepts the proposal as filed, the creation of the RTO is not
expected to have a material impact on the financial statements of the Company.
However, the ultimate outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.

     The Company continues to compete with other electric suppliers within the
state. In Georgia, most new retail customers with at least 900 kilowatts of
connected load may choose their electricity supplier. Numerous federal and state
initiatives are in varying stages to promote wholesale and retail competition
across the nation. Among other things, these initiatives allow customers to
choose their electricity provider. As these initiatives materialize, the
structure of the utility industry could radically change. Some states have
approved initiatives that result in a separation of the ownership and/or
operation of generating facilities from the ownership and/or operation of
transmission and distribution facilities. While the GPSC has held workshops to
discuss retail competition and industry restructuring, there has been no
proposed or enacted legislation to date in Georgia. Enactment would require
numerous issues to be resolved, including significant ones relating to
transmission pricing and recovery of costs. The GPSC continues its assessment of
the range of potential stranded costs. The inability of the Company to recover
all its costs, including the regulatory assets described in Note 1 to the
financial statements, could have a material effect on the financial condition of
the Company. The Company is attempting to reduce regulatory assets through the
GPSC retail rate order. See Note 3 to the financial statements under "Retail
Rate Order" for additional information.

     The Company is subject to the provisions of FASB Statement No. 71,
Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation. In the event that a
portion of the Company's operations is no longer subject to these provisions,
the Company would be required to write off related regulatory assets and
liabilities that are not specifically recoverable, and determine if any other
assets have been impaired. See Note 1 to the financial statements under
"Regulatory Assets and Liabilities" for additional information.

     The staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has questioned
certain of the current accounting practices of the electric utility industry -
including the Company's - regarding the recognition, measurement, and
classification in the financial statements of decommissioning costs for nuclear
generating facilities. In response to these questions, the FASB is reviewing the
accounting for liabilities related to the retirement of long-lived assets,
including nuclear decommissioning. If the FASB issues new accounting rules, the
estimated costs of retiring the Company's nuclear and other facilities may be
required to be recorded as liabilities in the Balance Sheets. Also, the annual
provisions for such costs could change. Because of the Company's current ability
to recover asset retirement costs through rates, these changes would not have a
significant adverse effect on results of operations. See Note 1 to the financial
statements under "Depreciation and Nuclear Decommissioning" for additional
information.

Exposure to Market Risks

Due to cost-based rate regulation, the Company currently has limited exposure to
market volatility in interest rates, commodity fuel prices and prices of
electricity. (See the discussion above for potential changes in industry
structure.) To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity
prices, the Company enters into fixed price contracts for the purchase and sale
of electricity through the wholesale electricity market. Realized gains and
losses are recognized in the income statement as incurred. At December 31, 2000,
exposure from these activities was not material to the Company's financial
position, results of operations, or cash flows. Also, based on the Company's
overall interest rate exposure at December 31, 2000, a near-term 100 basis point

change in interest rates would not materially affect the financial statements.

New Accounting Standard

In June 2000, the FASB issued Statement No. 138, an amendment of Statement
No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. Statement
No. 133, as amended, establishes accounting and reporting standards for
derivative instruments and for hedging activities. Statement No. 133 requires
that certain derivative instruments be recorded in the balance sheet as either
an asset or liability measured at fair value and that changes in the fair value
be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria
are met.

     Substantially all of the Company's bulk energy purchases and sales meet the
definition of a derivative under Statement No. 133. In many cases, these
transactions meet the normal purchase and sale exception and the related
contracts will continue to be accounted for under the accrual method. Certain of
these instruments qualify as cash flow hedges resulting in the deferral of
related gains and losses in other comprehensive income until the hedged
transactions occur. Any ineffectiveness will be recognized currently in net
income. However, others will be required to be marked to market through current
period income.

     The Company adopted the provisions of Statement No. 133 effective January
1, 2001. The impact on net income was immaterial. The application of the new
rules is still evolving and further guidance from the FASB is expected, which
could additionally impact the Company's financial statements.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Plant Additions

In 2000, gross utility plant additions were $1.1 billion. These additions were
primarily related to transmission and distribution facilities, the purchase of
nuclear fuel, and the construction of additional combustion turbine and combined
cycle units. The funds needed for gross property additions are currently
provided from operations, short-term and long-term debt, and capital
contributions from Southern Company. The Statements of Cash Flows provide
additional details.

Financing Activities

In 2000, the Company's financing costs increased due to the issuance of new debt
during the year. New issues during 1998 through 2000 totaled $1.5 billion and
retirement or repayment of higher-cost securities totaled $1.7 billion.

     Special purpose subsidiaries of the Company have issued mandatorily
redeemable preferred securities. See Note 9 to the financial statements under
"Preferred Securities" for additional information.

     Composite financing rates for long-term debt, preferred stock, and
preferred securities for the years 1998 through 2000, as of year-end, were as
follows:


                                   2000       1999        1998
                                ----------------------------------
Composite interest rate
   on long-term debt               5.90%       5.48%      5.64%
Composite preferred
   stock dividend rate             4.60        4.60       5.52
Composite preferred
   securities dividend rate        7.49        7.49       7.89
- ------------------------------------------------------------------

Liquidity and Capital Requirements

Cash provided from operations decreased by $135 million in 2000, primarily due
to higher fuel and purchased power expenses related to increased energy demands.

     The Company estimates that construction expenditures for the years 2001
through 2003 will total $1.6 billion, $1.3 billion, and $0.8 billion,
respectively. If the Company transfers wholesale generation assets to SPC in
2001 as contemplated, construction expenditures for the years 2001 through 2003
will total $1.0 billion, $0.9 billion, and $0.7 billion, respectively.
Investments in additional combustion turbine and combined cycle generating
units, transmission and distribution facilities, enhancements to existing
generating plants, and equipment to comply with environmental requirements are
planned.

     Cash requirements for redemptions announced and maturities of long-term
debt are expected to total $581 million during 2001 through 2003.

     As a result of requirements by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the
Company has established external trust funds for the purpose of funding nuclear


                                       II-84

decommissioning costs. The amount to be funded is $30 million each year in 2001,
2002, and 2003. For additional information concerning nuclear decommissioning
costs, see Note 1 to the financial statements under "Depreciation and Nuclear
Decommissioning."

Sources of Capital

The Company expects to meet future capital requirements primarily using funds
generated from operations and equity funds from Southern Company and, if needed,
by the issuance of new debt and equity securities, term loans, and short-term
borrowings. To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, the Company had
approximately $1.8 billion of unused credit arrangements with banks at the
beginning of 2001. See Note 9 to the financial statements under "Bank Credit
Arrangements" for additional information.

     Recently, the Company has relied on the issuance of unsecured debt and
trust preferred securities, in addition to unsecured pollution control bonds
issued for its benefit by public authorities, to meet its long-term external
financing requirements. In years past, the Company issued first mortgage bonds,
mortgage backed pollution control bonds and preferred stock to fund its external
requirements. The amount outstanding of the later securities has been steadily
declining during the last four years.

     If the Company were to choose to issue new first mortgage bonds or
preferred stock once again, it would be required to meet certain coverage
requirements.

ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES

Clean Air Act

In November 1990, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (Clean Air Act) were
signed into law. Title IV of the Clean Air Act -- the acid rain compliance
provision of the law -- significantly affected Southern Company's subsidiaries,
including the Company. Specific reductions in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide
emissions from fossil-fired generating plants are required in two phases. Phase
I compliance began in 1995 and some 50 generating units within Southern
Company's subsidiaries were brought into compliance with Phase I requirements.

     Southern Company's subsidiaries, including the Company, achieved Phase I
sulfur dioxide compliance at the affected units by switching to low-sulfur coal,
which required some equipment upgrades. Construction expenditures for the
Company's Phase I compliance totaled approximately $167 million.

     Phase II sulfur dioxide compliance was required in 2000. Southern Company's
subsidiaries, including the Company, used emission allowances and fuel switching
to comply with Phase II requirements. Also, equipment to control nitrogen oxide
emissions was installed on additional system fossil-fired units as necessary to
meet Phase II limits and ozone non-attainment requirements for metropolitan
Atlanta through 2000. Compliance for Phase II and initial ozone non-attainment
requirements increased total construction expenditures for the Company through
2000 by approximately $39 million.

     The one-hour ozone non-attainment standards for the Atlanta area have been
set and must be implemented in May 2003. Seven generating plants will be
affected in the Atlanta area. Additional construction expenditures for the
Company's compliance with these new rules are currently estimated at
approximately $705 million.

     A significant portion of costs related to the acid rain and ozone
non-attainment provisions of the Clean Air Act is expected to be recovered
through existing ratemaking provisions. However, there can be no assurance that
all Clean Air Act costs will be recovered.

                                       II-85



MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Georgia Power Company 2000 Annual Report

Environmental Protection Agency Litigation

On November 3, 1999, the EPA brought a civil action in the U.S. District Court
for the Northern District of Georgia. The complaint alleges violations of the
prevention of significant deterioration and new source review provisions of the
Clean Air Act with respect to coal-fired generating facilities at the Company's
Bowen and Scherer plants. The civil action requests penalties and injunctive
relief, including an order requiring the installation of the best available
control technology at the affected units. The EPA concurrently issued a notice
of violation to the Company relating to these two plants. In early 2000, the EPA
filed a motion to amend its complaint to add the violations alleged in its
notice of violation. The complaint and the notice of violation are similar to
those brought against and issued to several other electric utilities. The
complaint and the notice of violation allege that the Company failed to secure
necessary permits or install additional pollution equipment when performing
maintenance and construction at coal burning plants constructed or under
construction prior to 1978. The Company believes that it complied with
applicable laws and the EPA's regulations and interpretations in effect at the
time the work in question took place. The Clean Air Act authorizes civil
penalties of up to $27,500 per day per violation at each generating unit. Prior
to January 30, 1997, the penalty was $25,000 per day. An adverse outcome of this
matter could require substantial capital expenditures that cannot be determined
at this time and possibly require payment of substantial penalties. This could
affect future results of operations, cash flows, and possibly financial
condition unless such costs can be recovered through regulated rates.

Other Environmental Issues

In July 1997, the EPA revised the national ambient air quality standards for
ozone and particulate matter. This revision made the standards significantly
more stringent. In the subsequent litigation of these standards, the U.S.
Supreme Court recently dismissed certain challenges but found the EPA's
implementation program for the new ozone standard unlawful and remanded it to
the EPA. In addition, the Federal District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals
will address other legal challenges to these standards in mid-2001. If the
standards are eventually upheld, implementation could be required by 2007 to
2010.

     In September 1998, the EPA issued the final regional nitrogen oxide
reduction rules to the states for implementation. Compliance is required by May
31, 2004. The final rule affects 21 states, including Georgia.

     In December 2000, the EPA completed its utility study for mercury and other
hazardous air pollutants (HAPS) and issued a determination that an emission
control program for mercury and, perhaps, other HAPS is warranted. The program
is to be developed over the next four years under the Maximum Achievable Control
Technology (MACT) provisions of the Clean Air Act. This determination is being
challenged in the courts. In January 2001, the EPA proposed guidance for the
determination of Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) emission controls
under the Regional Haze Regulations. Installation of BART controls would likely
be required around 2010. Litigation of the BART rules is probable in the near
future.

     Implementation of the final state rules for these initiatives could require
substantial further reductions in nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, mercury, and
other HAPS emissions from fossil-fired generating facilities and other
industries in these states. Additional compliance costs and capital expenditures
resulting from the implementation of these rules and standards cannot be
determined until the results of legal challenges are known, and the states have
adopted their final rules. Reviews by the new administration in Washington, D.C.
add to the uncertainties associated with BART guidance and the MACT
determination for mercury and other HAPS.

     The Company must comply with other environmental laws and regulations that
cover the handling and disposal of hazardous waste. Under these various laws and
regulations, the Company could incur costs to clean up properties currently or
previously owned. The Company conducts studies to determine the extent of any
required clean-up costs and has recognized in the financial statements costs to
clean up known sites. These costs for the Company amounted to $4 million, $4
million, and $6 million in 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively. Additional sites
may require environmental remediation for which the Company may be liable for a
portion of or all required clean-up costs. See Note 3 to the financial
statements under "Other Environmental Contingencies" for information regarding
the Company's potentially responsible party status at a site in Brunswick,
Georgia, and the status of sites listed on the State of Georgia's hazardous site
inventory.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Georgia Power Company 2000 Annual Report


     The EPA and state environmental regulatory agencies are reviewing and
evaluating various matters including: control strategies to reduce regional
haze; limits on pollutant discharges to impaired waters; water intake
restrictions; and hazardous waste disposal requirements. The impact of any new
standards will depend on the development and implementation of applicable
regulations.

     Several major pieces of environmental legislation are being considered for
reauthorization or amendment by Congress. These include: the Clean Air Act; the
Clean Water Act; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and
Liability Act; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; the Toxic Substances
Control Act; and the Endangered Species Act. Changes to these laws could affect
many areas of the Company's operations. The full impact of any such changes
cannot be determined at this time.

     Compliance with possible additional legislation related to global climate
change, electromagnetic fields, and other environmental and health concerns
could significantly affect the Company. The impact of new legislation -- if any
- -- will depend on the subsequent development and implementation of applicable
regulations. In addition, the potential exists for liability as the result of
lawsuits alleging damages caused by electromagnetic fields.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Georgia Power Company 2000 Annual Report


1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
    POLICIES

General

The Company is a wholly owned subsidiary of Southern Company, which is the
parent company of five integrated Southeast utilities, Southern Company Services
(SCS), the system service company, Southern Communications Services (Southern
LINC), Mirant Corporation (formerly Southern Energy), Southern Nuclear Operating
Company (Southern Nuclear), Southern Company Energy Solutions, and other direct
and indirect subsidiaries. The integrated Southeast utilities (Alabama Power
Company, Georgia Power Company, Gulf Power Company, Mississippi Power Company,
and Savannah Electric and Power Company) provide electric service in four
states. Contracts among the integrated Southeast utilities -- related to jointly
owned generating facilities, interconnecting transmission lines, and the
exchange of electric power -- are regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC) or the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). SCS provides,
at cost, specialized services to Southern Company and subsidiary companies.
Southern LINC provides digital wireless communications services to the
subsidiary companies and also markets these services to the public within the
Southeast. Southern Company Energy Solutions develops new business opportunities
related to energy products and services. Southern Nuclear provides services to
Southern Company's nuclear power plants. Mirant Corporation acquires, develops,
builds, owns, and operates power production and delivery facilities and provides
a broad range of energy-related services to utilities and industrial companies
in selected countries around the world. Mirant Corporation's businesses include
independent power projects, integrated utilities, a distribution company, and
energy trading and marketing businesses outside the Southeastern United States.

     Southern Company is registered as a holding company under the Public
Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (PUHCA). Both Southern Company and its
subsidiaries are subject to the regulatory provisions of the PUHCA. The Company
is also subject to regulation by the FERC and the Georgia Public Service
Commission (GPSC). The Company follows accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States and complies with the accounting policies and practices
prescribed by the respective regulatory commissions. The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States requires the use of estimates, and the actual results may
differ from these estimates.

     Certain prior years' data presented in the financial statements have been
reclassified to conform with current year presentation.

Related-Party Transactions

The Company has an agreement with SCS under which the following services are
rendered to the Company at cost: general and design engineering, purchasing,
accounting and statistical, finance and treasury, tax, information resources,
marketing, auditing, insurance and pension, human resources, systems and
procedures, and other services with respect to business and operations and power
pool operations. Costs for these services amounted to $269 million, $253
million, and $251 million during 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively.

     The Company has an agreement with Southern Nuclear under which the
following nuclear-related services are rendered to the Company at cost: general
executive and advisory services; general operations, management and technical
services; administrative services including procurement, accounting and
statistical, employee relations, and systems and procedures services; strategic
planning and budgeting services; and other services with respect to business and
operations. Costs for these services amounted to $281 million, $270 million, and
$269 million during 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively.

Regulatory Assets and Liabilities

The Company is subject to the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB) Statement No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of
Regulation. Regulatory assets represent probable future revenues associated with
certain costs that are expected to be recovered from customers through the
ratemaking process. Regulatory liabilities represent probable future reductions
in revenues associated with amounts that are expected to be credited to
customers through the ratemaking process. Pursuant to the terms of the GPSC
retail rate order, the Company recorded $135 million and $85 million in 2000 and
1999, respectively, of accelerated cost recovery of regulatory assets which have

                                      II-95

been recorded on the balance sheet as a regulatory liability. See Note 3 under
"Retail Rate Order" for additional information. Regulatory assets and
(liabilities) reflected in the Company's Balance Sheets at December 31 relate to
the following:

===============================================================

     In the event that a portion of the Company's operations is no longer
subject to the provisions of Statement No. 71, the Company would be required to
write off related regulatory assets and liabilities that are not specifically
recoverable through regulated rates. In addition, the Company would be required
to determine if any impairment to other assets exists, including plant, and
write down the assets, if impaired, to their fair value.

Revenues and Fuel Costs

The Company currently operates as a vertically integrated utility providing
electricity to retail customers within its traditional service area located
within the state of Georgia, and to wholesale customers in the Southeast.

     Revenues are recognized as services are rendered. Unbilled revenues are
accrued at the end of each fiscal period. Fuel costs are expensed as the fuel is
used. The Company's fuel cost recovery mechanism includes provisions to adjust
billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, the energy component of purchased power
costs, and certain other costs. Revenues are adjusted for differences between
recoverable fuel costs and amounts actually recovered in current rates.

     The Company has a diversified base of customers. No single customer or
industry comprises 10 percent or more of revenues. For all periods presented,
uncollectible accounts averaged less than 1 percent of revenues.

     Fuel expense includes the amortization of the cost of nuclear fuel and a
charge, based on nuclear generation, for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear
fuel. Total charges for nuclear fuel included in fuel expense amounted to $75
million in 2000, $74 million in 1999, and $74 million in 1998. The Company has a
contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) that provides for the
permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel. The DOE failed to begin disposing of
spent fuel in January 1998 as required by the contracts, and the Company is
pursuing legal remedies against the government for breach of contract. Effective
June 2000, the on-site dry storage facility for Plant Hatch became operational.
Sufficient capacity is believed available to continue dry storage operations at
Plant Hatch through the life of the plant. Sufficient fuel storage capacity
currently is available at Plant Vogtle to maintain full-core discharge
capability for both units into the year 2014.

     Also, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 required the establishment of a Uranium
Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund, which is to be funded in
part by a special assessment on utilities with nuclear plants. The assessment
will be paid over a 15-year period, which began in 1993. This fund will be used
by the DOE for the decontamination and decommissioning of its nuclear fuel
enrichment facilities. The law provides that utilities will recover these
payments in the same manner as any other fuel expense. The Company -- based on
its ownership interests -- estimates its remaining liability under this law at
December 31, 2000 to be approximately $19 million. This obligation is recorded
in the accompanying Balance Sheets.

Depreciation and Nuclear Decommissioning

Depreciation of the original cost of depreciable utility plant in service is
provided primarily by using composite straight-line rates, which approximated
3.3 percent in 2000 and 1999, and 3.2 percent in 1998. In addition, pursuant to
a GPSC retail rate order, the Company recorded accelerated depreciation of
electric plant of $304 million in 1998. Total accelerated depreciation recorded
under the GPSC retail rate order was $467 million. These charges are recorded in
the accumulated provision for depreciation. When property subject to
depreciation is retired or otherwise disposed of in the normal course of


                                      II-96

NOTES (continued)
Georgia Power Company 2000 Annual Report

business, its original cost -- together with the cost of removal, less salvage
- -- is charged to accumulated depreciation. Minor items of property included in
the original cost of the plant are retired when the related property unit is
retired. Depreciation expense includes an amount for the expected costs of
decommissioning nuclear facilities and removal of other facilities.

     Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) regulations require all licensees
operating commercial power reactors to establish a plan for providing, with
reasonable assurance, funds for decommissioning. The Company has established
external trust funds to comply with the NRC's regulations. Amounts previously
recorded in internal reserves are being transferred into the external trust
funds over a set period of time as ordered by the GPSC. Earnings on the trust
funds are considered in determining decommissioning expense. The NRC's minimum
external funding requirements are based on a generic estimate of the cost to
decommission the radioactive portions of a nuclear unit based on the size and
type of reactor. The Company has filed plans with the NRC to ensure that -- over
time -- the deposits and earnings of the external trust funds will provide the
minimum funding amounts prescribed by the NRC.

     The Company periodically conducts site-specific studies to estimate the
actual cost of decommissioning its nuclear generating facilities. Site study
cost is the estimate to decommission the facility as of the site study year, and
ultimate cost is the estimate to decommission the facility as of its retirement
date. The estimated site study costs based on the most current study and
ultimate costs assuming an inflation rate of 4.7 percent for the Company's
ownership interests are as follows:

     The decommissioning cost estimates are based on prompt dismantlement and
removal of the plant from service. The actual decommissioning costs may vary
from the above estimates because of changes in the assumed date of
decommissioning, changes in the NRC requirements, changes in the assumptions
used in making the estimates, changes in regulatory requirements, changes in
technology, and changes in costs of labor, materials, and equipment. The Company
has filed with the NRC an application requesting a 20-year renewal of the
licenses for both units at Plant Hatch which would permit the operation of both
units until 2034.

     Annual provisions for nuclear decommissioning expense are based on an
annuity method as approved by the GPSC. The amounts expensed in 2000 and fund
balances as of December 31, 2000 were:

     Effective January 1, 1999, the GPSC increased the annual provision for
decommissioning expenses to $28 million from $20 million in 1998. This amount
is based on the NRC generic estimate to decommission the radioactive

portion of the facilities as of 1997 of $526 million and $438 million for
Plants Hatch and Vogtle, respectively. The ultimate costs associated with the
1997 NRC minimum funding requirements are $1.1 billion and $1.3 billion for
Plants Hatch and Vogtle, respectively. Significant assumptions include an
estimated inflation rate of 3.6 percent and an estimated trust earnings rate
of 6.5 percent. The Company expects the GPSC to periodically review and adjust,
if necessary, the amounts collected in rates for the anticipated cost of
decommissioning.

Income Taxes

The Company uses the liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes
and provides deferred income taxes for all significant income tax temporary
differences. Investment tax credits utilized are deferred and amortized to
income over the average lives of the related property.

Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC)

AFUDC represents the estimated debt and equity costs of capital funds that are
necessary to finance the construction of new regulated facilities. While cash is
not realized currently from such allowance, it increases the revenue requirement
over the service life of the plant through a higher rate base and higher
depreciation expense. For the years 2000, 1999, and 1998, the average AFUDC
rates were 6.74 percent, 5.61 percent, and 6.71 percent, respectively. AFUDC,
net of taxes, as a percentage of net income after dividends on preferred stock,
was less than 2.0 percent for 2000, 1999 and 1998.

Property, Plant, and Equipment

Property, plant, and equipment is stated at original cost, less regulatory
disallowances and impairments. Original cost includes: materials; labor;
payroll-related costs such as taxes, pensions, and other benefits; and the cost
of funds used during construction. The cost of maintenance, repairs, and
replacement of minor items of property is charged to maintenance expense. The
cost of replacements of property (exclusive of minor items of property) is
capitalized.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

For purposes of the financial statements, temporary cash investments are
considered cash equivalents. Temporary cash investments are securities with
original maturities of 90 days or less.

Financial Instruments

The Company has a firm commitment that requires payment in euros. As a hedge
against fluctuations in the exchange rate for euros, the Company entered into
forward currency swaps. The notional amount is 15.9 million euros maturing in
2001 through 2002. At December 31, 2000, the unrecognized gain on these swaps
was approximately $1.3 million.

     The Company's financial instruments for which the carrying amounts did not
approximate fair value at December 31 were as follows:

  At December 31, 1999                      $789        $680
- --------------------------------------------------------------

     The fair values for securities were based on either closing market prices
or closing prices of comparable instruments.

Materials and Supplies

Generally, materials and supplies include the cost of transmission,
distribution, and generating plant materials. Materials are charged to inventory
when purchased and then expensed or capitalized to plant, as appropriate, when
installed.

2.  RETIREMENT BENEFITS

The Company has defined benefit, trusteed pension plans that cover substantially
all employees. The Company provides certain medical care and life insurance
benefits for retired employees. Substantially all these employees may become
eligible for such benefits when they retire. The Company funds postretirement
trusts to the extent required by the GPSC and FERC. In late 2000, the Company
adopted several pension and postretirement benefits plan changes that had the

effect of increasing benefits to both current and future retirees. The effects
of these changes will be to increase annual pension and postretirement benefits
costs by approximately $10 million and $6 million, respectively. The measurement
date for plan assets and obligations is September 30 of each year.

     The weighted average rates assumed in the actuarial calculations for both
the pension and postretirement benefit plans were:

                                                2000      1999

Employee Savings Plan

The Company also sponsors a 401(k) defined contribution plan covering
substantially all employees. The Company provides a 75 percent matching
contribution up to 6 percent of an employee's base salary. Total matching
contributions made to the plan for the years 2000, 1999, and 1998 were $15
million, $15 million, and $14 million, respectively.

3. CONTINGENCIES & REGULATORY MATTERS

Retail Rate Order

On December 18, 1998, the GPSC approved a three-year retail rate order for the
Company ending December 31, 2001. Under the terms of the order, earnings are
evaluated against a retail return on common equity range of 10 percent to 12.5
percent. Retail rates were decreased by $262 million on an annual basis
effective January 1, 1999, and by an additional $24 million effective January 1,
2000. The order further provides for $85 million in each year, plus up to $50
million of any earnings above the 12.5 percent return during the second and
third years, to be applied to accelerated amortization or depreciation of
assets. Two-thirds of any additional earnings above the 12.5 percent return will
be applied to rate reductions, with the remaining one-third retained by the
Company. Pursuant to the order, in 2000 and 1999, the Company recorded $85
million each year in accelerated amortization of regulatory assets. In 2000, the
Company also recorded the additional $50 million of accelerated amortization.
The accelerated amortization is recorded in a regulatory liability account and,
as mandated by the GPSC, the Company recorded $10 million of interest on the
amounts in the regulatory liability account. In addition, the Company recorded
$44 million and $79 million of revenue subject to refund for estimated earnings
above 12.5 percent retail return on common equity in 2000 and 1999,
respectively. Refunds applicable to 1999 were made to customers in 2000. The
estimated 2000 refund is included in other current liabilities on the Balance
Sheet. The Company will file a general rate case on July 2, 2001, in response to


                                       II-100

which the GPSC would be expected to determine whether the rate order should be
continued, modified, or discontinued.

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Litigation

On November 3, 1999, the EPA brought a civil action in the U.S. District Court
for the Northern District of Georgia. The complaint alleges violations of the
prevention of significant deterioration and new source review provisions of the
Clean Air Act with respect to coal-fired generating facilities at the Company's
Bowen and Scherer plants. The civil action requests penalties and injunctive
relief, including an order requiring the installation of the best available
control technology at the affected units beginning at the point of the alleged
violations. The Clean Air Act authorizes civil penalties of up to $27,500 per
day, per violation at each generating unit. Prior to January 30, 1997, the
penalty was $25,000 per day.

     The EPA concurrently issued a notice of violation to the Company relating
to these two plants. In early 2000, the EPA filed a motion to amend its
complaint to add the violations alleged in its notice of violation. The
complaint and the notice of violation are similar to those brought against and
issued to several other electric utilities. The complaint and the notice of
violation allege that the Company failed to secure necessary permits or install
additional pollution equipment when performing maintenance and construction at
coal burning plants constructed or under construction prior to 1978. The Company
believes that it complied with applicable laws and the EPA's regulations and
interpretations in effect at the time the work in question took place.

     An adverse outcome of this matter could require substantial capital
expenditures that cannot be determined at this time and possibly require payment
of substantial penalties. This could affect future results of operations, cash
flows, and possibly financial condition unless such costs can be recovered
through regulated rates.

Other Environmental Contingencies

In January 1995, the Company and four other unrelated entities were notified by
the EPA that they have been designated as potentially responsible parties under
the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act with
respect to a site in Brunswick, Georgia. As of December 31, 2000, the Company
has recognized approximately $5 million in cumulative expenses associated with
the Company's agreed upon share of removal and remedial investigation and
feasibility study costs for this site. The final outcome of this matter cannot
now be determined. However, based on the nature and extent of the Company's
activities relating to the site, management believes that the Company's portion
of any remaining remediation costs should not be material to the financial
statements.

     In compliance with the Georgia Hazardous Site Response Act of 1993, the
State of Georgia was required to compile an inventory of all known or suspected
sites where hazardous wastes, constituents, or substances have been disposed of
or released in quantities deemed reportable by the State. In developing this
list, the State identified several hundred properties throughout the State,
including 34 sites which may require environmental remediation that were either
previously or are currently owned by the Company. The majority of these sites
are electrical power substations and power generation facilities. The Company
has remediated ten electrical substations on the list at a cumulative cost of
approximately $3 million through December 31, 2000. The State has removed from
the list three power generation facilities following the assessment which
indicated no remediation was necessary. In addition, the Company has recognized
approximately $27.5 million in cumulative expenses through December 31, 2000 for
the assessment of the remaining sites on the list and the anticipated clean-up
cost for 14 sites that the Company plans to remediate. Any additional costs of
remediating the remaining sites cannot presently be determined until such
studies are completed for each site and the State determines whether remediation
is required. If all listed sites were required to be remediated, the Company
could incur expenses of up to approximately $5 million in additional clean-up
costs and construction expenditures of up to approximately $37 million to
develop new waste management facilities or install additional pollution control
devices.

Nuclear Performance Standards

The GPSC has adopted a nuclear performance standard for the Company's nuclear
generating units under which the performance of Plants Hatch and Vogtle is
evaluated every three years. The performance standard is based on each unit's
capacity factor as compared to the average of all comparable U.S. nuclear units

                                       II-101

NOTES (continued)
Georgia Power Company 2000 Annual Report


operating at a capacity factor of 50 percent or higher during the three-year
period of evaluation. Depending on the performance of the units, the Company
could receive a monetary award or penalty under the performance standards
criteria.

     In January 1997, the GPSC approved a performance award of approximately
$11.7 million for performance during the 1993-1995 period. This award was
collected through the retail fuel cost recovery provision and recognized in
income over the 36-month period ending in December 1999. In February 2000, the
GPSC approved a performance award of approximately $7.8 million for performance
during the 1996-1998 period. This award is being collected through the retail
fuel cost recovery provision and recognized in income over a 36-month period
that began in January 2000, as mandated by the GPSC.

Race Discrimination Litigation

On July 28, 2000, a lawsuit alleging race discrimination was filed by three
Georgia Power employees against the Company, Southern Company, and SCS in the
United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. The lawsuit
also raised claims on behalf of a purported class. The plaintiffs seek
compensatory and punitive damages in an unspecified amount, as well as
injunctive relief. On August 14, 2000, the lawsuit was amended to add four more
plaintiffs and a new defendant, Southern Company Energy Solutions, Inc. The
lawsuit is in the discovery stage. The final outcome of this case cannot now be
determined.

4.  COMMITMENTS

Construction Program

The Company is constructing Plant Dahlberg, a ten unit, 800 megawatt combustion
turbine peaking power plant. Units one through eight began operation in May
2000; units nine and ten are expected to begin operation in June 2001. The
Company is also constructing a 571 megawatt combined cycle unit and a 610
megawatt combined cycle unit at Plant Goat Rock that will begin operation in
2002 and in 2003, respectively, and an addition of two 566 megawatt combined
cycle units at Plant Wansley, to begin operation in 2002. During 2001, the
Company plans to transfer the units at Plants Dahlberg, Goat Rock, and Wansley
at net book value to Southern Power Company (SPC), a new subsidiary formed by
Southern Company. Significant construction of transmission and distribution
facilities, and projects to upgrade and extend the useful life of generating
plants and to remain in compliance with environmental requirements will
continue. The Company currently estimates property additions to be approximately
$1.6 billion in 2001, $1.3 billion in 2002, and $0.8 billion in 2003. If the
Company transfers wholesale generation assets to SPC in 2001 as contemplated,
construction expenditures for the years 2001 through 2003 will total $1.0
billion, $0.9 billion, and $0.7 billion, respectively.

     The construction program is subject to periodic review and revision, and
actual construction costs may vary from estimates because of numerous factors,
including, but not limited to, changes in business conditions, load growth
estimates, environmental regulations, and regulatory requirements.

Fuel Commitments

To supply a portion of the fuel requirements of its generating plants, the
Company has entered into various long-term commitments for the procurement of
fossil and nuclear fuel. In most cases, these contracts contain provisions for
price escalations, minimum purchase levels, and other financial commitments.
Total estimated long-term fossil and nuclear fuel commitments at December 31,
2000 were as follows:

Purchased Power Commitments

The Company and an affiliate, Alabama Power Company, own equally all of the
outstanding capital stock of Southern Electric Generating Company (SEGCO), which


                                       II-102

NOTES (continued)
Georgia Power Company 2000 Annual Report


owns electric generating units with a total rated capacity of 1,020 megawatts,
as well as associated transmission facilities. The capacity of the units has
been sold equally to the Company and Alabama Power Company under a contract
which, in substance, requires payments sufficient to provide for the operating
expenses, taxes, debt service, and return on investment, whether or not SEGCO
has any capacity and energy available. The term of the contract extends
automatically for two-year periods, subject to either party's right to cancel
upon two year's notice. The Company's share of expenses included in purchased
power from affiliates in the Statements of Income is as follows:

    The Company has commitments regarding a portion of a 5 percent interest in
Plant Vogtle owned by Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia (MEAG) that are in
effect until the latter of the retirement of the plant or the latest stated
maturity date of MEAG's bonds issued to finance such ownership interest. The
payments for capacity are required whether or not any capacity is available. The
energy cost is a function of each unit's variable operating costs. Except as
noted below, the cost of such capacity and energy is included in purchased power
from non-affiliates in the Company's Statements of Income. Capacity payments
totaled $58 million, $57 million, and $56 million in 2000, 1999, and 1998,
respectively. The current projected Plant Vogtle capacity payments are:

5.  NUCLEAR INSURANCE

Under the Price-Anderson Amendments Act of 1988, the Company maintains
agreements of indemnity with the NRC that, together with private insurance,
cover third-party liability arising from any nuclear incident occurring at the
Company's nuclear power plants. The Act provides funds up to $9.5 billion for
public liability claims that could arise from a single nuclear incident. Each
nuclear plant is insured against this liability to a maximum of $200 million by
private insurance, with the remaining coverage provided by a mandatory program


                                       II-103

NOTES (continued)
Georgia Power Company 2000 Annual Report


of deferred premiums that could be assessed, after a nuclear incident, against
all owners of nuclear reactors. The Company could be assessed up to $88 million
per incident for each licensed reactor it operates but not more than an
aggregate of $10 million per incident to be paid in a calendar year for each
reactor. Such maximum assessment for the Company, excluding any applicable state
premium taxes -- based on its ownership and buyback interests -- is $178 million
per incident but not more than an aggregate of $20 million to be paid for each
incident in any one year.

     The Company is a member of Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL), a
mutual insurer established to provide property damage insurance in an amount up
to $500 million for members' nuclear generating facilities.

     Additionally, the Company has policies that currently provide
decontamination, excess property insurance, and premature decommissioning
coverage up to $2.25 billion for losses in excess of the $500 million primary
coverage. This excess insurance is also provided by NEIL.

     NEIL also covers the additional costs that would be incurred in obtaining
replacement power during a prolonged accidental outage at a member's nuclear
plant. Members can be insured against increased costs of replacement power in an
amount up to $3.5 million per week -- starting 12 weeks after the outage -- for
one year and up to $2.8 million per week for the second and third years.

     Under each of the NEIL policies, members are subject to assessments if
losses each year exceed the accumulated funds available to the insurer under
that policy. The current maximum annual assessments for the Company under the
three NEIL policies would be $19 million.

     For all on-site property damage insurance policies for commercial nuclear
power plants, the NRC requires that the proceeds of such policies should be
dedicated first for the sole purpose of placing the reactor in a safe and stable
condition after an accident. Any remaining proceeds are to be applied next
toward the costs of decontamination and debris removal operations ordered by the
NRC, and any further remaining proceeds are to be paid either to the Company or
to its bond trustees as may be appropriate under the policies and applicable
trust indentures.

     All retrospective assessments, whether generated for liability, property,
or replacement power, may be subject to applicable state premium taxes.

6.  JOINT OWNERSHIP AGREEMENTS

Except as otherwise noted, the Company has contracted to operate and maintain
all jointly owned generating facilities. The Company jointly owns the Rocky
Mountain pumped storage hydroelectric plant with Oglethorpe Power Company who is
the operator of the plant. The Company also jointly owns Plant McIntosh with
Savannah Electric and Power Company who operates the plant. The Company and
Florida Power Corporation (FPC) jointly own a combustion turbine unit
(Intercession City) operated by FPC.

     The Company includes its proportionate share of plant operating expenses in
the corresponding operating expenses in the Statements of Income.

     At December 31, 2000, the Company's percentage ownership and investment
(exclusive of nuclear fuel) in jointly owned facilities in commercial operation
were as follows:

7.  LONG-TERM POWER SALES AND LEASE
    AGREEMENTS

The Company and the other integrated Southeast utilities of Southern Company
have long-term contractual agreements for the sale of capacity and energy to
non-affiliated utilities located outside the system's service area. These

                                       II-104

NOTES (continued)
Georgia Power Company 2000 Annual Report


agreements consist of firm unit power sales pertaining to capacity from specific
generating units. Because energy is generally sold at cost under these
agreements, it is primarily the capacity revenues that affect the Company's
profitability.

     The Company's capacity revenues were as follows:

               Year      Revenues      Capacity
               -------------------------------------

               -------------------------------------

     Unit power from specific generating plants is being sold to Florida Power &
Light Company, FPC, and Jacksonville Electric Authority. Under these agreements,
approximately 102 megawatts of capacity is scheduled to be sold annually for
periods after 2000 with a minimum of three years notice until the expiration of
the contracts in 2010.

     During 2000, the Company entered into certain operating leases for portions
of its generating unit capacity. Minimum future capacity revenues from
noncancelable operating leases as of December 31, 2000 were as follows:

8.  INCOME TAXES

At December 31, 2000, tax-related regulatory assets were $566 million and
tax-related regulatory liabilities were $247 million. The assets are
attributable to tax benefits flowed through to customers in prior years and to
taxes applicable to capitalized interest. The liabilities are attributable to
deferred taxes previously recognized at rates higher than current enacted tax
law and to unamortized investment tax credits.

     Details of the federal and state income tax provisions are as follows:

31, 2000, all investment tax credits available to reduce federal income taxes
payable had been utilized.

9.  CAPITALIZATION

First Mortgage Bond Indenture Restrictions

The Company's first mortgage bond indenture contains various restrictions that
remain in effect as long as the bonds are outstanding. At December 31, 2000,
$891 million of retained earnings and paid-in capital was unrestricted for the
payment of cash dividends or any other distributions under terms of the mortgage
indenture. If additional first mortgage bonds are issued, supplemental
indentures in connection with those issues may contain more stringent
restrictions than those currently in effect. The Company has no restrictions on
the amount of indebtedness it may incur.

Preferred Securities

Statutory business trusts formed by the Company, of which the Company owns all
the common securities, have issued mandatorily redeemable preferred securities
as follows:


              Date of                                 Maturity
               Issue     Amount      Rate    Notes      Date
            ---------------------------------------------------
                       (millions)           (millions)
Trust I       8/1996      $225.00  7.75%     $232      6/2036
Trust II      1/1997       175.00  7.60       180     12/2036
Trust III     6/1997       189.25  7.75       195      3/2037
Trust IV      2/1999       200.00  6.85       206      3/2029

     Substantially all of the assets of each trust are junior subordinated notes
issued by the Company in the respective approximate principal amounts set forth
above.

     The Company considers that the mechanisms and obligations relating to the
preferred securities, taken together, constitute a full and unconditional
guarantee by the Company of the Trusts' payment obligations with respect to the
preferred securities.

     The Trusts are subsidiaries of the Company, and accordingly are
consolidated in the Company's financial statements.

Pollution Control Bonds

The Company has incurred obligations in connection with the sale by public
authorities of tax-exempt pollution control revenue bonds. The Company has
authenticated and delivered to trustees an aggregate of $378.8 million of its
first mortgage bonds outstanding at December 31, 2000, which are pledged as
security for its obligations under pollution control revenue contracts. No
interest on these first mortgage bonds is payable unless and until a default
occurs on the installment purchase or loan agreements.

Senior Notes

In February 2000 and February 2001, the Company issued unsecured senior notes.
The proceeds of these issues were used to redeem higher cost long-term debt and
to reduce short-term borrowing. The senior notes are, in effect, subordinated to
all secured debt of the Company, including its first mortgage bonds.

Bank Credit Arrangements

At the beginning of 2001, the Company had unused credit arrangements with banks
totaling $1.8 billion, of which $1.3 billion expires at various times during
2001, and $500 million expires at April 24, 2003.

     Of the total $1.8 billion in unused credit, $1.65 billion is a syndicated
credit arrangement with $1.15 billion expiring April 20, 2001, and $500 million
expiring April 24, 2003. Upon expiration, the $1.15 billion agreement provides
the option of converting borrowings into two-year term loans. Both agreements
contain stated borrowing rates but also allow for competitive bid loans. In



                                       II-106

NOTES (continued)
Georgia Power Company 2000 Annual Report


addition, the agreements require payment of commitment fees based on the unused
portions of the commitments. Annual fees are also paid to the agent bank.

     Approximately $115 million of the $1.3 billion arrangements expiring during
2001 allow for two-year term loans executable upon the expiration date of the
facilities. All of the arrangements include stated borrowing rates but also
allow for negotiated rates. These agreements also require payment of commitment
fees based on the unused portion of the commitments or the maintenance of
compensating balances with the banks. These balances are not legally restricted
from withdrawal.

     This $1.8 billion in unused credit arrangements provides liquidity support
to the Company's variable rate pollution control bonds. The amount of variable
rate pollution control bonds outstanding requiring that liquidity support as of
December 31, 2000 was $979 million.

     In addition, the Company borrows under uncommitted lines of credit with
banks and through a $750 million commercial paper program that has the liquidity
support of committed bank credit arrangements. Average compensating balances
held under these committed facilities were not material in 2000.

Other Long-Term Debt

Assets acquired under capital leases are recorded in the Balance Sheets as
utility plant in service, and the related obligations are classified as
long-term debt. At December 31, 2000 and 1999, the Company had a capitalized
lease obligation for its corporate headquarters building of $87 million with an
interest rate of 8.1 percent. The lease agreement provides for payments that are
minimal in early years and escalate through the first 21 years of the lease. For
ratemaking purposes, the GPSC has treated the lease as an operating lease and
has allowed only the lease payments in cost of service. The difference between
the accrued expense and the lease payments allowed for ratemaking purposes is
being deferred as a cost to be recovered in the future as ordered by the GPSC.
At December 31, 2000 and 1999, the interest and lease amortization deferred on
the Balance Sheets are $55 million and $54 million, respectively.

Assets Subject to Lien

The Company's mortgage dated as of March 1, 1941, as amended and supplemented,
securing the first mortgage bonds issued by the Company, constitutes a direct
lien on substantially all of the Company's fixed property and franchises.

Securities Due Within One Year

A summary of the improvement fund requirements and scheduled maturities and
redemptions of securities due within one year at December 31 is as follows:

                                                2000     1999

- ---------------------------------------------------------------
Total long-term debt                              $2      $156
===============================================================

     The Company's first mortgage bond indenture includes an improvement fund
requirement that amounts to 1 percent of each outstanding series of bonds
authenticated under the indenture prior to January 1 of each year, other than
those issued to collateralize pollution control obligations. The requirement may
be satisfied by June 1 of each year by depositing cash, reacquiring bonds, or by
pledging additional property equal to 1 2/3 times the requirement.

Redemption of Securities

The Company plans to continue, to the extent possible, a program of redeeming or
replacing debt and preferred securities in cases where opportunities exist to
reduce financing costs. Issues may be repurchased in the open market or called
at premiums as specified under terms of the issue. They may also be redeemed at
face value to meet improvement fund requirements, to meet replacement provisions
of the mortgage, or through use of proceeds from the sale of property pledged
under the mortgage.

     Under the GPSC retail rate order, the Company recorded $135 million and $85
million of accelerated amortization in 2000 and 1999, respectively, which were
recorded monthly as an operating expense. The fourth quarter December 1999
operating income has been restated to reflect the accelerated amortization as an
operating expense rather than as amortization of premium on reacquired debt. See
Note 3 to the financial statements under "Retail Rate Order" for additional
information.

     The Company's business is influenced by seasonal weather conditions.

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT
Gulf Power Company 2000 Annual Report


The management of Gulf Power Company has prepared -- and is responsible for --
the financial statements and related information included in this report. These
statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States and necessarily include amounts that are based on
the best estimates and judgments of management. Financial information throughout
this annual report is consistent with the financial statements.

   The Company maintains a system of internal accounting controls to provide
reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and that the accounting records
reflect only authorized transactions of the Company. Limitations exist in any
system of internal controls, however, based on a recognition that the cost of
the system should not exceed its benefits. The Company believes its system of
internal accounting controls maintains an appropriate cost/benefit relationship.

   The Company's system of internal accounting controls is evaluated on an
ongoing basis by the Company's internal audit staff. The Company's independent
public accountants also consider certain elements of the internal control system
in order to determine their auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the financial statements.

   The audit committee of the board of directors, composed of independent
directors provides a broad overview of management's financial reporting and
control functions. Periodically, this committee meets with management, the
internal auditors, and the independent public accountants to ensure that these
groups are fulfilling their obligations and to discuss auditing, internal
controls, and financial reporting matters. The internal auditors and independent
public accountants have access to the members of the audit committee at any
time.

   Management believes that its policies and procedures provide reasonable
assurance that the Company's operations are conducted according to a high
standard of business ethics.

   In management's opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows
of Gulf Power Company in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS


To Gulf Power Company:

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets and statements of capitalization
of Gulf Power Company (a Maine corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of
Southern Company) as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the related statements
of income, common stockholder's equity, and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2000. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

   We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

   In our opinion, the financial statements (pages II-123 through II-137)
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Gulf Power Company as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2000, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL
CONDITION
Gulf Power Company 2000 Annual Report


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

Gulf Power Company's 2000 net income after dividends on preferred stock was
$51.8 million, a decrease of $1.9 million from the previous year. In 1999,
earnings were $53.7 million, down $2.8 million when compared to 1998. The
decrease in earnings in 2000, as well as 1999, was primarily a result of higher
expenses than in the prior year.

Revenues

Operating revenues increased in 2000 when compared to 1999. The following table
summarizes the change in operating revenues for the past two years:

                                             Increase (Decrease)

Percent change                                  6.0%        3.6%
- ------------------------------------------------------------------

   Retail revenues of $562.2 million in 2000 increased $49.4 million, or 9.6
percent, from the prior year due primarily to the recovery of higher fuel and
purchased power costs. Retail base rate revenues increased $3.8 million due to
increased customer growth and hotter than normal weather, offset by a $10
million permanent annual rate reduction and $6.9 million of revenues subject to
refund based upon the current retail revenue sharing plan (See Note 3 to the
financial statements under "Retail Revenue Sharing Plan" for further
information). Retail revenues for 1999 increased $3.6 million, or 0.7 percent,
when compared to 1998 due primarily to an increase in the number of retail
customers served by the Company.

   The 2000 increase in regulatory cost recovery and other retail revenues over
1999 is primarily attributable to higher fuel and purchased power costs. The
1999 increase in regulatory cost recovery and other retail revenues over 1998 is
primarily attributable to the recovery of increased purchased power capacity
costs. "Regulatory cost recovery and other" includes the following:  recovery
provisions for fuel expense and the energy component of purchased power costs;
energy conservation costs; purchased power capacity costs; and environmental
compliance costs. The recovery provisions generally equal the related expenses
and have no material effect on net income. See Notes 1 and 3 to the financial
statements under "Revenues and Regulatory Cost Recovery Clauses" and
"Environmental Cost Recovery," respectively, for further information.

   Sales for resale were $133.9 million in 2000, an increase of $5.4 million, or
4.2 percent, over 1999 primarily due to additional energy sales. Revenues from
sales to utilities outside the service area under long-term contracts consist of
capacity and energy components. Capacity revenues reflect the recovery of fixed
costs and a return on investment under the contracts. Energy is generally sold
at variable cost. The capacity and energy components under these long-term
contracts were as follows:

                             2000         1999          1998
                     ----------------------------------------
                        (in thousands)
Capacity                  $20,270      $19,792       $22,503
Energy                     21,922       20,251        14,556
- -------------------------------------------------------------
Total                     $42,192      $40,043       $37,059
=============================================================

   Capacity revenues increased slightly in 2000 due to the recovery of higher
operating expenses experienced during the year. Capacity revenues had been
declining in prior years due to the decreasing net investment related to these
sales. This downward trend accelerated during 1999 as a result of a reduction in
the authorized rate of return on the equity component of the investment.

   Sales to affiliated companies vary from year to year depending on demand and
the availability and cost of generating resources at each company. These sales
have little impact on earnings.

   Other operating revenues decreased in 2000 and in 1999 due primarily to the
retail recovery clause adjustments for the difference between recoverable costs
and the amounts actually reflected in current rates. See Notes 1 and 3 to the
financial statements under "Revenues and Regulatory Cost Recovery Clauses" and
"Environmental Cost Recovery," respectively, for further discussion.

Gulf Power Company 2000 Annual Report


Energy Sales

   Kilowatt-hour sales for 2000 and the percent changes by year were as follows:

                             KWH      Percent Change
                     ----------------------------------

Total                      13,735      0.7       9.0
=======================================================

   In 2000, total retail energy sales increased when compared to 1999 due
primarily to an increase in the total number of customers and hotter than normal
weather. Total retail energy sales increased in 1999 when compared to 1998 due
to increases in the number of customers. See "Future Earnings Potential" for
information on the Company's initiatives to remain competitive and to meet
conservation goals set by the Florida Public Service Commission (FPSC).

   An increase in energy sales for resale to non-affiliates of 9.2 percent in
2000 when compared to 1999 is primarily related to unit power sales under
long-term contracts to other Florida utilities and bulk power sales under
short-term contracts to other non-affiliated utilities. Energy sales to
affiliated companies vary from year to year depending on demand and
availability and cost of generating resources at each company.

Expenses

Total operating expenses in 2000 increased $39.5 million, or 7.1 percent, over
the amount recorded in 1999 due primarily to higher fuel and purchased power
expenses. In 1999, total operating expenses increased $26.8 million, or 5.1
percent, compared to 1998 due primarily to higher fuel, purchased power, and
maintenance expenses offset by lower other operation expenses.

   Fuel expenses in 2000, when compared to 1999, increased $6.7 million, or 3.2
percent, due primarily to an increase in average fuel costs. In 1999, fuel
expenses increased $11.5 million, or 5.9 percent, when compared to 1998. The
increases were the result of increased generation resulting from a higher demand
for energy.

   The amount and sources of generation and the average cost of fuel per net
kilowatt-hour generated were as follows:

                                          2000       1999       1998

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

   Purchased power expenses increased in 2000 by $25.5 million, or 44.7 percent,
over 1999 and purchased power expenses for 1999 increased over 1998 by $13.2
million, or 30.2 percent, due primarily to a higher demand for energy in both
years.

   Depreciation and amortization expense increased $2.3 million, or 3.5 percent,
in 2000 when compared to 1999, due to an increase in depreciable property and
the amortization of a portion of a regulatory asset, which was allowed in the
current retail revenue sharing plan. The $5.5 million, or 9.2 percent, increase
in 1999 compared to 1998 was due primarily to a reduction in the amortization of
gains from the 1998 sale of emission allowances.

   Interest on long-term debt, which is included in "Interest expense",
increased $1.2 million, or 5.8 percent, in 2000 when compared to 1999 due
primarily to the issuance of $50 million of senior notes in August 1999. In 1999
interest on long-term debt increased $1.7 million, or 8.4 percent, when compared
to 1998 due primarily to the maturity of two first mortgage bond series in 1998
which were replaced by senior notes at a slightly higher interest rate, and the
issuance of $50 million of senior notes in August 1999.

Effects of Inflation

The Company is subject to rate regulation and income tax laws that are based on
the recovery of historical costs. Therefore, inflation creates an economic loss
because the Company is recovering its cost of investments in dollars that have
less purchasing power. While the inflation rate has been relatively low in

                                       II-115



MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  (continued)
Gulf Power Company 2000 Annual Report


recent years, it continues to have an adverse effect on the Company because of
the large investment in utility plant with long economic lives. Conventional
accounting for historical cost does not recognize this economic loss nor the
partially offsetting gain that arises through financing facilities with
fixed-money obligations, such as long-term debt and preferred securities. Any
recognition of inflation by regulatory authorities is reflected in the rate of
return allowed.

Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations for the past three years are not necessarily
indicative of future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on
numerous factors. The major factor is the ability to achieve energy sales growth
while containing cost in a more competitive environment.

   In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No.
87, Employers' Accounting for Pensions, the Company recorded non-cash income of
approximately $5.8 million in 2000. Pension income in 2001 is expected to be
less as a result of plan amendments. Future pension income is dependent on
several factors including trust earnings and changes to the plan.

   The Company currently operates as a vertically integrated utility providing
electricity to customers within its traditional service area located in
northwest Florida. Prices for electricity provided by the Company to retail
customers are set by the FPSC.

   Future earnings in the near term will depend upon growth in energy sales,
which is subject to a number of factors. Traditionally, these factors have
included weather, competition, changes in contracts with neighboring utilities,
energy conservation practiced by customers, the elasticity of demand, and the
rate of economic growth in the Company's service area. In early 1999, the FPSC
staff and the Company became involved in discussions primarily related to
reducing the Company's authorized rate of return. On October 1, 1999, the Office
of Public Counsel, the Coalition for Equitable Rates, the Florida Industrial
Power Users Group, and the Company jointly filed a petition to resolve the
issues. The stipulation included a reduction to retail base rates of $10 million
annually and provides for revenues to be shared within set ranges for 1999
through 2002. Customers receive two-thirds of any revenue within the sharing
range and the Company retains one-third. Any revenue above this range is
refunded to the customers. The stipulation also included authorization for the
Company, at its discretion, to accrue up to an additional $5 million to the
property insurance reserve and $1 million to amortize a regulatory asset related
to the corporate office. The Company also filed a request to prospectively
reduce its authorized ROE range from 11 to 13 percent to 10.5 to 12.5 percent in
order to help ensure that the FPSC would approve the stipulation. The FPSC
approved both the stipulation and the ROE request with an effective date of
November 4, 1999. The Company is currently planning to seek additional rate
relief to recover costs related to the Smith Unit 3 combined cycle facility
currently under construction and scheduled to be placed in-service in June of
2002.

   For calendar year 2000, the Company's retail revenue range for sharing was
$352 million to $368 million. Actual retail revenues in 2000 were $362.4 million
and the Company recorded revenues subject to refund of $6.9 million. The
estimated refund with interest was reflected in customer billings in February
2001. For calendar year 2001, the Company's retail revenue range for sharing is
$358 million to $374 million. For calendar year 2002, there are specified
sharing ranges for each month from the expected in-service date of Smith Unit 3
until the end of the year. The sharing plan will expire at the earlier of the
in-service date of Smith Unit 3 or December 31, 2002.

   The electric utility industry in the United States is continuing to evolve as
a result of regulatory and competitive factors. Among the primary agents of
change has been the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Energy Act). The Energy Act
allows independent power producers (IPPs) to access a utility's transmission
network in order to sell electricity to other utilities. This enhances the
incentive for IPPs to build cogeneration plants for a utility's large industrial
and commercial customers and sell energy generation to other utilities. Also,
electricity sales for resale rates are being driven down by wholesale
transmission access and numerous potential new energy suppliers, including power
marketers and brokers. The Company is aggressively working to maintain and
expand its share of wholesale sales in the southeastern power markets.

   In 2000, Florida's Governor appointed a 17 member study commission to look at
the state's electric industry, studying issues ranging from current and future
reliability of electric and natural gas supply, electric industry retail and
wholesale competition, environmental impacts of energy supply, conservation, and

                                       II-116



MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  (continued)
Gulf Power Company 2000 Annual Report


tax issues. The commission's final report and recommendations are due to the
Governor and legislature by December 1, 2001. The commission submitted an
interim report to the state legislature that involves introducing more
competition into the wholesale production of electricity in Florida. If approved
by the legislature, the proposal would require utilities to turn over generating
assets to an unregulated affiliate company over a 6-year transition period. The
proposal would allow out of state companies to build merchant facilities and to
bid on new generation needs. The effects of any proposed changes cannot
presently be determined, but could have a material effect on the Company's
financial statements.

   Although the Energy Act does not permit retail customer access, it was a
major catalyst for the current restructuring and consolidation taking place
within the utility industry. Numerous federal and state initiatives are in
varying stages to promote wholesale and retail competition. Among other things,
these initiatives allow customers to choose their electricity provider. Some
states have approved initiatives that result in a separation of the ownership
and/or operation of generating facilities from the ownership and/or operation of
transmission and distribution facilities. While various restructuring and
competition initiatives have been discussed in Florida, none have been enacted.
Enactment would require numerous issues to be resolved, including significant
ones relating to recovery of any stranded investments, full cost recovery of
energy produced, and other issues related to the current energy crisis in
California. As a result of this crisis, many states have either discontinued or
delayed implementation of initiatives involving retail deregulation. The
inability of a company to recover its investments, including the regulatory
assets described in Note 1 to the financial statements, could have a material
adverse effect on financial condition and results of operations.

   Continuing to be a low-cost producer could provide opportunities to increase
market share and profitability in markets that evolve with changing regulation.
Conversely, if the Company does not remain a low-cost producer and provide
quality service, then energy sales growth could be limited, and this could
significantly erode earnings.

   In 1996, the FPSC approved a new optional Commercial/Industrial Service Rider
(CISR), which is applicable to the rate schedules for the Company's largest
existing and potential customers who are able to show they have viable
alternatives to purchasing the Company's energy services. The CISR, approved as
a pilot program, provides the flexibility needed to enable the Company to offer
its services in a more competitive manner to these customers. The publicity of
the CISR ruling, increased competitive pressures, and general awareness of
customer choice pilots and proposals across the country have stimulated interest
on the part of customers in custom tailored offerings. The Company has
participated in one-on-one discussions with many of these customers, and has
negotiated and executed two Contract Service Agreements within the CISR pilot
program. The pilot program was scheduled to end in 2000; however, on February 6,
2001 the FPSC approved the Company's request to remove the original 48 month
limitation and allow the program to continue.

    Every five years the FPSC establishes numeric demand side management goals.
The Company proposed numeric goals for the ten-year period from 2000 to 2009.
The proposed goals consisted of the total, cost-effective winter and summer peak
demand (kilowatts) and annual energy (kilowatt-hour) savings reasonably
achievable from demand side management for the residential and
commercial/industrial classes. The Company submitted its 2001 Demand Side
Management Plan to the FPSC on December 29, 2000. The plan describes the
proposed programs the Company will employ to reach the numeric goals. The plan
relies heavily on innovative pricing and energy efficient construction.

    On December 20, 1999, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued
its final rule on Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs). The order
encouraged utilities owning transmission systems to form RTOs on a voluntary
basis. After participating in regional conferences with customers and other
members of the public to discuss the formation of RTOs, utilities were required
to make a filing with the FERC. Southern Company and its integrated utility
subsidiaries, including the Company, filed on October 16, 2000, a proposal for
the creation of an RTO. The proposal is for the formation of a for-profit
company that would have control of the bulk power transmission system of the
Company and any other participating utilities. Participants would have the
option to either maintain their ownership or divest, sell, or lease their assets
to the proposed RTO. If the FERC accepts the proposal as filed, the creation of

                                       II-117



MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  (continued)
Gulf Power Company 2000 Annual Report


an RTO is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial
statements. The outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.

   The Energy Act amended the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (PUHCA)
to allow holding companies to form exempt wholesale generators to sell power
largely free of regulation under PUHCA. These entities are able to own and
operate power generating facilities and sell power to affiliates -- under
certain restrictions.

    Southern Company is aggressively working to maintain and expand its share of
wholesale sales in the southeastern power markets. In January 2001, Southern
Company announced the formation of a new subsidiary -- Southern Power Company.
The new subsidiary will own, manage, and finance wholesale generating assets in
the Southeast. Southern Power will be the primary growth engine for Southern
Company's market-based energy business. Energy from its assets will be marketed
to wholesale customers under the Southern Company name.

   Compliance costs related to current and future environmental laws and
regulations could affect earnings if such costs are not fully recovered. The
Clean Air Act and other important environmental items are discussed later under
"Environmental Matters." Also, Florida legislation adopted in 1993 that provides
for recovery of prudent environmental compliance costs is discussed in Note 3 to
the financial statements under "Environmental Cost Recovery."

   The Company is subject to the provisions of FASB Statement No. 71, Accounting
for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation. In the event that a portion of
the Company's operations is no longer subject to these provisions, the Company
would be required to write off related regulatory assets and liabilities that
are not specifically recoverable, and determine if any other assets have been
impaired. See Note 1 to the financial statements under "Regulatory Assets and
Liabilities" for additional information.

Exposure to Market Risks

Due to cost-based rate regulation, the Company has limited exposure to market
volatility in interest rates and prices of electricity. To mitigate residual
risks relative to movements in electricity prices, the Company enters into fixed
price contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity through the wholesale
electricity market. Realized gains and losses are recognized in the income
statements as incurred. At December 31, 2000, exposure from these activities was
not material.

New Accounting Standard

In June 2000, FASB issued Statement No. 138, an amendment of Statement
No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.
Statement No. 133, as amended, establishes accounting and reporting
standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities. Statement
No. 133 requires that certain derivative instruments be recorded in the
balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at fair value, and
that changes in the fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless
specific hedge accounting criteria are met.

   The Company may utilize financial instruments to reduce its exposure to
changes in interest rates depending on market conditions. The Company also
enters into commodity related forward contracts to limit exposure to changing
prices on certain fuel purchases and electricity purchases and sales.

   Substantially all of these bulk energy purchases and sales meet the
definition of a derivative under Statement No. 133. In many cases, these
transactions meet the normal purchase and sale exception and the related
contracts will continue to be accounted for under the accrual method. Certain of
these instruments qualify as cash flow hedges resulting in the deferral of
related gains and losses in other comprehensive income until the hedged
transactions occur. Any ineffectiveness will be recognized currently in net
income. However, others will be required to be marked to market through current
period income.

   The Company adopted Statement No. 133 effective January 1, 2001. The impact
on net income was immaterial. The application of the new rules is still evolving
and further guidance from FASB is expected, which could additionally impact the
Company's financial statements. Also, as wholesale energy markets mature, future
transactions could result in more volatility in net income and comprehensive
income.

                                       11-118



MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Gulf Power Company 2000 Annual Report


Financial Condition

Overview

The Company's financial condition continues to be very solid. During 2000, gross
property additions were $95.8 million. Funds for the property additions were
provided by operating activities. See the Statements of Cash Flows for further
details.

Financing Activities

In 2000, there were no issuances or retirements of long-term debt. In 1999, the
Company sold $50 million of senior notes and long-term bank notes totaling $27
million were retired. See the Statements of Cash Flows for further details.

   Composite financing rates for the years 1998 through 2000 as of year end were
as follows:

                                       2000      1999      1998
                                    -----------------------------
Composite interest rate on
   long-term debt                       6.2%      6.0%      6.1%
Composite rate on
   trust preferred securities           7.3%      7.3%      7.3%
Composite preferred stock
   dividend rate                        5.1%      5.1%      5.1%
- -----------------------------------------------------------------

   The composite interest rate on long-term debt increased in 2000 due to higher
interest rates on variable rate pollution control bonds.


Capital Requirements for Construction

The Company's gross property additions, including those amounts related to
environmental compliance, are budgeted at $451 million for the three years
beginning in 2001 ($279 million in 2001, $96 million in 2002, and $76 million in
2003). These amounts include $199.2 million for the years 2001 and 2002 for the
estimated cost of a 574 megawatt combined cycle gas generating unit and related
interconnections to be located in the eastern portion of the Company's service
area. The unit is expected to have an in-service date of June 2002. The
remaining property additions budget is primarily for maintaining and upgrading
transmission and distribution facilities and generating plants. Actual
construction costs may vary from this estimate because of changes in such
factors as the following: business conditions; environmental regulations; load
projections; the cost and efficiency of construction labor, equipment, and
materials; and the cost of capital. In addition, there can be no assurance that
costs related to capital expenditures will be fully recovered.

Other Capital Requirements

The Company will continue to retire higher-cost debt and preferred securities
and replace these securities with lower-cost capital as market conditions and
terms of the instruments permit.

Environmental Matters

In November 1990, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (Clean Air Act) was
signed into law. Title IV of the Clean Air Act -- the acid rain compliance
provision of the law -- significantly affected the Company. Specific reductions
in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from fossil-fired generating
plants were required in two phases. Phase I compliance began in 1995. As a
result of a systemwide compliance strategy, some 50 generating units of Southern
Company were brought into compliance with Phase I requirements.

   Southern Company achieved Phase I sulfur dioxide compliance at the affected
plants by switching to low-sulfur coal, which required some equipment upgrades.
Construction expenditures for Phase I nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide
emissions compliance totaled approximately $300 million for Southern Company,
including approximately $42 million for the Company.

   Phase II sulfur dioxide compliance was required in 2000. Southern Company
used emission allowances and fuel switching to comply with Phase II
requirements. Also, equipment to control nitrogen oxide emissions was installed
on additional system fossil-fired units as necessary to meet Phase II limits and
ozone non-attainment requirements for metropolitan Atlanta through 2000.
Compliance for Phase II and initial ozone non-attainment requirements increased
Southern Company's total construction expenditures through 2000 by approximately
$100 million. Phase II compliance did not have a material impact on Gulf Power.

   A significant portion of costs related to the acid rain and ozone
nonattainment provisions of the Clean Air Act is expected to be recovered
through existing ratemaking provisions. However, there can be no assurance that
all Clean Air Act costs will be recovered.


                                       II-119



MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  (continued)
Gulf Power Company 2000 Annual Report


   In 1993, the Florida Legislature adopted legislation that allows a utility to
petition the FPSC for recovery of prudent environmental compliance costs that
are not being recovered through base rates or any other recovery mechanism. The
legislation is discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements under
"Environmental Cost Recovery." Substantially all of the costs for the Clean Air
Act and other new environmental legislation discussed below are expected to be
recovered through the Environmental Cost Recovery Clause.

   In July 1997, the EPA revised the national ambient air quality standards for
ozone and particulate matter. This revision made the standards significantly
more stringent. In the subsequent litigation of these standards, the U.S.
Supreme Court recently dismissed certain challenges but found the EPA's
implementation program for the new ozone standard unlawful and remanded it to
the EPA. In addition, the Federal District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals
will address other legal challenges to these standards in mid-2001. If the
standards are eventually upheld, implementation could be required by 2007 to
2010.

   In September 1998, the EPA issued the final regional nitrogen oxide reduction
rule to the states for implementation. Compliance is required by May 31, 2004.
The final rule affects 21 states, including Georgia. See Note 5 to the financial
statements under "Joint Ownership Agreements" related to the Company's ownership
interest in Georgia Power's Plant Scherer Unit No. 3.

   In December 2000, the EPA completed its utility study for mercury and other
hazardous air pollutants (HAPS) and issued a determination that an emission
control program for mercury and, perhaps, other HAPS is warranted. The program
is to be developed over the next four years under the Maximum Achievable Control
Technology (MACT) provisions of the Clean Air Act. This determination is being
challenged in the courts. In January 2001, the EPA proposed guidance for the
determination of Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) emission controls
under the Regional Haze Regulations. Installation of BART controls will likely
be required around 2010. Litigation of the BART rules is probable in the near
future.

   Implementation of the final state rules for these initiatives could require
substantial further reductions in nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, mercury, and
other HAPS emissions from fossil-fired generating facilities and other
industries in these states. Additional compliance costs and capital expenditures
resulting from the implementation of these rules and standards cannot be
determined until the results of legal challenges are known, and the states have
adopted their final rules. Reviews by the new administration in Washington, D.C.
add to the uncertainties associated with BART guidance and the MACT
determination for mercury and other HAPS.

   The EPA and state environmental regulatory agencies are also reviewing and
evaluating various other matters including: nitrogen oxide emission control
strategies for ozone non-attainment areas; additional controls for hazardous air
pollutant emissions; and hazardous waste disposal requirements. The impact of
any new standards will depend on the development and implementation of
applicable regulations.

   On November 3, 1999, the EPA brought a civil action in the U.S. District
Court against Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and the system service company. The
complaint alleges violations of the prevention of significant deterioration and
new source review provisions of the Clean Air Act with respect to five
coal-fired generating facilities in Alabama and Georgia. The civil action
requests penalties and injunctive relief, including an order requiring the
installation of the best available control technology at the affected units. The
EPA concurrently issued to the integrated Southeast utilities a notice of
violation related to 10 generating facilities, including the five facilities
mentioned previously and the Company's Plants Crist and Scherer. See Note 5 to
the financial statements under "Joint Ownership Agreements" related to the
Company's ownership interest in Georgia Power's Plant Scherer Unit No. 3. In
early 2000, the EPA filed a motion to amend its complaint to add the violations
alleged in its notice of violation, and to add Gulf Power, Mississippi Power,
and Savannah Electric as defendants. The complaint and notice of violation are
similar to those brought against and issued to several other electric utilities.
These complaints and notices of violation allege that the utilities had failed
to secure necessary permits or install additional pollution equipment when
performing maintenance and construction at coal burning plants constructed or
under construction prior to 1978. On August 1, 2000, the U.S. District Court

                                       11-120




MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  (continued)
Gulf Power Company 2000 Annual Report


granted Alabama Power's motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction in Georgia
and granted the system service company's motion to dismiss on the grounds that
it neither owned nor operated the generating units involved in the proceedings.
On January 12, 2001, the EPA re-filed its claims against Alabama Power in
federal district court in Birmingham, Alabama. The EPA did not include the
system service company in the new complaint. Southern Company believes that its
integrated utilities complied with applicable laws and the EPA's regulations and
interpretations in effect at the time the work in question took place. The Clean
Air Act authorizes civil penalties of up to $27,500 per day per violation at
each generating unit. Prior to January 30, 1997, the penalty was $25,000 per
day. An adverse outcome of this matter could require substantial capital
expenditures that cannot be determined at this time and possibly require payment
of substantial penalties. This could affect future results of operations, cash
flows, and possibly financial condition if such costs are not recovered through
regulated rates.

   The Company must comply with other environmental laws and regulations that
cover the handling and disposal of hazardous waste. Under these various laws and
regulations, the Company could incur substantial costs to clean up properties.
The Company conducts studies to determine the extent of any required cleanup
costs and has recognized in the financial statements costs to clean up known
sites. For additional information, see Note 3 to the financial statements under
"Environmental Cost Recovery."

   Several major pieces of environmental legislation are being considered for
reauthorization or amendment by Congress. These include: the Clean Air Act; the
Clean Water Act; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; the Toxic Substances
Control Act; and the Endangered Species Act. Changes to these laws could affect
many areas of the Company's operations. The full impact of any such changes
cannot be determined at this time.

    Compliance with possible additional legislation related to global climate
change, electric and magnetic fields, and other environmental health concerns
could significantly affect the Company. The impact of new legislation -- if any
- -- will depend on the subsequent development and implementation of applicable
regulations. In addition, the potential exists for liability as the result of
lawsuits alleging damages caused by electric and magnetic fields.

Sources of Capital

At December 31, 2000, the Company had approximately $4.4 million of cash and
cash equivalents and $53.5 million of unused committed lines of credit with
banks to meet its short-term cash needs. Refer to the Statements of Cash Flows
for details related to the Company's financing activities. See Note 4 to the
financial statements under "Bank Credit Arrangements" for additional
information.

   The Company historically has relied on issuances of first mortgage bonds and
preferred stock, in addition to pollution control revenue bonds issued for its
benefit by public authorities, to meet its long-term external financing
requirements. Recently, the Company's financings have consisted of unsecured
debt and trust preferred securities. The Company has no restrictions on the
amounts of unsecured indebtedness it may incur. However, in order to issue first
mortgage bonds or preferred stock, the Company is required to meet certain
coverage requirements specified in its mortgage indenture and corporate charter.
The Company's ability to satisfy all coverage requirements is such that it could
issue new first mortgage bonds and preferred stock to provide sufficient funds
for all anticipated requirements.

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking
Information

The Company's 2000 Annual Report contains forward looking and historical
information. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by
terminology such as "may," "will," "should," "expects," "plans," "anticipates,"
"believes," "estimates," "predicts," "potential" or "continue" or the negative
of these terms or other comparable terminology. The Company cautions that there
are various important factors that could cause actual results to differ
materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements; accordingly,
there can be no assurance that such indicated results will be realized. These
factors include the impact of recent and future federal and state regulatory
change, including legislative and regulatory initiatives regarding deregulation
and restructuring of the electric utility industry and also changes in
environmental and other laws and regulations to which the Company is subject, as
well as changes in application of existing laws and regulations; current and
future litigation, including the pending EPA civil action; the extent and timing
of the entry of additional competition in the markets of the Company; potential
business strategies, including acquisitions or dispositions of assets or

projects, integrated utilities, a distribution company, and energy trading and
marketing businesses outside the southeastern United States.

   Southern Company is registered as a holding company under the Public Utility
Holding Company Act of 1935 (PUHCA). Both Southern Company and its subsidiaries
are subject to the regulatory provisions of the PUHCA. The Company is also
subject to regulation by the FERC and the Florida Public Service Commission
(FPSC). The Company follows accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States and complies with the accounting policies and practices prescribed
by the FPSC and the FERC. The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires the
use of estimates, and the actual results may differ from those estimates.

   Certain prior years' data presented in the financial statements have been
reclassified to conform with current year presentation.

Related-Party Transactions

The Company has an agreement with SCS under which the following services are
rendered to the Company at cost: general and design engineering, purchasing,
accounting and statistical, finance and treasury, tax, information resources,
marketing, auditing, insurance and pension administration, human resources,
systems and procedures, and other services with respect to business and
operations and power pool operations. Costs for these services amounted to $44
million, $43 million, and $40 million during 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively.

Regulatory Assets and Liabilities

The Company is subject to the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB) Statement No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of
Regulation. Regulatory assets represent probable future revenues to the Company
associated with certain costs that are expected to be recovered from customers
through the ratemaking process. Regulatory liabilities represent probable future
reductions in revenues associated with amounts that are expected to be credited
to customers through the ratemaking process. Regulatory assets and (liabilities)
reflected in the Balance Sheets at December 31 relate to the following:

NOTES (continued)
Gulf Power Company 2000 Annual Report


   In the event that a portion of the Company's operations is no longer subject
to the provisions of FASB Statement No. 71, the Company would be required to
write off related regulatory assets and liabilities that are not specifically
recoverable through regulated rates. In addition, the Company would be required
to determine any impairment to other assets, including plant, and write down the
assets, if impaired, to their fair value.

Revenues and Regulatory Cost Recovery Clauses

The Company currently operates as a vertically integrated utility providing
electricity to retail customers within its service area located in northwest
Florida and to wholesale customers in the Southeast.

   Revenues are recognized as services are rendered. Unbilled revenues are
accrued at the end of each fiscal period.

   Fuel costs are expensed as the fuel is used. The Company's retail electric
rates include provisions to annually adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel
costs, the energy component of purchased power costs, and certain other costs.
The Company also has similar retail cost recovery clauses for energy
conservation costs, purchased power capacity costs, and environmental compliance
costs. Revenues are adjusted monthly for differences between recoverable costs
and amounts actually reflected in current rates.

   The Company has a diversified base of customers and no single customer or
industry comprises 10 percent or more of revenues. For all periods presented,
uncollectible accounts averaged significantly less than 1 percent of revenues.

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation of the original cost of plant in service is provided primarily by
using composite straight-line rates, which approximated 3.8 percent in 2000,
1999, and 1998. When property subject to depreciation is retired or otherwise
disposed of in the normal course of business, its cost -- together with the cost
of removal, less salvage -- is charged to the accumulated provision for
depreciation. Minor items of property included in the original cost of the plant
are retired when the related property unit is retired. Also, the provision for
depreciation expense includes an amount for the expected cost of removal of
facilities.

Income Taxes

The Company uses the liability method of accounting for income taxes and
provides deferred income taxes for all significant income tax temporary
differences. Investment tax credits utilized are deferred and amortized to
income over the average lives of the related property. The Company is included
in the consolidated federal income tax return of Southern Company.

Property, Plant, and Equipment

Property, plant, and equipment is stated at original cost. Original cost
includes: materials; labor; minor items of property; appropriate administrative
and general costs; payroll-related costs such as taxes, pensions, and other
benefits; and the estimated cost of funds used during construction. The cost of
maintenance, repairs, and replacement of minor items of property is charged to
maintenance expense. The cost of replacements of property (exclusive of minor
items of property) is charged to utility plant.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Temporary cash investments are considered cash equivalents. Temporary cash
investments are securities with original maturities of 90 days or less.

Financial Instruments

The Company's financial instruments for which the carrying amount did not equal
fair value at December 31 were as follows:

                                       Carrying          Fair
                                         Amount         Value
                                   ---------------------------
                                          (in thousands)
Long-term debt:
   At December 31, 2000                $365,993      $364,697
   At December 31, 1999                $367,449      $349,791
Capital trust preferred
securities:
   At December 31, 2000                 $85,000       $80,988
   At December 31, 1999                 $85,000       $69,092
- --------------------------------------------------------------

   The fair values for long-term debt and preferred securities were based on
either closing market prices or closing prices of comparable instruments.

NOTES (continued)
Gulf Power Company 2000 Annual Report


Materials and Supplies

Generally, materials and supplies include the cost of transmission,
distribution, and generating plant materials. Materials are charged to inventory
when purchased and then expensed or capitalized to plant, as appropriate, when
installed.

Provision for Injuries and Damages

The Company is subject to claims and suits arising in the ordinary course of
business. As permitted by regulatory authorities, the Company provides for the
uninsured costs of injuries and damages by charges to income amounting to $1.2
million annually. The expense of settling claims is charged to the provision to
the extent available. The accumulated provision of $1.2 million and $1.8 million
at December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively, is included in other current
liabilities in the accompanying Balance Sheets.

Provision for Property Damage

The Company provides for the cost of repairing damages from major storms and
other uninsured property damages. This includes the full cost of major storms
and other damages to its transmission and distribution lines and the cost of
uninsured damages to its generation and other property. The expense of such
damages is charged to the provision account. At December 31, 2000 and 1999, the
accumulated provision for property damage was $8.7 million and $5.5 million,
respectively. The FPSC approved annual accrual to the accumulated provision for
property damage is $3.5 million, with a target level for the accumulated
provision account between $25.1 and $36.0 million. The FPSC has also given the
Company the flexibility to increase its annual accrual amount above $3.5 million
at the Company's discretion. The Company accrued $3.5 million in 2000, $5.5
million in 1999, and $6.5 million in 1998 to the accumulated provision for
property damage. The Company charged $0.3 million, $1.6 million, and $4.2
million against the provision account in 2000, 1999, and 1998 respectively.

2.  RETIREMENT BENEFITS

The Company has a defined benefit, trusteed, non-contributory pension plan that
covers substantially all regular employees. The Company provides certain medical
care and life insurance benefits for retired employees. Substantially all
employees may become eligible for these benefits when they retire. Trusts are
funded to the extent required by the Company's regulatory commissions. In late
2000, the Company adopted several pension and postretirement benefit plan
changes that had the effect of increasing benefits to both current and future
retirees. The effects of these changes will be to increase the Company's annual
pension and postretirement benefits costs by approximately $1.2 million and $0.6
million, respectively. The measurement date for plan assets and obligations is
September 30 for each year.

Pension Plan

Changes during the year in the projected benefit obligations and in the fair
value of plan assets were as follows:
                                            Projected

Employee Savings Plan

The Company also sponsors a 401(k) defined contribution plan covering
substantially all employees. The Company provides a 75 percent matching
contribution up to 6 percent of an employee's base salary. Total matching
contributions made to the plan for the years 2000, 1999, and 1998 were $2.2
million, $2.0 million, and $2.0 million, respectively.

Work Force Reduction Programs

The Company recorded costs related to work force reduction programs of $0.6
million in 2000, $0.2 million in 1999, and $2.8 million in 1998. The Company has
also incurred its pro rata share for the costs of affiliated companies'
programs. The costs related to these programs were $1.2 million for 2000, $0.6
million for 1999, and $0.2 million for 1998. The Company has expensed all costs
related to these work force reduction programs.

3.   CONTINGENCIES AND REGULATORY
     MATTERS

Environmental Cost Recovery

In 1993, the Florida Legislature adopted legislation for an Environmental Cost
Recovery Clause (ECRC), which allows a utility to petition the FPSC for recovery
of all prudent environmental compliance costs that are not being recovered
through base rates or any other recovery mechanism. Such environmental costs
include operation and maintenance expense, emission allowance expense,
depreciation, and a return on invested capital.

   In 1994, the FPSC approved the Company's initial petition under the ECRC for
recovery of environmental costs. During 2000, 1999, and 1998, the Company
recorded ECRC revenues of $9.9 million, $11.5 million, and $8.0 million,
respectively.

   At December 31, 2000, the Company's liability for the estimated costs of
environmental remediation projects for known sites was $7.6 million. These
estimated costs are expected to be expended from 2001 through 2006. These
projects have been approved by the FPSC for recovery through the ECRC discussed
above. Therefore, the Company recorded $1.2 million in current assets and
current liabilities and $6.4 million in deferred assets and deferred liabilities
representing the future recoverability of these costs.

Environmental Litigation

On November 3, 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) brought a civil
action in the U.S. District Court against Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and SCS.
The complaint alleges violations of the prevention of significant deterioration
and new source review provisions of the Clean Air Act with respect to five
coal-fired generating facilities in Alabama and Georgia. The civil action
requests penalties and injunctive relief, including an order requiring the
installation of the best available control technology at the affected units. The
Clean Air Act authorizes civil penalties of up to $27,500 per day, per violation
at each generating unit. Prior to January 30, 1997, the penalty was $25,000 per
day.

   The EPA concurrently issued to the integrated Southeast utilities a notice of
violation related to 10 generating facilities, including the five facilities
mentioned previously and the Company's Plants Crist and Scherer. See Note 5
under "Joint Ownership Agreements" related to the Company's ownership interest
in Georgia Power's Plant Scherer Unit No. 3. In early 2000, the EPA filed a
motion to amend its complaint to add the violations alleged in its notice of
violation, and to add Gulf Power, Mississippi Power, and Savannah Electric as
defendants. The complaint and notice of violation are similar to those brought
against and issued to several other electric utilities. These complaints and
notices of violation allege that the utilities had failed to secure necessary
permits or install additional pollution equipment when performing maintenance
and construction at coal burning plants constructed or under construction prior
to 1978. The Company believes that its integrated utilities complied with
applicable laws and the EPA's regulations and interpretations in effect at the
time the work in question took place.

   An adverse outcome of this matter could require substantial capital
expenditures that cannot be determined at this time and possibly require payment
of substantial penalties. This could affect future results of operations, cash

flows, and possibly financial condition if such costs are not recovered through
regulated rates.

Retail Revenue Sharing Plan

In early 1999, the FPSC staff and the Company became involved in discussions
primarily related to reducing the Company's authorized rate of return. On
October 1, 1999, the Office of Public Counsel, the Coalition for Equitable
Rates, the Florida Industrial Power Users Group, and the Company jointly filed a
petition to resolve the issues. The stipulation included a reduction to retail
base rates of $10 million annually and provides for revenues to be shared within
set ranges for 1999 through 2002. Customers receive two-thirds of any revenue
within the sharing range and the Company retains one-third. Any revenue above
this range is refunded to the customers. The stipulation also included
authorization for the Company, at its discretion, to accrue up to an additional
$5 million to the property insurance reserve and $1 million to amortize a
regulatory asset related to the corporate office. The Company also filed a
request to prospectively reduce its authorized ROE range from 11 to 13 percent
to 10.5 to 12.5 percent in order to help ensure that the FPSC would approve the
stipulation. The FPSC approved both the stipulation and the ROE request with an
effective date of November 4, 1999. The Company is currently planning to seek
additional rate relief to recover costs related to the Smith Unit 3
combined cycle facility scheduled to be placed in-service in June of 2002.

   For calendar year 2000, the Company's retail revenue range for sharing was
$352 million to $368 million to be shared between the Company and its retail
customers on the one-third/two-thirds basis. Actual retail revenues in 2000 were
$362.4 million and the Company recorded revenues subject to refund of $6.9
million. The estimated refund with interest of $0.3 million was reflected in
customer billings in February 2001. In addition to the refund the Company
amortized $1 million of the regulatory assets related to the corporate office.
For calendar year 2001, the Company's retail revenue range for sharing is $358
million to $374 million. For calendar year 2002, there are specified sharing
ranges for each month from the expected in-service date of Smith Unit 3 until
the end of the year. The sharing plan will expire at the earlier of the
in-service date of Smith Unit 3 or December 31, 2002.

4. FINANCING AND COMMITMENTS

Construction Program

The Company is engaged in a continuous construction program, the cost of which
is currently estimated to total $279 million in 2001, $96 million in 2002, and
$76 million in 2003. The construction program is subject to periodic review and
revision, and actual construction costs may vary from the above estimates
because of numerous factors. These factors include changes in business
conditions; revised load growth estimates; changes in environmental regulations;
increasing costs of labor, equipment, and materials; and cost of capital. At
December 31, 2000, significant purchase commitments were outstanding in
connection with the construction program. The Company has budgeted $199.2
million for the years 2001 and 2002 for the estimated cost of a 574 megawatt
combined cycle gas generating unit to be located in the eastern portion of its
service area. The unit is expected to have an in-service date of June 2002. The
Company's remaining construction program is related to maintaining and upgrading
the transmission, distribution, and generating facilities.

Bank Credit Arrangements

At December 31, 2000, the Company had $61.5 million of lines of credit with
banks subject to renewal June 1 of each year, of which $53.5 million remained
unused. In addition, the Company has two unused committed lines of credit
totaling $61.9 million that were established for liquidity support of its
variable rate pollution control bonds. In connection with these credit lines,
the Company has agreed to pay commitment fees and/or to maintain compensating
balances with the banks. The compensating balances, which represent
substantially all of the cash of the Company except for daily working funds and
like items, are not legally restricted from withdrawal. In addition, the Company
has bid-loan facilities with seven major money center banks that total $130
million, of which $35 million was committed at December 31, 2000.

Assets Subject to Lien

The Company's mortgage, which secures the first mortgage bonds issued by the
Company, constitutes a direct first lien on substantially all of the Company's
fixed property and franchises.

Fuel Commitments

To supply a portion of the fuel requirements of its generating plants, the
Company has entered into contract commitments for the procurement of fuel. In
some cases, these contracts contain provisions for price escalations, minimum
purchase levels, and other financial commitments. Total estimated obligations at
December 31, 2000 were as follows:

   Year                                           Fuel

Lease Agreements

In 1989, the Company and Mississippi Power jointly entered into a twenty-two
year operating lease agreement for the use of 495 aluminum railcars. In 1994, a
second lease agreement for the use of 250 additional aluminum railcars was
entered into for twenty-two years. Both of these leases are for the
transportation of coal to Plant Daniel. At the end of each lease term, the
Company has the option to renew the lease. In 1997, three additional lease
agreements for 120 cars each were entered into for three years, with a monthly
renewal option for up to an additional nine months.

   The Company, as a joint owner of Plant Daniel, is responsible for one half of
the lease costs. The lease costs are charged to fuel inventory and are allocated
to fuel expense as the fuel is used. The Company's share of the lease costs
charged to fuel inventories was $2.1 million in 2000 and $2.8 million in 1999.
The annual amounts for 2001 through 2005 are expected to be $1.9 million, $1.9
million, $1.9 million, $2.0 million, and $2.0 million, respectively, and after
2005 are expected to total $13.8 million.

5.  JOINT OWNERSHIP AGREEMENTS

The Company and Mississippi Power jointly own Plant Daniel, a steam-electric
generating plant located in Jackson County, Mississippi. In accordance with the
operating agreement, Mississippi Power acts as the Company's agent with respect
to the construction, operation, and maintenance of the plant.

   The Company and Georgia Power jointly own Plant Scherer Unit No. 3. Plant
Scherer is a steam-electric generating plant located near Forsyth, Georgia. In
accordance with the operating agreement, Georgia Power acts as the Company's
agent with respect to the construction, operation, and maintenance of the unit.

   The Company's pro rata share of expenses related to both plants is included
in the corresponding operating expense accounts in the Statements of Income.

   At December 31, 2000, the Company's percentage ownership and its investment
in these jointly owned facilities were as follows:

6.  LONG-TERM POWER SALES AGREEMENTS

The Company and the other operating affiliates have long-term contractual
agreements for the sale of capacity to certain non-affiliated utilities located
outside the system's service area. The unit power sales agreements are firm and
pertain to capacity related to specific generating units. Because the energy is
generally sold at cost under these agreements, profitability is primarily
affected by revenues from capacity sales. The capacity revenues from these sales
were $20.3 million in 2000, $19.8 million in 1999, and $22.5 million in 1998.

                                       II-135



NOTES (continued)
Gulf Power Company 2000 Annual Report


Capacity revenues increased slightly in 2000 due to the recovery of higher
operating expenses experienced during the year.

   Unit power from specific generating plants of Southern Company is currently
being sold to Florida Power Corporation (FPC), Florida Power & Light Company
(FP&L), and Jacksonville Electric Authority (JEA). Under these agreements, 209
megawatts of net dependable capacity were sold by the Company during 2000. Sales
will increase slightly to 210 megawatts per year in 2001 and remain close to
that level, unless reduced by FP&L, FPC, and JEA for the periods after 2001 with
a minimum of three years notice, until the expiration of the contracts in 2010.

7.  INCOME TAXES

At December 31, 2000, the tax-related regulatory assets to be recovered from
customers were $16.0 million. These assets are attributable to tax benefits
flowed through to customers in prior years and to taxes applicable to
capitalized allowance for funds used during construction. At December 31, 2000,
the tax-related regulatory liabilities to be credited to customers were $38.3
million. These liabilities are attributable to deferred taxes previously
recognized at rates higher than current enacted tax law and to unamortized
investment tax credits.

   Details of the federal and state income tax provisions are as follows:

   Deferred investment tax credits are amortized over the lives of the related
property with such amortization normally applied as a credit to reduce
depreciation and amortization in the Statements of Income. Credits amortized in
this manner amounted to $1.9 million in 2000, 1999, and 1998. At December 31,
2000, all investment tax credits available to reduce federal income taxes
payable had been utilized.

NOTES (continued)
Gulf Power Company 2000 Annual Report


8.  COMPANY OBLIGATED MANDATORILY
    REDEEMABLE PREFERRED SECURITIES

In January 1997, Gulf Power Capital Trust I (Trust I), of which the Company owns
all of the common securities, issued $40 million of 7.625 percent mandatorily
redeemable preferred securities. Substantially all of the assets of Trust I are
$41 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 7.625 percent junior
subordinated notes due December 31, 2036.

   In January 1998, Gulf Power Capital Trust II (Trust II), of which the Company
owns all of the common securities, issued $45 million of 7.0 percent mandatorily
redeemable preferred securities. Substantially all of the assets of Trust II are
$46 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 7.0 percent junior
subordinated notes due December 31, 2037.

   The Company considers that the mechanisms and obligations relating to the
preferred securities, taken together, constitute a full and unconditional
guarantee by the Company of payment obligations with respect to the preferred
securities of Trust I and Trust II. Trust I and Trust II are subsidiaries of the
Company, and accordingly are consolidated in the Company's financial statements.

9.  SECURITIES DUE WITHIN ONE YEAR

At December 31, 2000, the Company had an improvement fund requirement of
$850,000. The first mortgage bond improvement fund requirement amounts to 1
percent of each outstanding series of bonds authenticated under the indenture
prior to January 1 of each year, other than those issued to collateralize
pollution control revenue bond obligations. The requirement may be satisfied by
depositing cash, reacquiring bonds, or by pledging additional property equal to
1 and 2/3 times the requirement.

10.  COMMON STOCK DIVIDEND
     RESTRICTIONS

The Company's first mortgage bond indenture contains various common stock
dividend restrictions, which remain in effect as long as the bonds are
outstanding. At December 31, 2000, retained earnings of $127 million were
restricted against the payment of cash dividends on common stock under the terms
of the mortgage indenture.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL
CONDITION
Mississippi Power Company 2000 Annual Report


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings

Mississippi Power Company's 2000 net income after dividends on preferred stock
of $55 million increased $0.2 million over 1999 earnings of $54.8 million, which
were $0.3 million less than 1998 earnings of $55.1 million.

Revenues

Operating revenues for the Company in 2000 and the changes from the prior year
are as follows:

  Percent change                               8.6%            6.4%
  ------------------------------------------------------------------

    Total retail revenues for 2000 increased approximately 6.2 percent when
compared to 1999. The increase resulted primarily from continued growth in the
service area, a positive impact of weather and additional fuel revenues. Retail
revenues for 1999 reflected a 6.1 percent increase over the prior year due to
the continued growth in the service area, increased fuel revenues, and a true-up
of the unbilled revenue estimate.

    Fuel revenues generally represent the direct recovery of fuel expense
including purchased power. Therefore, changes in recoverable fuel expenses are
offset with corresponding changes in fuel revenues and have no effect on net
income.

    Energy sales to non-affiliates include economy sales and amounts sold under
short-term contracts. Sales for resale to non-affiliates are influenced by those
utilities' own customer demand, plant availability, and the cost of their
predominant fuels.

    Included in sales for resale to non-affiliates are revenues from rural
electric cooperative associations and municipalities located in southeastern
Mississippi. Energy sales to these customers increased 10.9 percent in 2000 and
10.2 percent in 1999, with the related revenues rising 10.8 percent and 12.1
percent, respectively. The customer demand experienced by these utilities is
determined by factors very similar to those of the Company. Revenues from other
sales outside the service area increased in 2000 and 1999 primarily due to power
marketing activities. These increases were offset by increases in purchased
power from non-affiliates and, as a result, had no significant effect on net
income.

    Sales to affiliated companies within the Southern Company electric system
will vary from year to year depending on demand and the availability and cost of
generating resources at each company. These sales have no material impact on
earnings.

    Below is a breakdown of kilowatt-hour sales for 2000 and the percent change
for the last two years:

    Total retail kilowatt-hour sales increased slightly in 2000 when compared to
1999 sales, which included an unbilled revenue true-up of approximately 3.5
percent. The increase primarily resulted from the continued growth in the
service area and the positive impact of weather. Excluding the impact of the
unbilled revenue true-up, all retail customer classes experienced growth in 2000

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  (continued)
Mississippi Power Company 2000 Annual Report


due to the positive impact of weather, increased tourism, and continued growth
in the service area. In 1999, increased tourism and strong growth impacted
commercial sales, while industrial sales were impacted by increased production
by several larger industrial customers, including one which was shut down in
1998 by Hurricane Georges.

Expenses

Total operating expenses were $565 million in 2000 reflecting an increase of $52
million or 10.1 percent over the prior year. The increase was due primarily to
higher fuel and purchased power expenses. In 1999, total operating expenses
increased by 6.9 percent over the prior year due primarily to higher fuel
expenses.

    Fuel costs are the single largest expense for the Company. Fuel expenses for
2000 and 1999 increased 10.7 percent and 10.3 percent, respectively. The
increase for each year was due to increased generation and a higher average cost
of fuel. The increased generation was due to higher demand for energy across the
Southern Company electric system.

    In 2000, expenses related to purchased power from non-affiliates increased
40.0 percent, while expenses related to purchased power from affiliates
increased 64.7 percent which, in total, resulted in a 51 percent increase when
compared to 1999. This increase consisted mostly of energy purchased for power
marketing activities which was resold to non-affiliated third parties and had no
significant effect on net income. Sales and purchases among the Company and its
affiliates will vary from period to period depending on demand and the
availability and variable production cost of each generating unit in the
Southern Company electric system.

    The amount and sources of generation and the average cost of fuel per net
kilowatt-hour generated were as follows:

                                      2000     1999        1998

- -----------------------------------------------------------------

    Other operation expenses decreased 8.2 percent in 2000 primarily due to a
decrease in administrative and general expenses. In 1999, other operation
expense increased 13.9 percent primarily due to the amortization of costs
associated with the workforce reduction plan and higher distribution expenses.
Maintenance expense in 2000 increased due to additional scheduled maintenance,
while maintenance expense in 1999 decreased due to reduced scheduled
maintenance. In 2000, depreciation expenses increased slightly due to growth in
plant investment and a new composite depreciation rate, which became effective
January 2000. Comparisons of taxes other than income taxes for 2000 and 1999
show increases of 1.7 percent and 4.2 percent, respectively, due to higher
municipal franchise taxes resulting from higher retail revenues. Interest on
long-term debt increased in 2000 due to higher interest rates and increased debt
outstanding.

Effects of Inflation

The Company is subject to rate regulation and income tax laws that are based on
the recovery of historical costs. Therefore, inflation creates an economic loss
because the Company is recovering its costs of investments in dollars that have
less purchasing power. While the inflation rate has been relatively low in
recent years, it continues to have an adverse effect on the Company because of
the large investment in utility plant with long economic lives. Conventional
accounting for historical costs does not recognize this economic loss or the
partially offsetting gain that arises through financing facilities with

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  (continued)
Mississippi Power Company 2000 Annual Report


fixed-money obligations, such as long-term debt and preferred securities. Any
recognition of inflation by regulatory authorities is reflected in the rate of
return allowed.

Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations for the past three years are not necessarily
indicative of future earnings potential. The level of the Company's future
earnings depends on numerous factors ranging from weather to energy sales growth
to a less regulated and more competitive environment. Expenses are subject to
constant review and cost control programs. The Company is also maximizing the
utility of invested capital and minimizing the need for additional capital by
refinancing, managing the size of its fuel stockpile, raising generating plant
availability and efficiency, and aggressively controlling its construction
budget.

    The Company currently operates as a vertically integrated utility providing
electricity to customers within its traditional service area located in
southeastern Mississippi. Prices for electricity provided by the Company to
retail customers are set by the Mississippi Public Service Commission (MPSC)
under cost-based regulatory principles. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
(FERC) regulates the Company's wholesale rate schedules, power sales contracts
and transmission facilities.

    Operating revenues will be affected by any changes in rates under the
Performance Evaluation Plan (PEP) -- the Company's performance based ratemaking
plan -- and the Environmental Compliance Overview Plan (ECO Plan). PEP has
proven to be a stabilizing force on electric rates, with only moderate changes
in rates taking place. The ECO Plan provides for recovery of costs (including
costs of capital) associated with environmental projects approved by the MPSC,
most of which are required to comply with Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990
(Clean Air Act) regulations. The ECO Plan is operated independently of PEP.
Compliance costs related to the Clean Air Act could affect earnings if such
costs cannot be recovered. The Company's 2000 ECO Plan filed in January 2000 was
approved as filed, and resulted in a slight decrease in customer prices. The
Company filed its 2001 ECO Plan in January 2001 and, if approved as filed, it
will result in a slight increase in customer prices. Refer to Note 3 to the
financial statements under "Litigation and Regulatory Matters" for additional
information. The Clean Air Act and other important environmental items are
discussed later under "Environmental Matters."

    Future earnings in the near term will depend upon growth in energy sales,
which is subject to a number of factors. These factors include weather,
competition, changes in contracts with neighboring utilities, energy
conservation practiced by customers, the elasticity of demand, and the rate of
economic growth in the Company's service area. The Company anticipates somewhat
slower growth in energy sales as the tourism industry stabilizes within its
service area. In addition to tourism, the healthcare and retail trade sectors
will provide most of the anticipated energy growth for the commercial class of
customers, while shipbuilding, chemicals and the U.S. government will provide
much of the basis for anticipated growth in the industrial sector.

    The electric utility industry in the United States is currently undergoing a
period of dramatic change as a result of regulatory and competitive factors.
Among the primary agents of change has been the Energy Policy Act of 1992
(Energy Act). The Energy Act allows independent power producers (IPPs) to access
a utility's transmission network in order to sell electricity to other
utilities. This enhances the incentive for IPPs to build cogeneration plants for
a utility's large industrial and commercial customers and sell energy generation
to other utilities. Also, electricity sales for resale rates are affected by
wholesale transmission access and numerous potential new energy suppliers,
including power marketers and brokers.

    Although the Energy Act does not permit retail transmission access, it was a
major catalyst for the current restructuring and consolidation taking place
within the utility industry. Numerous federal and state initiatives are in
various stages to promote wholesale and retail competition. Among other things,
these initiatives allow customers to choose their electricity provider. As these
initiatives materialize, the structure of the utility industry could radically
change. In May 2000, the MPSC ordered that its docket reviewing restructuring of
the electric industry in the State of Mississippi be suspended. The MPSC found
that retail competition may not be in the public interest at this time, and
ordered that no further formal hearings would be held on this subject. It found
that the current regulatory structure produced reliable low cost power and
"should not be changed without clear and convincing demonstration that change


                                       II-145


MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  (continued)
Mississippi Power Company 2000 Annual Report


would be in the public interest." The MPSC will continue to monitor retail and
wholesale restructuring activities throughout the United States and reserves its
right to order further formal hearings on the matter should new evidence
demonstrate that retail competition would be in the public interest and all
customers could receive a reduction in the total cost of their electric service.
If the MPSC decides to hold future restructuring hearings on this matter,
enactment would require numerous issues to be resolved, including significant
ones relating to transmission, prices, and recovery of any stranded costs. The
inability of the Company to recover its investment, including regulatory assets,
could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the Company.

    The Company is attempting to minimize or reduce its cost exposure. The
Company is subject to the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB) Statement No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of
Regulation. In the event that a portion of the Company's operation is no longer
subject to these provisions, the Company would be required to write off related
regulatory assets and liabilities that are not specifically recoverable, and
determine if any other assets have been impaired. See Note 1 to the financial
statements under "Regulatory Assets and Liabilities" for additional information.

    Continuing to be a low-cost producer could provide significant opportunities
to increase market share and profitability in markets that evolve with changing
regulation. Conversely, unless the Company remains a low-cost producer and
provides quality service, the Company's energy sales growth could be limited,
and this could significantly erode earnings.

    On December 20, 1999, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued
its final ruling on Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs). The order
encourages utilities owning transmission systems to form RTOs on a voluntary
basis. After participating in regional conferences with customers and other
members of the public to discuss the formation of RTOs, utilities were required
to make a filing with the FERC. On October 16, 2000, Southern Company and its
integrated utilities including the Company filed a proposal for the creation of
an RTO. The proposal is for the formation of a for-profit company that would
have control of the bulk power transmission system of the Company and any other
participating utilities. Participants would have the option to either maintain
their ownership or divest, sell, or lease their assets to the proposed RTO. If
the FERC accepts the proposal as filed, the creation of an RTO is not expected
to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements. The outcome of
this matter cannot now be determined.

    The Energy Act amended the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935
(PUHCA) to allow holding companies to form exempt wholesale generators to sell
power largely free of regulation under PUHCA. These entities are able to own and
operate power generating facilities and sell power to affiliates - under certain
restrictions.

    Southern Company is aggressively working to maintain and expand its share of
wholesale sales in the southeastern power markets. In January 2001, Southern
Company announced the formation of a new subsidiary - Southern Power Company.
The new subsidiary will own, manage, and finance wholesale generating assets in
the Southeast. Southern Power will be the primary growth engine for Southern
Company's market-based energy business. Energy from its assets will be marketed
to wholesale customers under the Southern Company name.

    In accordance with FASB Statement No. 87, Employers' Accounting for
Pensions, the Company recorded non-cash pension income of approximately $4.2
million in 2000. Pension income in 2001 is expected to be less as a result of
plan amendments. Future pension income is dependent on several factors including
trust earnings and changes to the plan. For more information, see Note 2.

    The Company is involved in various matters being litigated. See Note 3 to
the financial statements for information regarding material issues that could
possibly affect future earnings.

    Compliance costs related to current and future environmental laws and
regulations could affect earnings if such costs are not fully recovered. The
Clean Air Act and other important environmental items are discussed later under
"Environmental Matters."

Exposure to Market Risks

Due to cost-based rate regulations, the Company has limited exposure to market
volatility in interest rates, commodity fuel prices, and prices of electricity.


                                       II-146



MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  (continued)
Mississippi Power Company 2000 Annual Report


To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity prices, the
Company enters into fixed price contracts for the purchase and sale of
electricity through the wholesale electricity market. Realized gains and losses
are recognized in the income statements as incurred. At December 31, 2000,
exposure from these activities was not material to the Company's financial
statements. Also, based on the Company's overall interest rate exposure at
December 31, 2000, a near-term 100 basis point change in interest rates would
not materially affect the financial statements.

New Accounting Standard

In June 2000, FASB issued Statement No. 138, an amendment of Statement
No. 133,  Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.
Statement No. 133,  as amended, establishes accounting and reporting
standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities. Statement
No. 133 requires that certain derivative instruments  be recorded in the
balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at fair value, and
that changes in the fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless
specific hedge accounting criteria are met.

    Substantially all of the Company's bulk energy purchases and sales meet the
definition of a derivative under Statement No. 133. In many cases, these
transactions meet the normal purchase and sale exception and the related
contracts will continue to be accounted for under the accrual method. Certain of
these instruments qualify as cash flow hedges resulting in the deferral of
related gains and losses in other comprehensive income until the hedged
transactions occur. Any ineffectiveness will be recognized currently in net
income. However, others will be required to be marked to market through current
period income.

    The Company adopted Statement No. 133 effective January 1, 2001. The impact
on net income was immaterial. The application of the new rules is still evolving
and further guidance from FASB is expected, which could additionally impact the
Company's financial statements. Also, as wholesale energy markets mature, future
transactions could result in more volatility in net income and comprehensive
income.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Overview

The principal change in the Company's financial condition during 2000 was the
addition of approximately $81 million to utility plant. Funding for these
additions and other capital requirements were derived primarily from operations.
The Statements of Cash Flows provide additional details.

Financing Activity

In March 2000, the Company issued $100 million of floating rate senior notes due
March 28, 2002. The proceeds were used to prepay bank loans of $45 million
maturing in November 2001 and $5 million maturing in October 2002. The balance
of the $100 million was used to repay a portion of the Company's outstanding
short-term debt. The Company plans to continue, to the extent possible, a
program to retire higher-cost debt and replace these securities with lower-cost
capital. See the Statements of Cash Flows for further details.

    Composite financing rates increased for the year 2000 when compared to 1998
and 1999. As of year-end , the composite rates were as follows:

                                    2000     1999     1998
                                 ----------------------------
 Composite interest rate on
     long-term debt                 6.41%    6.19%    6.14%

 Composite preferred stock
     dividend rate                  6.33%    6.33%    6.33%

 Composite interest rate on
     preferred securities           7.75%    7.75%    7.75%
 ------------------------------------------------------------

    In 1999, the Company signed an Agreement for Lease and a Lease Agreement
with Escatawpa Funding, Limited Partnership ("Escatawpa"), that calls for the
Company to design and construct, as agent for Escatawpa, a 1,064 megawatt
natural gas combined cycle facility. It is anticipated that the total project
will cost approximately $400 million, and upon project completion in mid 2001,
the Company intends to lease the facility for an initial term of approximately
10 years. It is anticipated that the annual lease payments will approximate $32
million during the initial term.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  (continued)
Mississippi Power Company 2000 Annual Report


Capital Structure

At year-end 2000, the Company's ratio of common equity to total capitalization,
excluding long-term debt due within one year, decreased from 50.2 percent in
1999, to 48.1 percent.

Capital Requirements for Construction

The Company's projected construction expenditures for the next three years total
$191 million ($62 million in 2001, $60 million in 2002, and $69 million in
2003). The major emphasis within the construction program will be on the upgrade
of existing facilities.

    Revisions to projected construction expenditures may be necessary because of
factors such as changes in business conditions, revised load projections, the
availability and cost of capital, changes in environmental regulations, and
alternatives such as leasing.

Other Capital Requirements

In addition to the funds required for the Company's construction program,
approximately $135 million will be required by the end of 2003 for present
sinking fund requirements and maturities of long-term debt. The Company plans to
continue, when economically feasible, to retire higher cost debt and preferred
stock and replace these obligations with lower-cost capital if market conditions
permit.

Environmental Matters

On November 3, 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), brought a civil
action in the U.S. District Court against Alabama Power Company, Georgia Power
Company and the system service company. The complaint alleges violations of the
prevention of significant deterioration and new source review provisions of the
Clean Air Act with respect to five coal-fired generating facilities in Alabama
and Georgia. The civil action requests penalties and injunctive relief,
including an order requiring the installation of the best available control
technology at the affected units. The EPA concurrently issued to the integrated
Southeast utilities a notice of violation related to 10 generating facilities,
which includes the five facilities mentioned previously, and the Company's
plants Watson and Greene County. In early 2000, the EPA filed a motion to amend
its complaint to add the violations alleged in its notice of violation, and to
add Gulf Power, Savannah Electric, and the Company as defendants. The complaint
and notice of violation are similar to those brought against and issued to
several other electric utilities. These complaints and notices of violation
allege that the utilities had failed to secure necessary permits or install
additional pollution equipment when performing maintenance and construction at
coal burning plants constructed or under construction prior to 1978. On August
1, 2000, the U.S. District Court granted Alabama Power's motion to dismiss for
lack of jurisdiction in Georgia and granted the system service company's motion
to dismiss on the grounds that it neither owned nor operated the generating
units involved in the proceedings. On January 12, 2001, the EPA re-filed its
claims against Alabama Power in federal district court in Birmingham, Alabama.
The EPA did not include SCS in the new complaint. The Company believes that it
complied with applicable laws and the EPA's regulations and interpretations in
effect at the time the work in question took place. The Clean Air Act authorizes
civil penalties of up to $27,500 per day per violation at each generating unit.
Prior to January 30, 1997, the penalty was $25,000 per day. An adverse outcome
of this matter could require substantial capital expenditures that cannot be
determined at this time and possibly require payment of substantial penalties.
This could affect future results of operations, cash flows and possibly
financial condition unless such costs can be recovered through regulated rates.

    In November 1990, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (Clean Air Act) were
signed into law. Title IV of the Clean Air Act -- the acid rain compliance
provision of the law -- significantly affected Southern Company. Specific
reductions in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from fossil-fired
generating plants were required in two phases. Phase I compliance began in 1995.
As a result of a systemwide compliance strategy, some 50 generating units of
Southern Company were brought into compliance with Phase I requirements.

    Southern Company achieved Phase I sulfur dioxide compliance at the affected
plants by switching to low-sulfur coal, which required some equipment upgrades.
Construction expenditures for Phase I nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide
emissions compliance totaled approximately $300 million for Southern Company,
including approximately $65 million for the Company.



                                       II-148


MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  (continued)
Mississippi Power Company 2000 Annual Report



    Phase II sulfur dioxide compliance was required in 2000. Southern Company
used emission allowances and fuel switching to comply with Phase II
requirements. Also, equipment to control nitrogen oxide emissions was installed
on additional system fossil-fired units as necessary to meet Phase II limits and
ozone non-attainment requirements for metropolitan Atlanta through 2000.
Compliance for Phase II and initial ozone non-attainment requirements increased
the Company's total construction expenditures through 2000 by approximately $100
million. Phase II compliance did not have a material impact on the Company.

    The Company's ECO Plan is designed to allow recovery of costs of compliance
with the Clean Air Act, as well as other environmental statutes and regulations.
The MPSC reviews environmental projects and the Company's environmental policy
through the ECO Plan. Under the ECO Plan, any increase in the annual revenue
requirement is limited to 2 percent of retail revenues. The Company's management
believes that the ECO Plan provides for recovery of the Clean Air Act costs. See
Note 3 to the financial statements under "Environmental Compliance Overview
Plan" for additional information.

    A significant portion of costs related to the acid rain and ozone
non-attainment provisions of the Clean Air Act is expected to be recovered
through existing ratemaking provisions. However, there can be no assurance that
all Clean Air Act costs will be recovered.

    In July 1997, the EPA revised the national ambient air quality standards for
ozone and fine particulate matter. This revision made the standards
significantly more stringent. In the subsequent litigation of these standards,
the U.S. Supreme Court recently dismissed certain challenges but found the EPA's
implementation program for the new ozone standard unlawful and remanded it to
the EPA. In addition, the Federal District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals
will address other legal challenges to these standards in mid-2001. A decision
is expected in the spring of 2001. If the standards are eventually upheld,
implementation could be required by 2007 to 2010.

    In September 1998, the EPA issued the final regional nitrogen oxide
reduction rules to the states for implementation. Compliance is required by May
31, 2004. The final rules affect 21 states that at present do not include
Mississippi. The EPA is presently evaluating whether or not to bring an
additional 15 states including Mississippi, under this regional nitrogen oxide
rule.

    In December 2000, the EPA completed its utility study for mercury and other
hazardous air pollutants (HAPS) and issued a determination that an emission
control program for mercury and, perhaps, other HAPS is warranted. The program
is to be developed over the next four years under the Maximum Achievable Control
Technology (MACT) provisions of the Clean Air Act. This determination is being
challenged in the courts. In January 2001, the EPA proposed guidance for the
determination of Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) emission controls
under the Regional Haze Regulations. Installation of BART controls would likely
be required around 2010. Litigation of the BART rules is probable in the near
future.

    Implementation of the final state rules for these initiatives could require
substantial further reductions in nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, mercury, and
other HAPS emissions from fossil-fired generating facilities and other
industries in these states. Additional compliance costs and capital expenditures
resulting from the implementation of these rules and standards cannot be
determined until the results of legal challenges are known, and the states have
adopted their final rules. Reviews by the new administration in Washington, D.C.
add to the uncertainties associated with BART guidance and the MACT
determination for mercury and other HAPS.

    The EPA and state environmental regulatory agencies are reviewing and
evaluating various matters including: emission control strategies for ozone
non-attainment areas; additional controls for hazardous air pollutant emissions;
and hazardous waste disposal requirements. The impact of any new standards will
depend on the development and implementation of applicable regulations.

    The Company must comply with other environmental laws and regulations that
cover the handling and disposal of hazardous waste. Under these various laws and
regulations, the Company could incur costs to clean up properties currently or
previously owned. Upon identifying potential sites, the Company conducts
studies, when possible, to determine the extent of any required cleanup costs.

                                       II-149



MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  (continued)
Mississippi Power Company 2000 Annual Report



Should remediation be determined to be probable, reasonable estimates of costs
to clean up such sites are developed and recognized in the financial statements.

    Several major pieces of environmental legislation are being considered for
reauthorization or amendment by Congress. These include: the Clean Air Act; the
Clean Water Act; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and
Liability Act; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; and the Endangered
Species Act. Changes to these laws could affect many areas of the Company's
operations. The full impact of any such changes cannot be determined at this
time.

    Compliance with possible additional legislation related to global climate
change, electromagnetic fields, and other environmental and health concerns
could significantly affect the Company. The impact of new legislation -- if any
- -- will depend on the subsequent development and implementation of applicable
regulations. In addition, the potential exists for lawsuits alleging damages
caused by electromagnetic fields or other environmental concerns. The likelihood
or outcome of such potential lawsuits cannot be determined at this time.

Sources of Capital

To meet short-term cash needs and contingencies, the Company had at December 31,
2000 approximately $7.5 million of cash and cash equivalents and approximately
$117 million of unused committed credit agreements. The Company had $56 million
of short-term notes payable outstanding at year-end 2000.

    It is anticipated that the funds required for construction and other
purposes, including compliance with environmental regulations, will be derived
from sources similar to those used in the past. These sources were primarily the
issuance of first mortgage bonds and preferred securities, in addition to
pollution control revenue bonds issued for the Company's benefit by public
authorities. The Company also issued unsecured debt in 1998.

    The Company has no restrictions on the amounts of unsecured indebtedness it
may incur. However, the Company is required to meet certain coverage
requirements specified in its mortgage indenture and corporate charter to issue
new first mortgage bonds and preferred stock. The Company's coverage ratios are
high enough to permit, at present interest rate levels, any foreseeable security
sales. The amount of securities which the Company will be permitted to issue in
the future will depend upon market conditions and other factors prevailing at
that time.

Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking
Information

This Annual Report includes forward-looking statements in addition to historical
information. Forward-looking information includes, among other things,
statements concerning projected sales growth and scheduled completion of new
generation. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by
terminology such as "may," "will," "should," "expects," "plans," "anticipates,"
"believes," "estimates," "predicts," "potential," or "continue" or the negative
of these terms or other comparable terminology. The Company cautions that there
are various important factors that could cause actual results to differ
materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements; accordingly,
there can be no assurance that such indicated results will be realized. These
factors include the impact of recent and future federal and state regulatory
change, including legislative and regulatory initiatives regarding deregulation
and restructuring of the electric utility industry and also changes in
environmental and other laws and regulations to which the Company is subject, as
well as changes in application of existing laws and regulations; current and
future litigation, including the pending EPA civil action against the Company;
the extent and timing of the entry of additional competition in the markets of
the Company; potential business strategies, including acquisitions or
dispositions of assets or businesses, which cannot be assured to be completed or
beneficial; internal restructuring or other restructuring options, that may be
pursued by the Company; state and federal rate regulation in the United States;
political, legal and economic conditions and developments in the United States;
financial market conditions and the results of financing efforts; the impact of
fluctuations in commodity prices, interest rates and customer demand; weather
and other natural phenomena; the ability of the Company to obtain additional
generating capacity at competitive prices; and other factors discussed elsewhere
herein and in other reports (including Form 10-K) filed from time to time by the
Company with the SEC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Mississippi Power Company 2000 Annual Report


1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
    POLICIES

General

Mississippi Power Company is a wholly owned subsidiary of Southern Company,
which is the parent company of five integrated Southeast utilities, a system
service company (SCS), Southern Communications Services (Southern LINC),
Southern Company Energy Solutions, Southern Nuclear Operating Company (Southern
Nuclear), Mirant Corporation -- formerly Southern Energy, Inc. -- and other
direct and indirect subsidiaries. The integrated Southeast utilities -- Alabama
Power Company, Georgia Power Company, Gulf Power Company, Mississippi Power
Company, and Savannah Electric and Power Company -- provide electric service in
four states. Contracts among the integrated Southeast utilities -- related to
jointly owned generating facilities, interconnecting transmission lines, and the
exchange of electric power -- are regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC) and/or the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). SCS
provides, at cost, specialized services to Southern Company and subsidiary
companies. Southern LINC provides digital wireless communications services to
the integrated Southeast utilities and also markets these services to the public
within the Southeast. Southern Company Energy Solutions develops new business
opportunities related to energy products and services. Southern Nuclear provides
services to Southern Company's nuclear power plants. Mirant acquires, develops,
builds, owns, and operates power production and delivery facilities and provides
a broad range of energy-related services to utilities and industrial companies
in selected countries around the world. Mirant businesses include independent
power projects, integrated utilities, a distribution company, and energy trading
and marketing businesses outside the southeastern United States.

    Southern Company is registered as a holding company under the Public Utility
Holding Company Act of 1935 (PUHCA). Both the Company and its subsidiaries are
subject to the regulatory provisions of the PUHCA. The Company is also subject
to regulation by the FERC and the Mississippi Public Service Commission (MPSC).
The Company follows accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States and complies with the accounting policies and practices prescribed by the
respective commissions. The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires the
use of estimates, and the actual results may differ from those estimates.

    Prior years' data presented in the financial statements have been
reclassified to conform with the current year presentation.

Related-Party Transactions

The Company has an agreement with SCS under which the following services are
rendered to the Company at cost: general and design engineering, purchasing,
accounting and statistical, finance and treasury, tax, information resources,
marketing, auditing, insurance and pension administration, human resources,
systems and procedures, and other services with respect to business and
operations and power pool operations. Costs for these services amounted to $46.2
million, $45.5 million, and $43.9 million during 2000, 1999, and 1998,
respectively.

Regulatory Assets and Liabilities

The Company is subject to the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB) Statement No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of
Regulation. Regulatory assets represent probable future revenues to the Company
associated with certain costs that are expected to be recovered from customers
through the ratemaking process. Regulatory liabilities represent probable future
reductions in revenues associated with amounts that are expected to be credited
to customers through the ratemaking process. Regulatory assets and (liabilities)
reflected in the Balance Sheets at December 31 relate to the following:

                                             2000         1999

NOTES (continued)
Mississippi Power Company 2000 Annual Report


    In the event that a portion of the Company's operations is no longer subject
to the provisions of FASB Statement No. 71, the Company would be required to
write off related regulatory assets and liabilities that are not specifically
recoverable through regulated rates. In addition, the Company would be required
to determine if any impairment to other assets exists, including plant, and
write down the assets, if impaired, to their fair value.

Revenues and Fuel Costs

The Company currently operates as a vertically integrated utility providing
electricity to retail customers within its traditional service area located
within the state of Mississippi, and to wholesale customers in the Southeast.

    Revenues are recognized as services are rendered. Unbilled revenues are
accrued at the end of each fiscal period. The Company's retail and wholesale
rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, the
energy component of purchased power costs, and certain other costs. Retail rates
also include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in costs for ad
valorem taxes and certain qualifying environmental costs. Revenues are adjusted
for differences between actual allowable amounts and the amounts included in
rates.

    The Company has a diversified base of customers. No single customer or
industry comprises 10 percent or more of revenues. For all periods presented,
uncollectible accounts continued to average less than 1 percent of revenues.

Depreciation

Depreciation of the original cost of plant in service is provided primarily by
using composite straight-line rates, which approximated 3.5 percent in 2000 and
3.3 percent in 1999 and 1998. When property subject to depreciation is retired
or otherwise disposed of in the normal course of business, its original cost --
together with the cost of removal, less salvage -- is charged to accumulated
depreciation. Minor items of property included in the original cost of the plant
are retired when the related property unit is retired. Depreciation expense
includes an amount for the expected cost of removal of facilities.

Income Taxes

The Company uses the liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes
and provides deferred income taxes for all significant income tax temporary
differences. Investment tax credits utilized are deferred and amortized to
income over the average lives of the related property.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant, and equipment is stated at original cost. Original cost
includes: materials; labor; minor items of property; appropriate administrative
and general costs; payroll-related costs such as taxes, pensions, and other
benefits; and the estimated cost of funds used during construction, if
applicable. The cost of maintenance, repairs, and replacement of minor items of
property is charged to maintenance expense except for the maintenance of coal
cars and a portion of the railway track maintenance, which are charged to fuel
stock. The cost of replacements of property -- exclusive of minor items of
property -- is capitalized.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

For purposes of the Statements of Cash Flows, temporary cash investments are
considered cash equivalents. Temporary cash investments are securities with
original maturities of 90 days or less.

Financial Instruments

The Company's financial instruments for which the carrying amount did not equal
fair value at December 31 were as follows:

                                       Carrying          Fair
                                         Amount         Value
                                   ---------------------------
                                          (in millions)
Long-term debt:
At December 31, 2000                      $371          $362
At December 31, 1999                      $353          $334
Capital trust preferred
  securities:
At December 31, 2000                       $35           $34
At December 31, 1999                       $35           $30
- --------------------------------------------------------------

    The fair values for long-term debt and preferred securities were based on
either closing market price or closing price of comparable instruments.

NOTES (continued)
Mississippi Power Company 2000 Annual Report


Materials and Supplies

Generally, materials and supplies include the cost of transmission,
distribution, and generating plant materials. Materials are charged to inventory
when purchased and then expensed or capitalized to plant, as appropriate, when
used or installed.

Provision for Property Damage

The Company is self-insured for the cost of storm, fire, and other uninsured
casualty damage to its property, including transmission and distribution
facilities. As permitted by regulatory authorities, the Company accrues for the
cost of such damage by charging expense and crediting an accumulated provision.
The cost of repairing damage resulting from such events that individually exceed
$50 thousand is charged to the accumulated provision. In 1999, an order from the
MPSC increased the maximum Property Damage Reserve from $18 million to $23
million and allows an annual accrual of up to $4.6 million. In 2000, the Company
provided for such costs by charges to income of $3.5 million. In 1999 and 1998,
the Company provided for such costs by charges to income of $4.4 million and
$1.5 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2000, the accumulated provision
amounted to $3.5 million.

2.  RETIREMENT BENEFITS

The Company has defined benefit, trusteed, pension plans that cover
substantially all employees. The Company provides certain medical care and life
insurance benefits for retired employees. Substantially all these employees may
become eligible for such benefits when they retire. The Company funds trusts to
the extent deductible under federal income tax regulations or the extent
required by regulatory authorities. In late 2000, the Company adopted several
pension and postretirement benefits plan changes that had the effect of
increasing benefits to both current and future retirees. The effects of these
changes will be to increase annual pension and postretirement benefits costs by
approximately $1.3 and $0.4 million, respectively. The measurement date for plan
assets and obligations is September 30 for each year.

    An additional assumption used in measuring the accumulated postretirement

percent for 2000, decreasing gradually to 5.50 percent through the year 2005 and
remaining at that level thereafter. An annual increase or decrease in the

Workforce Reduction Program

In 1997, approximately one hundred employees of the Company accepted the terms
of a workforce reduction plan. The cost incurred in connection with this
voluntary plan was approximately $18 million. The MPSC approved the deferral and
amortization of these program costs over a period not to exceed 60 months
beginning no later than July 1998. As of December 31, 1999, the cost was fully
amortized.

Employee Savings Plan

The Company also sponsors a 401(k) defined contribution plan covering
substantially all employees. The Company provides a 75 percent matching
contribution up to 6 percent of an employee's base salary. Total matching
contributions made to the plan for the years 2000, 1999, and 1998 were $2.3
million, $2.2 million, and $2.1 million, respectively.

3. LITIGATION AND REGULATORY MATTERS

Environmental Litigation

On November 3, 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) brought a civil
action in the U.S. District Court against Alabama Power Company, Georgia Power
Company and SCS. The complaint alleges violations of the prevention of
significant deterioration and new source review provisions of the Clean Air Act
with respect to five coal-fired generating facilities in Alabama and Georgia.
The civil action requests penalties and injunctive relief, including an order
requiring the installation of the best available control technology at the
affected units. The Clean Air Act authorizes civil penalties of up to $27,500
per day per violation at each generating unit. Prior to January 30, 1997, the
penalty was $25,000 per day.

     The EPA concurrently issued to the integrated Southeast utilities a notice
of violation related to 10 generating facilities, which includes the five
facilities mentioned previously, and the Company's plants Watson and Greene
County. In early 2000, the EPA filed a motion to amend its complaint to add the
violations alleged in its notice of violation, and to add Gulf Power, Savannah
Electric and the Company as defendants. The complaint and notice of violation
are similar to those brought against and issued to several other electric
utilities. These complaints and notices of violation allege that the utilities
had failed to secure necessary permits or install additional pollution equipment
when performing maintenance and construction at coal burning plants constructed
or under construction prior to 1978. On August, 1, 2000, the U.S. District Court
granted Alabama Power's motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction in Georgia
and granted SCS's motion to dismiss on the grounds that it neither owned nor
operated the generating units involved in the proceedings. On January 12, 2001,
the EPA re-filed its claims against Alabama Power in federal district court in
Birmingham, Alabama. The EPA did not include SCS in the new complaint. The
Company believes that it complied with applicable laws and the EPA's regulations
and interpretations in effect at the time the work in question took place. An
adverse outcome of this matter could require substantial capital expenditures
that cannot be determined at this time and possibly require payment of
substantial penalties. This could affect future results of operations, cash
flows and possibly financial condition unless such costs can be recovered
through regulated rates.

Retail Rate Adjustment Plans

The Company's retail base rates are set under a Performance Evaluation Plan
(PEP) approved by the MPSC in 1994. PEP was designed with the objective that the
plan would reduce the impact of rate changes on the customer and provide
incentives for the Company to keep customer prices low. PEP includes a mechanism
for sharing rate adjustments based on the Company's ability to maintain low
rates for customers and on the Company's performance as measured by three

                                       II-162



NOTES (continued)
Mississippi Power Company 2000 Annual Report


indicators that emphasize price and service to the customer. PEP provides for
semiannual evaluations of the Company's performance-based return on investment.
Any change in rates is limited to 2 percent of retail revenues per evaluation
period. PEP will remain in effect until the MPSC modifies or terminates the
plan. There were no PEP retail revenue changes for 2000, 1999, or 1998.

Environmental Compliance Overview Plan

The MPSC approved the Company's Environmental Compliance Overview Plan (ECO
Plan) in 1992. The ECO Plan establishes procedures to facilitate the MPSC's
overview of the Company's environmental strategy and provides for recovery of
costs (including costs of capital) associated with environmental projects
approved by the MPSC. Under the ECO Plan, any increase in the annual revenue
requirement is limited to 2 percent of retail revenues. However, the ECO Plan
also provides for carryover of any amount over the 2 percent limit into the next
year's revenue requirement. The Company conducts studies, when possible, to
determine the extent of any required environmental remediation. Should such
remediation be determined to be probable, reasonable estimates of costs to clean
up such sites are developed and recognized in the financial statements. The
Company recovers such costs under the ECO Plan as they are incurred, as provided
for in the Company's 1995 ECO Plan Order. The Company filed its 2001 ECO Plan in
January and, if approved as filed, it will result in a slight increase in
customer prices.

Approval for New Capacity

In January 1998, the Company was granted a Certificate of Public Convenience and
Necessity by the MPSC to build approximately 1,064 megawatts of combined cycle
generation at the Company's Plant Daniel site, to be placed in service by June
2001. In December 1998, the Company requested approval to transfer the ownership
rights under the certificate to Escatawpa Funding, Limited Partnership
("Escatawpa"), which will lease the facility to the Company (see Note 4,
Financing and Commitments). In September 2000, the Company and the Mississippi
Public Utilities Staff entered, and the MPSC in October 2000 approved, a new
stipulation that modifies a January 1999 stipulation and order covering cost
allocation. The 1999 stipulation and MPSC order would have excluded the new
capacity from retail ratebase and would have assigned the Company's existing
generating facilities entirely to the retail jurisdiction. The new stipulation
and MPSC order allocates a pro-rata share of the new capacity along with the
Company's existing generating capacity to the retail jurisdiction.

4.  FINANCING AND COMMITMENTS

Construction Program

The Company is engaged in continuous construction programs, the costs of which
are currently estimated to total $62 million in 2001, $60 million in 2002, and
$69 million in 2003. The construction program is subject to periodic review and
revision, and actual construction costs may vary from the above estimates
because of numerous factors. These factors include changes in business
conditions; revised load growth estimates; changes in environmental regulations;
increasing costs of labor, equipment and materials; and cost of capital.
Significant construction will continue related to transmission and distribution
facilities, and the upgrading of generating plants.

Financing

In 1999, the Company signed an Agreement for Lease and a Lease Agreement with
Escatawpa, that calls for the Company to design and construct, as agent for
Escatawpa, a 1,064 megawatt natural gas combined cycle facility. It is
anticipated that the total project will cost approximately $400 million, and
upon project completion in mid 2001, the Company intends to lease the facility
for an initial term of approximately 10 years. It is anticipated that the annual
lease payments will approximate $32 million during the initial term.

Bank Credit Arrangements

At December 31, 2000, the Company had total committed credit agreements with
banks for approximately $117 million. At year-end 2000, the unused portion of
these committed credit agreements was approximately $117 million. These credit
agreements expire at various dates in 2001. Some of these agreements allow
short-term borrowings to be converted into term loans, payable in 12 equal
quarterly installments, with the first installment due at the end of the first
calendar quarter after the applicable termination date or at an earlier date at
the Company's option. In connection with these credit arrangements, the Company

                                       II-163



NOTES (continued)
Mississippi Power Company 2000 Annual Report


agrees to pay commitment fees based on the unused portions of the commitments or
to maintain compensating balances with the banks. At December 31, 2000, the
Company had $56 million of short-term borrowings outstanding.

Assets Subject to Lien

The Company's mortgage indenture dated as of September 1, 1941, as amended and
supplemented, which secures the first mortgage bonds issued by the Company,
constitutes a direct first lien on substantially all of the Company's fixed
property and franchises.

Lease Agreements

In 1984, the Company and Entergy Corp. (formerly Gulf States Utilities) entered
into a forty-year transmission facilities agreement whereby Entergy began paying
a use fee to the Company covering all expenses relative to ownership and
operation and maintenance of a 500 kV line, including amortization of its
original $57 million cost. For the three years ended 2000, use fees collected
under this agreement, net of related expenses, amounted to approximately $3
million each year, and are included within Other Income in the Statements of
Income.

    In 1989, the Company entered into a twenty-two year operating lease
agreement for the use of 495 aluminum railcars. In 1994, a second lease
agreement for the use of 250 additional aluminum railcars was also entered into
for twenty-two years. The Company has the option to purchase the 745 railcars at
the greater of lease termination value or fair market value, or to renew the
leases at the end of the lease term. In 1997, a third lease agreement for the
use of 360 railcars was also entered into for three years, with a monthly
renewal option for up to an additional nine months. All of these leases,
totaling 1,105 railcars, were for the transport of coal to Plant Daniel.

    Gulf Power, as joint owner of Plant Daniel, is responsible for one half of
the lease cost. The Company's share (50%) of the leases, charged to fuel stock,
was $2.1 million in 2000, $2.8 million in 1999, and $2.8 million in 1998. The
Company's annual lease payments for 2001 through 2005 will average approximately
$2.0 million and after 2005, lease payments total in aggregate approximately $14
million.

Fuel

To supply a portion of the fuel requirements of its generating plants, the
Company has entered into various long-term commitments for the procurement of
fuel. In most cases, these contracts contain provisions for price escalations,
minimum production levels, and other financial commitments.

    Total estimated obligations at December 31, 2000 were as follows:

Year                                                Fuel

 6. LONG-TERM CAPACITY SALES AND LEASE
    AGREEMENTS

The Company and the other utility affiliates of Southern Company have long-term
contractual agreements for the sale of capacity and energy to certain
non-affiliated utilities located outside the system's service area. Because the
energy is generally sold at cost under these agreements, profitability is
primarily affected by revenues from capacity sales. The Company's capacity
revenues under these agreements were not material during the periods reported.

    During 2000, the Company entered into a 10 year capacity lease that begins
in mid 2001. The minimum capacity lease revenue that the Company will receive
will average approximately $21 million per year over the 10 year period.

7.  INCOME TAXES

At December 31, 2000, the tax-related regulatory assets and liabilities were $14
million and $26 million, respectively. These assets are attributable to tax
benefits flowed through to customers in prior years and to taxes applicable to
capitalized interest. These liabilities are attributable to deferred taxes
previously recognized at rates higher than current enacted tax law and to
unamortized investment tax credits.

    Details of the federal and state income tax provisions are shown below:

    Deferred investment tax credits are amortized over the lives of the related
property with such amortization normally applied as a credit to reduce
depreciation in the Statements of Income. Credits amortized in this manner
amounted to $1.2 million in 2000, 1999, and 1998. At December 31, 2000, all
investment tax credits available to reduce federal income taxes payable had been
utilized.

8. COMPANY OBLIGATED MANDATORILY
   REDEEMABLE PREFERRED SECURITIES

In February 1997, Mississippi Power Capital Trust I (Trust I), of which the
Company owns all the common securities, issued $35 million of 7.75 percent
mandatorily redeemable preferred securities. Substantially all of the assets of
Trust I are $36 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 7.75 percent
junior subordinated notes due February 15, 2037.

    The Company considers that the mechanisms and obligations relating to the
preferred securities, taken together, constitute a full and unconditional
guarantee by the Company of the Trusts' payment obligations with respect to the
preferred securities.

    Trust I is a subsidiary of the Company, and accordingly is consolidated in
the Company's financial statements.

9.  LONG-TERM DEBT DUE WITHIN ONE YEAR

A summary of the improvement fund requirements and scheduled maturities and
redemptions of long-term debt due within one year is as follows:

 ===============================================================

    The first mortgage bond improvement fund requirement is one percent of each
outstanding series authenticated under the indenture of the Company prior to
January 1 of each year, other than first mortgage bonds issued as collateral
security for certain pollution control obligations. The requirement must be
satisfied by June 1 of each year by depositing cash or reacquiring bonds, or by
pledging additional property equal to 166-2/3 percent of such requirement.

10. COMMON STOCK DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS

The Company's first mortgage bond indenture and the corporate charter contain
various common stock dividend restrictions. At December 31, 2000, approximately
$118 million of retained earnings was restricted against the payment of cash
dividends on common stock under the most restrictive terms of the mortgage
indenture or corporate charter.

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT
Savannah Electric and Power Company 2000 Annual Report


The management of Savannah Electric and Power Company has prepared--and is
responsible for--the financial statements and related information included in
this report. These statements were prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States and necessarily include
amounts that are based on the best estimates and judgments of management.
Financial information throughout this annual report is consistent with the
financial statements.

     The Company maintains a system of internal accounting controls to provide
reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and that accounting records
reflect only authorized transactions of the Company. Limitations exist in any
system of internal controls, however, based on a recognition that the cost of
the system should not exceed its benefits. The Company believes its system of
internal accounting controls maintains an appropriate cost/benefit relationship.

     The Company's system of internal accounting controls is evaluated on an
ongoing basis by the Company's internal audit staff. The Company's independent
public accountants also consider certain elements of the internal control system
in order to determine their auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the financial statements.

     The audit committee of the board of directors, composed of five independent
directors who are not employees, provides a broad overview of management's
financial reporting and control functions. Periodically, this committee meets
with management, the internal auditors and the independent public accountants to
ensure that these groups are fulfilling their obligations and to discuss
auditing, internal controls and financial reporting matters. The internal
auditors and the independent public accountants have access to the members of
the audit committee at any time.

     Management believes that its policies and procedures provide reasonable
assurance that the Company's operations are conducted according to a high
standard of business ethics.

     In management's opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows
of Savannah Electric and Power Company in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS


To Savannah Electric and Power Company:

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets and statements of capitalization
of Savannah Electric and Power Company (a Georgia corporation and a wholly owned
subsidiary of Southern Company) as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the
related statements of income, common stockholder's equity, and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2000. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

     In our opinion, the financial statements (pages II-179 through II-193)
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Savannah Electric and Power Company as of December 31, 2000 and
1999, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2000, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND
FINANCIAL CONDITION
Savannah Electric and Power Company 2000 Annual Report


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
- --------------------

Earnings

Savannah Electric and Power Company's net income after dividends on preferred
stock for 2000 totaled $23.0 million, representing no significant change from
the prior year.

     In 1999, earnings were $23.1 million, representing a $0.6 million, or 2.4
percent decrease from the prior year. This was principally due to lower
non-operating revenues.

Revenues

Total operating revenues for 2000 were $295.7 million, reflecting a 17.5 percent
increase when compared to 1999. The following table summarizes the factors
affecting operating revenues for the past two years:

                                                 Increase (Decrease)

    -----------------------------------------------------------------

     Retail revenues increased 16.7 percent or $40.4 million in 2000 as compared
to 1999. The primary contributors to the increase were continued growth in the
Company's service territory, the positive impact of weather on energy sales, and
an increase in fuel revenues.

     Electric rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in
fuel costs, the energy component of purchased power costs, and certain other
costs. Under these fuel recovery provisions, fuel revenues generally equal fuel
expenses--including the fuel component of purchased energy--and do not affect
net income. However, cash flow is affected by the economic loss from untimely
recovery of these receivables. The Company currently plans to make a filing with
the Georgia Public Service Commission (GPSC) in early 2001 to establish a new
fuel rate in order to better reflect current fuel cost and to collect the
current under-recovered balance.

     Revenues from sales to utilities outside the service area under long-term
contracts consist of capacity and energy components. Revenues from these sales
were not material to the financial statements.

     Sales to affiliated companies within the Southern electric system vary from
year to year depending on demand and the availability and cost of generating
resources at each company. These energy sales do not have a significant impact
on earnings.

Energy Sales

Changes in revenues are influenced heavily by the amount of energy sold each
year. Kilowatt-hour (KWH) sales for 2000 and the percent change by year were as
follows:

                           KWH            Percent Change

     Total retail energy sales in 2000 reflected increases in all customer
classes. Industrial energy sales increased 12.2 percent reflecting the
re-opening of an industrial facility under new ownership. Residential and
commercial sales also increased reflecting weather related demand and customer
growth.

     In 1999, total retail energy sales were down by 2.5 percent from the prior
year reflecting reduced energy sales of 20.7 percent to industrial customers due
to the shut-down of one industrial customer's facilities in late 1998 and

completed construction of a steam turbine unit by another industrial customer.
These reductions were partially mitigated by increased energy sales of 2.6
percent and 4.2 percent to residential and commercial customers, respectively.

Expenses

Total operating expenses for 2000 were $245.0 million, an increase of $42.0
million from the prior year due primarily to increases in purchased power from
both affiliates and non-affiliates and generation fuel expense. The increase in
fuel expense is attributable to an increase in generation and higher fuel costs.
Purchased power increased due principally to higher energy costs. Other
operation expense was higher reflecting increased benefit expenses. Maintenance
expense increased from 1999 reflecting higher power delivery and power
generation maintenance costs to support improved customer reliability and unit
availability, respectively. Depreciation and amortization increased reflecting
additional depreciation charges related to the GPSC accounting order. See Note 3
to the financial statements for additional information on the GPSC's 1998
accounting order.

     In 1999, total operating expenses were $203.0 million reflecting a slight
increase of $1.4 million from the prior year. This increase was due primarily to
increases in purchased power from non-affiliates and depreciation and
amortization. Purchased power from non-affiliates increased due principally to
higher demand for energy and increased costs associated with these power
purchases. Depreciation and amortization increased reflecting additional
depreciation charges related to the GPSC's accounting order.

     Fuel and purchased power costs constitute the single largest expense for
the Company. The mix of energy supply is determined primarily by system load,
the unit cost of fuel consumed, and the availability of units.

     The amount and sources of energy supply and the total average cost of
energy supply were as follows:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------

Effects of Inflation

The Company is subject to rate regulation and income tax laws that are based on
the recovery of historical costs. Therefore, inflation creates an economic loss
because the Company is recovering its costs of investments in dollars that have
less purchasing power. While the inflation rate has been relatively low in
recent years, it continues to have an adverse effect on the Company because of
the large investment in utility plant with long economic lives. Conventional
accounting for historical cost does not recognize this economic loss nor the
partially offsetting gain that arises through financing facilities with
fixed-money obligations such as long-term debt and trust preferred securities.
Any recognition of inflation by regulatory authorities is reflected in the rate
of return allowed.

Future Earnings Potential

The results of operations for the past three years are not necessarily
indicative of future earnings potential. The level of future earnings depends on
numerous factors ranging from energy sales growth to a less regulated, more
competitive environment.

     The Company currently operates as a vertically integrated utility providing
electricity to customers within the traditional service area of southeastern
Georgia. Prices for electricity provided by the Company to retail customers are
set by the GPSC. Prices for electricity relating to jointly owned generating
facilities, interconnecting transmission lines, and the exchange of electric
power are set by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).

                                       II-173



MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Savannah Electric and Power Company 2000 Annual Report


     Future earnings in the near term will depend upon growth in energy sales,
which is subject to a number of factors. These factors include weather,
competition, new short and long-term contracts with neighboring utilities,
energy conservation practiced by customers, the elasticity of demand, and the
rate of economic growth in the Company's service area.

     Georgia Power is currently constructing two 566 megawatt combined cycle
units at Plant Wansley to begin operation in 2002. The GPSC has certified the
Company's purchase of capacity from these units to serve its retail customers
for approximately seven years.

     The electric utility industry in the United States is currently undergoing
a period of dramatic change as a result of regulatory and competitive factors.
Among the primary agents of change has been the Energy Policy Act of 1992
(Energy Act). The Energy Act allows independent power producers (IPPs) to access
the Company's transmission network in order to sell electricity to other
utilities. This enhances the incentive for IPPs to build cogeneration plants for
industrial and commercial customers and sell energy generation to other
utilities. Also, electricity sales for resale rates are affected by wholesale
transmission access and numerous potential new energy suppliers, including power
marketers and brokers. The Company is positioning the business to meet the
challenge of this major change in the traditional practice of selling
electricity.

     Although the Energy Act does not permit retail customer access, it was a
major catalyst for the current restructuring and consolidation taking place
within the utility industry. Numerous federal and state initiatives are in
varying stages to promote wholesale and retail competition. Among other things,
these initiatives allow customers to choose their electricity provider. As these
initiatives materialize, the structure of the utility industry could radically
change. Some states have approved initiatives that result in a separation of the
ownership and/or operation of generating facilities from the ownership and/or
operation of transmission and distribution facilities. While the GPSC has held
workshops to discuss retail competition and industry restructuring, there has
been no proposed or enacted legislation to date in Georgia. Enactment would
require numerous issues to be resolved, including significant ones relating to
transmission pricing and recovery of costs. The GPSC continues its assessment of
the range of potential stranded costs. The inability of the Company to recover
its investments, including the regulatory assets described in Note 1 to the
financial statements, could have a material adverse effect on the financial
condition and results of operation. The Company is attempting to minimize or
reduce its cost exposure.

     Continuing to be a low-cost producer could provide opportunities to
increase market share and profitability in markets that evolve with changing
regulation. Conversely, if the Company does not remain a low-cost producer and
provide quality service, then energy sales growth could be limited, and this
could significantly erode earnings.

     Rates to retail customers served by the Company are regulated by the GPSC.
As part of the Company's rate settlement in 1992, it was informally agreed that
the Company's earned rate of return on common equity should be 12.95 percent. In
1998, the GPSC issued a four-year accounting order settling its review of the
Company's earnings. See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional
information.

     On December 20, 1999, FERC issued its final rule on Regional Transmission
Organizations (RTOs). The order encouraged utilities owning transmission systems
to form RTOs on a voluntary basis. After participating in regional conferences
with customers and other members of the public to discuss the formation of RTOs,
utilities were required to make a filing. On October 16, 2000, Southern Company
and its integrated utility subsidiaries, including the Company, filed with FERC
a proposal for the creation of an RTO. The proposal is for the formation of a
for-profit company that would have control of the bulk power transmission system
of Southern Company and any other participating utilities. Participants would
have the option to maintain their ownership, divest, sell, or lease their assets
to the proposed RTO. If the FERC accepts the proposal as filed, the creation of
an RTO is not expected to have a material impact on Southern Company's financial
statements. The outcome of this matter cannot now be determined.

     The Energy Act amended the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935
(PUCHA) to allow holding companies to form exempt wholesale generators to sell
power largely free of regulation under PUCHA. These entities are able to own and

operate power generating facilities and sell power to affiliates--under certain
restrictions.

     Southern Company is aggressively working to maintain and expand its share
of wholesale sales in the southeastern power markets. In January 2001, Southern
Company announced formation of a new subsidiary--Southern Power Company. The new
subsidiary will own, manage, and finance wholesale generating assets in the
Southeast. Energy from its assets will be marketed to wholesale customers under
the Southern Company name.

     Compliance costs related to current and future environmental laws and
regulations could affect earnings if such costs are not fully recovered. The
Clean Air Act and other important environmental items are discussed under
"Environmental Matters."

     The Company is subject to the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB) Statement No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of
Regulation. In the event that a portion of the Company's operations is no longer
subject to these provisions, the Company would be required to write off related
regulatory assets and liabilities that are not specifically recoverable, and
determine if any other assets have been impaired. See Note 1 to the financial
statements under "Regulatory Assets and Liabilities" for additional information.

New Accounting Standard

In June 2000, FASB issued Statement No. 138, an amendment of Statement No.
133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. Statement No.
133, as amended, establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative
instruments and for hedging activities.  Statement No. 133 requires that certain
derivative instruments be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or
liability measured at fair value, and that changes in the fair value be
recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are
met.

     The Company enters into commodity related forward contracts to limit
exposure to changing prices on electricity purchases and sales.

     Substantially all of the Company's bulk energy purchases and sales meet the
definition of a derivative under Statement No. 133. In many cases, these
transactions meet the normal purchase and sale exception and the related
contracts will continue to be accounted for under the accrual method. Certain
of these instruments qualify as cash flow hedges resulting in the deferral of
related gains and losses in other comprehensive income until the hedged
transactions occur. Any ineffectiveness will be recognized currently in net
income. However, others will be required to be marked to market through current
period income.

     The Company adopted Statement No. 133 effective January 1, 2001. The impact
on net income was immaterial to the Company. The application of the new rules is
still evolving and further guidance from FASB is expected, which could further
impact the Company's financial statements. Also, as wholesale energy markets
mature, future transactions could result in more volatility in net income and
comprehensive income.

FINANCIAL CONDITION
- ------------------

Overview

The principal change in the Company's financial condition in 2000 was the
addition of $27.3 million to utility plant. The funds needed for gross property
additions are currently provided from operating activities, principally from
earnings and non-cash charges to income such as depreciation and deferred income
taxes and from financing activities. See Statements of Cash Flows for additional
information.

Exposure to Market Risks

Due to cost-based regulation, the Company has limited exposure to market
volatility in interest rate, commodity fuel prices, and prices of electricity.
To mitigate residual risks relative to movements in electricity prices, the
Company enters into fixed price contracts for the purchase and sale of
electricity through the wholesale electricity market. At December 31, 2000,
exposure from these activities was not material to the Company's financial
statements. Also, based on the Company's overall interest rate exposure at
December 31, 2000, a near-term 100 basis point change in interest rates would
not materially affect the financial statements.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Savannah Electric and Power Company 2000 Annual Report


Capital Structure

As of December 31, 2000, the Company's capital structure consisted of 52.7
percent common stockholders' equity, 12.1 percent trust preferred securities,
and 35.2 percent long-term debt, excluding amounts due within one year. The
Company's long-term financial objective for capitalization ratios is to maintain
a capital structure of common stockholders' equity at 48 percent, preferred
securities at 10 percent and debt at 42 percent.

     Maturities and retirements of long-term debt were $0.4 million in 2000,
$16.2 million in 1999, and $30.4 million in 1998.

     Included in the 1999 maturities and retirements is the purchase by the
Company of all $15 million outstanding of its 7 7/8% Series First Mortgage Bonds
due May 1, 2025.

     The composite interest rates and dividend rates for the years 1998 through
2000 as of year-end were as follows:

                                      2000       1999       1998

Capital Requirements for Construction

The Company's projected construction expenditures for the next three years total
$95.9 million ($32.5 million in 2001, $31.5 million in 2002, and $31.9 million
in 2003). Actual construction costs may vary from this estimate because of
factors such as changes in: business conditions; environmental regulations; load
projections; the cost and efficiency of construction labor, equipment and
materials; and the cost of capital. In addition, there can be no assurance that
costs related to capital expenditures will be fully recovered. Construction and
upgrading of new and existing transmission and distribution facilities and
upgrading of generating plants will be continuing.

Other Capital Requirements

In addition to the funds needed for the construction program, approximately
$51.8 million will be needed by the end of 2003 for maturities of long-term debt
and present sinking fund requirements.

Environmental Matters

On November 3, 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) brought a civil
action in the U.S. District Court against Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and the
system service company. The complaint alleges violations of the prevention of
significant deterioration and new source review provisions of the Clean Air Act
with respect to five coal-fired generating facilities in Alabama and Georgia.
The civil action requests penalties and injunctive relief, including an order
requiring the installation of the best available control technology at the
affected units. The EPA concurrently issued to Southern Company's integrated
Southeast utilities a notice of violation related to 10 generating facilities,
which includes the five facilities mentioned previously and the Company's Plant
Kraft. In early 2000, the EPA filed a motion to amend its complaint to add the
violations alleged in its notice of violation, and to add Gulf Power,
Mississippi Power, and Savannah Electric as defendants. The complaint and notice
of violation are similar to those brought against and issued to several other
electric utilities. These complaints and notices of violation allege that the
utilities had failed to secure necessary permits or install additional pollution
equipment when performing maintenance and construction at coal burning plants
constructed or under construction prior to 1978. On August 1, 2000, the U.S.
District Court granted Alabama Power's motion to dismiss for lack of
jurisdiction in Georgia and granted the system service company's motion to
dismiss on the grounds that it neither owned nor operated the generating units
involved in the proceedings. On January 12, 2001, the EPA re-filed its claims
against Alabama Power in federal district court in Birmingham, Alabama. The EPA
did not include the system service company in the new complaint. Southern
Company believes that its integrated utilities complied with applicable laws and
the EPA's regulations and interpretations in effect at the time the work in
question took place. The Clean Air Act authorizes civil penalties of up to
$27,500 per day per violation at each generating unit. Prior to January 30,
1997, the penalty was $25,000 per day. An adverse outcome of this matter could

require substantial capital expenditures that cannot be determined at this time
and possibly require payment of substantial penalties. This could affect future
results of operations, cash flows, and possibly financial condition if such
costs are not recovered through regulated rates.

     In November 1990, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (Clean Air Act) were
signed into law. Title IV of the Clean Air Act--the acid rain compliance
provision of the law--significantly affected the Company and other subsidiaries
of Southern Company. Specific reductions in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide
emissions from fossil-fired generating plants were required in two phases. Phase
I compliance began in 1995 and some 50 generating units of Southern Company were
brought into compliance with Phase I requirements.

     Southern Company achieved Phase I sulfur dioxide compliance at the affected
plants by switching to low-sulfur coal, which required some equipment upgrades.
The construction expenditures for Phase I nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide
emissions compliance totaled approximately $2 million for Savannah Electric.

     Phase II sulfur dioxide compliance was required in 2000. Southern Company
used emission allowances and fuel switching to comply with Phase II
requirements. No significant dollars for Phase II compliance have been spent by
Savannah Electric.

     A significant portion of costs related to the acid rain and ozone
non-attainment provisions of the Clean Air Act is expected to be recovered
through existing ratemaking provisions. However, there can be no assurance that
all Clean Air Act costs will be recovered.

     In July 1997,  the EPA revised the national ambient air quality standards
for ozone and particulate matter. This revision made the standards significantly
more stringent.  In the subsequent litigation of these standards,  the U.S.
Supreme Court recently dismissed certain challenges but found the EPA's
implementation program for the new ozone standard unlawful and remanded it to
the EPA. In addition, the Federal District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals
will address other legal challenges to these standards in mid-2001.  If the
standards are eventually upheld, implementation could be required by 2007 to
2010.

     In September 1998, the EPA issued the final regional nitrogen oxide
reduction rules to the states for implementation. Compliance is required by May
31, 2004. The final rule affects 21 states, including Georgia. This rule remains
involved in litigation in the federal courts.

     In December 2000, the EPA completed its utility studies for mercury and
other hazardous air pollutants (HAPS) and issued a determination that an
emission control program for mercury and, perhaps, other HAPS is warranted. The
program is to be developed over the next four years under the Maximum Achievable
Control Technology (MACT) provisions of the Clean Air Act. This determination is
being challenged in the courts. In January 2001, the EPA proposed guidance for
the determination of Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) emission controls
under the Regional Haze Regulations. Installation of BART controls is expected
to take place around 2010. Litigation of the BART rules is probable in the near
future.

     Implementation of the final state rules for these initiatives could require
substantial further reductions in nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, mercury, and
other HAPS emissions from fossil-fired generating facilities and other
industries in these states. Additional compliance costs and capital expenditures
resulting from the implementation of these rules and standards cannot be
determined until the results of legal challenges are known, and the states have
adopted their final rules. Reviews by the new administration in Washington, D.C.
add to the uncertainties associated with BART guidance and the MACT
determination for mercury and other HAPS.

     The EPA and state environmental regulatory agencies are reviewing and
evaluating various other matters including: control strategies to reduce
regional haze; limits on pollutant discharges to impaired waters; water intake
restrictions; and hazardous waste disposal requirements. The impact of any new
standards will depend on the development and implementation of applicable
regulations.

     The Company must comply with other environmental laws and regulations that
cover the handling and disposal of hazardous waste. Under these various laws and
regulations, the Company could incur substantial costs to clean up properties.


                                       II-177




MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)
Savannah Electric and Power Company 2000 Annual Report


The Company conducts studies to determine the extent of any required cleanup
costs and will recognize in the financial statements costs to clean up known
sites.

     Several major pieces of environmental legislation are being considered for
reauthorization or amendment by Congress. These include: the Clean Air Act; the
Clean Water Act; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and
Liability Act; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; the Toxic Substances
Control Act; and the Endangered Species Act. Changes to these laws could affect
many areas of the Company's operations. The full impact of any such changes
cannot be determined at this time.

     Compliance with possible additional legislation related to global climate
change, electromagnetic fields, and other environmental and health concerns
could significantly affect the Company. The impact of new legislation--if
any--will depend on the subsequent development and implementation of applicable
regulations. In addition, the potential exists for liability as the result of
lawsuits alleging damages caused by electromagnetic fields.

Sources of Capital

At December 31, 2000, the Company had $50.1 million of unused short-term and
revolving credit arrangements with banks to meet its short-term cash needs and
to provide additional interim funding for the Company's construction program.
Revolving credit arrangements total $20 million, of which $10 million expires
April 30, 2003 and $10 million expires December 31, 2003.

     It is anticipated that the funds required for construction and other
purposes, including compliance with environmental regulation, will be derived
from sources similar to those used in the past. These sources were primarily
from the issuances of first mortgage bonds, other long-term debt, and preferred
stock, in addition to pollution control revenue bonds issued for the Company's
benefit by public authorities, to meet long-term external financing
requirements. Recently, the Company's financings have consisted of unsecured
debt and trust preferred securities. The Company is required to meet certain
earnings coverage requirements specified in its mortgage indenture and corporate
charter to issue new first mortgage bonds and preferred stock. The Company's
coverage ratios are sufficiently high to permit, at present interest rate
levels, any foreseeable security sales. There are no restrictions on the amount
of unsecured indebtedness allowed. The amount of securities which the Company
will be permitted to issue in the future will depend upon market conditions and
other factors prevailing at that time.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Savannah Electric and Power Company 2000 Annual Report

1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
    POLICIES

General

Savannah Electric and Power Company (the Company) is a wholly owned subsidiary
of Southern Company, which is the parent company of five integrated Southeast
utilities, a system service company (SCS), Southern Communications Services
(Southern LINC), Southern Company Energy Solutions, Southern Nuclear Operating
Company (Southern Nuclear), Mirant Corporation--formerly Southern Energy,
Inc.--and other direct and indirect subsidiaries. The integrated Southeast
utilities provide electric service in four states. Contracts among the
integrated Southeast utilities--related to jointly owned generating facilities,
interconnecting transmission lines, and the exchange of electric power--are
regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and/or the
Securities and Exchange Commission. SCS provides, at cost, specialized services
to Southern Company and subsidiary companies. Southern LINC provides digital
wireless communications services to the integrated Southeast utilities and also

Related-Party Transactions

The Company has an agreement with SCS under which the following services are
rendered to the Company at cost: general and design engineering, purchasing,
accounting and statistical, finance and treasury, tax, information resources,
marketing, auditing, insurance and pension, human resources, systems and
procedures, and other administrative services with respect to business and
operations and power pool operations. Costs for these services amounted to $15.1
million, $16.0 million, and $15.3 million during 2000, 1999, and 1998,

Regulatory Assets and Liabilities

The Company is subject to the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB) Statement No. 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of
Regulation. Regulatory assets represent probable future revenues to the Company
associated with certain costs that are expected to be recovered from customers
through the ratemaking process. Regulatory liabilities represent probable future
reductions in revenues associated with amounts that are expected to be credited
to customers through the ratemaking process. Regulatory assets and (liabilities)
reflected in the Balance Sheets at December 31 relate to:

                                            2000          1999

===============================================================

     In the event that a portion of the Company's operations is no longer
subject to the provisions of FASB Statement No. 71, the Company would be
required to write off related regulatory assets and liabilities that are not
specifically recoverable through regulated rates. In addition, the Company would
be required to determine if any impairment to other assets exists, including
plant, and write down the assets, if impaired, to their fair value.

Revenues and Fuel Costs

The Company currently operates as a vertically integrated utility providing
electricity to retail customers within its traditional service area of
southeastern Georgia and to wholesale customers in the Southeast.

    Revenues are recognized as services are rendered. Unbilled revenues are
accrued at the end of each fiscal period. Fuel costs are expensed as the fuel is
used. Electric rates for the Company include provisions to adjust billings for
fluctuations in fuel costs, the energy component of purchased power costs, and
certain other costs. Revenues are adjusted for differences between recoverable
fuel costs and amounts actually recovered in current regulated rates.

    The Company has a diversified base of customers. No single customer or
industry comprises 10 percent or more of revenues. For all periods presented,
uncollectible accounts averaged less than 1 percent of revenues.

    In 2000, the GPSC approved an increase of slightly over one-third of a cent
per kilowatt hour in the Company's fuel cost recovery rate. An increase of
slightly over three-tenths of a cent per kilowatt-hour was approved in 1999.

    The Company currently plans to make a filing with the GPSC in early 2001 to
establish a new fuel rate in order to better reflect current fuel costs and to
collect the current under-recovered balance.

Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation of the original cost of plant in service is provided primarily by
using composite straight-line rates, which approximated 3.0 percent in 2000 and
1999, and 2.9 percent in 1998. When property subject to depreciation is retired
or otherwise disposed of in the normal course of business, its cost--together
with the cost of removal, less salvage--is charged to the accumulated provision
for depreciation. Minor items of property included in the original cost of the
plant are retired when the related property unit is retired. Depreciation
expense includes an amount for the expected cost of removal of certain
facilities. In 1998, 1999 and 2000, the Company recorded accelerated
depreciation of $1.0 million, $2.0 million and $2.5 million respectively, in
accordance with the GPSC's 1998 rate order. See Note 3 to the financial
statements for more information.

Income Taxes

The Company, which is included in the consolidated federal income tax return
filed by Southern Company, uses the liability method of accounting for deferred
income taxes and provides deferred income taxes for all significant income tax
temporary differences. Investment tax credits utilized are deferred and
amortized to income over the average lives of the related property.

Allowance for Funds Used During Construction
  (AFUDC)

AFUDC represents the estimated debt and equity costs of capital funds that are
necessary to finance the construction of new facilities. While cash is not
realized currently from such allowance, it increases the revenue requirement
over the service life of the plant through a higher rate base and higher
depreciation expense. The composite rates used by the Company to calculate AFUDC
were 6.87 percent in 2000, 6.26 percent in 1999 and 8.00 percent in 1998.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment is stated at original cost less regulatory
disallowances and impairments. Original cost includes: materials; labor; minor
items of property; appropriate administrative and general costs; payroll-related
costs such as taxes, pensions, and other benefits, and the estimated cost of
funds used during construction. The cost of maintenance, repairs, and
replacement of minor items of property is charged to maintenance expense. The
cost of replacements of property exclusive of minor items of property is
capitalized.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

For purposes of the financial statements, temporary cash investments are
considered cash equivalents. Temporary cash investments are securities with
original maturities of 90 days or less.

Materials and Supplies

Generally, materials and supplies include the costs of transmission,
distribution, and generating plant materials. Materials are charged to inventory

    At December 31, 1999                  $40              $31

     The fair values for long-term debt and trust preferred securities were
based on either closing market prices or closing prices of comparable
instruments.


2.  RETIREMENT BENEFITS

The Company has defined benefit, trusteed, non-contributory pension plans that
cover substantially all employees. The Company provides certain medical care and
life insurance benefits for retired employees. Substantially all these employees
may become eligible for such benefits when they retire. The Company funds trusts
to the extent required by the GPSC. The measurement date for plan assets and
obligations is September 30 of each year.

     In late 2000, the Company adopted several pension and postretirement
benefit plan changes that had the effect of increasing benefits to both current
and future retirees. The effects of these changes will be to increase annual
pension and postretirement benefits costs by approximately $0.5 million and $0.3
million, respectively.

percent for 2000, decreasing gradually to 5.50 percent through the year 2005,
and remaining at that level thereafter. An annual increase or decrease in the
assumed medical care cost trend rate of 1 percent would affect the accumulated
benefit obligation and the service and interest cost components at December 31,
2000 as follows:

     The Company has a supplemental retirement plan for certain executive
employees. The plan is unfunded and payable from the general funds of the
Company. The Company has purchased life insurance on participating executives,
and plans to use these policies to satisfy this obligation.

Employee Savings Plan

The Company also sponsors a 401(k) defined contribution plan covering
substantially all employees. The Company provides a 75 percent matching
contribution up to 6 percent of an employee's base salary. Total matching
contributions made to the plan for the years 2000, 1999, and 1998 were $0.9
million, $0.9 million, and $0.8 million, respectively.

3.   CONTINGENCIES AND REGULATORY
     MATTERS

Environmental Litigation

On November 3, 1999, the EPA brought a civil action in the U.S. District Court
against Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and the system service company. The
complaint alleges violations of the prevention of significant deterioration and
new source review provisions of the Clean Air Act with respect to five
coal-fired generating facilities in Alabama and Georgia. The civil action
requests penalties and injunctive relief, including an order requiring the
installation of the best available control technology at the affected units. The
Clean Air Act authorizes civil penalties of up to $27,500 per day, per violation
at each generating unit. Prior to January 30, 1997, the penalty was $25,000 per
day.

   The EPA concurrently issued to the integrated Southeast utilities a notice of
violation related to 10 generating facilities, which includes the five
facilities mentioned previously and the Company's Plant Kraft. In early 2000,
the EPA filed a motion to amend its complaint to add the violations alleged in
its notice of violation, and to add Gulf Power, Mississippi Power, and Savannah
Electric as defendants. The complaint and notice of violation are similar to
those brought against and issued to several other electric utilities. These
complaints and notices of violation allege that the utilities had failed to
secure necessary permits or install additional pollution equipment when
performing maintenance and construction at coal burning plants constructed or
under construction prior to 1978. On August 1, 2000, the U.S. District Court
granted Alabama Power's motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction in Georgia
and granted the system service company's motion to dismiss on the grounds that
it neither owned nor operated the generating units involved in the proceedings.
On January 12, 2001, the EPA re-filed its claims against Alabama Power in
federal district court in Birmingham, Alabama. The EPA did not include the
system service company in the new complaint. Southern Company believes that its
integrated utilities complied with applicable laws and the EPA's regulations and
interpretations in effect at the time the work in question took place.

     An adverse outcome of this matter could require substantial capital
expenditures that cannot be determined at this time and possibly require payment
of substantial penalties. This could affect future results of operations, cash
flows, and possibly financial condition if such costs are not recovered through
regulated rates.

Retail Regulatory Matters

Rates to retail customers served by the Company are regulated by the GPSC. As
part of the Company's rate settlement in 1992, it was informally agreed that the
Company's earned rate of return on common equity should be 12.95 percent.

     In 1998, the GPSC approved a four-year accounting order for the Company.
Under this order, the Company will reduce the electric rates of its small
business customers by approximately $11 million over four years. The Company
will also expense an additional $1.95 million in storm damage accruals and
accrue an additional $8 million in depreciation on generating assets over the
term of the order. The additional depreciation will be accumulated in a
regulatory liability account to be available to mitigate any potential stranded
costs. In addition, the Company has discretionary authority to provide up to an

additional $0.3 million per year in storm damage accruals and up to an
additional $4.0 million in depreciation expense over the four years. Total storm
damages accrued under the order were $1.5 million in both 2000 and 1999 and
$0.75 million in 1998. No discretionary depreciation was recorded in the last
three years. Over the term of the order, the Company is precluded from asking
for a rate increase except upon significant changes in economic conditions, new
laws, or regulations. There is a quarterly monitoring of the Company's earnings
performance.

4.   COMMITMENTS

Construction Program

The Company is engaged in a continuous construction program, currently estimated
to total $32.5 million in 2001, $31.5 million in 2002, and $31.9 million in
2003. The construction program is subject to periodic review and revision, and
actual construction costs may vary from the above estimates because of numerous
factors. These factors include: changes in business conditions; revised load
growth estimates; changes in environmental regulations; increasing costs of
labor, equipment, and materials; and changes in cost of capital. The Company
does not have any traditional baseload generating plants under construction.
However, construction related to new and upgrading of existing transmission and
distribution facilities and the upgrading of generating plants will continue.

     To the extent possible, the Company's construction program is expected to
be financed from internal sources and from the issuance of additional long-term
debt and capital contributions from Southern Company.

     The amounts of long-term debt and trust preferred securities that can be
issued in the future will be contingent on market conditions, the maintenance of
adequate earnings levels, regulatory authorizations, and other factors.

Bank Credit Arrangements

At the end of 2000, unused credit arrangements with four banks totaled $50.1
million and expire at various times during 2001.

     The Company has revolving credit arrangements of $20 million, of which $10
million expires April 30, 2003 and $10 million expires December 31, 2003. One of
these agreements allows short-term borrowings to be converted into term loans,
payable in 12 equal quarterly installments, with the first installment due at
the end of the first calendar quarter after the applicable termination date or
at an earlier date at the Company's option.

     In connection with these credit arrangements, the Company agrees to pay
commitment fees based on the unused portions of the commitments.

Assets Subject to Lien

As amended and supplemented, the Company's Indenture of Mortgage, which secures
the first mortgage bonds issued by the Company, constitutes a direct first lien
on substantially all of the Company's fixed property and franchises. A second
lien for $10 million of bank debt is secured by a portion of the Plant Kraft
property and a second lien for $34 million in bank notes is secured by a portion
of the Plant McIntosh property.

Fuel and Purchased Power Commitments

To supply a portion of the fuel requirements of its generating plants, the
Company has entered into long-term commitments for the procurement of fuel. In
most cases, these contracts contain provisions for price escalations, minimum
purchase levels, and other financial commitments. The Company has fuel
commitments of $44 million and $8 million for 2001 and 2002, respectively.

     The company has entered into various long-term commitments for the purchase
of electricity. Estimated total long-term obligations at December 31, 2000 were
as follows:

5.   INCOME TAXES

At December 31, 2000, tax-related regulatory assets and liabilities were $12.4
million and $16.0 million, respectively. The assets are attributable to tax
benefits flowed through to customers in prior years and to taxes applicable to
capitalized interest. The liabilities are attributable to deferred taxes
previously recognized at rates higher than current enacted tax law and to
unamortized investment tax credits.

     Details of income tax provisions are as follows:

     Deferred investment tax credits are amortized over the lives of the related
property with such amortization normally applied as a credit to reduce
depreciation in the Statements of Income. Credits amortized in this manner
amounted to $ 0.7 million in 2000, 1999 and 1998. At December 31, 2000, all
investment tax credits available to reduce federal income taxes payable had been
utilized.

6.   TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES

In December 1998, Savannah Electric Capital Trust I, of which the Company owns
all of the common securities, issued $40 million of 6.85% mandatorily redeemable
preferred securities. Substantially all of the assets of the Trust are $40
million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 6.85% junior subordinated
notes due December 31, 2028.

     The Company considers that the mechanisms and obligations relating to the
trust preferred securities, taken together, constitute a full and unconditional
guarantee by the Company of payment obligations with respect to the preferred
securities of Savannah Electric Capital Trust I.

     Savannah Electric Capital Trust I is a subsidiary of the Company, and
accordingly is consolidated in the Company's financial statements.

7.   LONG-TERM DEBT AND LONG-TERM DEBT
     DUE WITHIN ONE YEAR

The Company's Indenture related to its First Mortgage Bonds is unlimited as to
the authorized amount of bonds which may be issued, provided that required
property additions, earnings and other provisions of such Indenture are met.

     Maturities and retirements of long-term debt were $0.4 million in 2000,
$16.2 million in 1999 and $30.4 million in 1998. Included in the 1999 maturities
and retirements is the purchase by the Company of all $15 million outstanding of
its 7 7/8% Series First Mortgage Bonds due May 1, 2025.

     Assets acquired under capital leases are recorded as utility plant in
service, and the related obligation is classified as other long-term debt.
Leases are capitalized at the net present value of the future lease payments.
However, for ratemaking purposes, these obligations are treated as operating
leases, and as such, lease payments are charged to expense as incurred.

     A summary of the sinking fund requirements and scheduled maturities and
redemptions of long-term debt due within one year at December 31 is as follows:

                                                  2000        1999

===================================================================

     The first mortgage bond improvement (sinking) fund requirements amount to 1
percent of each outstanding series of bonds authenticated under the Indenture
prior to January 1 of each year, other than those issued to collateralize
pollution control and other obligations. The requirements may be satisfied by
depositing cash or reacquiring bonds, or by pledging additional property equal
to 1 2/3 times the requirements.

     The sinking fund requirements of first mortgage bonds were satisfied by
certifying property additions in 2000 and by cash redemptions in 1999. It is
anticipated that the 2001 requirement will be satisfied by certifying property
additions. Sinking fund requirements and/or maturities through 2005 applicable
to long-term debt are as follows: $30.7 million in 2001; $0.6 million in 2002;
$20.5 million in 2003; $0.5 million in 2004; and $0.4 million in 2005.

8.   COMMON STOCK DIVIDEND
     RESTRICTIONS

The Company's Indenture contains certain limitations on the payment of cash
dividends on common stock. At December 31, 2000, approximately $68 million of
retained earnings was restricted against the payment of cash dividends on common
stock under the terms of the Indenture.

2 Payouts made in 1999
and 2000 for the four-year performance periods ending December 31, 1998 and

                           STOCK OPTION GRANTS IN 2000

Stock Option Grants. The following table sets forth all stock option grants to
the named executive officers of SAVANNAH during the year ending December 31,
2000.


6 Performance Stock Plan grants were made on February 18, 2000, and vest
annually at a rate of one-third on the anniversary date of the grant. Grants
fully vest upon termination as a result of death, total disability, or
retirement and expire five years after retirement, three years after death or
total disability, or their normal expiration date if earlier. The exercise
price is the average of the high and low fair market value of SOUTHERN's common
stock on the date granted. Options may be transferred to family members,
family trusts, and family limited partnerships.
7 A total of 6,977,038 stock options were granted in 2000.
8 Value was calculated using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. The
actual value, if any, ultimately realized depends on the market value of
SOUTHERN's common stock at a future date. Significant assumptions are shown
below:


                                     III-4




      AGGREGATED STOCK OPTION EXERCISES IN 2000 AND YEAR-END OPTION VALUES

Aggregated Stock Option Exercises. The following table sets forth information
concerning options exercised during the year ending December 31, 2000 by the

                  DEFINED BENEFIT OR ACTUARIAL PLAN DISCLOSURE

Pension Plan Table. The following table sets forth the estimated annual pension
benefits payable at normal retirement age under SOUTHERN's qualified Pension
Plan, as well as non-qualified supplemental benefits, based on the stated
compensation and years of service with the SOUTHERN system for Messrs. Holland,
James and Jeffers. Compensation for pension purposes is limited to the average
of the highest three of the final 10 years' compensation -- base salary plus the
excess of annual and long-term incentive compensation over 25 percent of base
salary (reported under column titled "Salary", "Bonus", and "Long-Term Incentive
Payouts" in the Summary Compensation Table on page III-3).

         The amounts shown in the table were calculated according to the final
average pay formula and are based on a single life annuity without reduction for
joint and survivor annuities (although married employees are required to have
their pension benefits paid in one of various joint and survivor annuity forms,
unless the employee elects otherwise with the spouse's consent) or computation
of the Social Security offset which would apply in most cases. This offset
amounts to one-half of the estimated Social Security benefit (primary insurance
amount) in excess of $3,900 per year times the number of years of accredited
service, divided by the total possible years of accredited service to normal
retirement age.


         As of December 31, 2000, the applicable compensation levels and years
of accredited service for SAVANNAH's named executives are presented in the
following table:

                                        Compensation            Accredited
            Name                           Level             Years of Service

            G. Edison Holland, Jr.9      $431,348                     17
            Anthony R. James              246,604                     21
            W. Miles Greer10              237,392                     16
            Kirby R. Willis               225,952                     26
            Lewis A. Jeffers              197,400                     21


9 The number of accredited years of service includes 9 years and 3 months
credited to Mr. Holland pursuant to a supplemental pension agreement.

10 The number of accredited years of service includes 7 years and 6 months
credited to Mr. Greer pursuant to a supplemental pension agreement.

                                     III-6





         Effective January 1, 1998, SAVANNAH merged its pension plan into the
SOUTHERN Pension Plan. SAVANNAH also has in effect a supplemental executive
retirement plan for certain of its executive employees. The plan is designed to
provide participants with a supplemental retirement benefit, which, in
conjunction with social security and benefits under SOUTHERN's qualified pension
plan, will equal 70 percent of the highest three of the final 10 years' average
annual earnings (excluding incentive compensation).

         The following table sets forth the estimated combined annual pension
benefits under SOUTHERN's pension and SAVANNAH's supplemental executive
retirement plans in effect during 2000 which are payable to Messrs Greer and
Willis, upon retirement at the normal retirement age after designated periods of
accredited service and at a specified compensation level.

Compensation of Directors.

         Standard Arrangements. The following table presents compensation paid
to the directors during 2000 for service as a member of the board of directors
and any board committee(s), except that employee directors received no fees or
compensation for service as a member of the board of directors or any board
committee. At the election of the director, all or a portion of the cash
retainer may be payable in SOUTHERN's common stock, and all or a portion of the
total fees may be deferred under the Deferred Compensation Plan until membership
on the board is terminated.

Cash Retainer Fee          $10,000
Stock Retainer Fee         50 shares per quarter

Meeting Fees:
$750 for each Board or Committee meeting attended

         Effective January 1, 1997, the Outside Directors Pension Plan (the
"Plan") was terminated and benefits payable under the Plan were frozen.
Non-employee directors serving as of January 1, 1997 were given a one-time
election to receive a Plan benefit buy-out equal to the actuarial present value
of future Plan benefits or receive benefits under the terms of the Plan at the
annual retainer rate in effect on December 31, 1996. Directors who elected to
receive the benefit buy-out were required to defer receipt of that amount under
the Deferred Compensation Plan until termination from board membership.
Directors who elected to continue to participate under the terms of the Plan are
entitled to benefits upon retirement from the board on the retirement date
designated in the respective companies' by-laws. The annual benefit payable is
based upon length of service and varies from 75 percent of the annual retainer
in effect on December 31, 1996 if the participant has at least 60 months of
service on the board of one or more system companies, to 100 percent if the
participant has at least 120 months of such service. Payments will continue for
the greater of the lifetime of the participant or 10 years.

                                     III-7



         Other Arrangements. No director received other compensation for
services as a director during the year ending December 31, 2000 in addition to
or in lieu of that specified by the standard arrangements specified above.

Employment Contracts and Termination of Employment and Change in Control
Arrangements.
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

SAVANNAH has adopted SOUTHERN's Change in Control Plan which is applicable to
certain of its officers, and has entered into individual change in control
agreements with its most highly compensated executive officers. If an executive
is involuntarily terminated, other than for cause, within two years following a
change in control of SOUTHERN the agreements provide for:

o lump sum payment of two or three times annual compensation,
o up to five years' coverage under group health and life insurance plans,
o immediate vesting of all stock options, stock appreciation rights, and
    restricted stock previously granted,
o payment of any accrued long-term and short-term bonuses and dividend
    equivalents, and
o payment of any excise tax liability incurred as a
    result of payments made under any individual agreements.

A SOUTHERN change in control is defined under the agreements as:

o  acquisition of at least 20 percent of the SOUTHERN's stock,
o  a change in the majority of the members of the SOUTHERN's board of
    directors,
o  a merger or other business combination that results in SOUTHERN's
   shareholders immediately before the merger owning less than 65 percent of
   the voting power after the merger, or
o  a sale of substantially all the assets of SOUTHERN.

A change in control of SAVANNAH is defined under the agreements as:

o acquisition of at least 50 percent of SAVANNAH's stock,
o a merger or other business combination unless SOUTHERN controls the
   surviving entity or
o a sale of substantially all the assets of SAVANNAH.

     If a change in control affects only a subsidiary of SOUTHERN, these
payments would only be made to executives of the affected subsidiary who are
involuntarily terminated as a result of that change in control.

     SOUTHERN also has amended its short- and long-term incentive plans to
provide for pro-rata payments at not less than target-level performance if a
change in control occurs and the plans are not continued or replaced with
comparable plans.

Report on Repricing of Options.

         None.
